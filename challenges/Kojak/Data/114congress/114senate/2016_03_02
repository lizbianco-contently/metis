Mr. President, the current Senate Democratic leader \nonce stated that ``nowhere in [the Constitution] does it say the Senate \nhas a duty to give presidential nominees a vote.'' The incoming Senate \nDemocratic leader, the one we will have next year, did not even wait \nuntil the final year of the last President's term to declare that the \nSenate should ``not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in \nextraordinary circumstances.'' And we all know what Vice President \nBiden said when he chaired the Judiciary Committee. Here is what he \nsaid: ``It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political \nseason is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination \nmust be put off until after the election campaign is over.''\n  That is the essence of the Biden rule. Yesterday, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and I personally reiterated to President Obama that \nwe will observe the Biden rule.\n  The American people deserve to be heard on this matter. That is the \nfairest and most reasonable approach today. Voters have already begun \nto choose the next President, who in turn will nominate the next \nSupreme Court Justice. It is an important decision.\n  Justice Scalia himself reminded us that setting aside one's personal \nviews is ``one of the primary qualifications for a judge.'' His aim was \nto follow the Constitution wherever it took him, even if he disagreed \npolitically with the outcome. We saw that when he sided with the \nconstitutional right of protestors to burn the American flag. ``If \nyou're going to be a good and faithful judge,'' he said, ``you have to \nresign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the \nconclusions you reach.''\n  I think Americans agree that judges should be fair, impartial \narbiters who apply the law and the Constitution equally to all and as \nactually written, not as they wish it were. I think most Americans \nagree a judge should be committed to an evenhanded interpretation of \nthe law and the Constitution so that everyone who walks into a \ncourtroom knows he or she will have a fair shake.\n  But there is another view of the role of a judge. Under the view \npromoted by the current President, the so-called ``empathy standard,'' \njudges prioritize their political ideology above the law. The problem \nwith that approach to judging is that empathy is only good in the \ncourtroom if you are lucky enough to be the person the judge actually \nhas empathy for. It is not so good if you are the other guy.\n  This is something the American people should decide. President Obama \nstill has every right to nominate someone on his way out the door. The \nSenate also has every right to withhold its consent. That is what the \nBiden rule reminds us of this election year. We will appropriately \nrevisit the matter after Americans elect their new President.\n  Now, this is not the only issue we discussed down at the White House \nyesterday. We also had a constructive discussion about other \nlegislative issues, such as the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic \nsweeping our country and the important bill we will continue to \nconsider today to help address it.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, is bipartisan \nlegislation that targets this crisis at every level. The bill has a \nhost of supporters, including 42 bipartisan cosponsors and more than \n130 groups dedicated to combating the epidemic.\n  And while this is an important authorization bill, I would also note \nthat Congress has already appropriated $400 million to opioid-specific \nprograms. All $400 million of those funds still remain available to be \nspent today. That is right. These funds are still available, and we \nwill have more opportunities to address funding through the \nappropriations process later this spring.\n  Michael Botticelli, the Obama administration's Director of National \nDrug Control Policy, testified at a hearing just a few months ago and \nthanked Congress for including funding in the fiscal 2016 spending \nbill, saying: ``We appreciate that Congress provided more than $400 \nmillion in funding in\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nthe fiscal 2016 appropriations act, specifically to address the opioid \nepidemic, an increase of more than $100 million from the previous \nyear.''\n  Botticelli went on to say there is ``clear evidence that a \ncomprehensive response,'' such as that of CARA, is ``tremendously \nimportant.'' He said that the provisions in CARA are ``critically \nimportant to make headway in terms of this epidemic.''\n  Let's not allow this issue to get tangled up in politics. It is \nreally too important to each of our States. Let's do our part today to \nhelp those in recovery take their lives back. Let's help keep families \ntogether and kids safer and help prevent more Americans from suffering \nat the hands of addiction.\n  Let's put politics aside and continue to work to pass the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which would be an important \nstep forward in the fight against our national opioid and heroin \ncrisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1170-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Paul).

There \nare times, when we are away from the cameras, that we get along well \nand have a good time.\n  There is no better example of that than this morning. Every week at 8 \no'clock in the morning on Wednesday we meet downstairs for the Senate \nPrayer Breakfast. I go there as often as I can. It is really very \nstimulating, and I am always glad I go every time I do go. But today \nwas especially good because Al Franken, the junior Senator from \nMinnesota, was making the presentation. Even though there is an opening \nprayer and a closing prayer, there is some talk in between that, and \nhis presentation was terrific. And of course we all know Al Franken, \nand so a lot of it was funny.\n  But I just want everyone watching us this morning to know we are not \nalways--I used the word--dour. There are times when we smile and have a \ngood time.\n  Everyone knows the Presiding Officer and I have total disagreement on \npolicy, but I so admire the Presiding Officer. Without reservation, I \ncan say we are friends--not just political friends, but we are friends. \nA year ago, when I was injured, because he is an ophthalmologist, he \nreached out to me and gave me his advice and mostly his concern, for \nwhich I am grateful.\n  I think if we stopped and looked around at each other, we would find \nmany such relationships such as the one with the Presiding Officer and \nthe senior Senator from Nevada, and I appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1170-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we now have a new rule called the Biden \nrule, which I guess was invented this morning. What happens when my \nfriend the Republican leader, as he did yesterday, talks about what \nSenator Biden has said is that he never completes the little \npresentation Senator Biden made. Senator Biden did not say there \nwouldn't be any nominations. Here is what he said in ending his \npresentation. At the end of his speech in 1992, Senator Biden said:\n\n       Compromise is the responsible course both for the White \n     House and for the Senate. If the President consults and \n     cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent \n     consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support as did \n     Justices Kennedy and Souter.\n\n  That is what this is all about. Senator Biden never said there \nwouldn't be any nominations approved, and that was evident in the oval \noffice yesterday. Vice President Biden told the story of a Republican \nPresident calling him down--he was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee--and said: OK, we are having some problems here. I have 10 \nnames on a piece of paper. I want you to look at it and give me your \nrough estimate. I will not bind you to this, but which of these do you \nthink would work?\n  These were people that a Republican President presented to the \nDemocratic chair of the Judiciary Committee saying: Give me your \nimpression of these people. So they went over them--yes, yes, yes, no. \nThey had 10 names.\n  That is the same thing that happened yesterday in the White House. \nPresident Obama said: Do you have any names for me? Give them to me. I \nwill be happy to take a look at them.\n  So there is no Biden rule, unless the Biden rule is that we will \ncontinue doing what we have always done here in the Senate. And what is \nthat? We approve in any Presidential election year--in a Presidential \nelection year we always take care of a nomination. We have never in the \nhistory of the country not done that, until now.\n  Now, the other thing is we keep talking about a lot of political \nthings, but we have an obligation based on the Constitution of the \nUnited States to do something about these nominations we get from the \nPresident. We have a constitutional duty to do our jobs, and that duty \nis to give advice and consent to the President when he sends a \nnomination up here, which we will have in a matter of a week or so.\n  And we do it quickly. We don't spend months and months doing this. \nThe Republicans' unprecedented call to block any nominee is more of the \nobstruction that we have had here too often. This has never ever been \ndone before.\n  As for my friend the Republican leader to talk about statements I \nmade and the senior Senator from New York made, of course we made \nstatements. It didn't affect what we did around here. I hoped people \nlistened. I hoped it slowed down what President Bush was going to do. \nBut the fact is President Bush did what he wanted, and he, in the \nprocess, was able to present nominations to us and we looked them over.\n  Now we have a new standard. We are not going to meet with whomever \nthis person is. We don't know who it is, but we are not going to meet \nwith him. We are not going to hold hearings, and we are not going to \nvote. That is wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1170-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1170-S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            REPUBLICAN PARTY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, here is a headline of an article that \nappeared in the Washington Post: ``Trump is the GOP's Frankenstein \nmonster.'' This was the headline in the Washington Post article \nauthored by Robert Kagan, a former official in the Reagan State \nDepartment who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute.\n\n  It is true, Donald Trump is the Republican Party's Frankenstein \nmonster. Republicans have spent the last 8 years stoking the fires of \nresentment and hatred, building Trump piece by piece. Today the \nRepublican establishment acts like it is surprised by Donald Trump's \nvictories around the country. They feign outrage that a demagogue \nspewing vile xenophobia is somehow winning in a party which spent years \ntelling immigrants they are not welcome in America. They act surprised \nthat Republican voters are flocking to a birther candidate, even as \nRepublican congressional leaders continue to support a man who refuses \nto distance himself from the Ku Klux Klan.\n  They express shock and outrage that Republican voters cheer Trump's \nschoolyard taunts, even as they trounce the most common courtesies \nextended to every President, even as they deny a fair hearing to a \nPresident's Supreme Court nominee for the first time ever--the first \ntime--in history. Republicans shouldn't be surprised. They spent 8 \nyears laying the groundwork for the rise of Donald Trump.\n  The reality is that Republican leaders are reaping what they have \nsown. As Mr. Kagan said in his Washington Post opinion piece yesterday, \n``The party's own political crimes are being punished in a bit of \ncosmic justice fit for a Greek tragedy.''\n  Seven years ago the Republican leader and his party decided that \nPresident Obama was an illegitimate President. They decided his \nPresidency was unworthy of their basic respect and good-faith efforts. \nCongressional Republicans decided that whatever policies this President \nproposed, they would reflexively oppose them--regardless of the merits. \nInstead, congressional Republicans had only one objective--to keep \nPresident Obama from being reelected.\n  In order to do that, the Republican leader and his party refused to \nengage the President or Democrats on policy. No matter how dire the \ncrisis for the\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nAmerican people, Republican leaders decided it was more important to \ndeny President Obama an achievement than help people in need. Think \nabout that. No matter how dire the crisis for the American people, \nRepublican leaders decided--I repeat--it was more important to deny \nPresident Obama an achievement than to help people in need.\n  Think about the monumental legislation Republicans refused to even \nengage in, let alone work on:\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, known as the stimulus, \nwhen our economy was in a nosedive--in a nosedive. Remember, when Obama \nwas elected, that month he was elected the country lost 800,000 jobs in \n1 month. We were in the throes of the great recession, and yet it took \nan effort to get a mere three Republicans to work with us on that \nlegislation. Very important. They were strong, they were courageous--\nSpecter, Collins, and Snowe. Republican leadership made it clear they \ndidn't want their Senators working with President Obama on the \nstimulus, but we got it done.\n  Health care. Before ObamaCare, there were nearly 50 million Americans \nwith no health insurance. Since then, almost 20 million more Americans \nhave health coverage. Today, if you have a preexisting disability, you \nare covered with insurance. Today the rate of no insurance is below 10 \npercent. This is all in spite of congressional Republicans who would \nnot work with Democrats despite our best efforts. They refused to do \nanything to engage in any way. When the debate over health care \nstarted, three Republicans--Senators Snowe, Grassley, and Enzi, very \nimportant Members of the Finance Committee--acted interested in fixing \nour Nation's health care system, but Republican leadership twisted \ntheir arms to convince them--whatever words we want to use--to get them \nin line with the Republican leader's wishes and abandoned any hope of \nbipartisanship on the issue. So there was none. Senator Snowe brought \nup a bill in the Finance Committee, but the Republican leadership \nturned it into a ``no'' vote on the Senator floor, and the senior \nSenator from Iowa went back to Iowa and started talking about death \npanels. Doesn't that sound like something Donald Trump would do?\n  Wall Street and Dodd-Frank legislation, when Wall Street crashed. I \ncan remember being in the White House with the Republican Secretary of \nthe Treasury, a wonderful man. Secretary Paulson was on his knees \nbegging Nancy Pelosi to work with him. The country was in deep trouble. \nDemocrats controlled the body. We had a Republican President, and we \nworked with a Republican President.\n  In the shadow of economic ruin created by Wall Street's unhinged \ngreed, Republicans would not work with us to rein in the big banks and \nfinancial institutions. They had been warned by Republican leadership. \nIn the end, only one Republican voted for that bill--only one.\n  Time and time again, congressional Republicans went to the extreme to \nblock any positive legislation to improve our Nation. The tactics \nRepublicans used to obstruct this President were unprecedented. In \neffect, the Republican leader told the President that none of his \npolicies would get a fair hearing from Republicans, and that is \nbasically true. Republicans denied the Office of the President the \nrespect it deserves, and their shoddy and disrespectful treatment \nbecame the norm.\n  In 6 years, the Republican leader launched more than 500 filibusters. \nDuring the same 6-year period, Lyndon Johnson, in 6 years, had overcome \n2 filibusters--500 to 2. This is far more than anyone ever imagined \ncould happen in this great body.\n  Actions speak louder than words. Automatically filibustering the \nPresident's policies for years on end sends a clear and simple message: \nRepublicans think this President's proposals are illegitimate. Instead \nof working for the American people, Republicans decided that making the \nextreme rightwing happy was more important. Republicans blocked \nlegislation to prevent criminals and suspected terrorists from buying \nguns, even background checks. Republicans blocked commonsense campaign \nfinance reform. We had 59 votes to allow some disclosure of all these \nhuge amounts of money; not a single Republican voted with us--not a \nsingle Republican. Republicans voted to deport DREAMers. Republicans \nblocked an increase in the minimum wage. Republicans blocked equal pay \nfor women. Republicans blocked efforts to do something about student \nloan debt. Now Republicans are blocking the nominee of the Supreme \nCourt before that person has even been nominated. This is just a short \nlist of what they have blocked.\n  From this rhetoric to their actions, the Republicans have set the \nTrump standards. The Republican Party has long used Islam to \nfearmonger. Now Donald Trump is doing the same thing. The Republican \nParty has spent years railing against Latinos and immigrants, trying to \nincite fear and panic. Congressman Steve King called immigrants drug \ndealers and described their bodies in a very negative, ugly way. Now \nDonald Trump is saying the same thing. Donald Trump is the ultimate \nfulfillment of the Republicans' legacy of obstruction and resentment, \nbut to be frank, it is not only Trump. Senator Cruz, Senator Rubio, and \nBen Carson are saying basically the same thing--maybe a little more \nsubtle, but they are saying the same thing. After all, this is the same \nparty--the Republican Party--that just yesterday saw nine of its \nMembers vote against naming a post office after world-famous poet and \ncivil rights activist Maya Angelou. It is hard to believe.\n  Even as the establishment condemns what Donald Trump says and does, \nthe Republican leadership is still supporting him. The Speaker of the \nHouse yesterday affirmed that he will vote for Donald Trump if he is \nthe Republican nominee for President. The Senate Republican leader has \nnot said he will not vote for Donald Trump if he is the nominee. \nPublicly, at least, Republicans are supporting a man who refused to \ndenounce the KKK--a man who continues to denigrate immigrants, Muslims, \nand the disabled.\n  Donald Trump is the standard bearer for the Republican Party. \nRepublicans created him by spending 7 years appealing to some of the \ndarkest forces in America. It is up to Republicans to try and undo what \nthey have done by denouncing Donald Trump. It is time for Republicans \nto stop the Frankenstein they created. Trump is the GOP's Frankenstein \nmonster. If Republicans fail to stop Donald Trump, it will tear the \nparty apart even more than it is now.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1171-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In 2014, an average of \n     more than 120 people in the United States died from drug \n     overdoses every day.\n       (2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n     (commonly known as ``NIDA''), the number of prescriptions for \n     opioids increased from approximately 76,000,000 in 1991 to \n     nearly 207,000,000 in 2013, and the United States is the \n     biggest consumer of opioids globally, accounting for almost \n     100 percent of the world total for hydrocodone and 81 percent \n     for oxycodone.\n       (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or \n     abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as \n     ``CPDs'') and are involved in most CPD-related overdose \n     incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network \n     (commonly known as ``DAWN''), the estimated number of \n     emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of \n     prescription opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent \n     between 2006 and 2010, from 84,671 to 179,787.\n       (4) The use of heroin in the United States has also spiked \n     sharply in recent years. According to the most recent \n     National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 900,000 \n     people in the United States reported using heroin in 2014, \n     nearly a 35 percent increase from the previous year. Heroin \n     overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014.\n       (5) The supply of cheap heroin available in the United \n     States has increased dramatically as well, largely due to the \n     activity of Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The Drug \n     Enforcement Administration (commonly known as the ``DEA'') \n     estimates that heroin seizures at the Mexican border have \n     more than doubled since 2010, and heroin production in Mexico \n     increased 62 percent from 2013 to 2014. While only 8 percent \n     of State and local law enforcement officials across the \n     United States identified heroin as the greatest drug threat \n     in their area in 2008, that number rose to 38 percent in \n     2015.\n       (6) Law enforcement officials and treatment experts \n     throughout the country report that many prescription opioid \n     users have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more easily \n     obtained alternative to prescription drugs.\n       (7) According to a report by the National Association of \n     State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to \n     as ``NASADAD''), 37 States reported an increase in admissions \n     to treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while \n     admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased \n     500 percent from 2000 to 2012.\n       (8) Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, \n     including abuse of prescription painkillers and, \n     increasingly, heroin, requires a multi-pronged approach that \n     involves prevention, education, monitoring, law enforcement \n     initiatives, reducing drug diversion and the supply of \n     illicit drugs, expanding delivery of existing treatments \n     (including medication assisted treatments), expanding access \n     to overdose medications and interventions, and the \n     development of new medications for pain that can augment the \n     existing treatment arsenal.\n       (9) Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. \n     Discoveries in the science of addiction have led to advances \n     in the treatment of substance use disorders that help people \n     stop abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume \n     their productive lives.\n       (10) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and \n     Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States \n     needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only \n     2,500,000 people received it. Furthermore, current treatment \n     services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a \n     report commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration (commonly known as ``SAMHSA''), there \n     are approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 individuals \n     needing substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the \n     ratio is much lower.\n       (11) The overall cost of drug abuse, from health care- and \n     criminal justice-related costs to lost productivity, is \n     steep, totaling more than $700,000,000,000 a year, according \n     to NIDA. Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major \n     economic dividends.\n       (12) According to NIDA, when schools and communities \n     properly implement science-validated substance abuse \n     prevention programs, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit \n     drugs is reduced. Such programs help teachers, parents, and \n     healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of youths \n     about the risks of drug abuse.\n       (13) Diverting certain individuals with substance use \n     disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based \n     treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable \n     numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the \n     course of those individuals' lives.\n       (14) According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of expired, \n     unwanted prescription medications have been collected since \n     the enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act \n     of 2010 (Public Law 111-273; 124 Stat. 2858).\n       (15) Faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models can provide \n     a critical path to successful recovery for a great number of \n     people in the United States. The 2015 membership survey \n     conducted by Alcoholics Anonymous (commonly known as ``AA'') \n     found that 73 percent of AA members were sober longer than 1 \n     year and attended 2.5 meetings per week.\n       (16) Research shows that combining treatment medications \n     with behavioral therapy is an effective way to facilitate \n     success for some patients. Treatment approaches must be \n     tailored to address the drug abuse patterns and drug-related \n     medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. \n     Different types of medications may be useful at different \n     stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using \n     drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse. Patients have a \n     range of options regarding their path to recovery and many \n     have also successfully addressed drug abuse through the use \n     of faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models.\n       (17) Individuals with mental illness, especially severe \n     mental illness, are at considerably higher risk for substance \n     abuse than the general population, and the presence of a \n     mental illness complicates recovery from substance abuse.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nmore of the troubling news that has come out on how the health care law \nhas affected the people of this country. A new poll just came out from \nNational Public Radio as well as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \nThis is what they found: According to the poll, 26 percent of Americans \nare telling us that the health care law--ObamaCare--has directly hurt \nthem. Twenty-six percent of Americans say that ObamaCare, the health \ncare law, has directly hurt them. Only 14 percent of the people in the \npoll said that their personal health care has gotten better under \nObamaCare. So it is just one in seven who say it is better; over one-\nquarter say they have personally been hurt. So almost twice as many \npeople have been directly hurt by the law compared to the people who \nhave been helped.\n  American taxpayers are also being hurt by ObamaCare because of the \nwaste and the fraud in the health care system. There is a new report \njust out from the Government Accountability Office. It came out last \nweek. It found that the Obama administration is still failing to stop \nthe fraud in health care subsidies.\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\n  Here is how the law was designed to work: People must have \ngovernment-approved insurance because of the law. It is a mandate. \nThere are a lot of people who have been forced to buy very expensive \ninsurance to comply with the law, and in many cases it is far more \ncoverage than they want, that they need, or that they can afford. So \nthe health care law, which the Democrats voted for and the Republicans \nvoted against, said that the government will give subsidies to people \nto help them pay for this Washington-mandated, expensive insurance.\n  To get the subsidy, people are supposed to be able to prove they are \neligible for the subsidy. There are various criteria to make sure \npeople are eligible. That means things like proving they make a certain \nincome or how many people are in their family or that they are citizens \nof the United States or that they are here legally.\n  Washington then pays the subsidy directly to the insurance company. \nThen later, the government comes around and tries to figure out if the \nperson even qualified for the money, so there is a huge potential for \nfraud and for wasting taxpayer dollars.\n  This new report from the Government Accountability Office found that, \ndespite the billions of dollars at stake, the Obama administration has \ntaken what they describe as a ``passive approach'' to identifying and \npreventing the fraud. The Obama administration has taken a ``passive \napproach.'' It says the Obama administration has struggled--struggled \nto confirm the eligibility of millions of people who applied for \nsubsidies. This is a report from the Government Accountability Office. \nWe want accountability in government.\n  The report found that there are 431,000 people who still had \nunresolved issues with the subsidy paperwork more than a year after \nthey first applied. The cases amount to over $1.7 billion in taxpayer \nsubsidies. Now, the insurance coverage that these people had for that \nyear has already ended. The Obama administration still did not know if \nthey should have gotten the money that was sent out to the insurance \ncompanies on their behalf.\n  There are another 22,000 cases where it still is not clear if the \nperson who got the subsidy was serving time in prison. How can \nWashington not even know if someone is in prison? This should be one of \nthe easiest things to find out. But there are millions of cases where \nthe administration is taking this passive approach to figuring out if \nthere is fraud occurring with these subsidies.\n  People all around the country are asking: Where is the accountability \nfrom the Obama administration? They are spending billions of taxpayer \ndollars. Where is the accountability to make sure that it is being \nspent properly and not wasted? There is no accountability because the \nObama administration does not seem to care about protecting taxpayer \nmoney. It cares more about getting a large number of people enrolled in \ninsurance. That is what they want, no matter what the law says, no \nmatter how much money they waste to do it.\n  This report from the Government Accountability Office came out last \nWednesday. The very next day, there was more bad news for taxpayers \nbecause of the health care law. There was an article in the Wall Street \nJournal on Thursday, February 25, under the headline ``Insurance Fight \nEscalates.'' It goes on to say: ``Health co-op leaders say the effort \nto recoup Federal loans will come up short.''\n  This is taxpayer money. Remember, the health care law gave out \nbillions of dollars--billions of dollars in loans to set up these \nhealth insurance co-ops across the country. They set up 23. Already, \nmore than half of them have collapsed and have gone out of business, 12 \nout of 23 have gone bust, and 700,000 Americans lost their insurance \nbecause these co-ops failed.\n  Now it looks as if hard-working taxpayers are going to lose the money \nthat the government loaned to these failed insurance businesses. \nAccording to this Wall Street Journal article, leaders of the co-ops \nsay that taxpayers are going to lose more than $1 billion in the failed \nco-ops. They say it is because most of the money has already been \nspent.\n  The article quotes the head of the co-op in New Mexico as saying: \n``Will there be any money left?''\n  ``Yeah, maybe.'' That is what he said. That is his answer: ``Yeah, \nmaybe.'' Maybe there will be a little money left out of more than $1 \nbillion in taxpayer loans. It is outrageous. It was not supposed to be \na bailout of the insurance company. These were supposed to be loans.\n  Is that how the administration thinks loans are supposed to work? \nDoes the Obama administration think that if they lend out money and \npeople borrow it from the taxpayers and spend it, then they don't have \nto pay it? Where is the accountability from these co-ops for the \nAmerican people? Where is the accountability for the Obama \nadministration to make sure that they loan this money responsibly and \ndon't waste it? Reports like this paint a very bad picture of health \ncare and the health care law in this country.\n  We talked about these 23 co-ops and half of them have failed. This \nwas headlined yesterday: ``Losses deepen for remaining ObamaCare co-\nops.''\n\n       Losses snowballed in the fourth quarter at four co-op \n     health plans [that have now reported their numbers for 2015].\n\n  The article says:\n\n       The nonprofit startups based in Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio \n     and Maine lost about $270 million last year. . . . That's \n     more than five times the level of losses those plans recorded \n     in 2014.\n\n  That was the first year they operated. They are still waiting for the \nupdated financial reports on the other seven remaining co-ops that have \nnot yet posted their returns.\n  Here we are. Six years ago, there was a debate in Congress about the \nAmericans' health care system. Everyone in this body agreed we had a \nproblem. Everybody agreed we needed to do something to help Americans. \nRepublicans presented our ideas on the floor of the Senate. We went to \nmeetings at the White House. We offered President Obama solutions. \nDemocrats and the President rejected our ideas, and they came up with \ntheir own massive plan.\n  Washington took on too much power over the health care decisions of \nAmerican families. More Washington control, less Washington \naccountability--they are never the right answers for our country. If \nWashington can't protect taxpayer dollars, it shouldn't be collecting \nso many of these dollars in the first place.\n  Republicans warned that ObamaCare would be bad for patients, bad for \nproviders, and terrible for the taxpayers. The news keeps coming out, \nshowing that we were exactly right. Republicans are going to continue \nto talk about our health care ideas and will continue to talk about \nideas that will actually hold Washington accountable as Washington \nspends taxpayers' dollars. We will continue to talk about ideas such as \ngiving families more control over their health care and their health \ncare decisions and giving Washington less control. That is what \nAmericans want.\n  This new report out from the National Public Radio poll showed 26 \npercent of Americans say that the health care law, ObamaCare, has \ndirectly hurt them. They didn't want this kind of health care reform \nthat directly hurts them, instead of helping them; they wanted to be \nhelped. They don't want an approach like we have; they want an approach \nthat gives them control and, certainly, not a passive approach to \npreventing fraud. The American people do not want ObamaCare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3345 to Amendment No. 3378\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment No. 3345, \nwhich is my supplemental amendment to address the heroin and opioid \nepidemic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mrs. Shaheen] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3345 to amendment No. 3378.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am not going to speak to this \namendment right now because I hope to do it later. I spent a fair \namount of time yesterday talking about the need to provide the \nresources to address the heroin and opioid epidemic, but I am very \npleased to see my colleague from Maine on the floor to speak to it. He \nhas been a cosponsor of the legislation and a huge advocate for \naddressing the challenge that Maine--like New Hampshire and so many \nother States--is facing from the heroin and opioid epidemic. I look \nforward to his remarks and to the opportunity for us to vote on this \namendment later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, this week, this body is talking about one of \nthe most serious problems facing our country. The word ``epidemic'' \nreally isn't strong enough to represent what we are seeing in terms of \ndrug addiction--opioids and heroin, in particular. The bipartisan \nsupport for the bill that is on the floor this week is an indication of \nthe belief of Members of both parties, of all parties of all parts of \nthe country, that this is a critically important question.\n  We have heard the appalling figures in committees and caucuses and on \nthe floor. In the State of Maine, there are 200 deaths a year from \noverdoses. This is an eightfold increase in the last 3 years. The \nfigure that got my attention most dramatically was that a year ago in \nMaine, we had 12,000 babies born, and of that number over 950 were \naddicted to a substance. That is almost 1 in 12 babies born in my \nState.\n  Nationally, the figures are just as shocking and as bad. In my \nneighboring State of New Hampshire, the number of overdose deaths is \nnow over 380 a year. It is more than one a day. Nationally, there are \n47,000 overdose deaths--more deaths than are caused by automobiles.\n  If this were Ebola or ISIS or any other kind of national crisis, we \nwould be in 24-hour session to find a solution. We would be doing \neverything the equivalent of the Manhattan Project to deal with \nsomething that is killing so many of our citizens, particularly our \nyoung people.\n  Like any other problem that gets to this body, this is complicated. \nThere isn't any single solution. It involves law enforcement. It \ninvolves national security--stopping drugs at the border. It involves \ntreatment of mental illness. It involves treatment of drug addiction \nand figuring out what works. It involves figuring out prevention. It \ninvolves dealing with the overwhelming number of opioid prescription \ndrugs that we now know lead to heroin and other addictions.\n  It is a very complex problem. There is no single answer, but there \nare some things we do know about this problem:\n  The first thing we know is that law enforcement alone isn't enough. \nEssentially, we have tried that for 25 years. Law enforcement alone \nisn't enough. It is important. It is a critical part of our defense \nagainst the scourge, but it is not the entire answer.\n  The second thing we know is that this epidemic is directly related to \nthe dramatic rise of prescription painkillers based upon opioids. The \ndata is that four out of five new heroin users started with \nprescription drugs. This is something we need to discuss. We need to \ndiscuss it with the medical community. We need to discuss it with the \neducational community, and we need to understand that when these drugs \nare prescribed, there are risks--serious, undeniable, dangerous risks \nthat are taking an enormous toll on our society.\n  Four out of five new heroin users started with prescription drugs. I \nmet a young man in Maine who was in treatment, who was trying to \nrecover, who had become an addict. He got there starting with a high \nschool sports injury, and he was prescribed opioid treatment--opioid \npills--and he ended up in the drug culture that was destroying his \nlife.\n  That is the second thing we know. We know that law enforcement isn't \nenough. We know that a big part of our focus has to be on opioids and \nprescription drugs.\n  The third thing we know is, there are some treatments that appear to \nwork. We don't know for sure. One of the things that I think we need to \ndo in this body is to provide for the research and the data sharing and \nthe data collection from around the country so we can find out what \nworks. It appears that medication and counseling together are something \nthat works, but we need more research and more data.\n  The fourth thing we know is that treatment resources are grossly \ninadequate. This epidemic has exploded in the last few years, but the \nresources in terms of treatment have, in some cases, actually \ndiminished. There are fewer beds today than there were 3 years ago \nbecause of budget cuts, because of policy changes, and we end up\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\nwith young people and people generally that have this terrible problem \neating up their lives with no place to go.\n  The greatest tragedy is when we have someone who is suffering from \naddiction and wants treatment and is ready to take the step and say ``I \nneed it,'' and there is no place to go. The estimates are that among \nteenagers who are caught in this trap, only 20 percent have treatment \navailable to them.\n  All these numbers and statistics and policy prescriptions aren't \nreally my subject today. I don't want to talk about politics or even \npolicy. I want to talk about people. In particular, I want to talk \nabout this little boy. This picture is of a young man from Maine named \nGarrett Brown. There was an extraordinary story about Garrett in the \nBangor Daily News late last week. A reporter, Erin Rhoda, an editor at \nthe Bangor Daily News--one of our great newspapers--got to know this \nyoung man named Garrett Brown and spent a lot of time interacting with \nhim over the last 3 years and recounted it in this extraordinary piece \nof journalism. It is the story of this young man's attempts to survive \nand what happened in his life.\n  This isn't politics. It isn't policy. It is people. In reading this \nstory as I sat in my darkened office late last week--as my staff went \nhome, they thought there was something wrong with me. The lights were \ndimmed, the sun was setting, and I read this story. It was like reading \nthe story of the Titanic or of the Lincoln assassination. You knew how \nit was going to come out, but you hoped it wouldn't happen. You kept \nseeing moments when it could have been avoided; the tragic end could \nhave been avoided, but it didn't happen. That was what was so gripping \nto me about this story. It was so real, and it was so close to home.\n  I have four boys of my own. I venture to say that every family in \nAmerica that has a son has a picture like it or just like it somewhere \nin their family scrapbooks or stored on their telephone or in their \ncomputer. This is a wonderful Maine kid--a smiling 8-year-old, happy, \nand ready to go to school with his backpack. Then, about 15 years \nlater, he is with his mom, and he is on his way out. He had a mom who \nloved him, but he had a system that failed him.\n  He took responsibility, by the way. He said: It's not that my mom or \nmy stepdad didn't care. They tried. My grandparents tried everything \nthey could. They were devout Christians. There was nothing they would \nhave done to change it.\n  He took responsibility. But when he took responsibility, we didn't \nprovide the means for him to effectuate that and save his own life. He \nhad to want to beat it, but he also had to have the means, the \nresources to take that step.\n  The Bangor Daily News quite accurately laid out the issue: ``Opioid \naddiction like Garrett's requires treatment.'' We have this idea in our \nsociety that it is just a choice. You make the choice; you don't have \nto take that pill. Well, the way these drugs work on your brain, they \nhijack the very parts of your brain that enable you to make that \ndecision. They actually go to the parts of the brain that deal with \nexecutive function, decisionmaking, and fear, and derail those parts of \nthe brain. It requires treatment. I am sure that occasionally there are \npeople who can do this by themselves, but that is very rare. Most \npeople require treatment, and odds are that those with an addiction to \ndrugs or alcohol won't get any treatment at all. As I mentioned, only \none out of five teenagers who needs treatment has it available to them. \nIf they do go through treatment, they are likely to get the wrong \ntreatment. There is a world of different theories on treatments \noptions, and that is why I say we need to have the research so we can \nunderstand what works and put our resources into the things that will \nactually bring results. Often it means they die, and that is what \nhappened to young Garrett.\n\n  Between 2010 and 2014, the number of overdose deaths in Maine \ninvolving heroin overdose increased eightfold. This is Maine. This \ncould have been any State in the country. It seems to be striking rural \nStates now as strongly or even worse than urban areas of the country.\n  I didn't know Garrett Brown, but he was a brave kid. I could tell by \nhis conversations with Erin Rhoda and by his conversations with us. He \nknew he was talking to us. He knew this was going to be public. He knew \nhe was communicating with us, and here is what he said:\n\n       If this changes one kid's life, saves one kid from being in \n     jail, saves his family the pain of seeing him go through it--\n\n  This is a guy with an addiction saying this. It is extraordinary.\n  He continued:\n\n       If this . . . saves one kid from overdosing and dying, then \n     all that I've done hasn't been in vain. I guess that's why I \n     keep doing this with you?\n\n  This is a tragedy. It is not a tragedy of numbers. It is a tragedy of \nreal people. It is a tragedy of young lives lost, of treasures \nsquandered, and of hearts broken. I have never in my adult life seen a \nproblem like this that is facing my State and every State in this \ncountry. We can't solve it all at once. There is no magic wand. But if \nwe find young people like Garrett who are ready to take a step toward a \ncure--if not a cure, at least have an ongoing recovery--we need to meet \nthem halfway. We need to meet them halfway through the support of \ntreatment, the support of creating options that are available, by \nunderstanding the relationship between addiction and the criminal \njustice system, and ultimately by loving our neighbors as ourselves.\n  People sometimes ask me: What is so special about Maine? I tell them \nMaine is a small town with very long streets. We know each other, care \nabout each other, think about each other, and we try to help each \nother. I think this country can also be a community--should be a \ncommunity where we think about and care about each other.\n  Young lives lost, treasures squandered, and hearts broken. I hope we \ncan start to change that tragic trajectory that is breaking so many \nhearts in this country this week so we can make a difference, not for \nGarrett but for the young people to whom he was desperately sending \nthis message. We can, we should, and we shall.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Commemorating Texas Independence Day\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important day \nin the history of my State of Texas, a day that inspires pride and \ngratitude in the hearts of all Texans. I rise to commemorate Texas \nIndependence Day.\n  In a moment, I wish to read a letter that was written 180 years ago \nfrom behind the walls of an old Spanish mission called the Alamo--a \nletter written by a 26-year-old lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army, \nWilliam Barret Travis--and in doing so, I carry on a tradition that was \nstarted by the late Senator John Tower, who represented Texas and this \nbody for more than two decades. This tradition was upheld by his \nsuccessor, Senator Phil Gramm, and then by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \nafter him. So it is an honor today to carry on this great tradition.\n  On February 24, 1836, with his position under siege and outnumbered \nnearly 10-to-1 by the forces of the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de \nSanta Ana, Travis penned the following letter:\n\n       To the people of Texas and all Americans in the world:\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots, I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Ana. I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man.\n       The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion. \n     Otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword if the \n     fort is taken.\n       I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag \n     still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender \n     or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of \n     patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to \n     come to our aid, with all dispatch.\n       The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no \n     doubt increase to 3,000 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days. If this call \n     is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country. Victory or death.\n\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\n\n  Signed:\n\n       William Barret Travis.\n\n  Of course, we know in the battle that ensued, all 189 defenders of \nthe Alamo lost their lives, but they did not die in vain. The Battle of \nthe Alamo bought precious time for the Texas revolutionaries allowing \nGeneral Sam Houston to maneuver his army into position for a decisive \nvictory at the Battle of San Jacinto.\n  With this victory, Texas became a sovereign nation, and so today we \ncelebrate the adoption of the Texas Declaration of Independence on \nMarch 2, 1836. For 9 years, the Republic of Texas thrived as a separate \nnation. In 1845, it was annexed to the United States as the 28th State. \nMany Texan patriots who fought in the revolution went on to serve in \nthe U.S. Congress, and I am honored to hold the seat of one of them, \nSam Houston. More broadly, I am honored to have the opportunity to \nserve 27 million Texans, thanks to the sacrifices made by these brave \nmen 180 years ago.\n\n\nReturn from Space of Commander Scott Kelly and Manifest For Human Space \n                               Flight Act\n\n  Mr. President, on a separate matter, one thing William Barret Travis \nand the other early settlers of Texas had in common was a thirst for \nadventure and a hunger for the great next frontier. It is an attitude \nof optimistic perseverance that has become a trademark of Texans for \ngenerations. So I think it is fitting today that we also celebrate a \nman who has devoted his life to expanding our footprint in space.\n  Last night Scott Kelly returned to Earth after almost a year in \nspace--one of the longest lasting space flights of all time. By \ntomorrow Scott should be back in Houston, home to the Johnson Space \nCenter.\n  In June I was able to tour the Johnson Space Center and meet some of \nthe men and women who made Scott Kelly's mission possible. They make \ntheir work look easy. They literally have a hand in sending someone to \nspace, ensuring their safety, and executing multiple projects all at \nthe same time. Yet for them it is all in a day's work. They are doing \nan outstanding job, not only for Houston but for Texas and the United \nStates. As you might expect, Texans view the space center with a \nparticular pride. The world has turned to it as a leader in space \nexploration and research for more than 50 years. As one of NASA's \nlargest research centers, it continues to keep the United States in the \nforefront of innovation and research related to science, technology, \nengineering, and medicine as well.\n  Importantly, the Johnson Space Center also leads our commercial space \npartnerships--a growing sector in my State--and helps design and test \nthe next generation of exploration capabilities and systems. The space \ncenter also trains members of our brave astronaut corps, people such as \nScott Kelly, to ensure they are prepared for the incredible challenge \nthey face.\n  A real highlight of my most recent visit to the Johnson Space Center \nwas my ability to actually speak to Scott Kelly while he was in space \nin the International Space Station. As you can tell from his social \nmedia presence--and I follow him on Twitter; he publishes pictures of \nhis incredible view from space on his Twitter feed--he is an optimistic \nguy, and it is easy to see that he loves his job, but I am sure he is \nlooking forward to being back home.\n  Scott's mission aboard the International Space Station was about \nsomething much bigger than just he, which I am sure he would say if he \nwere here. It was about an investment in the next generation and a \ncommitment to new discoveries and exploring new frontiers. The research \nhe was a part of, included studies to evaluate the effects of living in \nspace on the human body. Scott is actually a twin. His twin brother was \nhere on Earth while he was in space for a year, and I am sure there \nwill be a lot of extensive studies, given the fact that they are twins, \non what changes Scott experienced in his own metabolism, body, and the \nlike. They also grew plants in zero gravity in space and much more, \nwhich will lay the groundwork for preparing future Americans to go \nfarther, explore more places, and push the outer limits of human space \nexploration safely without endangering their health and well-being.\n  The work Scott Kelly accomplished, along with all of the men and \nwomen at the Johnson Space Center and with NASA, is so important \nbecause it secures America's position as the global leader in space \nexploration. As important, this research and development impacts more \nthan our space program. It helps applications in the medical field, for \nour military, and other scientific endeavors. I remember growing up, \nwhen we landed the first astronaut on the Moon and what an inspiration \nit was to me as a young person. I think space exploration has a way of \nopening the eyes and the imaginations of young people even today about \nthe future--a future perhaps in space exploration or other fields of \nscience, lured as they are to work in the forefront of discovery or \nhelp engineer the next great innovation.\n  Developments like this don't occur automatically and they don't occur \novernight. We have to task our space program with taking on new \nchallenges to reap the full benefits, technological breakthroughs, and \nscientific advancements, and that is why we needed a long-term strategy \nfor the U.S.-manned space mission.\n  Today I am introducing legislation called the Manifest for Human \nSpace Flight Act that would require NASA to provide Congress with a \nclear goal and thoughtful strategy. This would include outlining our \nexploration goals and selecting destinations for future manned space \nmissions that fully utilize our existing assets, provide opportunities \nto work with commercial and international partners, and position our \noverall space program on a more focused and stable trajectory. This \nlegislation would also, for the first time, designate a human presence \non Mars as a long-term goal of NASA.\n  Lieutenant Watley was perhaps an American on Mars in a great movie \n``The Martian,'' but I believe actually establishing a human presence \non Mars would be a worthy goal that would then necessitate the strategy \nto accomplish that goal. With this bill, I hope we can rightly \nprioritize space exploration and confirm our commitment to discovering \nthe next great frontier.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished senior Senator from \nTexas is still on the floor, he mentioned the astronaut and his year in \nspace. As one who has a hobby of photography, I was envious as I looked \nat all those. I am sure the distinguished Senator from Texas has the \nsame feeling I had seeing these photographs and seeing what an amazing \ncountry we are in all times of days and nights and seasons. So I thank \nhim for raising that issue.\n  Mr. President, this week we are considering the Comprehensive \nAddiction Recovery Act or as they call it CARA. There are few problems \nin this country that have had more of a devastating impact on American \nfamilies than opioid abuse. Communities across the country are \nstruggling and they are seeking help. Vermont is no exception, and I \nfound this as I held hearings around the State.\n  Finally, after years of a misguided approach, Congress now sees \naddiction for what it is, a public health crisis. We have before us a \nbipartisan bill we are considering that demonstrates strong bipartisan \nsupport by Senators for addressing addiction.\n  CARA authorizes a critical public health program that I helped create \nto expand access to medication-assisted treatment programs. Some \nVermonters who have been struggling with addiction have had to wait \nnearly a year to receive treatment. In fact, several died waiting. \nUnfortunately, the story is not unique.\n  The bill also includes my provision to support rural communities with \nthe overdose reversal drug naloxone. Rural locations have the highest \ndeath rates in the country from opioid poisoning, talking about my \nsmall State of Vermont, but every State, no matter how large or how \nsmall, has rural areas. I want people to know that rural locations have \nthe highest death rate. Now, if we can get naloxone into more hands, we \ncan save lives.\n\n  Last week, the police in Burlington, VT, were equipped with naloxone, \nand they were able to save a man's life with this impactful treatment. \nIn fact, the man was unconscious. They saved his life, and Police Chief \nBrandon del Pozo\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\ncalled it ``a textbook case of how police save lives using naloxone.''\n  Now, CARA recognizes that law enforcement will always play a vital \nrole. That is why I worked to include an authorization for funding to \nexpand State-led anti-heroin task forces.\n  These are important efforts, but I can't emphasize enough that one \nauthorization bill alone is not going to pull our communities out of \naddiction--not the communities in my State, in the distinguished \nPresiding Officer's State or in anybody else's State. We can't pretend \nthat solving a problem as large as opioid addiction does not require \nmore resources.\n  That is why the amendment proposed by Senator Shaheen is so \nessential. It puts real dollars behind the rhetoric. It is going to \nensure that the important programs authorized in CARA can actually \nsucceed.\n  We can all feel good about going on record saying we are against the \nproblem and that we want to solve the problem of opioid addiction. But \nif we say we are not going to give you any money to do it, it sounds \nmore like empty rhetoric.\n  In fact, Congress has approved much larger emergency supplemental \nbills addressing Ebola and swine flu. Even though we didn't have a \nsingle Ebola case in this country, we had supplemental funds addressing \nit, while we have thousands of opioid addiction cases across the \ncountry. These efforts were appropriate--but for Ebola and swine flu. \nNow we have a public health crisis that is here in our own country, and \nwe must respond. Of course, we have responded to epidemics in other \ncountries, but this is an epidemic here at home.\n  I think everybody agrees that opioid addiction is an epidemic. We \nshould start treating it like one. The Shaheen amendment provides that \ncommitment. I urge every Member who supports CARA--and that is a strong \nbipartisan group in this body--every Member who is concerned about \naddiction in their community--and I have to assume that includes every \nSenator--to put real resources behind CARA.\n  I think of the different hearings I have held around our State. In \none city, where some had suggested maybe we shouldn't have a hearing \nyet because we shouldn't talk about what is going on, the mayor of that \ncity took just the opposite view. He said: We have a problem; so we \nshould talk about it to see what we can do about it. He was happy I \ncame there. Although he is a Republican and I am a Democrat, we both \nsaid there is no politics and partisanship in this and we ought to face \nit.\n  But here is what happened. We scheduled that hearing, and we thought \nwe could use a hall of such-and-such a size. As the days toward the \nhearing kept coming, we found we needed a bigger and bigger hall \nbecause more and more people wanted to come there. We found we had the \nfaith community, law enforcement, the medical profession, mothers and \nfathers, addicts, and educators. All of these people came together and \nsaid: We have a problem, and we need the resources to work together. \nLaw enforcement can't do it alone. The medical profession can't do it \nalone. The faith community can't do it alone. Educators can't do it \nalone. But together, with the resources, we might be able to do \nsomething.\n  For another hearing I held--again, the very same thing in a small \ntown--we had to keep enlarging the place where we were going to meet. I \nrecall several people testifying, but one was a now-retired but highly \nrespected, decorated pediatrician. He told us about talking to a \ncouple. He didn't identify them for obvious reasons. But he said: You \nknow, we have this opioid problem here in our city. We have young \nteenagers who come from very good families--families that are well \neducated, prosperous, have good income, nice homes. But these teenagers \nare addicts, and they are getting some of this right from their home \nmedicine cabinet. In this hall with hundreds of people, you could hear \na pin drop. He stopped and paused for a moment, and he said: The \nparents thanked me and said: This is something we should watch out for. \nHe said: No, I am talking about your daughter. Your 14-year-old \ndaughter is an addict. I am talking about her. There are a lot of \nothers in this community, but I am talking about her. I am talking \nabout her.\n  To this day, I can hear the collective gasp in that room.\n  I later had the opportunity to meet the parents and the doctor and \nsee the things they were doing. They had the ability, and to the extent \nthat there were things available, they could pay for them, but most \npeople couldn't.\n  Yes, we should pass CARA, but we should also acknowledge that we have \nthis problem in every single State in the Union, across every \ndemographic, every income level, every area of education. Let's pass \nsome appropriations so that we are not just giving empty words and we \nare not addressing a terrible problem with just empty words. But the \nSenate is saying: We will stand up for a problem in our own country, as \nwe have in other countries when we have helped other countries, and we \nwill stand up for a serious problem right here at home, and we have the \ncourage to spend the money to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee for yielding at this time. I agree \nwith him on the issue of the legislation before us, but I felt \ncompelled to come to the floor to speak about the vacancy in the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  I rise to support this President's obligation--any \nPresident's obligation--to name a Supreme Court nominee to fill a \nvacancy, no matter when that vacancy occurs--election year or not. We \nshould rightfully expect any President to fulfill his or her \nconstitutional duty and send an eminently qualified nominee to the \nSenate. All logic, all reason, and the Constitution itself dictates \nthat every President has the duty to do so, under any interpretation of \nconstitutional law. Likewise, we should rightfully expect the Senate to \ndo its job and send that name to the Judiciary Committee, hold a \nhearing, debate the nomination on the floor, and take a vote.\n\n  We are not talking about a vague clause that invites interpretation. \nWe are talking about a very clear and concise clause--article II, \nsection 2, clause 2--that states: ``The President. . . . shall \nnominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court. . . . ''\n  It does not say: except in an election year. It does not say: except \nwhen it does not suit the political agenda of the majority party in the \nSenate. It does not say: No appointments can be made in the final year \nof a President's term. And it does not say: The Senate can arbitrarily \nand preemptively choose to obstruct the President's responsibility to \nmake appointments.\n  The point is, the Constitution is clear. In fact, in the last 100 \nyears, the Senate has taken action on every Supreme Court nominee, \nregardless of whether the nomination was made in a Presidential \nelection year.\n  But this goes far beyond the filling of a Supreme Court vacancy. This \ngoes to the very heart of the constant and continuous attacks this \nPresident has had to endure. For more than 7 years, some Republicans \nhave, time and again, questioned the legitimacy of this President. From \nhis election, beginning with the legitimacy of his birth certificate to \naccusing the President of lawlessness, having a Republican Member of \nCongress shout ``liar'' during the State of the Union to questioning \nhis legitimate authority in his final year in office to fill the \nvacancy left by the death of Justice Scalia. It begs the question of \nwhy this President is being denied the opportunity to fulfill his \nconstitutional obligation.\n  Why are constitutional standards, backed by history and precedent, \nbeing questioned for this President's Supreme Court nominee? If we were \nto rely on pure logic and simple consistency, the question to ask is, \nWould our friends on the other side deny a President of their own party \nthe right to make that appointment? I think not.\n  The only conclusion we can draw is that this is yet another \nvalidation of their strategic decision 7 years ago at a Republican \nretreat to make Barack Obama a one-term President and obstruct this \nPresident at every turn, and then claim political victory for their own \nmisguided inaction and refusal to govern.\n  What is most astonishing is that they claim, like Justice Scalia, \nthat the\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nConstitution is carved in stone, that it is undeniable and impervious \nto interpretation. Yet, somehow, they can completely ignore what it \nclearly states in yet another effort to obstruct this President's \nability to govern.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side: This President was elected \ntwice to serve two full terms. It has only been 7 years. It is time to \naccept it and move away from obstructionism and on to governing.\n  The President and I may have differences on certain policies, but we \nare in complete agreement that he should not be denied the ability to \nfill this vacancy on the Court. Democrats did not deny President Reagan \nthe ability to confirm Justice Kennedy in an election year, and the \nRepublicans should not deny this President the same ability under the \nsame circumstances. We should have the decency and respect for the \nConstitution to let the unambiguous wisdom of article II, section 2, \nclause 2 to determine our actions today, as we did then.\n  So let's stop the political posturing. Let the President fulfill his \nconstitutional responsibility and the Senate fulfill its advice and \nconsent role. Let's fulfill one of the most basic and solemn duties we \nhave. Let's have a hearing and take a vote. The American people deserve \na fully functioning Supreme Court.\n  There is a bipartisan tradition of giving full and fair consideration \nto Supreme Court nominees. Even when a majority of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has not supported the nominee, the committee has still sent \nthe nominee to the full Senate for a floor vote. And it should be noted \nthat at no time since World War II has the Court operated with fewer \nthan nine Justices because of the Senate simply refusing to consider a \nnominee.\n  Now, every day when I come to work, I pass the Supreme Court, and the \nwords over the portal of the Supreme Court say: ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw.'' Equal justice under law demands that the judicial branch be \nfully functional.\n  When we have a Supreme Court deadlocked in a decision, the decision \nin the lower court stands and the highest court in the land has no \nprecedential value. Let's be clear. When there is a difference between \ndifferent Federal courts in our country in different jurisdictions, it \nis the Supreme Court that determines what is the law of the land so \nthat Federal law is not different in New Jersey than it is in Texas. \nBut if the Court is deadlocked in two similar cases and the decision \nreverts to the finding of the lower court, there could be differences \nin how a person in New Jersey is treated than a person is in Texas \nunder the same Federal statute. It is not equal justice under the law.\n\n  To have equal justice under the law, the Nation needs the Supreme \nCourt to be fully functioning. Justice Scalia himself spoke of the \nproblems with an eight-Justice Court. In 2004, in explaining why he \nwould not recuse himself in a case involving former Vice President Dick \nCheney, he said:\n\n       With eight Justices, [it raises] the possibility that, by \n     reason of a tie vote, the Court will find itself unable to \n     resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case. \n     Even one unnecessary recusal impairs the functioning of the \n     Court.\n\n  So I believe that in life, Justice Scalia, as a textualist, would say \nthe President has an obligation to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. In \n1987, before the Democratic Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy, it was \nPresident Reagan who said: ``Every day that passes with the Supreme \nCourt below full strength impairs the people's business in that \ncrucially important body.''\n  I ask my Republican colleagues: How long are you willing to impair \nthe people's business? How long are you willing to stick to a strategy \nof obstructionism over good governance? How long are you willing to \ndeny this President his constitutional authority and obligation to \nappoint a nominee to satisfy your political agenda? How long are you \nwilling to deny equal justice under the law?\n  It was John Adams who reminded us that this is ``a government of \nlaws, not of men.''\n  It was Justice Felix Frankfurter who said: ``If one man can be \nallowed to determine for himself what is law, every man can. That means \nfirst chaos then tyranny. Legal process is the essential part of the \ndemocratic process.''\n  Let's not in this Chamber be the ``one man.'' Let's respect the \nConstitution and do our jobs. In this case, the Constitution is settled \nlaw. Let's not unsettle it through a misguided determination to score \npolitical points to undermine the legitimacy of this President.\n  The American people understand that our obligation in this process is \nto advise and consent, not neglect and obstruct. The American people \nwill see the harm to our country and our courts if the majority \ncontinues these political tactics. Let's do the right thing. Let's do \nour jobs and respect this institution and the Constitution by holding \nhearings and voting on a Supreme Court nominee.\n  Let's provide for equal justice under the law.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we just heard some very legitimate \nquestions from the previous speaker that ought to be answered, and I am \ngoing to go back to the familiar to answer that--to the so-called Biden \nrules.\n  By now everyone is pretty familiar with the Biden rules, so I am not \ngoing to take time to go over all of them again, but they boil down to \na couple basic points.\n  First, the President should exercise restraint and ``not name a \nnominee until after the November election is completed,'' or, stated \ndifferently, the President should let the people decide. But if the \nPresident chooses not to follow this model, but instead, as Chairman \nBiden said, ``goes the way of Fillmore and Johnson and presses an \nelection-year nomination,'' then the Senate shouldn't consider the \nnomination and shouldn't hold hearings.\n  It doesn't matter, he said, ``how good a person is nominated by the \nPresident.'' So the historical record is pretty clear. But we haven't \ntalked as much about one of the main reasons Chairman Biden was so \nadamant that the Senate shouldn't consider a Supreme Court nominee \nduring a heated Presidential election. It is because of the tremendous \ndamage such a hyperpolitical environment would cause the Court, the \nnominee, and the Nation. In short, if the Senate considered a Supreme \nCourt nominee during a heated Presidential election campaign, the Court \nwould become even more political than it already is.\n  That is a big part of what was driving Chairman Biden in 1992 when he \nspoke these strong words. Here is how Chairman Biden described the \nproblem in an interview--not the speech on the floor that I have quoted \nin the past--about a week before his famous speech of 1992:\n\n       Can you imagine dropping a nominee . . . into that fight, \n     into that cauldron in the middle of a Presidential year?\n\n  He continued:\n\n       I believe there would be no bounds of propriety that would \n     be honored by either side. . . . The environment within which \n     such a hearing would be held would be so supercharged and so \n     prone to be able to be distorted.\n\n  As a result, Chairman Biden concluded:\n\n       Whomever the nominee was, good, bad or indifferent . . . \n     would become a victim.\n\n  My friend the Vice President--but a friend when he was in the \nSenate--then considered the tremendous damage that thrusting a Supreme \nCourt nominee into a frenzied political environment would cause and \nweighed it against the potential impact of an eight-member Court for a \nshort time. He concluded that the ``minor'' cost of the ``three or four \ncases'' that would be reargued were nothing compared to the damage a \nhyperpoliticized fight would have on ``the nominee, the President, the \nSenate, and the Nation, no matter how good a person is nominated by the \nPresident.''\n  The former chairman concluded that because of how badly such a \nsituation would politicize the process, and based on the historical \nrecord, the only reasonable and fair approach--or as he said, the \n``pragmatic'' approach--is to not consider a nominee during a \nPresidential election.\n  He said.\n\n       Once the political season is underway . . . action on a \n     Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the \n     election campaign is over. That is what is fair to the \n     nominee and is central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to \n     me, Mr. President, we will be in deep trouble as an \n     institution.\n\n  He concluded:\n\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\n\n  \n\n       Senate consideration of a nominee under these circumstances \n     is not fair to the President, to the nominee, or to the \n     Senate itself.\n\n  This, in part, is why Chairman Biden went to such lengths to explain \nthe history of the bitter fights that occurred in Presidential years. \nHe said: ``Some of our Nation's most bitter and heated confirmation \nfights have come in Presidential election years.''\n  I will state this about the discussion we are having today and will \nprobably have every day for the next several months: Everyone knows \nthat this nominee isn't going to get confirmed. Republicans know it, \nDemocrats know it, the President knows it, and, can you believe it, \neven the press knows it. That is why the Washington Post called the \nPresident's future nominee a ``judicial kamikaze pilot,'' and the New \nYork Times noted that the nominee would need an ``almost suicidal \nwillingness to become the central player in a political fight that \nseems likely to end in failure.''\n  So the only question is, Why would the other side come to the floor \nto express outrage about not having a hearing? It is because they want \nto make this as political as possible.\n  The press has already picked up on it. For instance, CNN reported \nthat the other side hopes to use the fight over a Supreme Court nominee \nto ``energize the Democratic base.'' They are already using the Supreme \nCourt and the eventual nominee as a political weapon. They want nothing \nmore than to make the process as political as possible. That is why the \nPresident wants to push forward with a nominee who won't get confirmed. \nThat is why the other side is clamoring for a hearing on a nominee \neveryone knows won't get confirmed. Making the Court even more \npolitical is absolutely the last thing the Supreme Court needs.\n  The Court has been politicized enough already. A recent Gallup poll \ndocuments the frustration I hear expressed even at the grassroots of my \nState of Iowa. In the 6 years since President Obama has appointed two \nJustices, the American people's disapproval of the Supreme Court jumped \nfrom 28 percent disapproval in 2009 to 50 percent disapproval in 2015. \nThat is what happens when Justices legislate from the bench. This \nSenator might say there is even a Republican nominee sitting on that \nbench that has legislated from the bench as well.\n  That is what happens when Justices make decisions based on their \npersonal political preferences or what is in their heart rather than \nwhat is in the Constitution and the law. The last thing we need is to \nfurther politicize that process and the Court.\n  I just want to make sure that everyone understands what all of this \noutrage is really about. It is about making this process as political \nas possible.\n  We aren't going to let that happen to the Court, the nominee or the \nNation, to follow the suggestion of then-Senator Biden. We are going to \nhave a debate--a national debate--between the Democratic nominee and \nthe Republican nominee about what kind of Justice the American people \nwant on the Supreme Court. That is what the American people deserve, \nand that is why we are going to let the people decide.\n  But beyond one Justice, there is an even more basic debate occurring. \nAt my town meetings, often somebody will come in very outraged about \nwhy I won't impeach Supreme Court justices. They say: ``They're making \nlaw, instead of interpreting law. How come you put up with that?''\n  So we can have a debate between the Republican nominee and the \nDemocrat nominee on what the constitutional role of the Court is. And \nwe can have a debate about whether we want a Justice who expresses \nempathy and understanding of people's problems--the President's \nstandard. As we all know, that is not the purpose of the judicial \nbranch of government. That branch of government isn't supposed to let \ntheir personal feelings be involved whatsoever. And the President \nshould not encourage the Justices he appoints to let their feelings \ndecide cases. Their job is to look at what the law says, what the \nConstitution says, what the facts of the case are, and to make an \nimpartial judgment.\n  Consider a Justice appointed to the Supreme Court by a Republican \npresident, who wrote that the Affordable Care Act didn't fit into what \nCongress could do in regards to regulating interstate commerce--because \nthat reasoning could not be upheld under the Constitution. Instead, \nthat Justice decided the Court could uphold the Act under the \nCongressional taxing power and found a way to sustain this President's \nlegacy. It was also a Republican Justice who said: Find all kinds of \nways to do what you want to do as opposed to what the Constitution \nrequires or what Congress intends in legislation.\n\n  It would be nice to have a debate between a Democratic nominee and a \nRepublican nominee, whether we have two, three, or four national \ndebates or whether they have hundreds of appearances around the \ncountry, to have these basic constitutional issues discussed. And then \nwe should let the people decide not only who appoints the next Justice \nbut who will decide the direction of the Supreme Court for generations \nto come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I found this interesting. When my children \nwere little, I would read fairy tales to them, and they especially \nloved ``Through the Looking-Glass'' and ``Alice in Wonderland.'' And \nlistening to this speech, I thought of ``Through the Looking-Glass'' \nand ``Alice in Wonderland.''\n  It is interesting how President Obama gets blamed for everything. \n``Oh, the approval rating of the Supreme Court has gone down.'' The \nmajority of the Supreme Court Justices have been appointed or nominated \nby Republican Presidents. And we are going to blame President Obama \nbecause the Republican Justices, nominated by Republican Presidents, \nare bringing down the approval rating of the U.S. Supreme Court? \nAccording to my dear friend from Iowa--he is saying President Obama \nshould be blamed for what those Republican Justices on the Supreme \nCourt did. This is ``Alice in Wonderland.''\n  I don't care what happens; President Obama has to get blamed for it. \nEven if we have a hurricane or something, it must be President Obama's \nfault. But this is about as far a stretch as I've ever heard. If the \napproval rating of the court goes down because of the five Republicans \nwho constitute the majority of it, it is about as farfetched as ``Alice \nin Wonderland'' to blame President Obama for it.\n  Let's talk about facts. I like to talk about facts. It's the way \nDemocrats have handled Republicans' nominees. What my distinguished \nfriend doesn't point out, even though it has been pointed out to him by \nthe Vice President and by the President personally, certainly in my \npresence, Vice President Biden's speech--you should read the whole \nspeech--he is talking about what happens after the election. Vice \nPresident Biden as Chairman Biden put through, in an election year, a \nRepublican nominee to the Supreme Court and got a unanimous vote of \nDemocrats and Republicans in this body. Those are the facts. The fact \nis that we now use a different standard, it appears. In President \nBush's final 2 years, Democrats controlled the Senate. I was chairman. \nWe confirmed 68 of his nominees. In President Obama's final years in \noffice, Republicans have allowed only 16. These are facts. This isn't \nrhetoric, these are facts. We allowed 68 for a Republican President and \nRepublicans allowed only 16 for a Democratic President, and then they \nare going to blame the state of the judiciary on President Obama?\n  Then he talked about Vice President Biden when he was chairman and \nwhat he might have said during President H.W. Bush's last year in \noffice. Do you know what Vice President Biden did? They tried to imply \nthat he blocked judges. He put through 11 Republican nominees for the \ncircuit court and 53 Republican nominees for the district court--11 for \nthe circuit court, 53 for the district court. Do you know what \nRepublicans have allowed? Five lower court nominees this year. So if \nyou say we want to follow the Biden rule, I wish we would. We put \nthrough 53 district court nominees and 11 circuit court nominees, and \nduring a Democrat President's last year in office the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate has allowed only five. Come on, let's be fair.\n  The fact is, in a Presidential election year, we have never blocked a \nSupreme\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nCourt nominee because it was a Presidential election year. In fact, \nsince the Judiciary Committee began holding confirmation hearings for \nSupreme Court nominees in 1916, it has never denied a nominee a \nhearing.\n  I tell you this because the Constitution requires the President to \nmake a nomination--it is very clear--and then it says that we shall \nadvise and consent. Well, they are saying: ``No, we won't advise; we \nwon't consent; we won't even have a hearing.''\n  Mr. President, I have taken the oath of office here seven times. It \nis a moving, thrilling moment. I am sure the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, when he was sworn in, knew it was a solemn moment. You promise \nto uphold the Constitution, so help me God. The Constitution says the \nPresident shall nominate. It says we shall advise and consent.\n  I took my oath very, very seriously. That is why--just as Vice \nPresident Biden did when he was chairman--I moved a significant number \nof Republican judges through, even in the last year that President Bush \nwas in office. And that is so different from what we see now.\n  Just think about it. They criticize Vice President Biden. The last \nyear President George H.W. Bush was in office, Vice President Biden was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. He put through 11 circuit court \njudges and 53 district court judges. If you want to talk about the \nBiden rule, the Republicans have allowed only five lower court judges. \nCome on, let's get this out of partisanship. By any standard \nwhatsoever, when there has been a Republican President and a \nDemocratically-controlled Senate, we have treated that Republican \nPresident far better than they have treated Democratic Presidents.\n  But then to hear that because the five Republican-appointed majority \nmembers of the Supreme Court are bringing down the approval rating of \nthe Supreme Court for the American people, telling the American people \nit must be President Obama's fault--even if those five members were \nnominated and approved before President Obama's Presidency--that goes \ntoo far. That is ``Through the Looking-Glass.'' That is ``Alice in \nWonderland.''\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island on the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee very much. While he is on the floor, let me thank \nhim for his leadership, support, and passion for the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, which was shepherded through the Judiciary \nCommittee under his guidance and with his wise and benevolent support. \nI am very grateful.\n  I am on the floor to talk about the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act today because it has been said by several of my colleagues \nthat there is funding to implement this bill and that that funding is \nalready in the government's accounts, that if we pass the CARA bill, we \nwill be able to fund it and put it to work right away. Let me say with \nregret that I disagree with that assertion.\n  I am sorry to have a disagreement with my colleagues over this \nfunding question after all the very excellent bipartisan work we have \ndone to get this bill to this point. This really has been a legislative \nmodel. For years we worked on the statute. We had five different full-\non national seminars in Washington, bringing people in from all around \nthe country to advise us on all the different aspects of the opioid \nproblem. We had an advisory committee that supported us which was \nbroadly represented from all the different interests that are affected \nby the opioid crisis. We came up with a bipartisan bill which came \nthrough committee in regular order, without objection from anyone, and \nwhich is now on the Senate floor awaiting passage. That is the way it \nis supposed to work. But on this question of whether it is funded, I \nmust disagree, and I wish to explain why.\n  For openers, let me explain that in Congress, there are committees \nthat authorize funding. In the case of this bill, the relevant \ncommittees are the HELP Committee and the Judiciary Committee. But it \nis the Appropriations Committee that actually determines what funding \nwill go into which accounts. The Appropriations Committee, in turn, is \nbroken up into subcommittees, which determine the funding of different \naccounts in different areas of government. So one subcommittee has \njurisdiction in one set of accounts and another subcommittee has the \nappropriations authority over other accounts.\n  The funding my colleagues have referred to as the funding for this \nCARA bill was appropriated by what we call in the Senate the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Subcommittee. The Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee \nappropriates two accounts that generally correspond to the authorizing \npower of the HELP Committee. So there are three committees involved: \nJudiciary, HELP, and Appropriations. The subcommittee on Appropriations \nthat appropriated this money generally correlates to the authorizing \npower and jurisdiction of the HELP Committee. There are other \nAppropriations subcommittees. For instance, there is one that we refer \nto as CJS. CJS appropriates to, among others, the accounts within the \nauthorizing power of the Judiciary Committee. So that is the \nbackground.\n  Now let's go through the problems. One problem with my friend's \nargument that the bill is funded is that the funding measure to which \nthey refer originally passed out of its Appropriations subcommittee \nlast June. We didn't even take up the CARA bill in the Judiciary \nCommittee until this February. So there is a timing problem. How could \nthe appropriators last June have predicted this state of affairs on the \nfloor right now? The appropriators would have had to have had an \nastonishing, wizard-like ability to read the future in order to fund \nback then an unpassed bill--indeed, a bill that then didn't even have a \ncommittee hearing scheduled, let alone markup, passage, and the choice \nto bring it to the floor. Clearly, in June the Labor-HHS appropriators \nwere funding existing programs, and when the omnibus passed in \nDecember, these same programs were funded at an even higher level. In \nfact, Democrats demanded they be funded at nearly the identical level \nproposed in the President's budget. The President's budget goes even \nfurther back in time. The President's budget certainly could not have \nforeseen CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. So there \nis a timing problem.\n\n  Second, this CARA bill, back when these appropriations were passed in \nJune, was funded through different accounts than the accounts it is \nfunded through now as we see it on the floor. When the appropriations \nwere passed, it was funded through accounts that would be funded by CJS \nappropriators. So there is a committee mismatch as well as a timing \nproblem to any claim that these funds were intended for the CARA bill.\n  The bulk of the CARA bill back then--in fact, 10 out of its 13 \nprograms--authorized funding through Judiciary Committee programs, \nwhich is why the bill was sent by the Parliamentarians here to the \nJudiciary Committee. So if back then the intention was to fund CARA, it \nwould have been CJS that would have funded 10 of those 13 programs. The \nappropriators for the funds my colleagues speak of were not the CJS \nappropriators but the Labor-HHS appropriators. Again, there is a \ncommittee mismatch.\n  Here is what happened that explains the shift. After the fiscal year \n2016 omnibus had passed, we were informed--the sponsors and authors of \nthe legislation--that in order to get our bill out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the CARA bill had to be rewritten so that it operated only \nthrough existing Federal programs. There are Republicans, as the \nPresiding Officer well knows, who live by the principle of no new \nFederal programs, even for new crises, and we were asked in the \nJudiciary Committee to accommodate them. So we accommodated them. We \nrewrote the bill in January to accommodate those concerns.\n  So this February, when CARA came before the Judiciary Committee, it \nhad been revised to move the bulk of its new programs out of the \nJudiciary Committee accounts and into accounts under the jurisdiction \nof the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Now, of the \n10 programs remaining in the bill, 8 are located at\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nthe Department of Health and Human Services, in the jurisdiction of the \nHELP Committee. But that move was long after these appropriations were \nmade. You cannot connect them.\n  I should interject that this change created an intrusion by our \nJudiciary bill into the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee. All here \ntoday who support the CARA bill owe a great debt of gratitude and \nappreciation to Chairman Alexander and to Ranking Member Murray for \nallowing this bill to proceed, even though it now involves a \nconsiderable number of accounts under their committee's jurisdiction. \nThey have done so very graciously, without demanding further hearings \nor otherwise asserting their HELP Committee's turf. So to both of them \nI offer, and we should all offer, our sincere and heartfelt thanks.\n  It does seem a stretch to think that the appropriators in the \nAppropriations subcommittee that funds these HELP accounts could have \nforeseen last June not only that CARA would pass out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in February and not only that it would come to the floor now, \nbut also could have foreseen that so many of its programs would have \nbeen transferred from Judiciary Committee to HELP Committee accounts. \nThat would have been an astonishing--indeed, truly magical--feat of \nprediction.\n  The simple fact is that the Labor-HHS appropriations that my friends \nrely on as the funding for this CARA bill passed out of the relevant \nsubcommittee with little or no regard for CARA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated April 2, 2015, regarding this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Roy Blunt,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \n         Education, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n         Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science \n         and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n         Services, Education, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n         Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shelby, Chairman Blunt, Ranking Member \n     Mikulski, and Ranking Member Murray: As you may know, heroin \n     use and prescription opioid abuse are having devastating \n     effects on public health and safety across the United States. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), drug overdoses now surpass automobile accidents as the \n     leading cause of injury-related death for Americans ages 25 \n     to 64. Every day, more than 120 Americans die as a result of \n     drug overdose. Over half of these drug overdoses are related \n     to prescription drugs. While addiction is a treatable \n     disease, only about ten percent of those who need treatment \n     receive it.\n       We write to express our strong support for fiscal year (FY) \n     2016 funding for programs that would support the integrated \n     strategies for addressing opioid abuse included in the \n     Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015 (CARA, S. \n     524). This bipartisan legislation was developed over the past \n     year and a half through a cooperative process involving key \n     national stakeholders in the public health, law enforcement, \n     criminal justice, and drug policy fields, and is designed to \n     fight prescription opioid abuse and heroin use holistically--\n     from expanding prevention to supporting recovery.\n       Among other objectives, CARA would:\n       Expand prevention and educational efforts--particularly \n     aimed at teens, parents and other caretakers, and aging \n     populations--to prevent prescription opioid abuse and the use \n     of heroin.\n       Expand the availability of the overdose reversal drug \n     naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first \n     responders.\n       Expand resources to promptly identify and treat individuals \n     suffering from substance use disorders in the criminal \n     justice system.\n       Expand disposal sites for unwanted prescription medications \n     to keep them out of the hands of children and adolescents.\n       Launch an evidence-based prescription opioid and heroin \n     treatment and intervention program to expand best practices \n     throughout the country.\n       Launch a medication-assisted treatment and intervention \n     demonstration program.\n       Strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to help \n     states monitor and track prescription drug diversion and to \n     help at-risk individuals access services.\n       As you begin consideration of the FY 2016 appropriations \n     bills, we urge you to provide sufficient funding for the \n     provisions included in CARA, which would provide the \n     resources and incentives necessary for states and local \n     governments to expand treatment, prevention, and recovery \n     efforts for the millions of Americans who are affected by \n     substance use disorders. Among other things, we ask that you \n     ensure adequate funding for CDC's prescription drug \n     surveillance and monitoring activities and the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Medication-\n     Assisted Treatment for Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction \n     program. Because we know that medication-assisted treatment \n     should be an important component in treating those suffering \n     from opioid abuse in the criminal justice system, we urge you \n     to continue your support for the Medication-Assisted \n     Treatment Pilot Program at the Bureau of Prisons.\n       Only through a comprehensive approach that leverages \n     evidence-based law enforcement initiatives, treatment, and \n     support for recovery can we reverse the current skyrocketing \n     numbers of heroin and prescription opioid overdoses and \n     deaths. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kelly A. Ayotte,\n     Susan Collins,\n     Christopher A. Coons,\n     Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     Amy Klobuchar,\n       United States Senators.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the letter I have submitted was \nwritten to bring CARA to the attention of both the CJS and the Labor-\nHHS subcommittees. But those subcommittees, when they got this letter, \nhad no idea the bulk of this would move from the Judiciary Committee to \nthe HELP Committee. Back then, CARA was mostly funded through another \nsubcommittee--CJS. Back then, CARA had not even been scheduled for its \nhearing in Judiciary.\n  So why was the funding for the opioid crisis put in and, indeed, \nincreased by the appropriators of the HELP accounts? Obviously, because \n47,000 people died last year--in 2014, the last year we have on \nrecord--of opioid overdose deaths. This is a national crisis. They were \npaying attention to it. They were putting resources in, but not \nresources to implement the bill that we are about to vote on in the \nnext few days.\n  Indeed, as we speak, SAMSHA, the relevant agency, is gearing up its \ngrant applications to go forward and solicit bids for all the money the \nappropriators approved and that was dialed up in the omnibus. And \nSAMSHA is proceeding under the pre-CARA laws. SAMSHA intends to spend \nevery dollar of the appropriated funds, CARA or no CARA. That means if \nthis CARA bill passes, every dollar that goes this year to fund a CARA \nprogram will take away funds from that pre-CARA grant array that SAMSHA \nis preparing right now. In that case, we will necessarily be robbing \nPeter to pay Paul. You cannot count the same funding twice, and there \nis no new money for CARA.\n  One can make the argument, and, indeed, I would accept the argument \nthat though we are robbing Peter to pay Paul, CARA's Paul is better \nthan pre-CARA's Peter. CARA is, after all, a very good bill, but the \nfunding math is still undeniable. We are, in fact, robbing pre-CARA \nPeter to pay for a new CARA-improved Paul. So one can argue that funded \nprograms may improve because of CARA, at least to the extent the \nfunding goes to new CARA-authorized purposes. But that is an argument \nthat the same money will be better spent. It is not a fair argument \nthat there is new money for CARA programs. There is no new money.\n  In sum, the timing does not support the argument that there is new \nfunding for CARA. That money was appropriated long ago. Indeed, this \nbill will not even be law if we get it through the Senate. There is \nstill the House, the Conference, and the President. What kind of \nwizards do we think our appropriators must have been 8 months ago at \nseeing a future for this bill which we even now cannot see?\n  On top of that, the jurisdictional problem between Judiciary and HELP \nshows that the HELP appropriations had to be intended back in June for \nother programs, specifically for the HELP grants now underway at \nSAMSHA, which we would be robbing to fund CARA programs.\n  Unless they were time-traveling wizards, if the appropriators had \nintended to add extra money for CARA for this fiscal year, they would \nhave added the money to the Judiciary accounts that were what CARA \nauthorized back then\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nwhen it was introduced and when the appropriators passed the \nappropriations in the subcommittee.\n  Finally, it is a fact that all of this appropriated money my friends \nspeak of is already on its way to being spent. It will be spent even \nwithout CARA. It will be spent even if, for some reason, CARA fails. It \nmay even be spent before CARA becomes law, and it will be spent in \nprograms to support addiction recovery.\n  That is the logic of my conclusion that there is no funding for CARA. \nThat is the logic of my conclusion that to fund CARA without robbing \nother addiction recovery programs, we would need new funding, not just \nlast year's appropriations. And that, my friends, is why Senator \nShaheen's emergency funding bill is so important.\n  With that, I see my distinguished chairman on the floor, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I would like to start my remarks on the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act today by complimenting all of \nthe Members--Senator Whitehouse, Senator Grassley, Senator Portman, \nSenator Ayotte, Senator Shaheen, and all the Members who have been \nworking so hard on this legislation to produce something which is very \nmuch needed by our country.\n  I will start my remarks by telling a little story of a constituent \nwho wants to remain anonymous. This is her story:\n\n       On July 20, 2009, I was the passenger in a vehicle with my \n     close friend at the time behind the wheel. The light turned \n     green and as expected he hit the gas. While he was hitting \n     the gas, the oncoming car never hit their brakes to stop at \n     the red light they were approaching.\n       I was painfully pinned in the passenger's seat. All I could \n     hear was my friend asking me if I was OK. Upon arriving in \n     the ER I was quickly poked, prodded, and injected with high-\n     level painkillers. This is where it all began.\n       Walking out of the hospital, I wasn't only walking out with \n     crutches, but a prescription that changed the next 5 years of \n     my life. I was prescribed OxyContin to help manage the pain I \n     was experiencing. With continuing follow-up appointments and \n     check-ins, also came more prescriptions for ``pain management \n     prescriptions.''\n       Two months after getting into a car accident, I was a \n     heroin addict. How quickly all things I knew changed. In \n     September of 2009 I not only began shooting heroin but I also \n     began my first semester of college. I was a freshman at UMass \n     Boston, worked full time, but, secretly, I was also a heroin \n     addict. I kept my addiction a secret from everyone I knew \n     including my close friends and family.\n       On August 31, 2014 I woke up and said to myself ``enough is \n     enough.'' It took three overdoses in order to open my eyes. \n     Since leaving treatment in November of 2014, my recovery has \n     not stopped; I continue to learn and to grow daily. I have \n     also learned of the medical issues and complications that my \n     heroin use has led to. I now suffer from seizures because the \n     excessive drug use over 5 years has led to minor brain \n     damage. Along with the seizures, I have tested positive for \n     Hepatitis C and HIV, which is common with injection drug \n     users.\n       At the end of the day, all I want to do is to help others \n     who are struggling because I know what they are going \n     through.\n\n  Mr. President, she is one of the fortunate ones. She found the help \nshe needed and had the strength and support to get clean. But I am \nhearing enormous frustration from people who don't feel that sufficient \nresources are being brought to bear on this enormous epidemic of \nprescription drug and heroin addiction.\n  All week we have heard the statistics here in this Chamber. Our \nNation is experiencing more deaths from drug overdoses than from gun \nviolence or auto accidents. Eighty percent of the people suffering from \nheroin addiction started with opioid pain medications approved by the \nFDA and prescribed by doctors, with 27,000 people dying from an opioid \noverdose in 2014 and 1,300 of those coming from the State of \nMassachusetts.\n  This issue is one that doesn't just affect the Bay State. America is \ndrowning in a tsunami of heroin and prescription drug addiction that we \nmust stop before it drowns any more families and communities.\n  Let us compare what we are did as a nation when confronted with other \ndeadly epidemics. A bipartisan majority in Congress funded more than $5 \nbillion to respond to Ebola. We dispatched the medical community and \npublic health experts. Today the Obama administration is asking \nCongress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to fight the Zika virus.\n  Imagine if we applied the same commitment, the same urgency, and the \nsame level of resources to the prescription drug and heroin epidemic. \nWe need an immediate and comprehensive strategy that requires \ncommitment from all levels of government--State, local, and Federal. \nThat means Congress must step up to respond with leadership and with \nresources. We need to stop the overprescription of opioid pain \nmedication, we must prevent addiction before it takes hold, and we must \nprovide the funding necessary to ensure that we stem this tide of \ndeadly addiction.\n  The Food and Drug Administration must change its decision not to seek \nexpert advice about the risks of addiction before it approves abuse-\ndeterring opioids. Abuse-deterring opioids is a contradiction in terms. \nWhether an opioid is used as a deterrent or not, it has not prevented \ntens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or \nexperienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers. \nBy refusing to convene the advisory committee to inform all of its \nopioid approval decisions, the FDA continues to ignore outside experts \nwho could help stem the tide of tragic deaths and overdoses plaguing \nthis country.\n  That is why I have filed an amendment to require the FDA to convene \nadvisory committees of outside experts for all opioid approval \ndecisions--period. Now is the time to implement effective and \ncommonsense solutions, but we need funding to do that; funding for \nfamilies, funding for treatment providers, funding for our sheriffs and \nfirefighters who carry overdose prevention drugs that save lives. We \nneed to provide the real resources necessary to address a crisis that \nis only growing in numbers and severity, and that comes in the form of \nemergency funding. We are hemorrhaging lives by the day, and \nsupplemental funding is the first step needed to staunch the flow of \nsuffering and death.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a watershed moment in this national \ndebate to address the public health crisis of addiction. So let us be \nclear. Stopping the overprescription of pain medication that is fueling \nopioid addiction and overdoses starts with the prescribers. We need to \nrequire anyone who prescribes opioid pain medication and other \ncontrolled substances to undergo mandatory training on safe prescribing \npractices and the identification of possible substance abuse disorders. \nThat is why I have filed an amendment that requires prescribers to get \nthe education needed to help staunch this wall of suffering and death.\n  The doctors will say they don't want education to be mandated; that \nit should be voluntary. Well, the FDA has had voluntary education for \nopioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively \nencouraging doctors to take these voluntary education modules, but in \nmore than 2 years, less than 12 percent of prescribers have actually \ncompleted the FDA's voluntary education program. A survey of 1,000 \nphysicians nationwide found that nearly one-half of doctors erroneously \nreported that abuse-deterrent formulations were less addictive than \ntheir counterparts. It is unconscionable that our doctors know so \nlittle about these potentially deadly painkillers.\n  I intend to call up amendment No. 3382 later so we can make \nconsideration of the bill. The amendment would ensure that as a \ncondition of receiving a license to prescribe opioids, the recipient of \nthe license is educated in the best practices for using opioids and the \nconnection with addiction and with diversion. I intend to call up that \namendment later, asking for consideration.\n  From my perspective, if we are going to have a real strategy, then we \nhave to make sure there is a requirement that there is continuing \neducation. We also need to remove the barriers to effective treatment, \nincluding outdated Federal restrictions on medication-assisted \ntherapies like SUBOXONE.\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\n  Medication-assisted therapy for opioid addition is cost-effective, it \ndecreases overdose deaths, and it reduces transmission of HIV and \nhepatitis C. That is why I have filed an amendment that would lift the \ncaps that are limiting the number of patients doctors can treat with \nmedication-assisted therapy. If we are going to reduce the supply of \nheroin and illicit prescription drugs, we have to reduce the demand \nthrough effective treatment. I have been working with Senator Paul from \nKentucky on that amendment.\n  Also, fear of a lawsuit should not deter anyone from trying to save \nthe life of someone suffering from an overdose. That is why I have \nfiled an amendment that creates a Federal Good Samaritan provision that \nshields from civil liability family members, friends, and other \nbystanders who administer opioid prevention treatments like Narcan.\n  The debate we are having on this legislation this week is just the \nbeginning. We must let prescribers know that unless they get basic \neducation in opioids, they will have to turn off the spigot of \npainkillers that are flooding this country and leading to deadly \noverdoses. We must let law enforcement and the judicial system know we \ncannot incarcerate our way out of this problem. We must let Big Pharma \nknow we are going to work to ensure that we have a lifting of awareness \nof this issue every single day. Enough is enough in this country. \nEnough is enough. We have just seen an explosion in terms of this \nproblem.\n  We must now let all of those struggling with addiction know that help \nis on the way and that no matter how dark life seems right now, there \nis hope and the Sun will rise for them once again.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the opportunity to speak \nfor some time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Oregon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 2621 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to offer some thoughts about the \ncurrent discussion over a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  I had high hopes yesterday for the meeting in the White House between \nthe majority leader, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, President \nObama, and Vice President Biden. I had high hopes that meeting might \nlead to an opening and a willingness to entertain the important \nbusiness of filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court, but the \nannouncements made directly after that meeting suggested--a phrase we \nsometimes use back home--that the schoolhouse door is going to stay \nclosed. There will not be a debate. There will not be a vote. There \nwill not be a committee hearing. In fact, there was even a suggestion, \na commitment, that the majority would refuse even to entertain courtesy \noffice visits with the nominee that President Obama is expected to send \nup soon.\n  I was disappointed in that, and I wanted to take the floor to offer a \nsimple message. It is very important that the Senate do its \nconstitutional duty and do its job with respect to the Supreme Court \nvacancy. The job is pretty plain. We have a job description, as most \npeople do who have jobs. The job description is contained mostly in \narticle I of the Constitution, but there are also descriptions of what \nwe must do in the Senate in article II. Article II, section 2, clause 2 \nof the Constitution says the President ``shall nominate, and . . . with \nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint'' a variety of \nofficials, including Supreme Court Justices.\n  This is part of our job description, to entertain Presidential \nnominations for Supreme Court Justices. We volunteer for the job. We \ntake an oath to do the job. We cash a paycheck written by the American \npeople to pay for us to do the job. Frankly, we don't have the option \nof refusing to do the job.\n  Is there anything unusual about this situation, a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court occurring during the last year of a President's term? The \nanswer to that is no.\n  On 17 occasions, this body has entertained and had a confirmation \nvote on a Supreme Court Justice in the final year of a President's \nterm--17 times. When this happened, people thought it seemed rare, but \nwhen you go back and look at the historical record, it is not rare at \nall. On each of those occasions in a Presidential election year, the \nSenate has done its job under article II, section 2, clause 2, and \nentertained a nominee. There is no reason why this Senate should not do \nexactly the same thing, follow that historical precedent.\n  As I have traveled around Virginia in the weeks since the vacancy \nbecame open, I have talked to a lot of citizens about this. Sometimes \nit is helpful for us in this body to think about the way others--\nespecially our citizens--look at what we are doing or not doing here. \nCitizens ask me: What possibly could be the reason why the Senate would \nnot follow its clear historical precedent and do a job description that \nis contained in the Constitution and would refuse a vote, refuse \ndebate, refuse committee hearings, refuse even to meet with a nominee? \nWhy would Congress not do its job? Why would the Senate not do its job?\n  I have been thinking about that, and I can only conceive of two \nreasons why this Senate would not do its job, and both of the reasons \nare highly illegitimate, in my opinion.\n  The first reason--and this is a reason that occurs to many citizens, \nand they are very concerned about this--is that the Senate is \nannouncing that it will not do its job because of the identity of this \nparticular President. The Senate has been willing to do the job for \nother Presidents, but is there something about this particular \nPresident that is making the Senate decide to break its historical \ntraditions and violate article II, section 2, clause 2, and not do the \njob?\n  This question has given some added oomph because of another recent \nevent. In early February, President Obama sent his budget to the \nCongress. Pursuant to the Budget Act of 1974--and this has been \nfollowed uniformly by the Senate and the House--when the President \nsends up a budget, the Budget Committees have a hearing about the \nPresident's budget--even if they do not like it, and they often don't \nlike it, but that is what you do. You have a hearing about the \nPresident's budget. If you don't like it, you criticize the budget and \nthen you write a different budget. That is what has happened for every \nPresident since the Budget Control Act of 1974 passed.\n  In the last year of the Bush administration, when there were \nDemocratic majorities in both Houses when President Bush sent up his \nbudget, hearings were held on the budget. But in this instance, just \nwithin the last month, when the budget was sent up from President \nObama, both committees said: For this President--breaking the statute, \nbreaking all tradition--we will not even have a hearing on this \nPresident's budget.\n  So if we are going to break a constitutional command and break a \nhistory in which 17 Justices have been confirmed in a Presidential \nyear, and if we are going to break it for this President, and if we are \ngoing to break the Budget Control Act and break a uniform history since \n1974 by not according even a hearing for the budget submitted by this \nPresident, then a question that is being asked by the citizens of this \ncountry--certainly the citizens of this Commonwealth--is whether the \nactions taken here on this Supreme Court nomination to not allow a \nvote, not allow a debate, not allow a committee hearing, and not even \nallow courtesy office visits, is actually not about the Supreme Court \nat all, not even about the nominee, whosoever it shall be, but it is a \nparticular mark of disrespect for this President that is unprecedented \nin the history of this body. That is an explanation which many of my \ncitizens are deeply worried about and which many of my citizens are \ntalking about and asking about, and frankly I don't have a good answer \nto that concern.\n  There is a second reason that suggests itself to me with respect to \nbreaking all of the historical precedent on this particular Supreme \nCourt vacancy. It connects to another concern that I have taken to the \nfloor many times to talk about as a member of the Foreign Relations and \nArmed Services Committees. There is another clause of the Constitution \nthat I care deeply\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nabout, and that is article 1, section 8, clause 11. We should not be at \nwar without a vote of Congress.\n  We are now in the 20th month of a war, and Congress hasn't even \nvoted--this war against ISIL. I go to hearings all the time where \nMembers of the Senate criticize the President for what he is doing or \nnot doing in the war, but I see a complete unwillingness in this House \nand the House of Representatives to actually do what the Constitution \ncommands and have a vote on the war.\n  This circumstance reminds me of that: a clear constitutional command \nin article 2, section 2, clause 2; a clear historical precedent of the \nSenate engaging; but now, for this President, on this vacancy, a \ndecision: Hold on a second. Maybe we can just avoid voting yes or no. \nIf we vote yes for a nominee the President might send up, we will make \nsome people mad. If we vote no on a nominee the President sends up, we \nwill make some other people mad. Maybe we can just avoid the commands \nof article II, section 2, clause 2, avoid the uniform history of this \nbody, and not vote at all. If we can avoid voting at all, maybe we can \nevade accountability; maybe we can evade the criticism that might come \nto us from our constituents.\n  That is also highly troubling.\n  I can't think of any other reasons why this body would violate the \nclear commands of article II, section 2, clause 2, and violate a \nuniform history of approving 17 Supreme Court Justices during a \nPresidential year other than, A, it is fundamentally a sign of \ndisrespect for this particular President or, B, it is a desire by a \nSenate that certainly has the votes to confirm or deny, consistent with \nthe constitutional provision, to avoid taking a vote and thereby think \nwe can avoid the accountability to our citizens for casting a vote on \nsomething that might be controversial. Needless to say, both of those \nreasons are highly illegitimate and, in my view, are really beneath \nwhat we should be doing in this Chamber.\n  The last thing I will say is this: The job description of a Senator \nis laid out in the Constitution, but there are other parts of the job \nthat may not be laid out so plainly but that we all understand to be \nour job. For example, I don't think it is laid out that we should \npassionately represent our citizens and do constituent service for \nthem, but we all understand that is part of the job.\n  Well, another part of the job of a U.S. Senator that may not be \nspelled out as directly as the power to advise and consent on \nnominations or the power to declare war is that we are elected \nguardians of this institution, and more than just the institution of \nthe Senate, we are elected to be guardians of the Democratic traditions \nthat are set out in the Constitution, in this marvelous Constitution \nthat establishes three branches of government that have checks and \nbalances against each other.\n  We should always act, regardless of our disagreements, regardless of \nour debates or arguments, and the differences of opinion are \nlegitimate. We should always act to promote respect for our \ninstitutions, not only the institution of the Senate but the \ninstitution of the court system, which has a vacancy right now on the \nSupreme Court, the institution of the Presidency, toward whom we are \nsending a signal of disrespect by the actions that are being undertaken \nin this body. It is part of the job we need to do to build up the \nrespect for the institutions of our government. If Senators don't \nrespect the institutions of our government, why would anyone else \nrespect them? If we act in a way that subverts or tears them down, why \nwould we expect anyone else to respect the institution?\n  I came here to this body because I do respect the institution. I \nrespect its history. We are all humans; we can make mistakes. Votes \nhave been cast that in the light of day you could look at and expect to \nbe different. But compared to other systems in the world--and I lived \nin a country that was a military dictatorship when I was a young man, \nand I can certainly see the great blessing it is to live here in this \ncountry and serve here in this body. I deeply fear that the actions we \nare embarking on in connection with the Supreme Court nomination are \nexpressing a profound disrespect for the article III branch, the \ncourts; a profound disrespect for the article II branch of the \nPresidency; and, frankly, a profound disrespect for our own history, \ntraditions, and job description in this article I branch of the \nlegislature.\n  It is not too late for us to turn this around. It is not too late for \nus to take a pause and, when the President sends over a nomination for \nthe Supreme Court, to do what justice demands. If justice demands \nanything, it should be that we would analyze an individual on that \nperson's own merits instead of just saying that the blanket rule is \nthat no matter who you are, no matter what your qualifications, because \nyou were sent by this President, we will create a unique rule for you \nand refuse to entertain you.\n  We still have time to turn this around. I have no idea when the \nPresident will send a nominee over, and I have no idea who that nominee \nwill be, but when that nominee is delivered and recommended to the \nSenate, it is my prayer that this body will do what article II, section \n2, clause 2, demands; that we will do what we have done in every other \ninstance when a President has sent a nominee over in a Presidential \nelection year; that we will not bar the schoolhouse door but we will \nopen the doors to our office to accord a nominee the courtesy of a \ndiscussion; that we will have hearings in the Judiciary Committee; and \nthat we will have a robust debate and a vote on this floor. If that \nvote is a yes, that will be great. If that vote is a no, that will \nstill be fully in accord with the constitutional job description of \nthis Congress. But to not entertain a nominee at all, in my view, would \nviolate our oath, would violate the Constitution, and would express a \nsignificant disrespect for all three branches of government.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, along with my colleague Senator Schumer, \nI rise to offer what, in my view, are some needed changes to the \namendment Senator Toomey has now offered to the opioid bill. My bottom \nline for the opioid legislation is that a real solution has to include \nthree priorities: more prevention, better treatment, and tougher \nenforcement. To be successful, all three priorities must work in \ntandem.\n  The Toomey amendment, which is often called the Part D lock-in, would \nallow Part D plans to identify people in Medicare who may be abusing \nopioids. These people would then be assigned to one prescriber and one \npharmacy to get their pills. This is an enforcement policy, and it \ncracks down on those who game the system.\n  What is important, what is critical for the Senate to understand is \nthat the story does not stop there. If someone is addicted to opioids, \nthey need a path--a real path--to treatment. Without treatment, they \nmay get their pills on the street or they may turn to heroin. This \namendment ensures those who are at risk for opioid abuse are connected \nto meaningful treatment choices so they can better manage their pain \nand limit excessive prescriptions. Those struggling with addiction need \nthe health care system to be all hands on deck, working to ensure that \nthere is adequate treatment. That means your doctor, your health care \nplan, and your pharmacy need to come together and develop a treatment \nplan in order to ensure that Americans are on the road to real \nrecovery. Without access to treatment, the Toomey amendment alone would \nsimply lock persons suffering from addiction into a pharmacy, and they \nwould still be without a path out of addiction. Effective treatment has \nto be more than handing a pamphlet to somebody struggling with a \ncondition as powerful as addiction.\n\n  My amendment also aims to end the tide of overprescribing in the \nfirst place. It doubles the penalties for opioid manufacturers that \nprovide kickbacks to prescribers in order to boost their profits by \npromoting the unapproved use of these drugs at the expense of a \npatient's safety. The inappropriate practices of these companies have \nbeen well documented in recent years, and it is high time for real \naccountability when the opioid manufacturers go too far.\n  I will close by saying that at the Finance Committee hearing, which \nwas held last week, I asked the three panelists--one was a witness \nchosen by the distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, one was a witness \nI chose, and one was an individual that both of us thought would make \nan important contribution. The panel consisted of a pharmacist, a State \nassistant attorney general, and a child welfare and substance abuse \nexpert. I asked all of them one simple question, and that question was: \nDoes treatment and enforcement have to work in tandem to solve the \nopioid crisis? Each one of these witnesses--a witness chosen by \nChairman Hatch, a witness chosen by me, and an independent witness--\nanswered yes to my question. Prevention, treatment, and enforcement \nmust work in tandem, and to do that we have to adopt this amendment.\n  We ought to take action to improve policies in our government that \nwill actually solve the opioid crisis. I hope all of my colleagues will \nsupport my perfecting amendment to the Toomey amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of \namendment No. 3354. I filed this amendment with my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Capito, who has been a leader in our fight against \nopioid addiction. The opioid addiction problem in our country is \nsevere. It is growing, and it is not going to end unless Congress comes \ntogether to pass a law that targets the root causes of this epidemic. \nThe stakes are simply too high to ignore.\n  Last year alone, in communities all across our country, including \nmany in New York, 1.4 million more Americans started abusing opioids. \nEvery day, 44 more people are killed by an overdose. We have seen \nenough data to know that our opioid addiction problem is spiraling out \nof control. Opioid addiction is destroying too many lives in our \ncities, too many families in our rural communities, and too many young \nmen and women in our suburbs.\n  I wish to tell the story of one of my constituents whose name is Sean \nMurdick. Sean was a really special and gifted young man. He was \ncocaptain of his high school football team and had that rare ability to \nbring people together and connect with anyone. Sean didn't care if you \nwere on the football team or had a disability, he was always the first \none there to help you when you needed it.\n  After high school, Sean loved working with his hands, so he got a \ngood job as a construction worker. One day Sean broke his arm. Sean's \ndoctor gave him a prescription for oxycodone, a powerful opioid to mask \nhis pain. By the time his prescription ran out, Sean was already \naddicted. He couldn't shake the addiction no matter how hard he tried. \nHe started using heroin and tried to quit many times, but the system \nfailed. The system failed him nearly every step of the way, and last \nfall Sean overdosed and died.\n  I would like to tell you Sean's story from the perspective of his \nparents. My hometown paper, the Times Union, did an incredible story \nabout his life. I can imagine the pain they suffer because I have two \nyoung sons. The Murdicks\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nhad many questions but very few answers, and they have been lost in a \nfog of grief since their son's death 2 months ago.\n  The Times Union wrote:\n\n       They want to speak out in Sean's memory, to reclaim what \n     heroin stole from them in the hope that it might help other \n     parents struggling with a child's addiction.\n       ``Sean did not die in vain,'' his father said, choking back \n     tears.\n       ``We tried our best to save him. It wasn't enough,'' his \n     older brother said, his voice cracking. . . . His mother \n     walked over, embraced her son and spoke soothing words into \n     his ear. The father buried his head in his hands. It was a \n     tableau of sorrow.\n\n  We have seen this happen far too often. When their son spiraled down \ninto addiction--\n\n       His parents could see something was wrong with Sean. He \n     lost a lot of weight and seemed distant and fidgety. He \n     nodded off at the dinner table.\n       His father found a syringe in the bathroom and confronted \n     Sean.\n       ``Dad, I'm sick. I need help,'' he said. ``This is not me. \n     I don't want to be like this.''\n\n  The parents told their story to our paper. The paper says:\n\n       It was a revolving door of failure: detox, intensive \n     outpatient care, relapse. He did not qualify for the most \n     intensive and costliest level of care, inpatient residential \n     treatment. They denied him because he was not homicidal or \n     suicidal and had a stable home environment. ``It was a never-\n     ending battle with the insurance companies,'' his mother \n     said. ``They treated him like the scum of the Earth.''\n\n  Now imagine being a parent and going through this with your son--\ngoing from treatment center to treatment center.\n  When Sean finally died, he had the best care. He was in a treatment \ncenter. When he called his mother, he said:\n\n       ``Mom, I've gotta go. My steak's ready,'' he said. ``Love \n     you, mom.''\n\n  He went into the bathroom, and he overdosed.\n\n       Sean left his parents a final solace. Not long before he \n     died, he thanked them for their unconditional love and how \n     they supported him through a long road of misery.\n       ``You did everything right,'' he told them.\n\n  I don't know how a parent can hear those words and think they did \neverything right, but I can tell you as a Senator that the U.S. \nCongress is not doing everything right.\n  Too many parents are telling these stories about their children who \nhave died and too many patients are being prescribed opioids, such as \nPercocet, Vicodin, and OxyContin for acute pain. This medication is \nprescribed to patients for a broken wrist or when they have a wisdom \ntooth pulled--medication that they may need for only 2 or 3 days. Why \nin Heaven's name are they sent home with a dose of 30 oxycodone pills? \nWhat happens to those pills? Are they given to kids at a party? Are \nthey sold to addicts?\n  We know there is a huge issue with how prescriptions are being made, \nhow much medicine is being given to patients for this acute care, and \nright now there are no guidelines--no guidelines--given to doctors.\n  I have a bill to create that guideline. We need a guideline for the \nCDC. Our amendment is very simple. It would require the CDC to issue \nclear guidelines to our medical community for when it is appropriate to \nprescribe opioids instead of something nonaddictive, such as Extra \nStrength Tylenol.\n  Our amendment simply requires the CDC to issue these clear guidelines \nfor how much opioid medication our medical professionals can prescribe \nwithout putting a patient at high risk for addiction. These guidelines \nare already being done for chronic pain, so they should also do them \nfor acute pain.\n  We need to do something. As Members of Congress, we need to respond \nto the suffering of so many of our constituents. It is truly an \nepidemic, and it needs a response.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 \np.m. today, the Senate vote in relation to the following amendments in \nthe order listed: 3362, Feinstein; 3395, Wyden; 3367, Toomey; 3345, \nShaheen; that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the \namendments and that, where applicable, Senator Enzi or his designee be \nrecognized to offer a budget point of order against the respective \namendment and that the sponsor or their designee be recognized to make \na motion to waive; further, that all the amendments be subject to a 60-\naffirmative-vote threshold for adoption and that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided in the usual form prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                               Kari's Law\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a bipartisan \nbill that ensures all Americans can access 911 in emergencies.\n  In December of 2013, Kari Hunt was attacked in her Texas hotel room. \nAs this was unfolding, her 9-year-old daughter tried desperately to \ncall 911, but the call did not go through. Like millions of American \nchildren, Kari's brave daughter was taught to dial 911 for emergency \nassistance, but because they were in a hotel room, the phone required \nher to dial 9 followed by 911.\n  In any emergency, a few precious seconds can mean the difference \nbetween life and death. And although we cannot prevent tragic events \nfrom taking place, we do have the ability to make it easier to get \nhelp. That is why I have teamed up with Senators Amy Klobuchar, John \nCornyn, Ted Cruz, and Brian Schatz to put forward a new bill that could \nsave countless lives. Our legislation, named in honor of Kari Hunt, \nwould require that everyone has the ability to call 911 in an \nemergency. This problem isn't isolated to one hotel room or a \nparticular incident.\n  As of March 2014, consumers could not directly dial 911 in 44.5 \npercent of hotel franchises and 32 percent of independent hotels. Over \nthe past 2 years, the hotel industry and phone manufacturers have \nundertaken voluntary efforts to improve the problem, and I do commend \nthose efforts, but we need to do more. If one person cannot call 911 in \na life-or-death situation, that is one person too many.\n  The bill we have introduced, known as Kari's Law, would require \nmultiline telephone systems, such as those used in hotels and schools \nand office buildings, to have a default setting that enables people to \ndirectly call 911 without first dialing an access code such as 9 or 1. \nThe bill also requires that these phone systems be programmed to allow \na central location--such as the hotel front desk--to be notified if a \n911 call is made. Through our legislation, first responders can more \neasily locate people during an emergency. Then they face fewer barriers \nwhile this is unfolding.\n  Kari's Law has already received generous support from across the \ncountry. For example, in Nebraska, the bill is supported by the \nfirefighters associations in Omaha and Lincoln, the Buffalo County \nSheriff's Office, the city of Beatrice Fire and Rescue Department, \nCheyenne and Scotts Bluff County 911 representatives, and the chairman \nof the Scotts Bluff County Board of Commissioners. The bill is also \nsupported by the hotel industry and the American Hotel and Lodging \nAssociation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of FCC Commissioner Pai, \nwho has devoted time and resources to bring attention to this very \nimportant issue. Commissioner Pai traveled to Nebraska last June, and \nhe participated in a workshop on direct-dial 911 issues while at the \nUniversity of Nebraska in Lincoln. He has continued to encourage the \nindustry to work with him in an effort to find solutions to this \nimportant issue. The Nebraska Public Service Commission, which led the \nworkshop, has also been at the forefront of the discussion.\n  And finally, we would not be here discussing this bill without the \ntireless work of Kari's father, Hank Hunt. Hank has worked day in and \nday out to advocate for this legislation at both the State and the \nnational level. Hank has made it his mission to ensure that no other \nfamily will have to suffer through a similar tragedy. I paraphrase \nHank: It was the look on my granddaughter's face when we failed her. A \n9-year-old did what she was instructed to do by her parents, teachers, \nand adults. She was in a true, dire emergency, and she followed \ninstructions, but it didn't work.\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\n  I would call on all my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation. We owe it to Kari Hunt, her family, and the Americans who \nrely on their ability to call 911 for emergency help.\n\n\n                        Spoofing Prevention Act\n\n  Madam President, I also want to take a moment to speak about another \nbipartisan bill that is currently before the Senate. This legislation \nalso seeks to protect Americans by updating our telecommunications \nlaws. It would fix loopholes in our laws that are allowing scammers to \ntake advantage of innocent Americans through a practice known as caller \nID spoofing.\n  Caller ID spoofing allows predators to deliberately falsify their \nidentification and telephone numbers relayed through caller ID. The \nscammers frequently ask for personal information and for money. Often, \nsenior citizens and our veterans are the target of these predatory \npractices. Caller ID spoofing has become a major problem for Nebraskans \nand for law enforcement, which is why I am committed to eliminating \nthis practice.\n  In September 2013, USA Today highlighted the story of Marian Kerr \nfrom Hastings, NE. Ms. Kerr is an 83-year-old retired hospital nursing \nadministrator who fell victim to a spoofing scam. She received a call \nfrom individuals who claimed to work for the Federal Government, and \nthey asked for her bank account information. The scammers told her they \nwere Federal officials and already had her name, address, and her phone \nnumber. They used this information to trick Marian into providing her \nbank account number. Ms. Kerr had caller ID, but it displayed a number \nin Nevada, not Washington, DC, or Hastings, NE. She attempted to call \nback repeatedly, but she either received a busy signal or was sent to \nvoice mail. Ms. Kerr reported the incident to the police, but by then \nit was too late. Her money was gone, and there was nothing that law \nenforcement could do.\n  Last fall, the Omaha FBI issued a warning about the danger posed by \nscammers using the Bureau's identification to target Nebraskans. The \ncallers claimed to be offering a grant from the Federal Government, and \nthey proceeded to solicit credit card and banking information. This \npractice is happening across the country and it needs to stop. Whether \nit is hardworking Nebraskans like Ms. Kerr or veterans who bravely \nserved our country, no one is immune to this form of fraud.\n  That is why I was very pleased to join with Senator Nelson last month \nto introduce the bipartisan Spoofing Prevention Act. This bill would \namend the Truth in Caller ID Act. Currently, loopholes in this law are \nallowing scammers to manipulate caller ID information and to harass \nmillions of Americans.\n  While the Truth in Caller ID Act has helped to curb spoofing, the \ngrowth in new technologies has allowed scammers, especially those \noperating overseas, to continue this fraudulent practice. The Spoofing \nPrevention Act would crack down on spoofing by prohibiting caller ID \nspoofing on all voice calls, including those originating outside the \nUnited States, and all calls made using IP-enabled voice services. It \nwould also prohibit caller ID spoofing done via text messaging, which \nis now becoming a really common practice. Additionally, the bill \ndirects the GAO to look at what the FCC and the FTC have done to combat \nspoofing.\n  We must call for new solutions as technology continues to evolve, and \nI urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation so we \ncan ensure that our citizens are protected from fraud and abuse.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I would like you to recognize the \nassistant minority leader from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us is the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act. It is one of the few bills on which we find so much \nbipartisanship. It really is an issue that all of us understand back \nhome is a major problem, wherever home may be. In my State of Illinois, \nthere is no town too small and no suburb too wealthy to avoid the \nchallenge of this heroin crisis.\n  Here is what is happening. Over the last 10 years, we have seen the \npharmaceutical industry dramatically increase the number of painkiller \npills for sale. One classification of those opioids includes OxyContin, \nhydrocodone, and other names that are pretty familiar to us. It turns \nout that there have been so many of these pills produced that they have \nnow created an industry of their own--an illicit industry where people \nare buying and selling them to get high. When they reached a point \nwhere they can't find these pills or they are too expensive, they \nswitch, in the same category of narcotics, to heroin. Of course, heroin \ncan kill you if you have an overdose.\n  We now have more people dying from overdoses of heroin across the \nUnited States than people who are dying in traffic accidents. To give \nyou an idea of the volume of this challenge, I have been all across my \nState, from one end to the other, from Southern Illinois all the way up \nto Chicago and the suburbs and towns in between. There is hardly a \nsingle town that has been spared where some teenager wasn't found dead \nbecause of a heroin overdose. There are things we are doing to try to \nresolve this, but we are not doing enough and not doing it fast enough.\n  So the bill that is on the floor, the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act, is an attempt to find new ways for prevention, education, \nand treatment of substance abuse. There is an amendment offered by \nSenator Shaheen from New Hampshire. It is really a test. All of us can \nagree on the goals. Senator Shaheen says that is not enough. That is an \nempty promise unless you pay to achieve the goals. We have to put the \nmoney into substance abuse treatment. We have to put the money into \nefforts with law enforcement to reduce the likelihood of these drugs \ncoming into the United States. That is why I support her amendment.\n  I will offer another amendment too. What we are finding is that there \nare not enough treatment facilities for this huge growth in people who \nare addicted to heroin and other narcotics. There just aren't enough. \nSo my bill takes a look at Medicaid. That is the health insurance plan \nfor people in low-income categories. A few years ago, we changed this \nlaw and said you can't treat people for substance abuse if you have any \nmore than 16 beds in your facility--16. Can you imagine in the city of \nChicago what that means?\n  Well, I went to Haymarket, which is a wonderful operation started by \nMonsignor Ignatius McDermott decades ago, which treats people for \nalcoholism and substance abuse. They have empty beds now that can treat \npeople who are addicted to heroin and help them to break away from this \nhabit. But if they are under Medicaid, they can't offer these beds to \nthese individuals. So I have an amendment with Senator Angus King of \nMaine, and this increases the number of beds in each facility to 40. \nThis isn't a runaway number. It is a manageable number, and it is a \nrealistic number. If we are going to deal with heroin addiction, we \nhave to deal with it in an honest fashion.\n  Let me give an example of what I consider to be one of the more \neffective approaches. In Gloucester, MA, the chief of police decided to \ntry something new. They were having too many heroin overdose deaths, so \nhe made the decision and announced that if you came to his police \ndepartment or sheriff's office and announced your addiction, they \nwouldn't arrest you. They would put you into treatment. What happened \nwas a number of people came forward and went into treatment. It was a \ngood outcome for them and for the community.\n  I have a similar story from the town of Dixon in Illinois. They had \ntoo many scary instances where people were either close to a heroin \noverdose or actually passed away. They tried the same thing as \nGloucester, MA, and offered that if you came in and confessed your need \nfor help and treatment, they wouldn't arrest you. They would take you \ninto treatment. It worked. Over 20 local teenagers showed up because of \ntheir addiction and they were put into treatment.\n  Of course, the problem is there aren't enough treatment facilities. \nSo this amendment I have would expand the\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nopportunities for treatment, and we have to do that.\n  The good news about this, if there is a good part of this, is that we \nare finally dealing with addiction in reality. It is no longer viewed \njust as a moral failing or characterized as some omission of \nconscience. It is being viewed as a disease--a medical condition that \nshould and can be treated--and that is why we are making a step in the \nright direction.\n  We also--I think it bears repeating--we also changed the law in this \nChamber not that many years ago, a law which was brought to the floor \noriginally by Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Senator Pete \nDomenici of New Mexico, and that bill required that health insurance \npolicies in the United States, in the future, would cover mental health \ncounseling and substance abuse treatment. So, now, because that became \nthe law, the health insurance plans we buy cover our families for those \nneeds. Many families who never dreamed they would need substance abuse \ntreatment for their kids, thank goodness, can turn to their health \ninsurance plan for that kind of help. We have to protect that. Those \nwho talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act would be repealing \nthis very protection that families are using now for substance abuse \ntreatment. That isn't the answer. The answer is to have more treatment \nfacilities available so people can rid themselves of this addiction and \nget on with their lives.\n  I have met so many of these people in my roundtables, including law \nenforcement and doctors, but the ones I remember the most are the young \npeople addicted in high school who finally were able to break the \nhabit. They have a chance now for real life, but it is because there \nwas treatment there when they needed it.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this amendment. It will not come \nup today, but it will soon.\n  This is a good bill. I hope they will vote for the Shaheen amendment \nbecause it pays for the services we are promising. I don't want to end \nup making an empty promise to America as we face this heroin crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I thank the assistant minority leader \nfor those inspiring words, and I recognize the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n6 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me also join my colleague in agreeing \nwith the Senator from Illinois on his comments, and I, too, will join \nhim on voting in favor of the Shaheen amendment. It is important we not \nonly take on this question of opioid drug abuse but that we also make \nsure we fund the program. I thank him for his leadership.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of moments and join with many \nof my colleagues to talk about an issue of enormous importance on the \nconstitutional obligation to fulfill our duty in terms of reviewing \nwhomever the President of the United States nominates for the Supreme \nCourt. I wish to start, though, by saying a few words about Supreme \nCourt Justice Antonin Scalia and to offer my condolences to his family. \nWhether you agreed or disagreed with Judge Scalia's decisions--and \nmechanically I disagreed with many of them--he was a remarkable jurist \nand he was a remarkable individual. Over the last 10-plus years, I got \nto know him and his wife Maureen more in a social setting. He was warm, \nwitty, charming, brilliant, and he will be missed by all who agreed or \ndisagreed with him. My thoughts continue to be with Maureen and his \nfamily.\n  I rise, I think, almost in the mode of what I believe Justice Scalia \nwould have said as someone who was a strict constructionist and someone \nwho believed so firmly in the words of the Constitution. The words of \nthe Constitution are quite clear in article II, section 2, where it \nsays the President shall nominate Justices to the Supreme Court, and it \nis the responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent.\n  So my request to all colleagues in this body is simply let's do our \njob. It is not if the President will nominate, it is when the President \nwill nominate--and I hope he nominates soon--we should give that \nnominee their due consideration, a fair hearing, and then an up-or-down \nvote. The President has repeatedly voiced his strong commitment to \nnominating an eminently qualified replacement. That is his duty, and we \nmust do ours.\n  To those who suggest we should wait and let the American people \ndecide, the truth is, they already did. In 2012, the American people \nvoted to return President Obama to the White House for a second 4-year \nterm. That 4-year term doesn't end until January 20, 2017. I believe \nthere is ample time to vet a nominee and still wrap up this process \nthis spring.\n  Are we going to allow politics to totally overtake the work of this \nbody? Are we resigned to a complete and utter failure to govern until \nnext January?\n  I know the Presiding Officer and I both share a common background; \nthat is, a background in business. It is remarkable to me. No business \nin America--no business in the world--would operate under the \npresumption that because it is a Presidential year, that somehow we can \ndefault on all of our duties and simply kick over every issue until \nnext year. If we operated a business that way, we would be out of \nbusiness.\n  I believe it is absolutely essential that when the President--and I \nhope expeditiously--nominates an individual to the Supreme Court, that \nthis body do its job constitutionally: review that applicant, meet with \nthat applicant, hold hearings on that nominee, and then give that \nnominee the up-or-down vote the Constitution requires.\n  The remarkable thing is in a year where there is a lot of commentary \nabout what the public wants, I can at least tell my colleagues what the \npublic wants in Virginia. They want us to do our job.\n  I have received an overwhelming response from Virginians from one end \nof the Commonwealth to the other. They are expressing their opinion \nclearly about how the nomination process should move forward. A lot of \nVirginians are expressing their thoughts about what kind of nominee the \nSenate should confirm or not confirm, but what they are not saying is \nthat the U.S. Senate should punt on this constitutional responsibility. \nThey want us to do our job.\n  Over the past week, what I have found most striking is the awkward \npublic position held by so many people who otherwise claim to be \nadvocates of a strict reading of the words of the U.S. Constitution, \nwho somehow are saying--imagining something that doesn't appear in the \nConstitution, that a President or at least this President in his last \nyear--we are not going to follow the Constitution. We are going to kick \nit over until next year. I believe that is irresponsible. I believe it \nis inappropriate. I believe that does not follow the interpretation of \nthe Constitution and quite honestly I don't believe it would follow \nwhat Justice Scalia, who was a strict constitutionalist, would want to \nsee this body do.\n  Yet we saw some on the other side of the aisle, literally within \nhours of Justice Scalia's passing, saying: No vote. No proceeding. We \nare not going to do our job. We saw certain members of the leadership \nmeet yesterday with the President, again reaffirming their \nunwillingness to do their job.\n  This failure to act, this failure to do our constitutional duty, \ncould result--will result--in a vacancy on the Supreme Court stretching \nclose to a year, across two distinct terms of our highest Court. Over \nthat time, the Supreme Court could be deciding extremely important \ncases, and in many ways they are not going to function as the \nConstitution laid out.\n  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle often quote \nPresident Reagan. President Reagan himself said: ``Every day that \npasses with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's \nbusiness in that crucially important body.''\n  As a matter of fact, if we don't do our job, in effect, what we will \nbe doing is potentially shutting down another branch of government. \nRegardless of where we fall on the political spectrum, if there is one \nmessage we have\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nheard loud and clear over the last couple of years, the American people \ndo not abide shutting down various branches of government. The American \npeople deserve better than this.\n  I would again urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to step \nup and do their job. Let's give the President's Supreme Court nominee \nthe appropriate respect, hear them out, have those hearings, and give \nthe Senate a chance to exercise its will in a straight up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise for all Hoosiers who have been \ntouched by addiction or suffered the loss of a loved one as a result of \nopioid abuse, heroin use or other drug epidemics. I am here for every \nHoosier community that has been gripped by addiction.\n  I am here from Austin, IN, a small town of 4,200, much like many \nsmall towns in the Presiding Officer's home State of North Carolina, \nwhere more than 185 people tested positive for HIV, largely caused by \ninjection drug users who shared needles. I am here for Connersville, \nwhich was devastated by a heroin epidemic that saw 41 overdoses and 8 \ndeaths in a 3-month span. I am here for my hometown of Granger, which \nwas shaken last year when two teenage brothers, Nick and Jack Savage, \ndied in just one night from a prescription drug-related overdose. I am \nhere for Fort Wayne, Lafayette, and Terre Haute, and Indianapolis, and \nevery community across our State. No part of Indiana or our country is \nimmune from the pain of addiction and these drug epidemics.\n  By now many of us have heard the staggering statistics. One person in \nAmerica dies every 25 minutes from an opioid overdose, and overdose \ndeaths in the United States now outnumber fatal auto accidents.\n  Ultimately, this is about people. People like Mike Zoss of Tippecanoe \nCounty. Mike was the youngest of three boys. Mike was creative, enjoyed \nreading, and had a ton of friends. In high school he began \nexperimenting with prescription drugs. During his senior year, Mike's \nmom Donna got a call no parent wants to receive. Mike had overdosed at \na friend's house from a combination of LYRICA and methadone. He landed \nin intensive care and was in a coma for nearly 3 weeks. Miraculously, \nMike survived, but after struggling for nearly 3 more years with his \naddiction, Mike died from another overdose.\n  This scourge is about families and the heartbreak they endure and all \nthe people whose lives are shattered by addiction or even cut short. \nThat is why I have been working on this issue for over 2 years, \nlistening to Hoosiers, introducing bipartisan legislation, partnering \nwith Federal, State, and local officials, and bringing stakeholders \ntogether.\n  These families are why I support the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act. This bill provides States and local communities with the \ntools to prevent and treat drug addiction and to support individuals in \nrecovery. CARA strengthens prevention efforts, increases access to \ntreatment and recovery services, develops best prescribing practices, \nand expands access to naloxone, also known as Narcan, which can reverse \nthe effects of an opioid overdose. In addition, CARA expands disposal \nsites for unwanted and unused prescription drugs to keep them out of \nthe hands of children and teens, and CARA strengthens prescription drug \nmonitoring programs. This bill provides States and local communities \nwith the tools to prevent and treat drug addiction and to support \nindividuals in recovery.\n  CARA strengthens prevention efforts, increases access to treatment, \ndevelops best prescribing practices, and expands access to naloxone, as \nI said. Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. These \nare incredible steps that can make a huge change in what happens in the \nfuture of our country.\n  While this bipartisan bill includes many important provisions that \nhelp families in my home State of Indiana and across our entire \ncountry, it will take all of us working together to prevent and treat \naddiction. Prescribers and pharmacists, law enforcement and first \nresponders, parents and families, and officials at the Federal, State, \nand local levels all have a role to play.\n  I want to talk today about how CARA can best help in these efforts. \nFirst, I want to talk about prescribers. Our prescribers play a vital \nrole in addressing addiction because they are our partners in the fight \nto reduce the risk of prescription drug abuse. They have the knowledge \nand authority to help our patients, friends, neighbors, and family \nmembers understand both the benefits of prescription opioids and the \npotentially devastating dangers associated with opioid abuse.\n  Last year, we hosted a roundtable discussion in Indianapolis on \nprescribing practices with my colleague, Congresswoman Susan Brooks. By \nbringing together State officials, doctors, and pharmacists, all of \nwhom play key roles in curbing overprescribing, we can better engage \nhealth professionals in the fight against the opioid epidemic. We want \nto make sure doctors have the training, the tools, and the resources to \nprevent overprescribing and also to help them make the best possible \ndecisions about how to treat their patients.\n  Right now there is not one set of currently nationally accepted best \npractices that can help prescribers make the best informed decisions \nabout prescribing opioid drugs. Existing guidelines vary in the \nrecommendations that are made.\n  CARA would help. It includes a provision adopted from my bipartisan \nlegislation that I reintroduced last year with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire, which brings experts together \nto review, modify, and update, where necessary, best practices for pain \nmanagement and prescribing pain medication.\n  Second, I want to talk about our first responders and our law \nenforcement who are on the front line of this crisis. Frequently they \nare called to scenes where an individual has overdosed, and they are \nworking to find ways to address these drug epidemics. In Northwest \nIndiana, the Porter County sheriff's department is reaching out to \neducate families about the heroin crisis there with a video that \nincludes first-person accounts about how the epidemic has impacted the \nlocal community. In the northeast part of our State, over by the Ohio \nborder, the Fort Wayne Fire Department began using Narcan just last \nAugust to try to help save people who had overdosed. In the first 4 \ndays, they had to use it three different times--and many times since \nthen. In Central Indiana last year, Indianapolis EMS had administered \nnaloxone an astounding 1,227 times. We need to make the overdose \nreversal drug naloxone more readily available to first responders and \nlaw enforcement.\n  CARA includes a provision similar to one from my bill with Senator \nAyotte that provides grants to train law enforcement and other first \nresponders in the administration of naloxone to save lives. I have also \noffered an amendment that encourages first responder units receiving \nfunding through this program to use outreach coordinators to ensure \nthat every individual who receives naloxone also receives in-person \nfollowup. Indianapolis EMS recently began a similar outreach program \ndesigned to connect overdose victims who receive naloxone with the help \nthey need.\n  CARA assists law enforcement by expanding resources to identify and \ntreat individuals facing addiction in criminal justice centers. I hear \nfrequently from my friends--the police officers, sheriffs, judges, and \ncourt personnel throughout the Hoosier State--that more resources are \nsorely needed.\n  Third, I want to talk about families. There are countless personal \nstories across our State and almost every State about moms and dads, \nbrothers and sisters, wives and husbands, and grandparents who have \nbeen impacted by addiction. I want to share a couple of these stories.\n  Our young friend Aaron--Justin Phillips remembers her son Aaron, a \ntalented athlete who had dreams of playing football in college and the \nNFL. He was a starting quarterback on Lawrence North's varsity team. He \nwas smart and charming, with a generous heart.\n  It started for Aaron with a prescription pain medicine and then led \nto heroin. At the age of 20 years old, in October 2013, Aaron died of a \nheroin overdose. His mom said, ``We can't pretend it is not our kid \nbecause it very well may be our kid who is next.''\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\n  There are people like Michelle Standeford of Lebanon, IN, who lost \nher son and her nephew to addiction. Her nephew Greg died 3 years ago \nfrom a heroin overdose at the age of 21. Her son Troy, 33, died \nfollowing a long battle with addiction. His struggle began when he was \nprescribed opioids for the pain he was struggling with after a jet ski \naccident. This past Christmas, Michelle visited Troy, who was in South \nFlorida seeking treatment. She said he was in great spirits and eager \nto reunite with his family. A few weeks after Troy came back home to \nIndiana, he passed away. Think of this. He left behind parents, a wife, \nand two sons, 2 and 4 years old. These stories are way too common.\n  As Donna Zoss of Lafayette said, ``There are way too many kids dying, \nand as a community we need to do something.'' She wants to make sure \nother families learn from her experience before it is too late.\n  CARA would help families by raising awareness about opioid abuse and \nheroin abuse and expanding access to treatment. It includes a provision \nfrom our bipartisan bill with Senator Ayotte that establishes a \nnational drug awareness program. By helping families learn about the \nserious effects of opioid abuse and its connection to heroin, it can \nmake a difference.\n  CARA also would strengthen additional prevention efforts and increase \naccess to treatment and recovery services with the goal of helping more \npeople overcome addiction, including specific initiatives for women, \nyouth, and vets.\n  We are not doing enough, and the burden of addressing the opioid and \nheroin use epidemic has fallen heavily on our criminal justice system, \nwhich is clearly not equipped to treat all those struggling with \naddiction. That is why CARA is so important and why we need to pass \nthis critical legislation quickly.\n  We have an opportunity to work together--all of us--to pass a good \nbipartisan bill that helps confront opioid abuse, heroin abuse, and \nother drug epidemics. On the Federal level, it is our job to support \nand strengthen partnerships on the State and local levels to make sure \nevery town in every State is accounted for and can heal. CARA will do \njust that. It would be a significant step forward, although I think we \ncan all agree that it is just a first step.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3367\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise on the same topic that the Senator \nfrom Indiana was addressing very eloquently through the absolutely \nheart-wrenching stories he told of his constituents and their families. \nThese are stories we hear all across America. I hear them all across \nPennsylvania day in and day out.\n  Drug addiction is an enormous problem. It is devastating families and \ncommunities in our States. I share the view of the Senator from Indiana \nthat this legislation is very important. It takes a number of steps \nthat are very constructive. I congratulate Senator Whitehouse and \nSenator Portman for a very good piece of legislation that is going to \nhelp save lives. It is going to help save families and communities.\n  I have an amendment that I am going to address that is going to take \nanother step to help save lives, and I hope my colleagues will \noverwhelmingly support this because it is an epidemic the likes of \nwhich I don't know we have seen in a very long time.\n  Last October, I convened a field hearing of the Senate Finance \nSubcommittee on health care to learn more about this very epidemic of \nopioid addiction and heroin addiction and the overdoses that are \nresulting. We did it in Pittsburgh, and Senator Casey joined me. We \nreserved a very large auditorium, and we invited some of the leading \nlocal experts, doctors who were dealing with people who were suffering \nfrom addiction, law enforcement folks, recovering addicts. We had a \nstanding-room-only crowd in that room. Such was the intensity of the \nconcern of this issue and the breadth of it because we all know people \nwho are affected by this terrible scourge.\n  A couple of things I learned in the hearing that are important is \nthat we have to figure out how we can reduce some of the \noverprescribing of these narcotics--these prescription opioids--upon \nwhich people then become addicted. We also have to find ways to address \nthe diversion from prescriptions that are obtained through the \nconventional process, the black market, the streets, and the places \nwhere it feeds the addiction.\n  I think one of the overlooked elements of this problem has been the \nopioid epidemic that is affecting older folks, aging baby boomers, and \nsenior citizens who have become addicted to opioids for a variety of \nreasons.\n  The headlines have screamed about this. USA Today's headline said: \n``Many seniors Hooked On Prescription Drugs.'' The Wall Street Journal \nhad a headline recently: ``Aging Baby Boomers Bring Drug Habits Into \nMiddle Age.'' This came from a TV news channel: ``Senior citizens \ngetting hooked on painkillers.''\n  This is growing problem, and it doesn't know any demographic limits. \nIt affects senior citizens as well as young people. In fact, to give a \nsense of one of the, perhaps, contributing elements to this, in 2013 \nthere were 55 million opioid prescriptions written in America for \nAmericans over the age of 65. It is a stunning number. It is a 20-\npercent increase in just 5 years. We have not had a comparable increase \nin the number of senior citizens. It is a huge increase in the number \nof prescriptions per person. This is probably related to the fact that \nthe number of opioid-addicted seniors has itself tripled in the last \ndecade.\n  One of the problems has been identified by the Government \nAccountability Office. They estimate that in 1 year alone, 170,000 \nMedicare enrollees engaged in doctor shopping. That is the process by \nwhich beneficiaries go to multiple doctors to get multiple \nprescriptions for the same or similar powerful narcotics. They go to \nmultiple pharmacies to get them all filled, and they end up with these \ncommercial quantities of prescription drugs--vastly beyond anything \nthat any individual could need.\n  The GAO discovered that one beneficiary had visited 89 different \ndoctors in one year just to get prescription painkillers--89 doctors in \none year. That is almost 2 a week. Another beneficiary received \nprescriptions for 1,289 hydrocodone pills. That is almost like a 2-year \nsupply. It makes no sense. I could go on and on with cases in which \nfraud is being committed for the purpose of obtaining these \nprescriptions, which are then sold in the black market.\n  There is also a subset of Medicare beneficiaries who are innocently \ngetting duplicate opioid prescriptions because they are being treated \nby different doctors for different maladies. They have multiple \nillnesses. They get multiple prescriptions because in many cases there \nis nobody providing adequate oversight and coordination for their \ncare. So we have both, people who are intentionally and fraudulently \ngetting multiple prescriptions and then we have people who are \ninnocently getting it. So there is a way we can deal with this \ninappropriate prescription and diversion into the black market, and the \nadministration has asked us to do this.\n\n  This administration--the Obama administration--has asked Congress to \ngive them, in Medicare, the power to limit certain beneficiaries who \nare engaged in doctor shopping, exactly as people already can do so \nwithin Medicaid and with private health care providers. So the simple \nidea is to give Medicare the power when it identifies a beneficiary who \nis engaged in doctor shopping--getting multiple, duplicative \nprescriptions, either intentionally or unintentionally--to allow \nMedicare to lock that patient into one prescriber and one pharmacy. \nThat way you don't have this problem. That is what the administration \nhas asked us to do.\n  So I have introduced a bill that does exactly that. It is called the \nStopping Medication Abuse and Protecting Seniors Act. Senator Brown of \nOhio is the lead Democrat on this bill. I thank Senators Portman and \nMcCain also for their work. This is the amendment we are offering to \nthis bill to give Medicare the very same tool that Medicaid has, the \ntool that the administration is asking for, and the tool that all \nexperts say makes sense.\n  As I said, Medicaid and commercial users already do this, and we are \nnot inventing something new. What we are doing is simply applying a \nproven technique that limits overprescribing and\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\ndiversion, applying that to Medicare, where it does not exist today. No \none who legitimately needs a prescription for opioids will be denied \nthat. That would be completely unreasonable and inappropriate.\n  In fact, we exempt seniors in nursing homes, where the nursing home \ncan provide the monitoring, and seniors who are in hospice, and cancer \npatients who might need unusually large quantities are exempted. In \nfact, this legislation would actually lock in a small fraction of 1 \npercent of Medicare enrollees, but that is the fraction that is \nengaging in this very dangerous behavior.\n  First, I am grateful for the very broad bipartisan support that we \nhave. As a result, if we get this passed today--which I certainly hope \nwe will--we will help opioid-addicted seniors find treatment because \nthey will be notified when they come up on this list--when it is \ndiscovered that they are going to multiple doctors and multiple \npharmacies. It will stop the diversion of these powerful narcotics.\n  It will save taxpayer money because taxpayers reimburse for all of \nthese prescriptions, even those that are fraudulent. Maybe, most \nimportantly, it will reduce the availability of these opioids. We have \n25 Republican and Democratic cosponsors on the bill. We have the \nsupport of the National Governors Association. Nearly identical \nlanguage was already passed in the House. It was embedded in the 21st \nCentury Cures Act, where it passed overwhelmingly.\n  The President's budget has asked for this very mechanism repeatedly. \nThe CMS Acting Administrator was before our committee, and \nAdministrator Slavitt said this legislation ``makes every bit of sense \nin the world.'' The CDC Director is for it. The White House drug czar \nis for it. The Pew Charitable Trusts testified on behalf of our \nlegislation, and the Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing \nsupport it--not to mention many law enforcement groups and senior \ngroups, such as the Medicare Rights Center.\n  This is a tool that is overdue. We have this tool in private health \ncare insurance coverage. We have this tool in Medicaid. We just need to \nhave this tool in Medicare.\n  I wish to single out for a special thanks my coauthor Sherrod Brown. \nSenator Brown and his staff worked very hard and did a tremendous job. \nThey provided, in fact, very valuable feedback to make sure that all \nthe stakeholders were going to be treated fairly and specifically, that \nbeneficiary rights would be properly respected. That is a very \nimportant and very constructive contribution that Senator Brown made to \nthis legislation. He also helped to secure many endorsements from \noutside groups.\n  My fellow Pennsylvanian, Senator Casey, was very helpful and is \npassionate about this issue. He has seen firsthand the damage that is \nbeing done across Pennsylvania from opioid abuse. He is a cosponsor of \nthe legislation.\n  We had a very successful hearing in the Finance Committee. I thank \nSenator Hatch for having this very topic of how we can limit the \ndiversion through Medicare of these very dangerous narcotics, and I \nthought that was a very constructive hearing.\n  I also thank Senator Kaine, who, through his work on the Senate Aging \nCommittee, has been very active and extremely helpful on this issue.\n  Again, this is an amendment that has broad, bipartisan support. It \nhas been vetted by the stakeholders. It has been vetted by and \nrequested by the administration. It is endorsed by numerous health care \nand law enforcement groups. The reason it has such broad support is \nbecause it will save lives, it will protect seniors from opioid \noverprescriptions, it will stop fraud, and it will dramatically reduce \npill diversion. So to vote no on this would be to allow the continued \nflooding of very dangerous prescription opioids onto the black market, \nand I can't think of any reason we would want to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Toomey-Brown-Portman-\nKaine amendment. Let's get this adopted and then let's pass this \nunderlying bill, which is very, very constructive as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as one of the authors of the bill \nbefore us on the floor now, I wish to say that I appreciate and welcome \nthe Senator's amendment, and I appreciate the bipartisan way in which \nit was achieved, with Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, as well as with the \nother cosponsors of the bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor back so that we may hear from another \ncoauthor of this legislation who was with us through the long and \narduous process of preparing this bill, running the seminars, putting \ntogether the advisory committee, and crafting the legislation.\n  I yield for the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I very much thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for the work that we were able to do together on this important \nlegislation, for his leadership, and, really, his passion for this \nissue that is devastating my State--the heroin and opioid epidemic that \nis facing all of us. I thank him for a very thoughtful approach and \nbringing people together around this. I am so pleased we are debating \nthis on the Senate floor today.\n\n\nHonoring Officer Ashley Guindon and Lieutenant James ``Jimmy'' Geraghty\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today with great sadness to \ndiscuss and to honor the lives of two of our outstanding law \nenforcement officers from New Hampshire who were taken from us far too \nsoon. One is New Hampshire State Police Lieutenant Jimmy Geraghty, a \nU.S. Army veteran and outstanding public servant. Another is Prince \nWilliam County Officer Ashley Guindon of Merrimack, NH.\n  Ashley was a Merrimack, NH, native and a Marine Corps veteran who was \nkilled in the line of duty in Virginia 1 day after being sworn in as a \npolice officer to serve in the Prince William County Police Department.\n  These individuals represent the very best of law enforcement. It is \nwith such a heavy heart that I pause to remember Ashley Guindon, an \nincredible young woman whose life was tragically cut short. Ashley was \nkilled in the line of duty last week, tragically, on her first day as a \npolice officer with the Prince William County Police Department in \nVirginia.\n  Ashley could not have known her fate when she responded to an \nemergency call, but she responded to the call with the same sense of \nduty and resolve that all of our faithful law enforcement officers do \nevery single day because they don't know at that next stop, at that \nnext house that they respond to help someone in need, what they are \ngoing to be confronted with.\n  Ashley's death is a terrible, unthinkable tragedy and serves as a \nsomber reminder of the tremendous sacrifices that our law enforcement \nofficers make every single day by putting their lives on the line to \nkeep us safe.\n  My heart breaks for Officer Guindon's mother Sharon, for her family, \nfor her friends, and for the public safety community, as they mourn the \nloss of this tremendous young woman whose life ended far, far too soon. \nI will keep them in my thoughts and prayers as I know everyone in this \nChamber will.\n  But Officer Guindon should not be remembered because of the \ncircumstances of her death. Rather, she should be remembered for her \ntremendous life of service to her Nation, to the people whose community \nshe worked to keep safe, and for the sacrifices that she has made and \nher family has made on behalf of all of us.\n  Officer Guindon demonstrated an incredible commitment to her country \nin so many ways. Following her graduation from Merrimack High School in \n2005, she joined the Marine Corps. In doing so, she was honoring the \nlife of her father and the service of her father, who deployed to Iraq \nas a member of the New Hampshire Air National Guard. So she comes from \na family of service. Her father lost his life after returning home from \nserving in Iraq, and Officer Guindon felt that she could honor his \nmemory by joining the armed services herself. So she joined and became \na marine.\n  In her high school yearbook she wrote:\n\n       As I take flight it only makes me closer to u daddy. Mom, \n     thanks for everything it'll be a long road but we can manage \n     and it will only make u stronger.\n\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\n\n  Underneath her picture in her high school yearbook, the caption read: \n``live for something rather than die for nothing.''\n  Think about that: ``live for something rather than die for nothing.''\n  Well, absolutely, Officer Guindon did live for something. She lived \nfor our country in her service as a marine. She lived for members of \nher community, giving of herself and making the ultimate sacrifice to \nkeep others in her community safe. She lived with such honor and \ndistinction, and she answered the call to duty.\n  Officer Guindon was taken from us far too soon. But by working to \nensure that we honor her service, her heroism, her commitment, and the \nsacrifice she and all law enforcement officers make on our behalf every \nsingle day, we can ensure that her inspiring legacy of dedication to \nothers, of service to her country and to her community will never be \nforgotten. We will never forget her service or her sacrifice. We will \ncontinue to honor her and her family for what they have done in service \nto our Nation every single day.\n  I also wish to take a moment to honor another law enforcement \nofficer, someone with whom I had the privilege of working personally \nwhen I served as attorney general of our State, someone whom I probably \ncalled a friend, and who has also been taken from us far too soon.\n  I honor Lieutenant James ``Jimmy'' Geraghty, who passed away recently \nfollowing a courageous battle with cancer. I join his family, his \nfriends, and the law enforcement community in New Hampshire who mourn \nhis death. I am speaking about someone who touched so many people in \nour State, who really lived a life of service, a life of heroism, a \nlife of integrity. I honor his service, his integrity, and his \ndedication to excellence.\n  He was a member of the New Hampshire State Police for 24 years and \nrose to the rank of commander of the New Hampshire State Police Major \nCrimes Unit. The New Hampshire State Police Major Crimes Unit is the \nunit that handles the most difficult cases in our State--murder cases, \nvery difficult cases. It is a unit where you are called upon at every \nhour of the day in the most difficult of circumstances.\n  Lieutenant Geraghty handled some of the most troubling cases and the \nmost horrific cases you can imagine as a law enforcement officer. He \nhandled them with such incredible dedication, compassion, and \ncommitment, and he did his job so well.\n  In the most high-profile case of his career, Lieutenant Geraghty led \nthe investigation into the brutal 2009 Mount Vernon homicide--a \nhorrific, horrific case. It was a complex and extremely time-consuming \ninvestigation that focused on multiple juvenile defendants.\n  Because of the thoroughness, professionalism, and dedication brought \nto the case by Lieutenant Geraghty and the major crimes unit, the \nprosecution was able to pursue the successful conviction of all the \ndefendants involved.\n  For their work on the 2009 Mount Vernon case, Lieutenant Geraghty and \nthe major crimes unit were presented with the New Hampshire \nCongressional Law Enforcement Award for unit citations.\n  I had the privilege of being there when Lieutenant Geraghty received \nthat award, when he was there with his family. Really, the incredible \nwork that he did on that case made such a difference in bringing to \njustice defendants who committed horrific, horrific crimes and in \nkeeping New Hampshire safe.\n  Lieutenant Geraghty will also be remembered for his entire \noutstanding career of service to both New Hampshire and the Nation.\n  Lieutenant Geraghty also served very honorably in the U.S. Army for 5 \nyears, holding posts at Fort Benning in Georgia, Fort Polk in \nLouisiana, and at Fort Richardson in Arkansas.\n  He also served overseas by participating in the REFORGER exercise in \nGermany. He achieved the rank of sergeant, E-5, during his career with \nthe U.S. Army and received an honorable discharge. But his service did \nnot end there. After serving in the armed services, he then returned \nhome and embarked on his career in law enforcement, first serving as a \npolice officer in the Hudson Police Department, after which he was \naccepted as a trooper in the New Hampshire State police.\n  During his time with the New Hampshire State police, Lieutenant \nGeraghty spent 8\\1/2\\ years with the Narcotics and Investigations Unit, \nand he did a phenomenal job there investigating a variety of cases, \nfrom street-level buys to multistate trafficking organizations.\n  While serving in the Narcotics and Investigations Unit, Lieutenant \nGeraghty was assigned to the HIDTA--high-intensity drug trafficking \narea--for 2\\1/2\\ years, so he understood and worked hard on the issues \nwe are trying to address on the Senate floor today regarding heroin and \nopioid addiction and so many other illegal substances as he fought to \nkeep them off our streets. Lieutenant Geraghty's natural talent for \nleadership and keen ability to work with others were critical in the \nrole he played in HIDTA. During his time with HIDTA, he received \nseveral awards and recognitions for his dedication and commitment to \nexcellence.\n  He was promoted to the rank of sergeant in May of 2006, and from \nthere he was assigned to the Major Crime Unit as a detective sergeant \nin February of 2008. In 2010 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant \nwithin his unit, assuming the commanding officer's position--a post in \nwhich he served until he became ill last year. And he served with such \ndistinction.\n  I have many friends at the attorney general's office who worked with \nthe Major Crime Unit and with whom I have spoken--the chief of the \ncriminal bureau unit and with other prosecutors--and they speak of Jim \nGeraghty's service with such glowing reviews, with such incredible \ncompassion, and they speak of the incredible hard work he put in. He \nrepresented the very best of our law enforcement officers.\n  I wanted to talk about his career today because it was important for \nme to mention his professional accolades, and there are many, because \nhe was such a humble man and he never liked to talk about all of his \naccomplishments. He liked to focus on something I want to make sure we \nremember about Jim Geraghty: He lived by the motto ``family first,'' \nwhich was incredibly apparent to anyone who knew him. He was married to \nhis wife Valerie for 30 years. Together they had four wonderful \nchildren. They are an amazing family, son Jimmy and daughters Colleen, \nKatie, and Erin.\n  I want to offer my thoughts and prayers to Valerie, to Jimmy, to \nColleen, and to Katie and Erin. You are an incredible family, and your \nhusband and father will never be forgotten. What an incredible person \nhe was. He impacted the lives of so many people with the service he \ngave to his State.\n  It has been said that although Geraghty had an exceptional law \nenforcement career, he considered his family his greatest adventure. In \na 2015 letter, his fellow local law enforcement officers described him \nas a ``gallant public servant who has spent most of his life serving \nothers.'' Others said of him that ``he [was] truly a consummate team \nplayer who demonstrated the true meaning of a quiet professional.'' \nAnother individual said that ``he [was] humble, dedicated, and \nresilient with any duties and/or responsibilities [he was] faced \nwith.'' And, lastly, ``His remarkable and unblemished career within law \nenforcement is a true testament and shining example of what we all wish \nto aspire to.'' This is how the officers who served with him, the \ntroopers who served with him, described Lieutenant Jim Geraghty. He \nwill be deeply missed.\n  I am honored to recognize Lieutenant Jim Geraghty and to honor his \ntremendous contributions as the commander of the State Major Crime Unit \nand to say what an amazing family man and great human being. He was \nsomeone who lived his life with great integrity. He was truly someone \nwe would all want to emulate in living our lives.\n  Again, I offer my prayers to his family. They are an incredible \nfamily as well, and I hope they know we will continue to stand with \nthem in their most difficult days ahead.\n  So today I wish to say about both Officer Ashley Guindon and \nLieutenant Jim Geraghty that they were incredible law enforcement \nofficers who gave so much to New Hampshire, to our country, and that \nthey really represented the very best in what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SCOTT). The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n               Return from Space of Commander Scott Kelly\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to welcome a national hero back to \nplanet Earth--CDR Scott Kelley. After spending 340 days in space on his \nmost recent visit to the International Space Station, Commander Kelley \nhas smashed the previous U.S. record in space flight and for most of \nthe total time spent in space as well. But Commander Kelley's \naccomplishment, while notable in its own right, is serving a greater \npurpose. NASA is preparing to undertake one of the greatest \ntechnological challenges in human history--a voyage to the planet Mars. \nDepending on the alignment of the planets, Mars is anywhere from 35 \nmillion miles to an astounding 250 million miles from Earth. It is all \naccording to the alignment of the planets.\n  If you want to put that into perspective, Mr. President, the distance \nfrom you and me reflecting the 238,000 miles from Earth to the Moon, \nwhich is as far as we have gone and is a long way--that is the farthest \nwe have ever been--if that distance from the Earth to the Moon were \nrepresented by the distance from you to me, then the distance to Mars \nfrom right where this Senator is standing would be way out to the edge \nof the District of Columbia and Maryland.\n  Commander Kelley's mission is a milestone on this journey to Mars. \nThe International Space Station--our football-sized laboratory orbiting \nin space, as large as a football field from one goalpost to the other--\nis our test bed for exploration. Indeed, Commander Kelley spent those \n340 days at the International Space Station.\n  Now, as we venture out, traveling those vast distances between Earth \nand Mars, it is going to mean that humans are going to spend more time \nin space than ever before, so Commander Kelley's yearlong stay aboard \nthe station is an important validation of our ability to live and work \nin space for the long periods of time someone would be in zero-g.\n  But there is another very interesting aspect to his mission. Scott \nKelley has an identical twin, his brother Mark. Retired Navy CAPT Mark \nKelley, also an astronaut, remained on Earth while his brother was in \nspace, and now he is a baseline to compare the changes in the body and \nthe psychological effects to his brother Scott. This comparison is \ngoing to provide important insights into the effects of space flight on \nthe human body and perhaps even effects on the Human Genome itself. The \nmore we learn about how the human body changes in space, the better off \nwe are because we can prepare for the longer and longer voyages in \nspace. But we also gain insights into the fundamental working of the \nhuman body that we may never have learned confined to Earth's gravity. \nAnd who knows where these discoveries are going to lead--perhaps to new \ncures and therapies for afflictions folks suffer here on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  The space station where Commander Kelley stayed for almost a year is \na powerful tool for science and for discovery and for exploration. That \nis why at the end of last year we extended the authorization of the \nspace station all the way until at least through the year 2024. It is \nalso why I am so excited about the crewed flights from U.S. soil to the \nspace station resuming next year. Next year, Americans on American \nrockets will go to and from low-Earth orbit. Once we have the Dragon on \nthe SpaceX or the Starliner on the Atlas V, those crewed capsules are \ngoing to make regular trips to and from the space station. But we \nshould also then be able to expand the space station crew, because of \nthat regular visitation, from six to seven doing their research \nprojects on board the station. That means a lot more discoveries.\n  Some people may not appreciate how difficult it is to spend a year in \nspace, but I can tell you it is not only an amazing experience, but it \nis tough on your body. The body experiences muscle atrophy in zero-g \nand also bone loss. This is why astronauts have to be in peak physical \ncondition and also try to continue that as they are out in space for \nlong durations. And spending a year away from loved ones, of course, is \nno easy task. This demonstrates the strength and the courage Scott \nKelley has shown.\n  So I want the Senate to recognize CDR Scott Kelley for this \naccomplishment. It is going to take him some days to readapt to the \nEarth's gravitational pull. I commend him for the contributions to \nspace exploration and thank him for the sacrifices he has made and the \nsacrifices his family has made over the last year.\n  Welcome home, Commander, and thank you for offering to be a part of \nthis great adventure we call space exploration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, prescription drug abuse is the fastest \ngrowing problem in the country. It is a problem the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention classifies as an epidemic.\n  The availability of prescription painkillers is a leading factor in \nthe increase of opioid abuse. Since 1999, opioid abuse overdose deaths \nhave quadrupled nationwide.\n  Unfortunately, my home State of Arkansas is not immune to the \nproblem. CDC data shows that it is one of 12 States with more \npainkiller prescriptions than people--I repeat, one of 12 States with \nmore painkiller prescriptions than people.\n  Benton, AR, police chief Kirk Lane has seen the impact in his \ncommunity. During a recent visit to my office, he said: ``A lot of \npeople become addicted very innocently and can't find a way back.''\n  Placing prescription drugs in the medicine cabinet for safekeeping is \nno longer the best option because 70 percent of Americans misusing \npainkillers are getting them from friends and family.\n  Arkansas has implemented measures to combat this problem by \ndecreasing the availability of prescription drugs and properly \ndisposing expired and unneeded medication through the Arkansas Take \nBack Program. This is an important step that has resulted in the \nremoval of more than 72 tons of unneeded medication from homes in the \nState.\n  Congress has taken action to fight this epidemic. As a member of the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have pushed the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to reform its culture of prescription. Nationwide, \npharmacies have a system in place to prevent overfilling prescriptions. \nIt is time for VA to adopt a similar system.\n  I pressured the DEA--the Drug Enforcement Administration--to reform \nits policy to allow clinics and pharmacies to serve as dropoff sites \nfor the collection of unused or unwanted prescription drugs.\n  Last year, we passed legislation to improve the prevention and \ntreatment of opioid abuse by pregnant women and care for newborns \naffected by this abuse. That bill was signed into law.\n  Congress approved more than $400 million in funding to address the \nopioid epidemic this fiscal year. That is an increase of more than $100 \nmillion from the previous year. Calls for additional funds for this \nlegislation are premature. We need to see the progress and results made \nwith the current finding.\n  We must continue our commitment to the fighting of this epidemic and \nproviding our communities with the tools they need to improve response \nto addiction and promote treatment and recovery. That is why we need to \npass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  This bill can help give communities the ability to combat the growing \nopioid epidemic in Arkansas and across the country by expanding \nprevention efforts, supporting law enforcement, combating overdoses, \nand expanding access to treatment.\n  I have heard from many Arkansans who support this bill. It has the \nsupport of a wide range of organizations that represent law enforcement \nofficials, drug treatment providers, and health care professionals. \nThis speaks to the comprehensive approach we are taking to fight this \nepidemic.\n  It also authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to veterans \ntreatment courts. These courts are critical in helping our veterans \nbreak the cycle of addiction and turning their lives around.\n  Prescription drug abuse is a widespread problem that impacts all ages\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nand populations of Americans. I am committed to providing Arkansas \ncommunities the resources they need to fight this epidemic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3345\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleague from Arkansas about the challenges of the heroin and opioid \nepidemic. I think it is really a pandemic that we are facing in too \nmany States across this country. Certainly it is a huge issue in New \nHampshire, my home State, where we have the highest percentage of \ndeaths from overdoses of any State in the country.\n  In a few minutes, we are going to be voting on the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, which is an excellent piece of legislation, \nsponsored by my colleagues Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island and Amy \nKlobuchar from Minnesota, as well as my colleague from New Hampshire, \nSenator Ayotte, and Senator Portman.\n  We are also going to be voting on a number of amendments, including \nan amendment that I have proposed, which is emergency supplemental \nfunding to make sure that the changes we are making as a result of the \nCARA legislation actually get the resources that need to be provided in \norder to make those changes work.\n  In 2014, more than 47,000 Americans died from lethal drug overdoses. \nEach day, 120 Americans die from drug overdoses in New Hampshire. We \nare losing more than a person a day from drug overdoses--three times as \nmany people as we lost last year in automobile accidents. These are \nnumbers we have been using a lot on the floor of the Senate in the last \ncouple of days, but I think they are numbers that we need to continue \nrepeating and repeating because losing 47,000 Americans from drug \noverdoses is not acceptable.\n  Everywhere I go in New Hampshire, I am told one thing consistently by \ndrug treatment professionals and by law enforcement, and that is, they \nneed more resources and they need them now. Health workers are being \noverwhelmed. Nationwide, nearly 9 out of 10 people with substance use \ndisorders don't receive treatment. They are being turned away. They are \nbeing denied treatment because of a chronic lack of resources.\n  The amendment Senator Whitehouse and I have proposed addresses this \nproblem. It provides $300 million in emergency funding for the \nSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Program. This is \nfunding that will save lives in our States of New Hampshire, Rhode \nIsland, Arkansas, and in the Presiding Officer's home State of South \nCarolina. This is funding that will save lives in each of our States.\n  Not only are health workers being overwhelmed, but law enforcement \nofficials are also being overwhelmed. We need an infusion of new \nfunding to mobilize additional efforts to stop opioid traffickers and \ndrug dealers.\n  This emergency supplemental amendment would allocate $230 million to \nthe Byrne JAG Program to directly combat the opioid crisis. These are \nefforts that will keep drugs off the streets.\n  In total, the Shaheen-Whitehouse amendment appropriates $600 million \nin emergency funding that will be immediately available to States and \nthose working on the frontlines to address this crisis. I think that is \nwhy the National Governors Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, \nthe American Public Health Association, the American Society of \nAddiction Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Management, the \nAmerican College of Physicians, the National Association of State \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, and so many other groups support this \namendment. Again, the critical point here is that this amendment funds \nkey provisions of the CARA bill.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is a good bill. It is \nexcellent work that so many people have been involved in. The sponsors \ndid great work in writing the legislation. I support it. I am a \ncosponsor. But it is an authorization bill that does not provide \nfunding. So if we support making the changes in law that are included \nin the CARA bill, we should also support providing emergency funding to \nthose same programs.\n  To all my colleagues in this body, we know that doing the same thing \nis not working. Every year more and more people are dying from drug \nuse. Congress needs to rise to this challenge, just as it has in so \nmany previous public health emergencies, because, make no mistake about \nit, this is a public health emergency, and we have a history of \nproviding supplemental funding to address public health emergencies. In \n2009, Congress appropriated $2 billion in emergency funding to fight \nswine flu--a bill that passed the Senate 91 to 5. Many of us who voted \nfor that are still in this body. Just last year, Congress approved $5.4 \nbillion to combat the Ebola outbreak--an outbreak that killed just one \nperson in the United States. Compare that to the 47,000 people we lost \nin 2014 to drug overdoses. Surely--surely Congress can come together \nnow to fight this raging epidemic that is right here at home.\n  We can't avert our eyes from the 47,000 Americans who are killed by \nlethal overdoses each year. We can't accept that 9 out of 10 Americans \nwith substance use disorders don't get treatment. We can't ignore the \nfact that law enforcement officers in communities across this country \nare overwhelmed by aggressive drug traffickers and a rising tide of \nopioid-related crimes. The $600 million emergency funding in the \namendment I am proposing will help stem the tide. It will make a \npowerful difference in communities all across America.\n  CARA is important legislation. I intend to vote for it. I hope this \nbody will pass it. But I urge my colleagues to also support the \namendment that makes sure we have the urgent emergency funding to ramp \nup this fight in the months immediately ahead. Passing CARA without any \nfunding is like offering a life preserver to people who are drowning \nand not putting air in that life preserver. This is a nationwide \ncrisis. It is way past time we mobilized a nationwide response that is \nequal to the challenge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I know we have a vote coming. I ask \nunanimous consent to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss why I believe the \nSenate should not hold hearings or schedule a vote on any Supreme Court \nnominee offered by President Obama until the American people choose our \nnext President this November.\n  The American people are reacting to our global security and debt \ncrises when they go to the polls, and this upcoming election will not \nonly determine the direction of our country, but it also serves as a \nreferendum on the Presidency, Congress, and now the Supreme Court \nbalance.\n  The last 7 years have shown that this President has sought to exceed \nthe constitutional bounds of the Executive office by assuming powers \nthat were delegated to this body. For instance, in January of 2013 the \nPresident attempted to recess-appoint nominees to the National Labor \nRelations Board in direct violation of the Senate's will. Of course, \nthe Supreme Court later intervened and struck down those appointments. \nAs well, my colleagues across the aisle have repeatedly shown a \nwillingness to aid this administration in making unprecedented power \ngrabs, including employing the nuclear option for judicial nominees. \nThe American people were outraged at these events, as was I.\n  So while I acknowledge the President's position on insisting that the \nSenate consider a nominee, it is vital that the people get their say on \nthis lifetime appointment. It is the role of the Senate to rise above \ncurrent political theater. It is about upholding principle and not \nabout the individual. The Senate simply should not consider a nominee \nat this time and let the people have their say.\n  I should also point out that my position and the position of many of \nmy colleagues is not a novel idea. For instance, it was then-Senator \nObama who filibustered Justice Alito's nomination in 2006. It was then-\nSenator Biden who in 1992 preemptively said that President George H.W. \nBush should avoid a Supreme Court nomination until after that year's \nelection. As chairman of\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\nthe Senate's Judiciary Committee, then-Senator Biden also made the same \npoint we are today when he came to the floor of the Senate and made \nthis quote: ``It is my view that if a Supreme Court justice resigns \ntomorrow or within the next several weeks, or resigns at the end of the \nsummer, President Bush should consider following the practice of a \nmajority of his predecessors and not--and not--name a nominee until \nafter the November election is completed.''\n  The balance of the Supreme Court is in serious jeopardy. We must \nensure that balance remains as a check against efforts by government to \nbypass the will of the people.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I stand with Chairman \nGrassley and other members in saying we will not consider a nominee to \nthe Supreme Court before the next President is sworn into office. We \nare already in the midst of a political campaign season, so any nominee \nwill be seen through the lens of partisan politics. It is disingenuous \nfor the minority party to say otherwise. And this is to the point that \nthen-Senator Biden was speaking in 1992.\n  As we said in our letter last week, we intend to exercise the \nconstitutional power granted to the Senate under article II, section 2. \nWhile the President shall nominate judges to the Supreme Court, the \npower to grant or withhold consent of such nominees rests solely with \nthis body.\n  At a time when the stakes are so high, the American people deserve \nthe opportunity to engage in a full and robust debate over the type of \njurist they wish to decide some of the most critical issues of our time \nand for the next generation. Not since 1932 has the Senate confirmed a \nSupreme Court nominee in a Presidential election year to a vacancy \narising in that year--not since 1932.\n  It is necessary to go even further back, to 1888, to find an election \nyear nominee who was both nominated and confirmed under divided \ngovernment, as we have now. Today, the American people are presented \nwith an exceedingly rare opportunity to decide the direction the Court \nwill take over the next generation. The people should have this \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3362\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3362, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words in support \nof amendment No. 3362, which Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and \nI, with Senators Cantwell and Ayotte, have cosponsored.\n  This bill has passed the Senate by unanimous consent three times. It \nensures that international drug traffickers can be prosecuted when \nthere is reasonable cause to believe that their illegal drugs will be \ntrafficked into our country. It also better enables the prosecution of \nmanufacturers and distributors of listed precursor chemicals who know \nor intend that these chemicals will be used to manufacture illicit \ndrugs destined for the United States.\n  Finally, it makes a technical fix to the Counterfeit Drug Penalty \nenhancement Act of 2012 at the request of the Justice Department.\n  I would like to thank Senators Grassley, Ayotte, and Cantwell for \ncosponsoring this amendment. I hope my colleagues will pass it this \ntime with a vote, since it has been done by unanimous consent three \ntimes in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak in strong support of \namendment No. 3362, offered by Senator Feinstein and me, the \nTransnational Drug Trafficking Act. This is a bill that she and I have \nworked on for many years.\n  One of the many reasons for the ongoing heroin epidemic in this \ncountry is the increase in heroin supply on the streets of the United \nStates.\n  Mexican cartels are aggressively expanding into new territory here. \nAnd they are flooding our communities with cheap, pure heroin. Indeed, \nheroin seizures at the border have more than doubled since 2010. The \nU.S. Government estimates that Mexican heroin production jumped an \nincredible 62 percent from 2013 to 2014 alone.\n  And the reality is that it isn't just heroin coming over the border. \nBetween 2009 and 2014, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported a \n300 percent increase in methamphetamine seizures on the southwest \nborder as well.\n  This bill is a natural complement to CARA. We can't arrest our way \nout of this heroin epidemic. We can try to reduce the heroin supply on \nour streets by making it easier to target these cartels for \nprosecution.\n  This is in part why Senator Feinstein and I introduced this \nlegislation. Our bill would make it easier for the Department of \nJustice to prosecute cartels who harm our communities from abroad by \ntrafficking heroin, other drugs, and precursor chemicals for ultimate \ndelivery here.\n  If this amendment is adopted, prosecutors would need to prove only \nthat an international drug trafficker had reasonable cause to believe \nthat the illegal drugs or chemicals he manufactured or distributed \nwould be unlawfully imported into the United States, as opposed to \nknowing or specifically intending that result.\n  This amendment passed the Senate by unanimous consent in October. It \nalso passed the Senate unanimously the past two Congresses.\n  But the House still hasn't taken it up. So I ask my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment so we can send it to the House again, this time \nalong with CARA.\n  We need to attack the problem of opioid addiction from every angle, \nand this amendment should be part of a comprehensive approach.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nfollowing this first vote in the series be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3395, offered by \nthe Senator from Oregon Mr. Wyden.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment keeps the Toomey amendment \non enforcement completely intact and makes two critical improvements. \nIt adds prevention and treatment.\n  Colleagues, this is what the Republican witness in the Finance \nCommittee said is needed. It is what the Democratic witness in the \nFinance Committee said is needed. We need more prevention, better \ntreatment, and tougher enforcement to work in tandem. The Toomey \namendment is about enforcement, but we also need prevention and \ntreatment. If somebody is addicted to opioids, they need a real path \nout of addiction. This amendment ensures people who need help are \nconnected to meaningful treatment choices to better manage their pain \nand limit excessive prescriptions.\n  My amendment also aims to end the tide of overprescribing in the \nfirst place. It does that by doubling the penalties for manufacturers \nthat provide kickbacks to prescribers in order to boost their profits.\n  I offer this with my colleagues Senator Schumer and Senator Murray. I \nvery much hope we can get this amendment adopted. If we can have a \nbipartisan effort in the Senate that ensures there is tougher \nenforcement but also better treatment and better prevention to do that \nwe have to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the pending amendment, No. 3395, offered by \nSenators Wyden and Schumer, would establish a new demonstration program \nwithin Medicare Part D to coordinate the treatment of opioid addiction. \nThe proposal would also increase the penalties on drugmakers.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the amendment would \nincrease direct spending over both the 2016 through 2020 and the 2016 \nthrough 2025 periods. If the amendment were adopted, then the Judiciary \nCommittee would exceed its spending allocation over both of these time \nperiods. As a consequence of the new spending proposed, the Wyden-\nSchumer amendment is a violation of section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  As I said before, we all agree that the heroin and opioid abuse \nepidemic is real and has to be addressed, but I believe we ought to \naddress the problem living within the confines of the budget we \npreviously agreed to just last December. The underlying bipartisan bill \nprovides a good framework for tackling this problem. It provides a \ncomprehensive, specific, and evidence-based approach to help Americans \ncombat this epidemic.\n  In light of that, the pending amendment No. 3395, offered by the \nSenator from Oregon, would cause the underlying legislation to exceed \nthe authorizing committee's section 302(a) allocation of new budget \nauthority or outlays. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the \nmeasure pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, this is a bipartisan, commonsense policy. \nI wish to thank my coauthors, Senators Brown, Portman, and Kaine.\n  Lock-in is a tool by which beneficiaries who are abusing prescription \nopioids are locked in to a single prescriber and a single pharmacy for \naccess to these powerful narcotics. It would make it difficult or \nimpossible for these excessive prescriptions to continue when a patient \nis so locked in.\n  It is a tool that is already used by Medicaid and private insurers. \nWhat our amendment would do is extend this important tool to Medicare. \nIt is a policy that has been requested by the administration. It is in \nthe President's budget. It has broad bipartisan support. It will help \nstop fraud, help coordinate care for seniors, and save taxpayer money.\n  As Senator Wyden observed, his amendment, had it proceeded, would not \nhave actually extended this tool to Medicare. The only way we can do \nthat on this bill is to pass this amendment.\n  I would encourage everyone's support. I think we have an agreement \nfor a voice vote on this, but before we go to that, I wish to yield to \nSenator Brown for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis leadership.\n  Various doctors may not realize they are prescribing duplicative \nopioid painkillers. We have done the lock-in with Medicaid. In many \nStates, it has worked. This is a commonsense solution to help a \nrelatively small number of people but a growing number of seniors whom \na Medicare lock-in could assist.\n  I urge support for the Toomey-Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3345, \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, we are voting on very good legislation \nwith the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This is a way to \nexpand programs that work to address what is a real pandemic of heroin \nand opioid abuse in this country. But the reality is that unless we \nprovide the resources to make these programs work, it is like giving a \ndrowning person a life preserver that has no air in it. It doesn't make \na difference. We are losing 47,000 people a year--120 people a day--to \noverdoses. Our law enforcement needs additional funding. The substance \nabuse treatment folks need additional support.\n  What my emergency supplemental amendment would do is to support the \nprograms that are in the CARA legislation. It is about equally divided \nbetween support for law enforcement and support for treatment. It helps \nwith prescription drug monitoring, with education, and with recovery. \nIt is the kind of support we need to provide if we are really going to \nmake a difference in this epidemic we are all facing.\n  I urge my colleagues to not just support the underlying legislation--\nthat is good and we should support it, but unless we provide the \nfunding, we will not have done what we need to to accomplish real \nchange to keep people from dying. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \nShaheen amendment No. 3345.\n  Of course, the opioid crisis demands resources, and significant \nresources are being directed to it. But this amendment is political \ngamesmanship by some of my Democratic colleagues for whom the Senate's \nadvancement of CARA doesn't fit their preferred political narrative.\n  CARA is a bipartisan bill that addresses the clear and present public \nhealth crisis of heroin and prescription opioid abuse. Through the hard \nwork of many on both sides of the aisle, it passed the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously. And just a few weeks later, we are considering \nit on the Senate floor. This is the Senate working in a constructive, \nbipartisan way on behalf of the American people, unlike the way it \nworked under Democrat control.\n  But that is not a narrative some Democrats want the American people \nto hear. So a controversy must be manufactured to create a distraction. \nAnd the controversy that has been manufactured today is that CARA \ndoesn't appropriate any funds for this crisis.\n  CARA, of course, is an authorizing bill. It does many significant \nthings that I talked about here on the floor earlier in the week. But \nit was never intended to appropriate funds.\n  That is what we have the Appropriations Committee for. That is why we \nhave an appropriations process. We should follow that process.\n  In fact, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the \nfiscal year 2016 appropriations act passed in December provides more \nthan $400 million in funding specifically to address the opioid \nepidemic.\n  This is an increase of more than $100 million over the previous year. \nNone of that money has even been spent yet--it is available today. So \nthere is simply no reason to leap ahead of the fiscal year 2017 \nappropriations process.\n  The reality is that this public health crisis festered while the \nSenate was in Democratic control for years. For example, heroin \noverdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014.\n  And all the while, no emergency supplemental spending bill was \nbrought to the floor specifically to address it. In fact, no \nauthorization bill like CARA was brought to the floor either during \nthose years.\n  So I ask my colleagues to ignore this manufactured controversy. $400 \nmillion is available today to combat this crisis, an increase of $100 \nmillion. We should follow the appropriations process, which is just \naround the corner, where competing priorities and tradeoffs can be \nevaluated.\n  That is the best way to ensure both that adequate resources are \ndirected to this epidemic while at the same time maintaining fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the pending amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire appropriates $600 million on top of the $571 million \nprovided in the bill as reported by the Judiciary Committee over the \n2016-2020 period. Unlike the underlying bill, which requires \nappropriators to provide the authorized funding within the \ndiscretionary spending caps, the Shaheen amendment would designate new \nspending as emergency not subject to budget enforcement.\n  I am also concerned that this amendment lacks specificity in how the \nfunds are allocated. For example, the bill provides $300 million to the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for substance \nabuse treatment to address the heroin and opioid crisis and its \nassociated health effects. While we all agree that the heroin and \nopioid abuse epidemic must be addressed, I believe the underlying \nbipartisan bill provides a better framework to tackle this problem. It \nprovides a comprehensive, specific, and evidence-based approach to help \nAmericans combat this epidemic.\n  In the meantime, the Senate Appropriations Committee shepherds \nresources to the opioid problem in the consolidated appropriations bill \nsigned into law late last year. Nearly $600 million was included to \nstart down the road to helping States and communities to address this \nproblem.\n  The appropriators, working with our authorizers inside the framework \nof this bill, can evaluate the effectiveness of this year's spending as \nthey make decisions about how much to spend and how to spend most \neffectively in upcoming years.\n  Finally, last year's budget resolution conference report contained a \ndeficit neutral reserve fund, spearheaded by Senator Ayotte and adopted \nunanimously by the committee, to address the opioid challenge. \nTogether, Republicans and Democrats agreed that, if Congress were to \nagree on policies and funds to tackle this urgent problem, we should \nwork to pay for it. The Shaheen amendment does not do that.\n  Also, the Obama administration did not request opioid funding in the \nsupplemental request sent just last week for emergency Zika funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. In that case, let me say that the pending amendment, No. \n3345, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire would cause the \naggregate level of budget authority and outlays for fiscal year 2016 as \nestablished in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the \nbudget, S. Con. Res. 11, to be exceeded; therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment under section 311(a)(2)(A) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, do I have any time left to speak under \nthe previous 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Then pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget \nresolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I, \nSenator Shaheen, and Senator King be recognized for a 15-minute \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3345\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we rise to express our disappointment \nwith what just took place. I am one of the authors of the underlying \nbill. I think it is a very good piece of legislation, but it would make \na very significant difference if it had some funding.\n  The simple fact that we have to face is this bill has no funding \nright now. I know colleagues on the other side have come to the floor \nto say there is funding--$80 million, $400 million--but in point of \nfact I must disagree with them. Let me list the points that show, I \nbelieve, why there is no funding to this bill at this point.\n  The first is that the funding they point to was passed out of the \nAppropriations subcommittee 7 months before this bill even had its \nmarkup. It would have been an astonishing feat of prediction to be \nable--back then--to fund this bill now.\n  If that weren't clear enough, there was a change in the bill between \nthen and now. Then, if you wished to fund this bill, you would have put \nthe bulk of the money through the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee \nbecause the bulk of this bill was written in the CJS Appropriations \nSubcommittee. We only changed it this January in response to Republican \nobjections that nobody wanted to create new programs. So we rerouted \nthe new programs through existing programs. That is when it became a \nLabor-HHS-dominated bill. So there is no way that last June, when this \nmoney came through that Appropriations subcommittee, they knew it was \ngoing to this.\n  Moreover, if you go to the agency that is responsible for \ndistributing this money, they are bidding the money out right now. They \nhave a use right now for every dollar of it. If we don't pass this \nbill, they will put the money out and it will be spent. If we do pass \nthis bill, they will put the money out and it will be spent. If we \ndon't get the bill out soon enough, they will have to pass it out and \nget it spent under existing law. So you simply can't say with a \nstraight face that this is a funded bill.\n  The only way this is funded is by robbing the accounts that SAMHSA is \nnow putting out now to bid to fund, in order to fund this bill. You can \nsay the money will be better spent under this legislation. I think that \nis true. I support this bill. I am going to be for the bill all the way \nthrough, even if it is not funded, but you can't say there is funding.\n  This is a very solvable problem. We have done it before. As Senator \nShaheen pointed out on the floor, when it was the swine flu, on an \nemergency appropriations process, we appropriated $2 billion and when \nit was Ebola, $5 billion. If you say: Well, no, now something has \nchanged, we can't do that, we have pay for it--Senator Manchin has a \npay-for. A penny per milligram of opioid raises over $1 billion. You \ncould do half a penny that could be contributed by the pharmaceutical \nindustry that is so culpable in this predicament, in this tragedy we \nhave, but, no, rather than allow this good program, this bipartisan \nprogram to be expedited out there, to help the people who are dying--\n47,000 in 2014, the last year--what we have done is protect the \npharmaceutical industry from having to pay any share of the solution.\n  I yield to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, who is the author of the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act. That is the underlying bill we were trying \nto amend.\n  I would just point out that despite what the honorable chairman of \nthe Budget Committee said, the fact is that the emergency supplemental \nfunding amendment we introduced is very specific about where the \nfunding goes. It goes to programs that are addressed in CARA, expanded, \nand improved; the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grants \nthat go to the States to be distributed, funding the law enforcement \nthrough the Byrne-JAG and COPS grants that are very specific in how \nthey can be used to fight heroin and opioid abuse.\n  Like my colleague, I am disappointed--not surprised but disappointed. \nI very much appreciate those people who voted for this amendment, who \nwere willing--particularly some of my colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle--who were willing to step forward and say, if we are going to \naddress this problem, we have to provide the resources that \ncommunities, that States need to fight this addiction.\n  The question I have for those people who didn't vote to support this \namendment is, How many more people have to die before we are willing to \nprovide the resources that are needed to fight this epidemic--47,000 \npeople in 2014. In New Hampshire, we are losing more than a person a \nday. In 2015, we lost over 400 people to overdose deaths from opioid \nand heroin, three times as many people as we lost in traffic accidents. \nSo many communities will continue to be ravaged because we are not \nwilling to commit the resources to tackle this pandemic.\n  What do we tell the families of those people who have overdosed? What \ndo we tell the parents of young people such as Courtney Griffin, whose \nfather came and testified at a hearing Senator Ayotte and I had last \nfall in New Hampshire. He talked about the difficulties of getting \nCourtney treatment before she overdosed and died.\n  I met a man at a treatment center in Lebanon, NH, a man in recovery \nwho had been in and out of prison. I thought he put it very well when \nhe said: You know, it costs about $35,000 a year to keep somebody in \nprison. Wouldn't it make more sense to put dollars into treatment \nbecause it is a whole lot less expensive to provide the funding to\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\ntreat people who are using opioids and heroin, who are substance \nabusers, than to put them in jail?\n  To all of my colleagues, I am disappointed, but I am not defeated. \nThe fact is, this is coming back. It will come back in the \nappropriations process, and it will come back at every opportunity \nbecause I am not going to quit on those families in New Hampshire who \nneed help. I am not going to quit on the treatment professionals who \nare trying to provide treatment for the people who are in need. I am \nnot going to quit on the law enforcement, the police officers, the \nsheriffs, and all of the people in law enforcement in New Hampshire who \nare trying to put pushers behind bars and trying to get people off the \nstreets and into treatment.\n  I hope at some point the rest of the Members of this body are willing \nto take up this cause and provide the resources people need because I \nwill tell you it is certainly worth it to address the 47,000 people we \nlost. We were willing to put $5.4 billion into Ebola, and we lost one \nperson in America. We were willing to put $2 billion into fighting \nswine flu, and we lost about 12,000 people in the swine flu epidemic. \nWe have not been willing to put funding in to address the thousands, \nthe tens of thousands of people we are losing each year in this \ncountry.\n  So we are going to keep at it. We are going to keep fighting until we \nget the resources that families and communities need to fight this \nscourge.\n  I yield to my colleague from Maine, who has been--like my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island--a real leader in trying to address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise in disappointment, surprise, and some \nconfusion that we have this bill. We spent a week--I went to the \nJudiciary Committee. The bill came out of the committee unanimously. \nThere is tremendous interest in this subject. When I have talked about \nit at home, I have said to my people in Maine, this is something we are \ngoing to be able to do because every Member of this body is being \naffected by this tragedy that is engulfing our country. This is \nsomething we are going to be able to do together and indeed we have \ndone a lot together. We have a good bill. We have passed some good \namendments. One of the President's amendments was in the bill that we \npassed this afternoon. This is important work, but it has to be \nfunded--the old saying in Maine, and I suspect everywhere else, put \nyour money where your mouth is.\n  I was on a teleconference with some folks in Maine just 2 hours ago \ntalking about this, and one of the chiefs of police said: It is time to \nmove from talking about being interested in this to investing in it. We \ncannot solve this problem without money. It would be nice if we could. \nThere is a drastic and dramatic shortage of treatment facilities in \nthis country, and the only way we are going to be able to do it is to \npay for it.\n  We had a point of order on the budget. I have to tell you I am \nconfused because I stood here less than 3 months ago when we passed the \nbudget bill and $680 billion of tax extenders. Where was the point of \norder then? It wasn't funded. A dime of it wasn't funded. Maybe there \nwas a point of order, but it was rejected and overwritten so fast that \nnone of us noticed it. It was the speed of light.\n  My mother used to say we strain at gnats and swallow camels. We \nswallowed $680 billion of entirely unfunded tax extenders, and we \ncannot solve it and bring it into our hearts to save lives for one one-\nthousandth of that amount, $500 million--one one-thousandth of the \namount that we passed in a matter of minutes last December. I am \nconfused by this. I don't understand it.\n  By the way, 47,000 people, that sounds like a lot, but this is what \nreally sounds like a lot. Since this debate started at 2 o'clock this \nafternoon, 10 people have died; 10 people have died in the last 2 \nhours; 47,000 people is 5 people every hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days \nof the year. We are not talking about abstractions here, we are talking \nabout people's lives. We are talking about what I consider one of the \nmost serious problems I have ever seen in my State. We talk about \nEbola. We talk about ISIS. We talk about all of these challenges we \nhave. Yet this is something that is killing five people an hour, and we \nare not willing to put the funds in to do it. It is a false promise.\n  I believe this bill is going to do a lot of good, but it is not going \nto meet the promise we are making to the American people by all of this \ndrama this week about drug abuse and that we are going to do something \nabout it. We are not going to do enough about it because in order to \ndeal with this problem--and this is true everywhere--it is going to \ntake money to provide treatment for people who need it.\n  As I talked about this morning, the tragedy is when someone is ready \nto change their life and ready to try to defeat this awful disease--and \nthey cannot find any place to give them treatment. I was at a detox \ncenter in Portland just last week. They are turning away 100 people a \nmonth from a detox center--not even a treatment center but a detox \ncenter--because they do not have the beds.\n\n  I am delighted we are working on this bill. I am delighted we are \npassing it. I think there is a lot of good in it, and it is, in fact, a \nbipartisan bill. But to venture up to the edge of this problem and then \nstep away because we are not willing to pay for what, in my mind, is \none of the most serious emergencies we have faced since I have been in \npublic life is disappointing, surprising, and it is a great missed \nopportunity for the country.\n  I join my colleagues in regretting the decision that was just made. I \nthink it was an opportunity where we could have spoken as one to \nrealistically attack this scourge that is devastating our people. We \nare losing lives, we are squandering treasure, and we are breaking \nhearts. The only way we are going to be able to solve this problem or \nat least make a dent in it is to provide the wherewithal to the \nprograms throughout the country that are struggling manfully and \nmightily to confront the problem and defeat it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nyielding to me to speak for a moment in response to the comments made \nby my colleagues about the legislation before us, which is legislation \nto address the horrible problem we have in all our States of the \naddictions caused by heroin and prescription drugs. About 100 people \nwill die today from overdoses, and that is just the tip of the iceberg \nbecause there are so many other people whose lives are being ruined, \nfamilies being torn apart, and communities being devastated.\n  Senator Whitehouse, other Members of this body, and I drafted this \nlegislation over the period of the last few years, including five \nsummits we had in this Congress to bring in experts from all over the \ncountry on prevention, education, treatment, and recovery--dealing with \nthe law enforcement side and the importance of having Narcan available \nand also helping to get prescription drugs off bathroom shelves and \nensure we had drug-monitoring programs. It is a comprehensive approach.\n  I will say I disagree a little with my coauthor, my colleague from \nRhode Island, in saying that if we could pass this bill, there would be \nno funding for it somehow. There was a huge increase in funding, as \neveryone knows, at the end of the year for opioids. Senator Whitehouse, \nothers, and I approached the appropriators and asked them to be sure \nthat funding was consistent with where we were on CARA at that time--in \nthe middle of the Judiciary Committee. When we had some jurisdictional \nissues, we worked hard to draft the legislation so that if we could get \nit enacted this fiscal year--that is between now and September 30--\nthere would be funding to help us accomplish what is in the \nlegislation.\n  However, as my colleagues know, this bill is an authorization bill. \nWhat does that mean? It means it is a bill that directs how funding \nwill be spent. It is not a spending bill.\n  Having said all that, as Senator Shaheen knows, I supported her \nefforts to add additional resources over and above what could be spent \nthis year on CARA because I believe this is such an urgent problem, and \nI believe it does rise to the level of being an emergency. That is \nsaying a lot. I am a fiscal conservative. But that means it is not paid \nfor by offsetting other programs. It is\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\njust additional funding because it is such an urgent need.\n  We have done this on other occasions with health care emergencies \nwhen we have had something like the Ebola crisis. Well, I think this is \na crisis too, so I voted with Senator Shaheen today. I am a cosponsor \nof her amendment. I support it, but I don't support the efforts of some \nwho say somehow there is no money in here. This is an authorization \nbill. This is the first step toward getting the money, not just this \nyear but into the future. That is the point.\n  Back in the House, I was the author of the Drug-Free Communities Act. \nSome 19 years later, $1.3 billion has been spent in support of the \nDrug-Free Communities Act, helping to create over 2,000 community \ncoalitions, including in just about every State represented in this \nbody. Was that a spending bill? No. It was like this--an authorization \nbill to direct the spending based on a lot of research and effort, \nevidence-based practices we know would work. That is what this is. This \nis taking it to the next level.\n  Specifically directed to the points my good friend from Maine just \nmentioned about treatment centers being filled and detox centers not \nhaving room for someone to go to get the detox and then get into \ntreatment, these are real problems in our communities now. That is what \nthis legislation is meant to address, not just by appropriations for 1 \nyear but by changing the law for the future.\n  If we do this, and do it right, in another 19 years in this \nlegislation, we will spend even more than we spent on the Drug-Free \nCommunities Act. It will be well over $2 billion that will have been \nspent that would otherwise not have gone out because of this \nlegislation. So just as Senator Whitehouse said that he strongly \nsupports this bill because it is evidence based, because we spent the \nright time putting the effort into making sure it would be money well \nspent, this bill is really important.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues--Senators Shaheen, King, \nand Whitehouse. Senator Whitehouse and I have been at this for a few \nyears together. It is the right thing to do for our country at a time \nwhen we do face a crisis.\n  Again, I will support the additional spending because I think this is \nso critical. But let's not go forward with this sense that somehow this \ndoesn't matter. This does matter in a very big way. This is a necessary \nfirst step. And in terms of this year, because we increased funding \ndramatically at the end of the year for this fiscal year--not one penny \nof that has been outlaid, by the way; it has been appropriated but \nthere has been no outlay yet--I believe anything we could get done this \nyear--getting it through the House, getting it through the Senate, and \nthe President signing it--would be funding we could use for these \nimportant CARA programs just in the 7 months of this fiscal year.\n  Certainly we should right now--as I have done and I know Senator \nWhitehouse is doing and others are doing--go to the Committee on \nAppropriations and say: With regard to next fiscal year, let's be sure \nthat we have the entire bill funded. And again, I would support even \nadditional funding beyond that. But at a minimum, let's get this done. \nThis is an opportunity on a bipartisan basis to actually get something \ndone to help people who are crying out for our help. Communities need \nour help. Families that are being broken apart need our help.\n  I appreciate the fact Senator Shaheen made her best effort today. She \nwas right, in my view, but let's also continue to work together to get \nthis legislation passed with whatever funding we can add to it. That is \ngreat with me, but let's get this bill passed to ensure that going into \nthe future we are directing this funding effectively and increasing \nthis funding to help those who need it most.\n  Again, I appreciate my colleague from Nevada, and I am sorry to take \nso much of his time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if I can have 1 minute before the \nSenator departs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to end this conversation on a happy note, after what I \nconsider to be a very unhappy vote, and that is to express my \nappreciation to Senator Portman for his collegiality and his work over \nmany years to get this bill to where it is now in the Senate. I express \nmy appreciation to him for voting for the amendment of Senator Shaheen. \nI express my appreciation to him for publicly pledging to work as hard \nas we can together to get funding for this bill into the appropriations \nprocess that is underway right now.\n  I look forward to working with him on all those endeavors. I do \nbelieve that we missed a big opportunity, because Senator Shaheen's \nbill, had it passed, would have flooded a lot more money, a lot faster, \ninto the solution of this problem.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle on this particular piece of legislation. I know \nthere is a lot of passion behind this, and there should be, and I do \nbelieve at the end of the day there will be an appropriate \nauthorization and spending level so we can get this bill passed, which \nis something I support.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Leahy, and all \nthose who have been involved in this particular topic of bringing \nopioid abuse to the forefront. Opioid abuse is an issue every Member of \nthe Senate hears about when they go home. For many Nevadans, substance \nabuse is an issue that hits close. It is an issue I read about in \nconstituents' letters and hear in far too many calls that come in to my \noffice on this issue.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have heard from those who are \nstruggling with addiction or who have lost a loved one to this \nepidemic. In my home State of Nevada, there were 545 drug overdose \ndeaths in 2014 alone. I have heard countless stories from young \nNevadans who have experienced addiction themselves or seen their \nfriends slip into this scary spiral of abuse.\n  I recently met a young man from Reno who was advocating on behalf of \nmultiple friends whom he had lost to heroin overdose. He said it \nstarted with experimenting with leftover painkillers in his friend's \nparents' medicine cabinet. Eventually, the pills were gone, and the \ngroup of friends started experimenting with harder and cheaper drugs. \nSome of their friends fell into the juvenile court system after being \ncaught with illegal drugs.\n  Unfortunately, the court system wasn't equipped to adequately treat \ntheir addiction. They slipped back into their old habits, and the young \nman from Reno has now gone to multiple funerals.\n  I am glad he had the courage to tell his friends' stories. Opioid \nabuse and addiction has stolen the lives of far too many Nevadans, and \nit is time we do something about it.\n  I know my colleagues also hear the same stories in their offices on a \ndaily basis. In 2014, opioids were involved in almost 30,000 American \ndeaths. That means more Americans now die each year from drug overdoses \nthan they do from car crashes.\n  The unfortunate reality of opioid abuse has become a major public \nhealth concern, and something needs to be done. We know this epidemic \nhits all ages, all socioeconomic levels, all races, and all genders.\n  Opioid use often starts with treating legitimate pain needs. There \nare two groups of Nevadans that are extremely important, and I have \nfocused my efforts today on these two very important populations: our \nveterans and our seniors.\n  First, I have two amendments that improve access to treatment for our \nNation's veterans. My first amendment, Heller amendment No. 3346, would \ninclude veterans service organizations in the Pain Management Best \nPractices Interagency Task Force. Giving VSOs a seat at the table on \nthis task force will help us better understand the unique circumstances \nour Nation's veterans face that drive them to use opioids in the first \nplace.\n  My second amendment, Heller amendment No. 3351, would allow veterans \nnonprofit organizations to be eligible for grants from the Building \nCommunities of Recovery program. The Building Communities of Recovery \nprogram is designed to pool community resources to help those affected \nby\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\nopioid abuse seek the proper treatment to recover from these highly \naddictive pain medications and avoid slipping into a cycle of chronic \ndrug abuse.\n  Including veterans nonprofit organizations in this grant program will \nallow places like Veterans Village in Las Vegas to access more \nresources to treat the servicemen and -women in our State. As a member \nof the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am concerned about how \nopioid abuse impacts America's heroes. Some of these veterans are in \nsevere pain due to the injuries they sustained during service to our \nNation, and numerous veterans have reached out to my office for help \nwhen the VA's policies are negatively impacting them.\n  As we debate the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, it is \ncritical for Congress to ensure VSOs have a voice. These organizations \nunderstand the unique challenges veterans face with opioids and how to \nresolve these issues. That is why I have filed two amendments to allow \nthis important stakeholder to come to the table and help reduce opioid \nabuse.\n  I encourage my colleagues to accept these amendments, and I would \nlike to continue to work with the bill managers as we find a path \nforward on them.\n  The senior population is another group of Nevadans that face unique \ncircumstances on how they become dependent on opioids. They are \nprescribed opioids to cope with chronic pain and discomfort after \nsurgery and, obviously, rightfully so. In fact, about 40 percent of \nNevada's seniors are on some type of opioid, but opioids have qualities \nthat make them highly addictive and prone to abuse.\n  Pain is a highly complex issue, and there are many barriers to pain \nmanagement. Just recently I had a constituent reach out to my office \nbecause they were being denied access to a lifesaving opioid pain \nmedication for a very rare and serious condition. Fortunately, we were \nable to help resolve the situation, but it was disappointing that this \nNevadan had to go to such extremes to receive the treatment they \ndeserved.\n  No doubt Congress should play a role in addressing opioid addiction \nand this epidemic, and I think there are ways to accomplish this goal \nwhile ensuring that seniors in Nevada and throughout the United States \ncontinue to receive the care they need. One of those ways is to \npermanently repeal the Medicare caps on therapy services. Right now, \ncurrent law places an annual per-beneficiary payment limit of $1,880 \nfor all outpatient therapy services.\n  I firmly believe that if patients had better access to physical \ntherapy, they would not be as dependent on highly addictive pain \nmedication. Seniors would also have a higher quality of life by \ntreating the sources of the pain and rebuilding their strength. With \nproper access to care, seniors will be able to enjoy a happy and \nhealthy retirement rather than cope with the pain through highly \naddictive medication that only masks their discomfort.\n  Senator Cardin and I have been working on a responsible alternative \nto the Medicare's therapy cap. I believe more work needs to be done to \nensure that these proposals will solve the problem and ensure that \nthese seniors have access to the therapies and treatments they need.\n  Right now, the cap has been lifted until March of 2017. We have until \nearly next year to come up with a permanent solution to the therapy cap \nissue, and I have no doubt that Senator Cardin and I will be able to \ndeliver results for seniors across this country.\n  The American people want us to put partisan politics aside and come \nup with solutions to the problems we see every day. CARA is an example \nthat Congress can, and should, come together to solve these problems. \nThe epidemic of opioid abuse has reached a serious point in our debate. \nI believe the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is a step in the \nright direction.\n  I encourage my colleagues to pass this important legislation, and I \nam hopeful that we can do it this week, showing Nevadans and all \nAmericans that we are serious about addressing this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Supreme \nCourt vacancy for the second time on the floor, but I did want to thank \nthe cosponsors of our bill, Senator Portman, Senator Whitehouse, and \nSenator Ayotte, and also Senator Shaheen for her strong amendment that \nI think would have made such a difference if we could get some \nimmediate emergency funding.\n  As we know, there are other important provisions in this bill, \nespecially the work I am focused on with prescription drug monitoring, \nthe simple idea that when I talk to doctors, they are never sure if \nthis is someone who is actually abusing the system. They want to do \nwell. They have been trained to do well to get people out of pain. But \nso often there is not a lot of monitoring about what is going on. And \nthis is going to help get the States to start doing their work. I again \nthank Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Ayotte, and Shaheen for their work \non this bill.\n\n\n                   filling the supreme court vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, I come today to talk about the Supreme Court.\n  Last Wednesday, I led a meeting of the steering and outreach \ncommittee on the Supreme Court and the Senate's constitutional \nresponsibilities. We had the opportunity at that meeting to hear from \nfour distinguished law professors on the constitutional implications of \nthe current vacancy and to put some historical and constitutional \ncontext about the choice before us. I would like to share some of the \ninsights with my colleagues.\n  First of all, Jamal Greene, a professor of law at Columbia Law \nSchool, looked to the original intent of the Framers of the \nConstitution, noting that ``the Framers did not contemplate the use of \nthe Senate's advice and consent power solely to run out the clock on a \npresidential appointment. As [Alexander] Hamilton speculated in \nFederalist 76, rejection of a nominee `could only be to make place for \nanother nomination by [the President].' ''\n  The critical point made by Professor Greene, which was echoed by the \nrest of the panel, is that inaction is not an appropriate response when \nthe Constitution says that the President shall nominate and that the \nSenate has a duty to advise and consent. In fact, Professor Gerhardt \nfrom the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill noted that the \nonly time Members truly abandoned their constitutional duties and left \nthis position open was during the Civil War. Think about that. Senators \nbefore us in this great Chamber--even before we had this Chamber, when \nthey were meeting in other places. We have been through World War I, we \nhave been through World War II, we have been through the Vietnam war, \nwe have been through civil rights tumult, and always the position was \nfilled and not left vacant for that year time period. We have to go \nback to the Civil War.\n  Another common theme we heard from all of the panelists is that the \nproposed inaction by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is \nwithout precedent in our Nation's history. In the last 135 years, no \nPresident has been refused a vote on a nominee for an open seat on the \nCourt. The Senate has confirmed more than a dozen Supreme Court \nJustices in Presidential election years, including five in the last 100 \nyears. So it is not as if we have to go way back in time; five of them \nwere in the last 100 years. Probably the most oft-cited example is the \nexample of President Reagan nominating Justice Kennedy in his last few \nyears in the White House. He nominated Justice Kennedy, and a \nDemocratic Senate confirmed--not just confirmed but confirmed \nunanimously.\n  Another member of the panel was Professor Jeff Stone. He is a \nprofessor at the University of Chicago Law School--actually, my \nprofessor, my evidence professor. I always enjoy asking my professors \nquestions now that I am a Senator as opposed to when they used to ask \nquestions of me. He was, of course, a former colleague of Justice \nScalia's. In fact, when Justice Scalia left the University of Chicago \nto be appointed to the bench, he actually gave his papers and all of \nhis notes to Professor Stone. While they had some different political \nviews, without a doubt, he had admiration for Professor Stone and \nProfessor Stone had admiration for Justice Scalia, as he has written \nabout since his death.\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\n  After reviewing the history of Supreme Court nominations, Professor \nStone concluded:\n\n       Despite all the fuss and fury over the Supreme Court \n     confirmation process, the plain and simple fact is that the \n     Senate always defers to the president as long as the \n     president puts forth nominees who are clearly qualified and \n     who are reasonably moderate in their views. And this is true \n     even when the Senate is controlled by the opposing party. In \n     short, nominees who are both qualified and moderate are \n     confirmed. Period.\n\n  I think he was using as an example--we know there have been nominees \nwho have been turned down by the Senate in past, including in the \nrecent past, but the point is, they got a hearing and they got an up-\nor-down vote. There are cases where people withdrew their names. There \nare cases where the up-or-down vote was not in their favor. But they \nalways were moved forward.\n  Although we have been accustomed to a certain level of partisanship \nin Congress, Professor Stone pointed out that the nomination process \nfor Supreme Court Justices has remained in large part a bipartisan \nprocess. Again, people may vote differently, but as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee and a relatively new member in confirmation \nprocesses for both Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor, those hearings \nwere very civil. At the time, Senator Sessions was the ranking member \nand Senator Leahy was the chair. At those hearings, people asked the \nquestions they wanted to. They went on for a number of days. Then we \nhad a final vote, and then we came to the Senate and all was done. As \nwe know, among the Justices currently serving, the longest time from \nthe nomination to the confirmation was actually 99 days; that was \nJustice Thomas.\n\n  So we have always had a process that has worked. And while the result \nhas, sadly, become more partisan--although there have been a number of \nRepublicans who voted for the recent nominees, it has been more \npartisan over time. When we look at the unanimous vote Justice Kennedy \ngot, the process itself worked, and that is very important to the \nfunctioning of the Senate.\n  The fact is, we may have a very difficult atmosphere around us \npolitically and sometimes right here in this Chamber, but we have tried \nto keep our dignity and move forward with our processes, and we find \nways to work together and we treat each other with respect. For me, \nthat is a lot about what this is about, this process for a nominee. \nYes, it is about what the Constitution says. Yes, it is about \nrespecting history. Yes, it is about not leaving a vacancy on the third \npillar of our government when, in fact, our only job as Senators is not \nto determine what happens in those cases or what the individual \ndecisions are, but it is to fund that Court and make sure that \nvacancies are filled in our advice and consent function. But it often \ngoes beyond all of that for me. It is about how we function as a body, \nthat we keep to our processes, that we move legislation, that we move \nnominees, and that we respect our traditions, we respect the Senate, \nand we respect each other.\n  Looking beyond the constitutional duties of the Senate and the \nhistorical precedent of the Senate considering Supreme Court nominees, \nwe have had the opportunity to hear from our panel, as I mentioned, as \nwell as from a number of others, about the importance of filling a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  Professor Greene, whom I mentioned before, and others noted that this \ninaction could leave the Court for two full terms without the ability \nto resolve closely contested cases. They don't get the easy cases on \nthe Supreme Court. That is not why they are there. That is not why they \nare called the Supreme Court. They get the tough cases. They get the \ncases in the gray area. When the lower courts are in disagreement and \ncan't figure out what to do, they are the decisionmaker.\n  Professor Greene went on to say in our panel: ``The Supreme Court has \nmultiple responsibilities, but one of its main, core functions is to \nresolve those disagreements [among the lower courts], and [this \nvacancy] leaves the law in a state of uncertainty.''\n  The people of this country have enough uncertainty to deal with. Of \ncourse, because of our democratic functions, we do not know who our \nnext President will be. There is a lot of blame and a lot of finger-\npointing going on throughout our political system right now. There is a \nlot of uncertainty. There is uncertainty with the way our laws have \nworked. But one of our jobs is to put some certainty in people's lives. \nWe did that with the budget at the end of last year. We did that with \nthe Transportation bill last year. We did that with a number of pieces \nof legislation that were passed on a bipartisan basis. Now it is our \njob to not leave the entire legal system in a state of uncertainty.\n  Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has also spoken out. When asked \nabout Republicans seeking to wait a year until considering a nominee, \nshe said: ``I don't agree. I think we need somebody there to do the job \nnow and let's get on with it.''\n  In fact, former President Ronald Reagan, who nominated Justice \nO'Connor to the Supreme Court, said in 1987: ``Every day that passes \nwith a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business \nin that crucially important body.''\n  He made that statement around the same time he nominated Justice \nKennedy, who was confirmed, as I noted, unanimously by a Senate \ncontrolled by the opposite party in the last year of a Presidency. That \nis our closest and most recent example--confirmed in the last year of \nthe Reagan Presidency by a Democratic Senate, with a Republican \nPresident.\n  We now have a Democratic President who is not running for President \nagain--he can't--who is in the last year of his Presidency, with a \nRepublican Senate.\n  The critical importance of filling this seat is clear, and it is not \nsomething we can wait on for over a year. Not since the Civil War have \nwe had a vacancy for over a year. And, may I add, there is plenty of \ntime for the Senate to consider and confirm the nominee. Is it \nconvenient? No, it is not convenient. There is a lot going on. It is an \nelection year. Things happen. Unexpectedly, Justice Scalia died. And \nmany people who knew him well, such as my law professor in Chicago, \nmiss him. But he died, and that triggered a duty on the part of the \nPresident and on our part.\n  The Senate has taken an average of only 67 days--about 2 months--from \nthe date of the nomination to the confirmation vote since 1975. This \nmeans that if the President offers a nomination this month, that \nnominee should receive a vote in the Senate by Memorial Day. If for \nsome reason that doesn't happen and the hearings take longer than we \nthink, I would put one other day forth: We could finish this by the \nFourth of July. For those who love the Constitution, that is certainly \na good holiday and end date.\n  Looking at the text of the Constitution, the precedent of the Senate, \nand the importance of the circumstances, the matter is clear: It is the \nduty of the Senate to thoughtfully consider the President's nominee to \nthe Supreme Court, and anything less than that disregards our oaths of \noffice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to associate my remarks with the \nSenator from Minnesota and just say that what the Constitution says is \nso clear. It says that the President shall--not may--it says shall \nnominate and then the Senate will advise and consent. That is clear. \nThe President is going to nominate. So are we going to wait around for \na whole year without giving our advice and/or consent? In other words, \njust do your job. So I thank the Senator for her comments.\n\n\n                             Takata Airbags\n\n  Mr. President, I have a very touchy subject to talk about again--the \nongoing Takata airbag fiasco. It is now a recall fiasco. To this point, \nsome 26 million of these airbags that are in the center of the steering \ncolumn that we drive around with right in front of us or in front of \nthe passenger's seat or on the sides, side airbags--some 26 million of \nthem have already been recalled.\n  A little over a week ago, I spoke about this continuing customer \nconfusion over this recall fiasco. For the sake of the safety of our \nAmerican consumers who happen to be drivers in these vehicles with \nthese Takata airbags, we need to end this confusion. I think the \nprocess has to begin with having the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, or NHTSA,\n\n[[Page S1211]]\n\ntake a hard look at whether they need to start the process of recalling \nall Takata airbags with ammonium nitrate-based inflaters.\n  Ammonium nitrate seems to be the problem. It is a chemical compound \nthat is ignited when you have a collision. Within less than a second, \nit inflates with gases. This is the airbag that is supposed to save our \nlives. But what is supposed to save lives has been killing lives \nbecause the explosive force is so great that it starts to shred the \nmetal housing. That is sending pieces of shrapnel right into the driver \nor into the passenger.\n  Last week, I showed the Senate one of these airbags, and then I \nshowed them a piece of metal that became, in effect, shrapnel, like a \ngrenade, only this piece was that big and it had killed a lady in \nOrlando, FL. As a matter of fact, when the police got to the \nintersection where she had a collision and the airbag deployed and they \ngot there and found her in the car, they thought it was a murder \nbecause her neck had been slashed. But, in fact, it was this airbag, \nexploding with such force that it shredded the metal. In this case, it \nwas a piece that big.\n  On February 10, I sent a letter to the NHTSA Administrator, Mark \nRosekind, asking him to do two things. First, I asked him to use his \nauthority to phase out the production of the new Takata ammonium \nnitrate-based airbag inflaters as soon as possible. With all that we \nknow about these things, this ammonium nitrate should not be used as \nreplacement for the old Takata inflaters, and it certainly shouldn't be \nused in the new cars that are produced and sold to consumers.\n  Second, in this letter, I asked him to seriously consider a total \nrecall of all Takata ammonium nitrate-based inflaters that are \ncurrently in vehicles. My goodness, that is a big number. That is \npotentially another 90 million units in this country alone. That could \nbe as much as 260 million worldwide. But with all the manipulation of \ndata and the serious safety lapses that our staff on the Senate \nCommerce Committee has detailed in two separate reports, I think it is \nsomething that we should seriously look at. Potentially, it is a big \nnumber of recalls of this ammonium nitrate-based inflater that is \ncurrently in vehicles.\n  I want to say that I supported Administrator Rosekind's nomination, \nand I think he has done a number of things to try to improve NHTSA. But \nI was not too pleased with his written response to my letter that I \nreceived from him on February 26, just a few days ago. In my letter, I \nasked him to provide me with the total number of inflaters that Takata \ncould supply under existing contracts with automakers. He didn't supply \nthat.\n  Will Takata continue to produce millions of these things? We don't \nknow. We don't know the answer.\n  Are consumers today basically getting a newer version of the old \nversion that has been so defective? No answer to that either. In other \nwords, are we going to replace an old live grenade with a new live \ngrenade?\n  In the letter, I also asked the Administrator to consider an \naccelerated phaseout of the production of new Takata ammonium nitrate-\nbased inflaters. In his letter, he declined.\n  As to the request for NHTSA to look at a larger recall of Takata \nammonium nitrate-based airbags, Administrator Rosekind declined to call \nfor a larger recall. He based that statement on the fact that most of \nthe Takata airbags that have not been recalled contain something called \ndesiccant, which removes the moisture and is supposed to stabilize the \nammonium nitrate in the inflaters.\n  That desiccant is there because moisture is considered to be the \nculprit that causes the ammonium nitrate to be defective in its \nexplosion. So desiccant is supposed to remove that moisture, and it is \nsupposed to stabilize the ammonium nitrate.\n  The exact quote in his letter is this: ``In fact, to date, NHTSA is \nunaware of any inflator rupture, in testing or in the field, of a \nTakata inflator using chemical desiccant to counteract the effects of \nmoisture.''\n  He says that NHTSA is unaware of any inflater rupture using the \nchemical desiccant.\n  That statement is not true. On October 15 of last year, General \nMotors recalled about 400 vehicles for Takata side airbags with the \nchemical desiccant. Fortunately, in that testing, nobody was injured. \nBut that wasn't correct information given to the Commerce Committee, \nand NHTSA finally admitted their error to our staff on Monday of this \nweek.\n  Why didn't NHTSA seem to know about it beforehand? This really raises \nserious questions when a regulator doesn't even seem to know about its \nown data. NHTSA had that data. As a result, it continues to raise \nquestions about who is really in control of this recall. Is it who \nought to be, NHTSA, or is it the manufacturer of the defective airbag, \nTakata?\n  Deaths and serious injuries have occurred as a result of these \ndefective airbags. They have been in Florida, but they have been in \nmany other places. The last one was in the Carolinas in December, and a \nFord driver is dead as a result of it.\n  I can tell you that this Senator and many of the members of the \nSenate Commerce Committee are not going to sit quietly and wait for \nthis to get sorted out in good time. Lives are at stake. We are going \nto keep pushing until all consumers who have vehicles with Takata \nairbags get answers and get help.\n  I wish I didn't have to bring this to the Senate floor, but in the \nsafety and sake of consumers we have to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Texas case that was \nheard by the U.S. Supreme Court, Whole Woman's Health. This morning, I \njoined hundreds of pro-choice advocates on the steps of the Supreme \nCourt in advance of the oral arguments. They came from all parts of the \ncountry with signs such as ``Don't mess with access'' and ``Respect my \nfundamental human dignity.''\n  The lead-up to this case was a Texas law, HB2, which imposes \nunnecessary medical requirements on the State's clinics that provide \nabortion services.\n  According to the American Medical Association and the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, these requirements are not \nnecessary to protect the health of women seeking these services. \nRather, these onerous restrictions, known as targeted regulation of \nabortion providers, or TRAP laws, have only one purpose--to deny \nabortion services to women.\n  Three-quarters of clinics in Texas will close if this law is upheld, \nleaving nearly a million women without adequate access to reproductive \nservices. By making the false claim that restrictions like those passed \nin Texas will actually protect women's health, opponents of abortion \nhope to conceal their true agenda, which is putting an end to abortion \nand women's reproductive choices.\n  The Texas law is just one more example of a litany of legislation and \nother attempts to limit a woman's constitutionally protected right to \nchoose. Attacks on reproductive rights, such as misleading undercover \nvideos, violence at clinics, and numerous attempts in Congress to roll \nback progress on women's health care continued in 2015.\n  Since Roe v. Wade was decided, State legislatures have passed \nhundreds of laws to chip away at a woman's right to choose. In the last \n4 years alone, States have passed 231 anti-choice laws. Among the most \ninvasive are those requiring ultrasounds of women seeking abortion \ncare, and some of the most ill-conceived laws require providers to give \nmedically unsound information to scare women seeking abortion care. \nLaws that are not based on medical science and opposed by medical \npractitioners do not protect a woman's health. No matter how loudly or \nhow often these arguments--or these claims--are repeated, they are \nlies. Lies repeated do not become truths.\n  While these restrictive laws impact all women, they impact minority \nand lower income women most. For example, the Texas law will result in \nthe closure of more and more provider clinics. Women in Texas will have \nto travel farther and farther to get to open clinics. Women who have \nlimited resources\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nto travel for needed services or cannot afford to take time from work \nto travel these long distances are the most negatively impacted by TRAP \nlaws.\n  Why do women need to be protected from being able to access the \nreproductive services they need and choose? Fundamentally, what is the \npoint of a constitutional right if one is unable to exercise that \nright? I cannot think of any other constitutionally protected right \nthat has seen so many restrictions placed upon it, except perhaps the \nright to vote, but that is a subject for another speech.\n  It is more than ironic that while many of our anti-choice colleagues \nvehemently speak out in support of constitutional rights, when it comes \nto women's bodies and reproductive choice, they are all too willing to \nset aside their constitutional principles to invade those fundamental \nrights. Neither Congress nor the States have a right to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. I am a politician. I \nwas a businessman before I was elected to the Senate. I watched with \ninterest the debates since the death of Antonin Scalia about what the \nSenate and country should do in terms of filling its vacancy, in terms \nof its timing.\n  The Constitution tells us what to do. The Constitution tells us that \nthe President shall make an appointment, or a nomination, to fill that \nvacancy and the Senate shall offer its advice and consent. There is no \ndeadline or trigger date. There are no other rules or guidelines.\n  There have been a lot of historic debates on both sides of the aisle \nover whether or not a nomination for a Supreme Court justice should be \nnamed in the last year of a Presidency. Interestingly enough, if you \nread the history, sometimes it is the Republicans saying they shouldn't \ndo it and sometimes it is the Democrats. In fact, if you really go back \nand look, we have all said the same thing. It would just depend on \nwhose ox was getting gored in the politics of a particular day.\n  I love Joe Biden. He is a personal friend of mine and a great Vice \nPresident of the United States. I served with him in the Senate and on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, which the Presiding Officer serves on \ntoday.\n  I did a little research on what Joe had to say because I appreciate \nhis wisdom. In the last year of the Bush administration--H. W. Bush--in \n1992 on June 25, then-Senator Biden made two statements, and I would \nlike to share those statements. The first is the following:\n\n       [I]t would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the \n     political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme \n     Court nomination must be put off until after the election \n     campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is \n     central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, we will be \n     in deep trouble as an institution.\n\n  Let's take that quote and apply it to the current contemporary time \nwe are in today. We are in a politically unknown territory. Yesterday \nwas Super Tuesday, and 15 States went to the polls. We had newcomers \ngetting the most votes, and we had old-timers getting the most in one \nprimary. We have women getting votes. We have men getting votes. We \nhave conservatives and we have liberals. We don't know who our \nPresident is going to be or what party he or she will be from. But we \ndo know that when they are elected and sworn in January of next year, \nthey will be the President of the United States most contemporarily \nappointed and elected by the people of the United States of America.\n  The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbitrator of what the executive \nand legislative branches do. It is only appropriate that the Supreme \nCourt majority, as it is cast, be made up of nine people, five of whom \nare in the majority, who were appointed freely and without political \ninfluence, judged for their best political and legal acumen and in the \nbest interest of the country.\n  I don't think going to the current President, Mr. Obama, who is in \nthe last year of his term, and getting him to make an appointment that \nwill only last a few months of his last year in office is the right way \nto go.\n  I think we need to say the following: The President of the United \nStates who is elected this November and sworn in next January will be \nthe President of all the people most contemporarily voted by the people \nof America. That is the President who should make the nomination, and \nthat is the Senate that should make the confirmation.\n  I urge my colleagues who argued about going ahead and moving \nforthrightly and quickly on filling Antonin Scalia's seat to think \nabout this. Next year the Senate will be a new Senate. It won't be this \nSenate. Many of us are up for reelection. I may not be here. I don't \nknow who will be here. I am trying. I don't know who will be here. I \nwant to get here, but I don't know if I will be here.\n  We don't know who the President will be. Each of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats, have our pick. We hope it is our President. We hope it is \nthe man or woman we want, but we don't know that. But we do know that \non the first Tuesday in November, we will elect a new President. In \nJanuary, that President will be sworn in, and it will be his or her \nopportunity, if we wait, to make the nomination for whomever will fill \nAntonin Scalia's place. It will be the new Senate's place to confirm \nthat nomination. The Senators who are elected will be the ones most \nrecently elected to the Senate, and the President who is elected will \nbe the most recently elected President of the United States. That is \nthe person who should make that appointment, and that Senate should \nmake that confirmation.\n  Think about this. Ronald Reagan appointed Antonin Scalia in 1986. \nAntonin Scalia served on the Court for 30 years until 2016. The next \nperson appointed to take his place may serve 30 years as well. That \ntakes us to 2046. That is a long time from now. Shouldn't we take the \nmost contemporarily elected President to make that appointment rather \nthan one who is going away and will be in the history books? I think it \nis right to allow the President who has been most recently elected to \nmake that nomination and allow the newest Senate to make the \nconfirmation and do what is right for the American people.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic thing. I respect my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle. We have all made the same statements. It \nwould just depend on whether it was our President or the other guy's \nPresident, whether it was our Senate or the other guy's Senate.\n  In fact, I will close my remarks by again quoting my friend Joe Biden \nfrom the same speech he made on June 25, 1992. He said: ``Others may \nfret that this approach would leave the court with only eight members \nfor some time, but as I see it, the cost of such a result . . . [is] \nquite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, the President, the \nSenate, and the Nation would have to pay for what would assuredly be a \nbitter fight, no matter how good a person is nominated by the \nPresident.''\n  Vice President Biden made that statement when he was a Senator and \nfaced the same situation that we face today. He was smart and wise \nbeyond his years. He said: It is best to look to the future for the \nappointment, the next President for the nomination, and the next Senate \nfor the confirmation and look to the future of the of the Court, \nbecause it is the Supreme Court--many times on a vote of 5 to 4--that \nwill decide the fate of legislative and executive action. It is only \nright that we have the best and most contemporarily appointed Court \nthat we could possibly have, and the only way to do that is to make \nsure that the next President makes the appointment.\n  I underscore what I said at the beginning. It is not a Republican or \nDemocratic thing. It is a political thing. We are all politicians and \ncreatures to our politics. All of us have said the same thing. It would \njust depend on who was in charge at the time as to whether we spoke \nlike Joe Biden as a Republican or spoke like Joe Biden as a Democrat.\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\n  I commend Antonin Scalia for being a great servant to the American \npeople. He was a great jurist, a great writer, and a great judge. He \nwill be missed.\n  Somewhere out there in America today, there is another Antonin Scalia \njust waiting to be nominated and confirmed by the Senate. I don't know \nwho it is, but I know this: I want them to be found by the next \nPresident of the United States elected this November and confirmed next \nJanuary by this Senate. That is the right person. That is the right \nway, and I submit that is the way I recommend we do it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Women's Health Protection Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, earlier today I joined a number of my \ncolleagues outside the Supreme Court to work with advocates who were \ngathered there, thousands of people, including many young people. \nLooking into their faces, I realized that for them Roe v. Wade is \nhistory, but my mind went back to 1974, the year after Roe v. Wade, \nwhen I was a law clerk to Justice Blackmun. I heard similar voices from \nthe serene, contemplative chambers of Justice Blackmun and thought \nthen--in fact all of us thought then--that Roe v. Wade would settle for \nall time, at least for the next decades, the reproductive rights of \nwomen in the United States of America, and we were wrong. We were wrong \nthat the law would be settled, that rights would be protected, that Roe \nwould be accepted, and that privacy would become enshrined as a matter \nof constitutional law or at least accepted politically. We were wrong.\n  Today, in a historic case, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on \na challenge to the basic fundamental right of privacy with practical \nimplications that will alter the lives of women in Texas, where the \ncase rose, and throughout the country.\n  I know firsthand from my experience as a law clerk, but even more so \nin the decades since as an advocate for reproductive rights and women's \nhealth care, as U.S. attorney, as a member of the Connecticut General \nAssembly, first as a member of the House and then in the State Senate, \nand as our State attorney general, working and fighting to enshrine in \nState law the rights protected by Roe v. Wade and then protect them \nfrom physical threat and intrusion at the clinics where those rights \nwere made real.\n  Those rights mean nothing if they are unprotected. If women need to \ntravel hundreds of miles, if women need to leave their jobs and their \nchildren for days, if women have no access to those rights, they are \nunreal for them. That is the net fact of the law that is \nunderchallenged in the case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Whole \nWoman's Health v. Hellerstedt. That law, HB2, in effect, so restricts \nthe availability of reproductive rights in practical, real terms as to \nplace an insurmountable burden for many women on the exercise of those \nrights. Those rights are prevented from being real for them, for \ncountless others, and they will be put out of reach for countless women \nacross the country if this law is not struck down.\n  That is what we are asking the Supreme Court to do: to strike down \nthis law that under the pretense of protecting women's health, imposes \nrestrictions that deny rights, rights to privacy that are basic to the \nhuman condition. They are constitutional rights, but nothing is more \nbasic than the right to control your own body. Nothing is more \nessential than protection of rights to decide when to have a child. \nThese issues of control over one's body involve control over one's \nfaith, rights of privacy, and power to make basic life decisions.\n  That is what it means to have a right to privacy. It is the right to \nbe left alone--as one of our Supreme Court Justices said, the right to \nbe left alone from unwarranted and unnecessary government intrusion. \nThe Supreme Court will have to make a judgment about whether the burden \nplaced on that right is justified by this supposed protection of \nwomen's health.\n  Anybody familiar with this case knows that supposed reason for these \nlaws that require many privileges for doctors or particular widths of \nhallways in clinics is a ruse, a pretense, in fact, a falsehood.\n  My view is the outcome should be clear in this deliberative battle \nbefore the Court, but the ramifications, the practical impacts, are \nsevere for those women in Texas who would have no access to \nreproductive health care, and for women around the country because the \nsimple stark fact is, since 2011, State legislatures have enacted 288 \nlaws like the one in Texas, designed to restrict access to reproductive \nrights. We are not talking about a situation limited to Texas. In State \nafter State, legislature after legislature, these rights would be \nrestricted by similar laws.\n\n  That is the reason I have introduced the Women's Health Protection \nAct, to stop this invasion--it is truly an invasion--of women's \nreproductive rights. The measure I have introduced would, in effect, \nstrike down such measures, prevent them, so as to reduce, and hopefully \neven eliminate, the cost and the time required for litigation \nchallenging them in State after State, like what happened in Texas \nwhere women have been denied the certain assurance, the basic security \nof knowing that this care will be available to them, because of the \ncontinuing litigation, the costs of lawsuits, and the time-consuming \ncontention and controversy that arises from it.\n  The arbitrary and arcane restrictions imposed by the Texas law \nconcerning admitting privilege requirements and building specifications \nare unrelated to health and safety and clearly create an undue burden \non women's right to choose. That is the legal principle, the core \ntenant that needs to be upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I joined with a number of my colleagues, and in fact led the amicus \nbrief to the Supreme Court, which urges them to reach the right result \nand strike down this law. My hope is that the outcome will not only be \nright for Texas and the women of Texas--and the people of Texas because \nthe right of privacy is not guaranteed only to women, it is to men, and \nthe decisions that women make affect families and children as well as \ntheir spouses. I hope the Supreme Court finally does what Roe v. Wade \nwas thought to do in clear, bright-line text that will prevent States \nfrom intruding with these pretense, ruse laws, supposedly protecting \nhealth when, in fact, all they do is restrict the right to privacy.\n  I am proud to join with my colleagues in fighting these attacks on \nwomen's health care. But I hope that the clerks, as I once was, in the \nSupreme Court will look from those windows today and think to \nthemselves that this case will, in fact, finally settle these issues, \nfinally give women the assurance and security they need.\n  There is no need to keep returning and relitigating these issues. \nThere is no need for this body to consume time and energy on defunding \nPlanned Parenthood. There is no need for these kinds of repeated \nbattles over rights that should be secure and unchallengeable in 21st \nCentury America. Rehashing this fight simply costs us in time and other \nprecious commodities that we should be spending on jobs, economic \nprogress, veterans, national security, investment in infrastructure, \ninvestment in our human capital, and college affordability. All of the \npresent issues--those and others of this day--are what should occupy us \non this floor and occupy the country as we move forward, hopefully \nguaranteeing that the rights in Roe will be real for every American \nwoman.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, which is bipartisan, \nI might\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nadd, and to discuss several amendments that I have submitted.\n  Mr. President, our country is facing a prescription drug epidemic, \nand today is a good step toward addressing this crisis. This is a \ncrisis I have been dealing with since my days as Governor of the great \nState of West Virginia. Opioid abuse is ravaging my State of West \nVirginia and many other States. I know the Presiding Officer has the \nsame problem in Utah. Our State has been hit harder than any other \nState in the country. Drug overdose deaths have soared more than 700 \npercent since 1999. We lost 627 West Virginians to opioids last year \nalone. Mr. President, 61,000 West Virginians used prescription pain \nmedication for nonmedical purposes in 2014. This includes 6,000 \nteenagers. Our State is not unique. Every day in our country, 51 \nAmericans die from opioid abuse. Since 1999 we have lost almost 200,000 \nAmericans to prescription opioid abuse.\n  The fact that we have with the bill in front of us is simply this: It \nis an important first step. It will authorize $77.9 million in grant \nfunding for prevention and recovery efforts, which we need, and expand \nprevention and education efforts particularly aimed at teens, parents \nand other caretakers, and aging populations. It will also prevent the \nabuse of opioids and heroin and promote treatment and recovery. It will \nexpand the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and \nother first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses to save \nlives. It will expand disposal sites for unwanted medication to keep \nthem out of the hands of our children and adolescents. It will also \nlaunch an evidence-based opioid and heroin treatment and intervention \nprogram to expand best practices throughout the country. It will \nstrengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to help States monitor \nand track prescription drug diversion.\n  While the bill is a good start and addresses critical problems, there \nis more that needs to be done. I have a few amendments I want to speak \nabout and explain that I think will improve the bill by changing the \nFDA mission statement, providing grants for consumer education, and \nrequiring prescription prescriber training.\n  First of all, I firmly believe we need cultural change at the FDA. \nThat is why I submitted the Changing the Culture of the FDA Act as an \namendment to this bill. This amendment would strengthen the actions \nthat the FDA recently announced that they were committed to taking into \nconsideration the public health impact of approving opioid medications. \nMind you, what they said is that they were committed to taking it into \nconsideration. I don't think that is much of a change, and it is \ndefinitely not a cultural change. It is a movement in the right \ndirection, which I acknowledge. By solidifying this commitment in the \nagency's mission statement, we ensure that the agency oversees the \napproval of these dangerous drugs and cannot waiver from their stated \ngoals.\n  The language in my amendment is similar to the language in the FDA's \ncurrent mission statement regarding tobacco, and we all know the \ndevastating effects of tobacco. The mission statement says simply this: \n``FDA also has the responsibility for regulating the manufacturing, \nmarketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public \nhealth and to reduce tobacco use by minors.''\n  If we think it is that serious that we put this in the mission \nstatement for tobacco, why can't we do it for opiates? Tobacco kills \nhundreds of thousands of Americans every year, and we have rightly \nrecognized this as a public health crisis. However, opiates killed more \nthan 18,000 people just by the end of 2014. That is 51 people every \nday. This, too, is a public health crisis. It is absolutely ridiculous \nthat the FDA has treated opiates like any other drug up for approval.\n  To date, the agency has failed to consider the devastating public \nhealth impact of their repeated decisions to approve dangerously \naddictive opiates. We have seen that in their resistance to \nrescheduling hydrocodone, their approval of Zohydro against the advice \nof their own advisory committee, and their refusal to consult an \nadvisory committee on other dangerous opioid approvals, including their \ndecision to allow the use of OxyContin in children as young as 11 years \nold. Opioids are simply different from many types of drugs the FDA \noversees. As I noted before, they have killed almost 200,000 people \nsince 1999 and have ruined the lives of countless others.\n  The FDA must be held accountable for their actions. Like our efforts \nto protect the public--particularly children--from the dangers of \ntobacco, the U.S. Congress must take action to ensure that the FDA \ndoes, in fact, do what it has promised to do and take the devastating \npublic health impact of opiate addiction into account when approving \nnew drugs. It is putting it on par with tobacco, that is all. In a \nmission statement, one has more responsibility than just passing it \nthrough as a business plan.\n  My second amendment also relates to the critical role the FDA plays \nin addressing the opiate epidemic. It would require the FDA to seek the \nadvice of its advisory committee before approving any new opiate \nmedication. These are experts, scientists, people who know the makeup \nand composites of these chemicals and what they do to human beings. If \nthe FDA approves a drug against the advice of the advisory committee--\nthat means if they do not take the recommendation by their own experts \nand they wish to put this drug on the market--the agency would be \nrequired to submit a report to us, the people's representatives, the \nCongress, justifying that decision. The approval will be delayed until \nthe report is submitted. Tell us why you won't take the advice of your \nexperts and why you even subvert and basically pay no attention.\n  The FDA plays a critical role in addressing the opiate epidemic as \nthe agency overseeing the approval of these drugs. Under the FDA's own \nrules, they are supposed to convene a committee of scientific experts \nwhen a matter is of significant public interest, highly controversial, \nor in need of a specific type of expertise. With 51 people dying every \nday in the country from an overdose of prescription opiates, it is \nclear that the approval of opiates meets every one of these standards \nand that the FDA should seek the counsel of its expert panel and adhere \nto its recommendations with regard to approving dangerously addictive \nopioids.\n\n  Unfortunately, this hasn't happened. It truly hasn't happened. Let me \ngive an example. It took us 3 years just to get rescheduled from a \nschedule III to a Schedule II all opiates--Zohydro, Vicodin. These are \nthe most widely prescribed opiates. It took us 3 years, which what \nshould have been a 3-week turnaround.\n  The week after they even approved the taking down of these drugs from \na schedule III to a schedule II, which took over 1 billion pills off \nthe market, they came right back and they recommended a drug called \nZohydro. This is a drug that their expert panel had basically advised \n11 to 2 not to put on the market. They failed to seek their council's \nadvice on the concerns with the safety of this drug.\n  Since that time, three new extended-release opioid medications--\nTarginiq, Hysingla, and Morphabond--have been approved without any \nadvisory committee meeting at all. Let me give my reasoning on why I \nthink this happened. There was so much pushback on Zohydro from the \nGovernors, Senators, and Congress people for putting this high-powered \ndrug on the market against the advice of their own council that they \ndidn't want to go through that again, so basically they just skipped it \naltogether and brought these drugs right to market. They also approved \nOxyContin for use in children as young as 11, again without seeking the \nadvice of a pediatric advisory committee. This is a dangerous precedent \nand must stop.\n  I am encouraged that in the FDA's recent announcement on opioid \napprovals, the FDA has finally agreed that the approval of these \npowerful drugs must be subject to an advisory committee. I am very \nconcerned, however, that the FDA will continue to exempt abuse-\ndeterrent opioids from this process and has not promised to abide by \nthe advice. They said they will take it under consideration. They are \nnot bound to take the advice of the advisory committee.\n  While abuse-deterrent formulations, which are harder to crush or \nliquify, have a role to play in reducing the impact of this epidemic, \nthese drugs are\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\nno less addictive than traditional opiates. In addition, in the real \nworld, we have seen these so-called abuse-deterrent properties easily \novercome. The tragic HIV outbreak we saw in Scott County, IN, last year \noccurred after hundreds of people in that community shared needles to \nshoot up Opana. They used the same needle to shoot up Opana--something \nthat should have not been possible if it were truly abuse-deterrent.\n  This amendment would solidify the FDA's commitment to seek the advice \nof an advisory committee when approving opioid medications and would \nstrengthen it by extending that commitment to all opioids and by \nholding the FDA accountable. The FDA does not listen to its own \nexperts. This is such a reasonable request and such a reasonable \namendment to protect all the people in all of our States. It is a \ncommonsense measure that would ensure that the FDA is fully considering \nthe public health impact and the many lives lost as a result of these \ndangerous opioid medications.\n  Another amendment I have is on mandatory prescriber education. This \nepidemic is one that needs to be fought on all fronts, but most \nimportantly, we need to fight it on the frontlines with prescribers, \nwhich is precisely what my third amendment seeks to do. It requires \nmedical practitioners, our doctors--the people we trust--it basically \nrequires them to receive training. You would think they are getting \ntraining on this now, but they are not. There is no specific training, \ngoing through school or at any other time, on the safe prescribing of \nopiates prior to receiving and renewing their DEA license to prescribe \na controlled substance. That is all we are saying. This training must \ninclude information on safe opioid prescribing guidelines, the risks of \noverprescribing opioid medication, pain management, early detection of \nopiate addiction, and the treatment of opiate-dependent patients. This \nis something only the doctors can do. These are the people writing on \ntheir prescription pads, sending them to the pharmacists, and \nfulfilling all of our prescriptions. We are asking for them to have \nthat type of required training when they get their DEA license and \nrenew their DEA license.\n  This must be fought on all fronts, but most importantly we need to \nfight it on the frontlines with the prescribers. According to the \nNational Institutes of Health, more than 259 million prescriptions were \nwritten in 2012. Think about that--259 million prescriptions were \nwritten in 2012 just in the United States for opiate painkillers. That \nequals one bottle of pain pills for every adult in the United States of \nAmerica. We are the most addicted country on planet Earth. With a \npopulation of less than 5 percent of us living in this great country of \nours, we consume 80 percent of the opiates produced in the world. The \nother 6.7 billion people don't use what we use. Why? That is a 400-\npercent increase in the number of prescriptions since 1999. In a little \nover a decade, there has been a 400-percent increase, and we are \npumping out more pills, thinking this is going to cure America. This is \nwithout a corresponding increase in reported pain. They are not \ncomplaining any more about pain; they are just getting more pills. But \nit has come with a corresponding 400-percent increase in overdose \ndeaths. So if overdose deaths are related to the increase of pills on \nthe market, don't you think we ought to do something about it? It is \npretty simple.\n  I have too many stories from my constituents that they receive \nsignificantly more pain medication than they need to treat their pain, \nand those extra pills increase the risk of addiction for individuals \nand are dangerous for society if diverted. Someone can get their teeth \nworked on, get their teeth extracted, and they will get 30 days of pain \npills when they may only need them for 1 or 2 days. It is ridiculous.\n  I hear from physicians themselves that they do not receive enough \ntraining. These are doctors telling us it is not in their basic \neducation as they go through medical school--prescribing these drugs--\nor even after they leave medical school. There is no continuing \neducation demanded about this. Until we ensure that every prescriber \nhas a strong understanding of the state of opiate prescribing practices \nand the very great risk of opiate addiction, abuse, and overdose \ndeaths, we will continue to see too many people prescribed these \ndangerous drugs which can lead them down the tragic path of addiction.\n  Finally, we must improve our consumer education efforts. My fourth \namendment would establish consumer education grants through SAMHSA to \nraise awareness about the risks of opiate addiction and overdose. There \nare 2.1 million Americans addicted to opiates. Many of these \nindividuals began the road to addiction with a seemingly innocent \nprescription and little or no warning about the danger from a \nphysician. They weren't told they could be addicted. They weren't told \nthey would be hooked and it would change their life forever. Or it \nbegan when a friend offered a pill that they thought couldn't be that \ndangerous because a doctor had given it to them: Here, I have got \nsomething that will help you. Try this.\n\n  And they get started. There is simply too little understanding about \nthe dangers of these drugs, and too many get sucked into opioid \naddiction because they don't understand the risk and because the people \nclose to them don't know how to recognize the signs of addiction or \nknow how to access the resources to help their loved ones.\n  It is the silent killer. It is the one we all keep quiet--every one \nof us. Every one of us in America knows somebody--either in our \nimmediate family, extended family or a close friend--who has been \naffected, but we say nothing. Use and abuse of prescription drugs cost \nthe country an estimated $53.4 billion a year in lost productivity. \nThese are people who can't function, who can't work, and are basically \ndrawing off of their unemployment or off of their insurance.\n  Medical costs and criminal justice costs--you name it. You talk to \nany law enforcement anywhere in the United States of America and they \nwill all tell you a minimum of 80 percent of the crimes that are \nreported that they have to go and serve are drug related--80 percent. \nSo the cost is probably even higher than that.\n  This amendment provides $15 million a year to help prevent these \ncosts in the first place. It makes sense. That is $15 million. OK, you \nare going to say: Oh, that is a lot of money.\n  Let me just tell say that as a society we regularly invest in efforts \nto prevent unnecessary deaths. We already have done that, and we \ncontinue to do that. Thirty thousand people died in car accidents in \n2013, and we invested $668 million in motor vehicle safety and accident \nprevention. That is more than $22,000 per death that we have invested \ntrying to prevent people from getting killed in automobile accidents, \ndriving safely, DUI, everything. With 28,000 people dying of \nprescription opioid or heroin overdose in 2014, this $15 million \nfunding represents an investment of $500 per person for a life that we \ncould save. We spend $22,000 trying to prevent accidents in \nautomobiles.\n  As to opiates, all we are asking for is a $500 investment to save \ntheir lives. We have to put our priorities where our values are, and we \ncan do that. The grants that would be authorized under this amendment \nwould help those on the frontlines of this terrible epidemic to provide \ntheir communities with the information they need to help stop the \nspread of opioid addiction and to help people seek treatment. This \nfunding will better enable us to educate individuals about the dangers \nof opioid abuse.\n  There are practices to prevent opioid abuse, including the safe \ndisposal of unused medication and how to detect the warnings of early \naddiction. I would venture to say that most people do not know how to \nlook at their children and know that there is a chance that they may \nget addicted or are getting addicted. It is sometimes too late.\n  It will help us save lives by raising awareness about the dangers of \nprescription opioid medications to prevent opioid addiction in the \nfirst place and ensuring that loved ones know how to help when a friend \nor family member becomes addicted.\n  This amendment that we are asking for, this amendment that I am \nasking for is one that really makes sense. If we can't educate the \npublic, then we have little chance of ever curing this epidemic.\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\n  We have had a lot of talk about the funds and how much money we are \nspending. We just had a final amendment that I would like to address, \nas there is a great need for funding to pay for substance abuse \ntreatment.\n  Well, I strongly agree with my colleagues who supported Senator \nShaheen's amendment to provide $600 million in funding, which we \ndesperately need to support Federal programs that work to prevent \nopioid abuse and provide much needed treatment.\n  If you look at the amount of money it is costing now for \nincarceration, all the lost time, all of the drug-related crimes that \nhave been committed, it would have been an investment well made, but I \nknow there are people who believe differently.\n  In 2014, 42,000 West Virginians, including 4,000 youths, sought \ntreatment for illegal drug use but failed to receive it. There was no \nplace to get it. In your State and my State people are looking. \nSometimes they are looking for this, and there is no place to put them. \nIf you have day courts or drug courts in your State, they will tell \nyou: We have no place to put them. There is no place to get the \ntreatment to cure a person who truly is looking for a cure. This is \njust unacceptable. There are people who recognize that they need it, \nand they beg for it. They have been turned away because there simply \nweren't enough facilities, beds or health care providers in their \ncommunity.\n  But we spend money every year building new prisons all over the \ncountry. We have a backlog, and we have an overcrowding prison \npopulation. We know from long experience that when a person asks for \nhelp, that is our opportunity. If we turn them away, they will never \ncome back. They just don't when they are turned away. That is why I \nwish to introduce this amendment, and I would like a very vigorous \ndiscussion on it.\n  We have tobacco, which we know is very dangerous and kills people. It \nis harmful, and we spend a lot of money trying to prevent people from \nusing it and young people from starting to use it. We even tax it. We \ntax it so that basically we can deter the use of it.\n  We have alcohol. We know alcohol can be very addictive and, \nbasically, it ruins people's lives. We know that and we tax that. We \nhave nothing on opioids--nothing.\n  What we are asking for is consideration of a 1-cent fee on every \nmilligram of opiates that are produced--one penny per milligram. This \nfee would be levied on the pharmaceutical company, and the money raised \nwill be used to create a permanent funding stream to strengthen the \nsubstance abuse prevention and treatment block grant.\n  I know so many people have taken a pledge: We are not going to pass \nany new taxes.\n  I understand that. We are really at a crunch. We basically have cut \nback, and our military is struggling. Every part of a program that we \nthink is near and dear to our States and to the people in our States is \nhaving trouble. I am not asking to take away from another one. I am \nasking that this one penny per milligram of opioids that are produced \nin this country would give us permanent funding to start having the \ntreatment centers that we so desperately need. I don't know of any \nother way to do it in a more compassionate way. We do it for \ncigarettes; we do it for alcohol. We have opiates killing more than all \nof that. I am just asking for that dialog, that consideration. It could \nbe something of a bipartisan movement, because this silent killer--\nopiates--doesn't have a partisan home. It is not Democratic. It is not \nRepublican. It is not Independent. It is killing Americans--all of us.\n  The substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant goes to the \nStates to pay for critical substance abuse treatment programs. The new \nfunding raised, which is based on past opiate sales--I am basing it on \npast opiate sales--could be anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion \na year, and all the States will be able to participate. Every State \nwould participate in these moneys that would be available. They could \nbe used by States to establish new addiction treatment facilities, to \nimprove access to drug courts, to operate support programs for \nrecovering addicts, to care for babies born with neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome or to meet any other treatment need that your State or my \nState might face. These treatments save lives and strengthened \ncommunities. We are losing a generation, a whole generation.\n  Opioid producers have made billions of dollars selling their drugs \nover the past several decades. I am not here railing against the \npharmaceuticals. They do a lot of good for our country and save a lot \nof lives too. This is one that doesn't, and this one has been proven \nthat it is a killer.\n  This amendment asks them to contribute a small portion of their \nprofits to help pay for this treatment. Everyone says: They are going \nto pass it on. Don't worry; you will be paying more. This is one time, \none penny--one penny a milligram. That is all we are asking.\n  For the 2.1 million Americans who are addicted to their products, my \namendment also provides exemptions. I am talking about the exemptions \nnow because I know people are going to say: What about our veterans? \nWhat about those in severe chronic pain? What about those who are \nterminally ill?\n  We have, basically, exemptions built into this amendment for those \npeople, so they are not put into hardship, and for the neediest in our \ncountry. They are not going to be put in a hardship.\n  This is a cost that if we look at it, I don't know of any other way \nto fix it. I really don't. I know people have taken pledges: We are not \ngoing to do this, not going to do that, not going to consider it. Well, \nyou ought to consider the damage that is doing to America. I am not \nasking for any other program to be sacrificed at all. So I think this \nis responsible. This one penny. That is all I am asking for--one penny.\n  I am pleased the Senate is addressing this epidemic. It is in a \nbipartisan way. We have the CARA package in front of us. I appreciate \nthat, and I know we all have a great passion for trying to cure this.\n  This is how we need to work to solve the major challenges in our \ncountry that face us. I am pleased to see we are going through regular \norder. We have amendments that we are able to put on and talk about. I \nthink it is worthy to have these discussions. We must provide the \ncritical resources needed, and I think we have a solution to that. I \nhope we can have that discussion. I hope all of us can have an adult \ndiscussion about how we save Americans, how we save our families, our \nchildren, and the next generations to come.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues and with you to \nsee if there is a better way we can strengthen and make a piece of \nlegislation better than what it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my friend \nfrom West Virginia and his work on this issue that has hit West \nVirginia and, particularly, southeast Ohio kind of first and hardest. \nBut it has spread to so many other places and caused so much heartache \nand so much family disruption--not just for the young men or women, in \nthe case of young people who are addicted, but the whole family. As one \nmother of a teenager said to me in Youngstown, OH, or in Warren, OH, \none day, this is really a family affair.\n  I am pleased to see bipartisan support for finally tackling the \nopioid addiction epidemic. It has touched every State and almost every \ncommunity in our country. In 2014, more people died from drug overdoses \nthan any year on record, with 2,482 in Ohio. That is a record number of \nprescription drug overdoses and a record 1,177 overdoses related to \nheroin. People often start with pain medication, sometimes \noverprescribed prescription medicine that will, in far too many cases, \nlead to heroin addiction. Heroin is cheaper to buy on the street than \nfor people to get OxyContin or oxycodone or Percocet or any number of \nlegal morphine pain medications.\n  These numbers mean that in 1 year alone, 2,500 Ohioan families lost a \nloved one to addiction. What those numbers don't account for are the \nthousands of other families and hundreds of other communities that \ncontinue to struggle with opioid abuse. It should not be easier for \nAmericans to get their hands on opioids than it is for them to get help \nto treat their addiction. It should not be easier for Americans to get \ntheir hands on opioids than it is to get help to treat their addiction.\n  Addiction is not an individual problem. It surely is not a character \nflaw,\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nas many people half a generation ago liked to say when it was people \nwho didn't look like them. But the fact is it was not a character flaw \nthen and it is not a character flaw now. It is a chronic disease.\n  When left untreated, it places a massive burden on our health care \nsystem and a terrible, terrible cost on families who have an addicted \nfamily member. When we think about this epidemic, we have in our minds \na young worker who turned to painkillers after a back injury or a car \naccident, someone who started with oxycodone--maybe as a party drug--\nand then turned to heroin. This problem is bigger than that.\n  Our national conversation forgets the hundreds of thousands of \nseniors who often are given unsafe and duplicative prescriptions for \nopioids. It is not uncommon for seniors to be treated by multiple \nspecialists and physicians. Doctors may not know they are prescribing \nduplicative painkillers, meaning this doctor prescribed a painkiller--\nmaybe oxycodone or OxyContin or Vicodin or another--and this other \ndoctor may have done the same thing. They weren't communicating, and \ndidn't know. Seniors find it difficult to manage all of their different \nprescriptions far too often.\n  Take, for example, Ohioan Dennis Michelson. I met him at the Benjamin \nRose Institute on Aging in Cleveland last August. He is one of the \nestimated 170,000 Medicare beneficiaries who recently battled an \naddiction to pain medication.\n  He was prescribed pain medication by his doctor to manage chronic \nmigraines. When his primary care doctor sought to wean him off the \nmedication, he went to other doctors and pharmacists to obtain those \nopioids. He was eventually arrested and charged with felonies for \ntampering with prescriptions. He has since recovered. He is now an \nadvocate for reform to address the prescription drug epidemic.\n  After hearing his story, it strikes me that if a patient with \nlegitimate and sometimes complex medical needs winds up getting pain \nmedication from several different doctors--you could see how that would \nhappen; none of those doctors know about one another--the system has \nfailed the patient.\n  It is why I worked with Senator Toomey from Pennsylvania to introduce \nthe Stopping Medication Abuse and Protecting Seniors Act. I was proud \nto see this body support it as an amendment today. We already have a \nproven tool to address the problem of patients getting duplicative \nopioids from multiple doctors and pharmacists. It is called Patient \nReview & Restriction Programs. But despite their success in State \nMedicaid programs and commercial plans, these programs aren't available \nin Medicare prescriptions under current law. That is the purpose of the \nToomey-Brown amendment and what we are trying to fix.\n  The amendment will ensure that a small number of seniors who receive \nhigh doses of addictive opioids from multiple doctors get those \npainkillers from one doctor and one pharmacist. It is what we did on \nso-called Medicaid lock-in--for people who were abusing the system on \npurpose or more likely those who sort of fell into this trap and went \nfrom doctor to doctor, pharmacist to pharmacist, in some sense doctor \nshopping or pharmacy shopping--so that practice would end. We have done \nthe same sort of thing now with so-called Medicare lock-in. It would \nsave taxpayers $100 million over the next decade. It will reduce \noverprescribing, and it will crack down on fraud.\n\n  I am pleased we have bipartisan support for this commonsense measure, \nbut this amendment and this bill are a step. We need a comprehensive \napproach that addresses the entire spectrum of addiction from crisis to \nrecovery. I have introduced the Heroin and Prescription Drug Abuse \nPrevention and Reduction Act. It will boost prevention efforts, it will \nimprove tools for crisis response, it will expand access to treatment, \nand it will provide support for lifelong recovery.\n  Addiction is chronic. It doesn't mean that when somebody overcomes \ntheir addiction and seems to defeat it, it won't come back later in \nlife. If we are serious about fighting this epidemic, we have to make \nsure we provide a serious investment that will deliver results long \nterm.\n  My colleagues, Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire and Senator \nWhitehouse of Rhode Island, introduced an amendment that would have \nprovided $600 million to fight this epidemic. It would have gone \ndirectly to public health workers, directly to law enforcement \nofficials who are working on the frontlines of this battle every day. \nIt would have shown constituents we are serious about addressing this \ncrisis.\n  I was disappointed this body was unwilling and unable to find the \nmoney necessary to address these problems. This legislation is a good \nbill. Without the money, it is a good bill, but it is really only half \na good bill because my colleagues are simply unwilling--maybe it is the \ntea party influence, maybe they are afraid of a Republican rightwing \nprimary, whatever it is--to ante up the dollars that would fully help \nus deal with this epidemic. We can't do this without an investment.\n  I met with a number of tuberculosis experts in my office today. We \nhave been successful in this country with eliminating smallpox, \neliminating polio, and keeping Ebola from being contracted in the \nUnited States and killing any Americans. We have done all of that \nbecause we invested in a public health system. We can't address this \nopioid epidemic without dollars. Yet my colleagues will simply always \nback off and say: Well, we can't afford to do this. They can afford tax \ncuts for wealthy people, and they can afford continuing to pump money \ninto expensive weapons systems, but they will not spend money to \naddress probably the most serious public health crisis we have seen in \nthis country in years.\n  Once again, I say that it should not be easier for Americans to get \ntheir hands on opioids than it is to get help to treat their addiction. \nThis Senate should get serious about this. We should pass this bill, to \nbe sure, but there is so much else. I am distressed my colleagues chose \nnot to step up to the plate and do what deep down they know we should \ndo.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier today, I missed the vote on the \nShaheen amendment No. 3345. If I had voted, I would have voted yea.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for \ntoday's amendment votes in relation to S. 524, the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act of 2015.\n  On amendment No. 3362 by Senator Feinstein, I would have voted yea.\n  On the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. \n3395 by Senator Wyden, I would have voted yea.\n  On the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. \n3345 by Senator Shaheen, I would have voted yea.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation takes a strong and balanced approach to \ntackling the prescription drug and heroin epidemic our Nation faces, \nand I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  I would like to note the hard work by many of my colleagues and their \nstaffs--Senators Whitehouse, Ayotte, Coons, Kirk, Klobuchar, and \nPortman. Their States have been especially hard hit by this epidemic, \nand this bill would help alleviate some of the suffering.\n  We are all well aware of the sobering statistics. Drug overdoses kill \nmore than 120 Americans each day--more than motor vehicle crashes or \ngunshot wounds. Opioid and heroin overdoses account for more than half \nof these deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, in 2014, 25,760 people died from prescription drugs, and of \nthat, 18,893 deaths were caused by opioid painkillers. Heroin caused an \nadditional 10,574 deaths.\n  These numbers have continually increased over the past 15 years, and \ntoday we are in the midst of an epidemic. That is why we need this \nbill. We need a comprehensive response to a problem that has touched \nevery State of our country.\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act strengthens our \nsubstance abuse prevention, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement \ninfrastructure. While it focuses on prescription opioid abuse and \nheroin use, it also has the potential to help other drug problems that \nwe face. Specifically, it authorizes a number of programs to: ensure \naccess to appropriate, evidence-based medical treatment; address local \nand emerging drug threats and trends; equip first responders with \nlifesaving tools, such as Naloxone, an opioid overdose-reversal drug; \nand strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to reduce \noverprescribing, doctor shopping, and ultimately overdose deaths. The \nbill also establishes an interagency task force on pain management and \nopioid painkiller prescribing. The overprescription and overuse of \nthese drugs are a major factor in this epidemic.\n  Lastly, to examine ways to improve access to drug treatment, the bill \nrequires a Government Accountability Office study on the 16-bed limit \nfor Medicaid reimbursement to drug treatment programs, also known as \nthe Institutions for Mental Disease exclusion.\n  The holistic nature of this bill is a clear step in the right \ndirection. It also supports the administration's efforts to confront \nthis epidemic and can help accomplish the goals laid out in the 2015 \nNational Drug Control Strategy.\n  However, there are two things that I believe would have made this \ncomprehensive bill even more effective: 1, addressing the sheer volume \nand availability of opioid painkillers; and 2, full funding.\n  First, on the widespread availability of prescription opioids, I \nwould like to outline a few often-cited facts from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. Health care providers wrote 259 million \nprescriptions for opioid painkillers in 2012. This was enough for every \nAmerican adult to have their own bottle of pills. Since 1999, the sale \nof prescription opioid painkillers has increased by 300 percent. At the \nsame time, there has been no change in the amount of pain patients \nreported. During this same time period, deaths from overdose of \nprescription opioid painkillers quadrupled.\n  Additionally, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 20 \npercent of people ages 12 and older have used prescription drugs \nnonmedically at least once. The majority of those who abuse \nprescription opioids get them for free from a friend or relative, often \nfrom legitimate prescriptions written in excess.\n  And, over the past 5 years, the Drug Enforcement Administration has \ncollected more than 5.5 million pounds of unused or unwanted drugs, \nincluding opioids.\n  Moreover, data from Express Scripts shows that while there are fewer \nindividuals filling prescriptions for opioids, the overall number of \nprescriptions filled, as well as the number of days per prescription, \nboth increased.\n  All of this shows there are simply too many pills available for \ndiversion and abuse, and I believe better prescribing practices can \nplay an important role in reducing excess supply.\n  Our doctors and health care providers must improve the way they \nprescribe these opioids, to ensure safe and effective pain relief, but \nalso to prevent misuse and overdose. At the same time, we must also \nmaintain appropriate access for legitimate medical needs.\n  Updated guidelines, such as those the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention will soon release, will help improve prescribing practices. \nIncreased prescriber education can also help.\n  I am also looking into the possibility of responsibly regulating \ninitial opioid prescriptions to reduce risk for misuse, addiction, and \ndiversion. In my view, a patient who has a simple dental procedure does \nnot need a 30-day supply of Vicodin. This is the type of prescribing \nthat I believe we need to fix. Second, a bill like this can only have a \npositive impact if its programs are actually funded.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, has introduced an \namendment that would provide emergency funding for the programs \nauthorized in this bill, and I urge its passage.\n  I do not need to tell you that opioid and heroin abuse are very \nserious problems, but today we have an opportunity to address the issue \nhead-on and save lives. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting \nfor this important bill.\n  Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the United States is in the midst of a \nfull-blown drug crisis. More people died from drug overdoses in 2014 \nthan any previous year on record, claiming more lives than car \naccidents across the country. Since 2000, there has been a 200 percent \nincrease in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioid pain relievers \nand heroin, with 61 percent of all drug overdose deaths in 2014 \ninvolving some type of opioid.\n  These tragedies are proof of the fierce bonds of addiction, and it \nseems no State has been spared from the opioid epidemic. In my State of \nCalifornia, deaths involving prescription pain medications have \nincreased by 16.5 percent since 2006. In fact, there were more than \n1,800 opioid-related deaths in 2012 alone, and 72 percent of those \ninvolved prescription pain medications.\n  We cannot ignore the opioid crisis anymore. This is not a problem for \nonly the local communities or State officials. This is a nationwide \ncrisis and addressing it requires a multi-pronged response at all \nlevels of government. Last year, California was one of only 16 States \nselected to receive funding from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC to help improve safe prescribing of opioid painkillers, \nan important step forward in tackling the root cause of this \ndebilitating drug crisis.\n  The pain and sorrow of drug addiction knows no limits. This is a \ntragedy that impacts families from all backgrounds, including our \nservicemembers and veterans. There is substantial evidence that \nprescription drug use and abuse is a major contributing factor to \nmilitary and veteran suicides. This has been a concern of mine for \nseveral years, and I was proud to work with my colleagues in 2013 to \nensure that military and veterans hospitals were included in the Drug \nEnforcement Administration's prescription drug takeback efforts so that \nour military personnel, veterans, and their families could voluntarily \ndispose of unwanted or unused prescription drugs.\n  However, much more must be done to combat this epidemic. To address \nthis emergency fully and effectively, we need to provide immediate \nfunding to the key grant programs included in the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, CARA. I applaud Senator Shaheen and Senator \nWhitehouse for introducing an amendment to give the Department of \nJustice, DOJ, and the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, the \ntools they need to fund the essential prevention, treatment, and law \nenforcement programs to help the families and communities torn apart by \ndrug abuse.\n  American lives are on the line, and we cannot wait to act. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

HELLERSTEDT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court heard the oral \narguments in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. At issue in this case \nis a Texas law that puts restrictions on women's health clinics and \nproviders.\n  Contrary to what proponents claim, these restrictions do not enhance \nwomen's health in any way. They are medically unnecessary, according to \ngroups like the American Medical Association and the American College \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Instead, these restrictions serve \njust one purpose: to restrict women's access to clinics.\n  If the Texas law stands, nearly three-quarters of the State's clinics \nwill be\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\nforced to close. That would leave just 10 clinics statewide to serve \n5.4 million Texan women of reproductive age. But unfortunately, this is \nthe type of thing we have come to expect from the State of Texas. The \nTexas Legislature and Governor have already passed laws that infringe \non its citizens' constitutional rights.\n  For example, the State has passed laws that limit victims' ability to \nrecover much-deserved damages after accidents. And they have passed one \nof the strictest voter ID laws in the Nation. We are seeing the results \nof the State's pattern of undermining their citizens' constitutional \nrights. Just yesterday it was reported that more than half a million \nregistered voters in Texas can't even vote.\n  This is the pattern of disenfranchisement Texas is engaged in. The \nState's women are, sadly, the latest example of Texas infringing on \nimportant constitutional rights. Though it is not entirely surprising \nthat the radical Republicans in Texas have targeted women's health, it \nis nonetheless disappointing. I hope the Supreme Court will choose to \nprotect women's health and strike down this disastrous Texas law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1219-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE GEORGIA PUBLIC POLICY FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize a \ngreat leader in Georgia politics, a leader that studies hard, presents \nideas, and analyzes State public policy issues to educate citizens and \nenhance economic opportunity. This leader is not a person but an \norganization that is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2016: the \nGeorgia Public Policy Foundation.\n  Established in 1991, the foundation is an independent, State-focused \nthink tank that proposes market-oriented approaches to public policy to \nimprove the lives of Georgians. Whether they are aware of it or not, \nGeorgians have benefitted from the positive line of influential leaders \nof this organization, including my good friend Rogers Wade. It was \nfounded by a great Georgian, Hank McCamish, and today is led by a \nGeorgian who will leave another great legacy of his own, Kelly \nMcCutcheon.\n  Through dozens of events each year, facilitating discussions between \nState members and political, education, media, and business leaders, \nthe Georgia Public Policy Foundation has lived up to its motto: \n``Changing Georgia Policy, Changing Georgians' Lives since 1991.''\n  The Georgia Public Policy Foundation performs scholarly research and \nanalysis of State public policy issues and works to educate citizens, \npolicymakers, and the media. It maintains a State-focused, independent, \nnonpartisan, and market-oriented approach to improve the lives of \nGeorgians, and it affords opportunities for advocacy membership and \nvolunteering.\n  The Georgia Public Policy Foundation helps shape meaningful policy on \neducation, the environment, criminal justice, government reform, health \ncare, legal reform, regulation, spending, taxes, transportation, and \nwelfare reform.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 2617. A bill to provide for the development of a United States \nstrategy for greater human space exploration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mapping a New and Innovative \n     Focus on Our Exploration Strategy for Human Spaceflight Act \n     of 2016'' or the ``MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of \n     2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Reaffirmation of Policy.--Congress reaffirms that the \n     long-term goal of the human space flight and exploration \n     efforts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     shall be to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth \n     orbit and to do so, where practical, in a manner involving \n     international partners, as stated in section 202(a) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization \n     Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312(a)).\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of \n     2010 (Public Law 111-267; 124 Stat. 2813), the National \n     Academy of Sciences, through its Committee on Human \n     Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core \n     capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and \n     published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report \n     entitled ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches \n     for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration''.\n       (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders \n     from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy \n     communities. With input from the public, the Committee on \n     Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and \n     aspirational rationales together constitute a compelling case \n     for\n\n[[Page S1224]]\n\n     human space exploration. These rationales include economic \n     benefits, national security, national prestige, inspiring \n     students and other citizens, scientific discovery, human \n     survival, and a sense of shared destiny.\n       (3) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars \n     is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight \n     program.\n       (4) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration define a series \n     of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and \n     technology development as needed to achieve the long-term \n     goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars.\n\n     SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY.\n\n       (a) Human Exploration of Mars.--Section 202(b) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization \n     Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) to achieve human exploration of Mars, including the \n     establishment of a capability to extend human presence to the \n     surface of Mars.''.\n       (b) Exploration Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--In accordance with this subsection, the \n     Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration shall submit an interim report and final \n     report setting forth a strategy to achieve the objective in \n     paragraph (5) of section 202(b) of the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, as \n     amended by subsection (a) of this section, through a series \n     of successive, sustainable, free-standing, but complementary \n     missions making robust utilization of cis-lunar space and \n     employing the Space Launch System, Orion crew capsule, and \n     other capabilities provided under titles III, IV, V, and IX \n     of that Act (42 U.S.C. 18301 et seq.).\n       (2) Strategy requirements.--In developing the strategy \n     under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall include--\n       (A) the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar \n     space toward enabling missions to various lunar orbits, the \n     lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, the moons of Mars, and other \n     destinations of interest for future human exploration and \n     development;\n       (B) the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar \n     space for economic, scientific, and technological advances;\n       (C) the opportunities for collaboration with--\n       (i) international partners;\n       (ii) private industry;

A bill to require the Secretary of Commerce to carry out a \npilot program on the award of financial assistance to local governments \nto support the development of startup businesses, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I am introducing the Startup \nEntrepreneur Empowerment Delivery, SEED, Act today to address the \nchallenges faced by startup businesses in North Dakota, as well as \nother rural States and small cities, by helping them get the early \nstage funding they need to grow their business.\n  Access to capital is one of the single largest barriers between \nstartup businesses and success. This bill addresses the unique needs of \nstartup companies in our country's more rural States by creating a \npilot program through the U.S. Department of Commerce aimed at \nproviding small amounts of capital to qualifying startups.\n  Innovation does not just happen in Silicon Valley or at our country's \nbiggest research institutions. Innovative ideas are blooming in our \nheartland and startups are forming on our main streets making the \nentrepreneurial ecosystem of our smaller cities stronger than ever \nbefore. But too often, we hear the same challenges from startups and \nsmall businesses that they are trying to fit a square peg into a round \nhole, meaning they run into the barrier of not being able to qualify \nfor Federal support or Federal programs because they are asking for too \nlittle funding. We can't let these innovators slip through the cracks.\n  The Startup Entrepreneur Empowerment Delivery, SEED, Act would grant \nfinancial assistance to ten small sized cities across the country which \nthen would make awards directly to startups to use for marketing, \ninfrastructure, recruitment and hiring resources. This bill directly \naddresses the concerns that I continue to hear from startups in North \nDakota and will help drive them to success and reinvest and diversify \nthe local economies of our Nation's more rural areas.\n  With my SEED Act, we can invest in small cities, in rural States, \nlike North Dakota, helping drive startups to success. Just like anyone \nfrom a small or rural town, we know how to make a little go a long way, \nand this bill will help make that possible. The SEED Act will allow the \nFederal Government to continue its priority of investing in innovation \nand will ensure those investments are felt in America's heartland.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Tester, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 2621. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to genetically engineered food transparency and \nuniformity; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the genius of America was a government \ndesigned, as President Lincoln so eloquent summarized, ``Of the people, \nby the people, for the people.''\n  I will be rising periodically to address issues that affect Americans \nacross our country and that this Chamber should be addressing. This \nweek I am using my speech to highlight the labeling of genetically \nmodified foods. This is truly a ``We the people'' versus ``We the \nTitans'' battle because citizens routinely poll in very high numbers \nabout their desire to know what is in their food, and they like the \nidea of being alerted when their food contains genetically modified \norganisms or GMOs, but that is not necessarily the consequence, as when \nwe go through the legislative process, often the ``We the people's'' \ncommonsense vision is lost in favor of pressures applied by powerful \ninterest groups. We are in the middle of a debate like that right now. \nSo that is why I thought it appropriate to rise at this moment to \naddress this.\n  This is a debate about whether you believe that in a democracy, \ncitizens have a right to know or whether that right to know is going to \nbe taken away from them. I guess it goes to whether you feel that \ncitizens have the minds they are put on this Earth with to make \ndecisions of their own versus being told what decisions to make by a \nFederal Government.\n  This debate over genetically modified organisms is a debate that gets \ncomplicated because there are tremendous differences in the types of \ngenetic changes in plants. Let me give you some examples. You might \nhave a crop where the crop has been modified genetically in the \nlaboratory to produce natural toxins that defend plants against root-\ndwelling insect pests. Perhaps as a result of that, the farmers can \nreduce the amount of synthetic pesticides they apply to crop lands. \nThat might be a very positive thing. It might save a lot of money, and \nit also might save a lot of runoff of pesticides. That is one example.\n  Other crops have been modified to fortify foods with vitamins and \nnutrients. For example, golden rice, developed by the International \nRice Institute, provides greater amounts of vitamin A to reduce the \ndeficiency of this essential vitamin in our diets. There are other \npositive impacts. For example, you have transgenic carrots--carrots \nthat have been modified genetically to produce drugs inside the carrot \nto treat the genetic disorder known as Goucher's disease. Other genetic \nmodifications have been used to attempt to increase crop yields through \nmore efficient photosynthesis.\n  So that is a whole variety of different ways of trying to make plants \ncontribute better to our nutrition and certainly in terms of the \ndynamics to the farming environment, but there are also changes that \nare made that raise concerns among some of our citizens. For example, \nmost of the genetically modified crops grown in the United States have \nbeen altered to confer resistance to a chemical herbicide known as \nglyphosate. I was looking at a chart. I do not have it to display, but \nI will describe it. After the introduction of these GMO crops in the \nearly 1990s, the amount of acreage that has been planted with \nglyphosate-resistant crops has gone to nearly 100 percent. With \nsoybeans, it went to 100 percent by about 2005--just about every \nsoybean plant in America. Glyphosate-resistant cotton, virtually all \ncotton, falls into that category, and a great deal of the corn, the \nvast majority of the corn planted in our country falls into that \ncategory.\n  So now we have millions of acres being sprayed with glyphosate. At \nfirst glance, one might say: Well, that is a great thing because it is \nan easy way to reduce weeds--but often Mother Nature is complicated. \nFor example, when you have all of that glyphosate being sprayed on acre \nafter acre, millions of acres, the weeds start to evolve a resistance \nto it. Then that resistance means you have to put more herbicides on \nthan before. So that is a concern or, for example, as you put more \nglyphosate on, you have more glyphosate runoff, and that runoff becomes \na concern because you have herbicides running off into our waterways, \nand that can have an impact on sensitive aquatic species, including \nfish, mussels, amphibians, microorganisms. So it merits study, but it \nis certainly something to be concerned about.\n  You can also have the impact of going to a separate item in which you \nhave, as I mentioned as a positive, the fact that plants have been \ngenetically modified to resist certain bugs that attack the roots. \nWestern corn rootworm is an example of that, but now it appears to be \nevolving to eat the corn that was bioengineered to kill it because, \nover time, with millions and millions of acres, there is some genetic \nchange, and some worm that would have been killed because it has a \ngenetic diversity and genetic changes is now resistant. It produces \noffspring, and suddenly you have a bug that is sometimes referred to as \nsuperbugs that are evolving to be resistant to pesticides. What is the \nimpact of that?\n  Let me give you another example. We had a huge drop in the population \nof Monarch butterflies, magnificent creatures. I think humans just see \na Monarch and they fall in love, just seeing one beautiful butterfly. \nOf course, these butterflies manage to travel thousands of miles in the \ncourse of their lives, which is just stunning that such a fragile, \nbeautiful, little creature could travel so far to go way south in order \nto reproduce and come way back north. When we apply huge amounts of \nglyphosate herbicides, one of the side effects is that it kills a lot \nof the plants; that is, the milkweed, that the Monarch eats. So you \nhave an attack on the Monarch. That is not the only impact on the \nMonarch, but it is a contributing factor, and the result is that it has \ncontributed to a crash in this population.\n  To summarize, you have many potential positive impacts of genetic \nengineering, and you have many potential concerns from genetically \nengineered crops.So there are considerations that need to be balanced. \nSome individuals hear that and are not concerned at all. They say: It \nis fine. I want to buy products that are genetically engineered or I \nwould like to buy these and not those. Others say: I am really \nconcerned about a specific feature of genetically modified crops, and I \ndon't want to use my dollars to buy that crop and contribute to the \nproblem I am concerned about. This is an adult conversation. It is a \ncomplex conversation. There are benefits and there are disadvantages \nand there are more studies to be done to discover just how much the \nconcern should be. Some individuals are concerned that with this huge \namount of biphosphate being sprayed--and biphosphate is now a known \ncarcinogen--is there any residue that stays on the crops that people \nharvest and eat. So they are concerned about that.\n  That is why labeling is leveling the field. It allows those who are \nconcerned to know what is going on. It allows those who are not \nconcerned to not pay attention. My daughter happens to like to look at \ningredient lists and tries not to consume high-fructose corn syrup. It \nis helpful to her to know what is in it, and she can exercise her \nconsumer preference. Other folks don't want to have excessive salt or \nmaybe they are allergic to peanuts, so peanuts are on the ingredients \nlist, and it is helpful to them to be able to make that decision.\n  Honoring our citizens' right to know seems to be disappearing on \nCapitol Hill because we have powerful special interests that don't want \nto let citizens make these judgments, make these evaluations, between \nthe advantages and the disadvantages. Last summer, a few hundred yards \nfrom here in the House of Representatives, the majority voted for a law \nthat blocks States from passing laws to provide this type of \ninformation on a label.\n  Just yesterday in the Senate, the Senate Agricultural Committee voted \nout a law to block the rights of citizens to know whether GMOs are in \ntheir food. That is an outrageous--outrageous--bill. It would halt any \nprogress in ensuring that consumers can simply and easily access \ninformation about GMO ingredients through labeling.\n  This bill that was passed out of committee also included a proposal \nthat the Secretary of Agriculture do an education campaign touting the \neconomic, nutritional, humanitarian, and scientific benefits of GMOs, \nbut the bill didn't say--and educate consumers about the substantial \nconcerns the scientific community has, about the impact on the \nevolution of weeds, about the impact on the evolution of bugs, about \npotential residues that are on\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nthe crops, about the runoff that is in our waterways affecting how \nhealthy our waterways are and the organisms that live in our streams \nand in our rivers.\n  So this is a very unbalanced presentation to the American public. It \nis the type of thing that government shouldn't be involved in--\nbasically, running a promotional campaign on taxpayers' dollars to not \ncreate a balanced understanding of an issue but instead an unbalanced \nunderstanding of an issue.\n  The truth is, all Americans have the right to know what is in their \nfood. They are buying food to feed their children. They have the right \nto know the ingredients so they can make responsible decisions. \nProviding information regarding genetically modified ingredients is a \ncommonsense way to empower consumers to make their own personal \ndecisions on issues they care about on the food they purchase. It is a \npretty emotional issue when you start talking about the food you are \nputting in your own mouth or the food you are feeding your children.\n  Campbell's Soup has begun taking steps to voluntarily disclose on all \nof their soups whether the products contain genetically modified \ningredients. Why are they doing this? They say they have a relationship \nof integrity with their customers. They want their customers to know \nfull information about their products and let the customer decide what \nthe customer wants, and they will provide information about the type of \ngenetic modifications and what they mean so the customer will have \nenough information to make a decision. There are advantages and \ndisadvantages to GMO ingredients.\n  Our Federal Government already requires the labeling of ingredients \nand basic nutritional information in order to protect the public and \nguard against false product marketing. These food labels tell consumers \nmany things. They are supposed to tell how many calories. They tell how \nmuch there is of a variety of vitamins. They list the ingredients and \ndo so in order of how prominent they are in the product. Our labeling \nlaws even say that when fish are sold in large supermarkets, they have \nto state whether a fish is farm raised or wild caught. Why do we \nrequire supermarkets to label the fish as farm raised or wild caught? \nBecause our consumers care about that. There are implications of \nwhether a product was grown in an artificial lake or whether it was \ncaught in the wild. Consumers want to know and use their own minds to \nmake these decisions. That is something about being in a free society--\nyou get to make your own decisions based on disclosure. We make the \ninformation available.\n  This type of labeling about genetic modifications or genetically \nmodified organisms in the ingredients is routine around the world. \nSixty-five other countries, including twenty-eight members of the \nEuropean Union, plus Japan, plus Australia, plus China, plus Brazil, \nalready require mandatory GM labeling. Has it come to the point that we \nin America are denying information that is routinely required in China \nfor consumers? Is that the point we are coming to on this bill, this \nDARK Act, Denying Americans the Right to Know Act? This is not the \ndirection we should be going.\n  Instead, we believe in our American citizens, we believe in \neducation, we believe in individual decisionmaking, and consumer \ninformation on the label honors that. Blocking States from being able \nto provide information that those State legislators or those State \ncitizens, by initiative, say they want, that is an overstepping of \nFederal authority to crush States' rights on an issue important to \ncitizens.\n  That is why today I am introducing a compromise bill, a bill trying \nto bring this conversation to a commonsense compromise. It is called \nthe Biotechnology Food Labeling and Uniformity Act. I am introducing \nthis bill today with Senator Tester and Senator Leahy. It would give \nthe FDA the authority to develop a uniform Federal standard for on-\npackage disclosure of genetically modified ingredients.\n  I have met with industry groups. I have met with the pro-label \ngroups. I tried to find that area of compromise between the two. What I \nfound is a great deal of flexibility on the labeling groups. Those \ngroups said there doesn't have to be information on the front of the \npackage. It is OK if it is on the ingredients list on the back of the \ncan or the back of the package. It doesn't have to be in supersized \nprint. It is OK if it is in the same small print that the ingredients \nare printed in. In fact, they are open to many different versions of \nhow a company discloses this information, as long as a person can go to \nthe store, pick up the package, turn it over, and quickly find out if \nthere is a GMO impact.\n  These are some of the ideas--and there are a variety--that are \nacceptable to the labeling side of the world. One is on the ingredients \narea. After the ingredient, it could either say it is genetically \nmodified or put in a code like GM--it doesn't take up much space, it is \non the list of ingredients--or if there are several ingredients and you \nwould rather use an asterisk, you would rather put an asterisk and put \nwhat the asterisk means: ``This ingredient has been genetically \nmodified,'' or ``May contain genetically modified ingredients.'' So a \nsimple phrase at the bottom or a symbol. Brazil uses a symbol. They use \na T. This is an example of using a symbol T for transgenic--not all of \nthem at once, just each of them would be fine. It will take effort for \nconsumers to look and see it. It is not upfront. They have to pick up \nthe product. They have to look. It can be typed in small print, but it \ngives a person who cares the ability to get to the bottom of the \nquestion. Then, if they want, they can look up at the Web site the \nproduct, through a quick response code, and get more details. That \nrange of flexibility is where the compromise can be honoring a \ncitizen's right to know, while not taking up a lot of space on a \npackage or not doing anything on the front of the package that says \nthat this product is healthy or unhealthy or otherwise. It means the \nshare of Americans who want this information--just as there is a share \nof Americans who want to know if there is high-fructose corn syrup, \nthere is a share of Americans who want to know if fish is farmed or \nwild fish--can in fact find this out.\n  This also addresses the big issue manufacturers have been raising. \nThey don't want a patchwork across the country of 50 different States \nhaving different labeling laws. Our supply inventory doesn't work that \nway. We don't have a warehouse that only serves one State. Quite \nfrankly, it gets very complicated and even more so on the East Coast, \nwhere the States are all packed together, than it does back home in \nOregon. That is a legitimate concern. So there are big concerns. About \n50 different versions of the law or maybe counties even having \ndifferent laws is addressed.\n  I am going to simply conclude with this understanding: Citizens have \na right to know in a free society what is in their food. Let's honor \nthat. Should the DARK Act--the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act \nthat passed out of the Agriculture Committee--come to this floor, many \nof us will stand up to fight it in every possible way. It shortchanges \nAmerican citizens, denies them critical information, and takes the \nright of a fundamental privilege in our society. It strips our States. \nIt is a Federal overreach, and it is an assault on consumer information \nand consumer rights. It is just wrong, and we will oppose it \nvigorously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1226-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1226-S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 384--DESIGNATING MARCH 2, 2016, AS ``READ ACROSS \n                             AMERICA DAY''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nKaine, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Capito) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Opioid Overdose Reduction \n     Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in \n     the United States.\n       (2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription \n     pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased fivefold \n     among women over the past decade.\n       (3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than \n     car accidents.\n       (4) Overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids can be \n     prevented if the person who overdosed is timely administered \n     an opioid overdose drug.\n       (5) Medical personnel as well as non-medical personnel can \n     be trained to administer opioid overdose drugs safely and \n     effectively.\n       (6) On April 13, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration \n     approved a prescription opioid overdose drug hand-held auto-\n     injector for use by family members and caregivers to treat a \n     person known or suspected to have had an opioid overdose.\n       (7) Several States, including Massachusetts, have \n     established programs allowing for the administration of \n     opioid overdose drugs by non-medical personnel, and those \n     programs have saved lives.\n       (8) The willingness of medical and non-medical personnel to \n     administer opioid overdose drugs may be deterred by potential \n     civil liability, and the willingness of physicians to \n     prescribe opioid overdose drugs to persons other than a \n     patient may also be deterred by potential civil liability.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to save the \n     lives of people who intentionally or inadvertently overdose \n     on heroin or other opioids by providing certain protections \n     from civil liability with respect to the emergency \n     administration of opioid overdose drugs.\n\n     SEC. 803. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title--\n       (1) the term ``health care professional'' means a person \n     licensed by a State to prescribe prescription drugs;\n       (2) the term ``opioid overdose drug'' means a drug that, \n     when administered, reverses in whole or part the \n     pharmacological effects of an opioid overdose in the human \n     body; and\n       (3) the term ``opioid overdose program'' means a program \n     operated by a local health department, community-based \n     organization, substance abuse treatment organization, law \n     enforcement agency, fire department, other first responder \n     department, or voluntary association or a program funded by a \n     Federal, State, or local government that works to prevent \n     opioid overdoses by in part providing opioid overdose drugs \n     and education to individuals at risk of experiencing an \n     opioid overdose or to an individual in a position to assist \n     another individual at risk of experiencing an opioid \n     overdose.\n\n     SEC. 804. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this \n     title preempts the law of a State to the extent that such law \n     is inconsistent with this title, except that this title shall \n     not preempt any State law that provides additional protection \n     from liability relating to the administration of opioid \n     overdose drugs or that shields from liability any person who \n     provides or administers opioid overdose drugs.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--Sections \n     805, 806, and 807 shall not apply to any civil action in a \n     State court against a person who administers opioid overdose \n     drugs if--\n       (1) all parties to the civil action are citizens of the \n     State in which such action is brought; and\n       (2) the State enacts legislation in accordance with State \n     requirements for enacting legislation--\n       (A) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (B) declaring the election of the State that such sections \n     805, 806, and 807 shall not apply, as of a date certain, to \n     any civil actions covered by this title; and\n       (C) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 805.

Mr. President, I am here tonight to discuss the Supreme \nCourt vacancy caused by Justice Antonin Scalia's death.\n  First, I think it is important to reflect on Justice Scalia's life \nand profound contribution and influence on the Court and our country. \nHe was one of the longest serving Justices in our Nation's history, \nand, as far as I can tell, every single day he served, he applied his \nconsiderable intellect, integrity, and wit to the work before him.\n  Although I disagreed with many of his decisions, I never doubted his \ncommitment to the rule of law. He was a principled originalist. He was \nloyal to his country. By all accounts, including moving testimony from \nhis children, he was devoted to his family and to his friends, \nincluding to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, with whom he often disagreed.\n  Judge Scalia's judicial philosophy was well understood when President \nReagan nominated him to the Supreme Court in 1986. Many Senators then \nopposed his judicial approach, but in an echoing indictment of today's \nSenate and its partisanship, 30 years ago the U.S. Senate confirmed \nJustice Scalia 98 to 0--a vote that testifies to Justice Scalia's \nqualifications and to the integrity of Members of this body who \ndisagreed with his vision of the Constitution but, exercising their \nconstitutional duty, refused to withhold their support for a qualified \nnominee.\n  Here is what article II, section 2, clause 2 says about our and the \nPresident's duty: The President ``shall nominate, and by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the \nsupreme Court.''\n  When a vacancy arises, the President shall nominate a replacement and \nthe Senate shall advise and consent by voting on that nominee. That is \nwhat the plain language of the Constitution requires, and that is what \nPresidents and the Senate have done throughout our history. That is \nwhy, in the past 100 years, the Senate has taken action on every single \nSupreme Court nominee--even those made during a Presidential election \nyear. Throughout our history, there have been at least 17 nominees \nconfirmed by the Senate in Presidential election years. The last of \nthese was Justice Kennedy in 1988.\n  This history reveals that when the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee said last week that ``[t]he fact of the matter is that it's \nbeen standard practice over the last 80 years to not confirm Supreme \nCourt nominees during a presidential election year,'' he was incorrect. \nThe fact of the matter is that since the founding of this country, the \nSenate has done its job even in an election year. In fact, during one \nelection year, the Senate voted to confirm not just one but three \nJustices to fill vacancies on the Court. The President was none other \nthan George Washington, and he was in the fourth year of his second \nterm when that happened. That Senate included some of our Founders, \ndelegates to the Constitutional Convention. But, come to think about \nit, what did they really know about the Constitution?\n  On that subject, by the way, it has been incredible in the truest \nsense of the word to hear people--Senators and even candidates for \nPresident who claim to be, as Justice Scalia surely was, constitutional \noriginalists or textualists--willfully ignore the plain meaning of the \nConstitution in favor of this so-called standard practice. That is not \na form of constitutional interpretation with which I am familiar, but \nit seems to be guiding the majority leader and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee away from the text they claim to revere. They wrote \ntogether in the Washington Post:\n  It is today the American people, rather than a lame-duck President \nwhose priorities and policies they just rejected in the most-recent \nnational election, who should be afforded the opportunity to replace \nJustice Scalia.\n  I have a chart. I redlined the actual words of the Constitution with \nthe claim of the majority leader and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We can see they bear no relationship to one another. In \nfact, only seven words--the black words--remain from the original \nconstitutional text, including in those seven words a conjunction, a \ndefinite article, and a preposition--otherwise known as ``and,'' \n``the,'' and ``of.''\n  Oh, and by the way, if we want to talk about a real standard \npractice, the President becomes a lameduck only after the election that \nis coming up and only until the inauguration.\n  When we look at the history, it is telling that, unlike almost all \nour other work, the Senate's consideration of Supreme Court nominees \nhas been remarkably expeditious. On average, the Senate has voted 70 \ndays after the President's nomination. When Justice Scalia died, 342 \ndays remained in the President's term--nearly a full quarter of his \nfinal term in office. Why has the Senate, notorious for its glacial \nslowness, historically acted with such deliberate speed when it comes \nto our consideration of Supreme Court Justices?\n  I suspect there are three principal reasons: first, the \nconstitutional clarity that commands us; second, the unique nature of \nthe responsibility--no one else, including the House of \nRepresentatives, can exercise it; and third, the essential importance \nof the Supreme Court's composition.\n  With respect to the Supreme Court's composition, no less of an \nauthority than Justice Scalia himself explained it well. Asked to \nrecuse himself from a case involving Vice President Cheney, Justice \nScalia rejected the suggestion that he should ``resolve any doubts in \nfavor of recusal.'' He observed that such a standard might be \nappropriate if he were on the court of appeals, where his ``place would \nbe taken by another judge, and the case would proceed normally. On the \nSupreme Court, however, the consequence is different: The court \nproceeds with eight Justices, raising the possibility that, by reason \nof a tie vote, it will find itself unable to resolve the significant \nlegal issue presented by the case.''\n  Justice Scalia then quoted the Supreme Court's own recusal policy \nobserving that, ``[e]ven one unnecessary recusal impairs the \nfunctioning of the Court.'' If even one unnecessary recusal impairs the \nCourt, imagine what a 14-month vacancy would do. Imagine if, in 2016, \nwe had a repeat of 2000, when the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore, \nexcept with only eight Justices on the bench. Imagine the \nconstitutional crisis our Nation would have to endure.\n  I know it has become fashionable for Washington politicians to tear \ndown rather than work to improve the democratic institutions that \ngenerations of Americans have built. But to impair so cavalierly the \njudicial branch of our government is pathetic. It is a standard one \nwould expect of a lawless nation, rather than a nation committed to the \nrule of law. It is the behavior of a petty kangaroo court, not of the \nU.S. Senate. And it threatens to deny justice to millions of Americans \nin the name of petty politics. It is time for the Senate to do its job, \nas every Senate before us has done.\n  I am not asking my colleagues to support the nominee. That is a \nmatter of conscience for each of us. But what is unconscionable is that \nthe majority, if it keeps its word, will have no hearing, will hold no \nvote, and refuse even the courtesy of a meeting with the President's \nnominee.\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\n  Speaking of doing our job, in view of the seriousness of the Court's \nnomination, we should reconsider the majority's proposed 7-week summer \nrecess for the Senate. In July and August alone, we are barely in \nsession for 8 days. Unlike our responsibility to vote on Supreme Court \nnominees, the Senate schedule is not enshrined in the Constitution. It \nis set by the majority.\n  In that connection, I am glad to invite any of my colleagues to my \noffice to watch a video of a constituent of mine whom I met 2 weeks ago \nin Pueblo West. She manages a retail store and struggles every month to \nkeep it going. Unlike the Senate, she has 22 vacation days a year, not \na month. Instead, she works a second job to pay for childcare so she \ncan keep her main job. Millions of Americans are watching the Senate \ntake the entire summer off and claim there isn't time to do our job. \nThat doesn't meet the standard of a great nation or a great \nparliamentary body. What is worse is that this whole charade has become \nan extension of playground politics, the childish pettiness that has \nmetastasized in this Presidential primary season.\n  How far have we drifted from our simple constitutional obligations \nwhen one side refuses to even meet with any prospective nominee? What \nmessage does that send to the people of Colorado and across the \ncountry? Where I come from, taking your ball and going home isn't \nacceptable behavior on the playground. How could it possibly be \nacceptable in the U.S. Senate?\n  Senate greatness, the national interest as a legislative guide, \nmaturity, and comity will not be restored overnight or with a single \ndecision. It has taken far too long for us to travel down this \ndestructive road to deadlock, ideological rigidity, and bitter \npartisanship for restoration of greatness to the Senate to occur \nquickly, but we should begin--we must begin, and we can begin--with our \ntreatment of some of our most serious, even sacred duties: the \nconfirmation of the next Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  We are not here to pacify a political base or satisfy one or more \nspecial constituencies or rally our political parties. We are here to \nelevate our Republic, to make it a beacon for the world, to demonstrate \nhow mature representatives of sovereign States govern a mature nation.\n  This Supreme Court nomination is not a test of strength between the \nexecutive and legislative branches. It is a test of our strength as \nleaders with an honorable history and a heritage of wisdom and \nmaturity. How we manage our constitutional duty to provide serious \nconsideration and deliberation to a rare appointment to the Nation's \nhighest judicial office will determine whether we deserve the respect \nof Americans who rightly expect us to exhibit dignity, mutual respect, \nand wisdom on their behalf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I, too, rise this evening to discuss the \nvacancy on the Supreme Court and the need for the Senate to do its job \nand give fair consideration to any nominee made by President Obama to \nfill this seat on the Supreme Court. Many of my Republican colleagues \nhave vowed to block any nominee out of hand, and every single \nRepublican member of the Judiciary Committee has likewise vowed to \nrefuse any nominee a fair hearing. The Senate majority leader, along \nwith several other Republican Senators, went as far to say they would \nnot even meet with the nominee. I am not sure I ever heard anything \nlike that in my 9 years in the Senate, going on 10. This is \ninconsistent, totally inconsistent with our duty as U.S. Senators.\n  Let me start tonight by saying to my Republican colleagues, \nrespectfully: Do your job. Do your job, consider this nominee, and then \nvote whichever way you want.\n  We know the Supreme Court cannot permanently function as the \nConstitution intends with only eight members. Last week I asked \nquestions of a panel of experts, constitutional scholars, including \nGeorgetown law professor Peter Edelman at a steering committee hearing \nin the Senate. These constitutional experts confirmed that because \nsplit decisions defer to the holding of the lower court, it is entirely \npossible we could see a string of split decisions that would undermine \nthe primary purpose of the Supreme Court; that is, to resolve \ndifferences in the opinions coming out of the various circuit courts \nacross the country.\n  This is no doubt why the Constitution provides specific instructions \non filling Supreme Court vacancies. Article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution states, in part, ``[The President] shall nominate, and by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall Appoint . . . \nJudges of the Supreme Court.''\n  In both instances, the word ``shall'' is used. There is no \nequivocation. It doesn't say ``shall appoint at a certain time in a \npresidency'' or ``may appoint.'' It is very clear from the Constitution \nwhat the Senate must do and what the President must do.\n  Barack Obama is the President of the United States. According to the \nConstitution, in the event of a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nPresident of the United States shall nominate a replacement. Nothing \nmore needs to be said to counter the, what I would argue, outrageous \ncalls for the President to refrain from nominating a replacement simply \nbecause his 323 days left in office are fewer than 365 days. To refrain \nwould violate the letter of the Constitution.\n  Republican Senators, for whatever reason, seem to disagree with the \noriginal intent of the Framers in this situation. Often those same \nRepublican Senators come to the floor and make floor statements \ninciting the Constitution, but now they would completely ignore a \nconstitutional directive.\n  The Constitution is also clear with respect to the Senate's duty to \nadvise and consent on the President's nominee. No sincere reading could \nlead to the conclusion that the Senate would be within its rights and \nupholding its responsibility if it refused any potential nominee fair \nconsideration. My Republican colleagues argue they are absolved of \ntheir responsibility to give fair consideration to a nominee simply \nbecause the Senate is constitutionally allowed to withhold its consent.\n  That is one argument. It doesn't make sense, but that is the argument \nthey make. The other argument is that ``we should let the American \npeople decide'' by refusing to consider any nominee until the next \nPresident takes office. This denies precedent. Justice Kennedy was \nconfirmed in the last year of President Ronald Reagan's final term \nunder a Democratic Senate, and the Senate has confirmed 17 Supreme \nCourt nominees in Presidential election years.\n  This point of view also neglects the obvious fact that the American \npeople already decided in twice electing Barack Obama to be our \nPresident. Both the President and his office deserve to be treated with \nrespect. Denying the President's legitimate authority to nominate a \ncandidate for Supreme Court is more than just an irresponsible attempt \nto score political points; it is a distortion of the separation of \npowers unprecedented in modern times.\n  Senate Republicans have not been granted authority to prematurely \nterminate Presidential powers. They have not been granted that \nauthority. The Senate has taken action on every Supreme Court nominee \nin the last 100 years, regardless of whether the nomination was made in \na Presidential election year, and not since the Civil War has the \nSenate taken longer than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. These \nnominees have always been seen as entitled to timely consideration as \nwell. Since 1975, the Senate has taken an average of just 70 days from \nthe date of nomination to the date of confirmation.\n  Like many Senators here--virtually every Senator who serves in this \nbody receives mail all the time from our constituents. On this issue, I \nhave received thousands of letters urging the Senate to fulfill its \nduty and give fair consideration to the Supreme Court nominee that the \nPresident chooses.\n  One particular letter came from a woman by the name of Jane from \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania, a community outside of Philadelphia. The \nletter Jane sent me was profound in its simplicity. Jane said that \nhaving an understaffed Court would be ``unfair to the process of \njustice.''\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\n  Jane's words, not mine. A fully functioning Supreme Court is not \nabout obscure details of Senate procedure to Jane. It is about \nsomething more than that. To her, one of my constituents, it is also \nnot about who said what 10 years ago, nor is it about Presidential \npolitics. It is about something else. Access to justice is what matters \nto Jane. It is what should matter to every Senator.\n  Jane ended this letter she sent me with a reminder that I will repeat \nin the hope that my Republican colleagues will take it to heart, as I \ndid. Jane said the ``opportunity to take part in a Justice's nomination \nis a privilege and deserves respect.''\n  I agree. Consideration and casting a vote regarding a Supreme Court \nnominee nominated by the President of the United States to serve as one \nof only nine Justices on the Supreme Court, you bet, that is a \nprivilege and it deserves respect.\n  To my Republican colleagues, I say, again, do your job, as I must do \nmy job, and give this duty that you have--the duty to consider and to \nvote on a Supreme Court nominee--this rare privilege, the respect it \ndeserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/02/senate-section/article/S1241-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
