Mr. President, under a new majority the Senate is \ngetting back to work, and progress is being made on behalf of the \nAmerican people. We saw another example of that yesterday when we \npassed the most pro-passenger, pro-security FAA reauthorization in \nyears.\n  It is the product of dedicated work from Senator Thune, Senator \nAyotte, and their ranking member counterparts, Senators Nelson and \nCantwell. These Senators ensured that Republicans and Democrats both \nhad a say on this bill, and we ultimately arrived at balanced \nlegislation that passed by a very strong bipartisan majority.\n  It takes important strides to bolster national security against the \nthreat of terrorism, it contains provisions to help frustrated \npassengers, and it won't levy a nickel in new taxes or fees on \npassengers or impose the kind of overregulation that can take away \ntheir choice or threaten service.\n  As the Washington Post reminded us, this is ``the second major \ntransportation bill approved by the Senate within five months.''\n  So whether it is providing long-term solutions for highway funding, \npermanent tax relief for families and small businesses, or commonsense \nreforms for airline passengers and airport security, this much is \nclear: The Republican-led Senate is working to address issues that \naffect our constituents on a daily basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2205-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, passing the FAA reauthorization \nbill isn't the only legislative milestone we will mark this week. Today \nwe will pass, as the New York Times put it, ``the first major energy \nbill to come to the Senate floor since the Bush administration,'' the \npassage of which, as the paper has also noted, would represent a \nsignificant step forward for the Nation's energy policy.\n  It has been nearly a decade since the Senate last debated major \nenergy legislation and much has changed in that time. That is why \nSenator Murkowski, the Energy Committee chair, and Senator Cantwell, \nthe ranking member, worked for the past year to move broad bipartisan \nenergy legislation, the Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  Like the FAA reauthorization bill I mentioned earlier, this bill \nwon't raise taxes on American families, but it can help them by making \nenergy more affordable and more abundant, by building on technological \nadvances and bolstering national security, and by growing the economy \nand furthering innovation. In short, the bill before us takes a \ncomprehensive approach to bring America's energy policies in line with \nthe kind of challenges and opportunities we now face.\n  The bill managers worked ceaselessly to see this bill through to \nfinal passage. Now, following the passage of the most pro-passenger, \npro-security FAA reauthorization in years, the Republican-led Senate \nwill today pass the first major Energy bill in nearly a decade. It is \nbroad, it is bipartisan, and it is just the kind of legislation we are \nseeing a lot of in a Republican-led Senate that continues to show what \nis possible with good ideas and good old hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2205-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2205-S2206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, on the topic of hard work. The \nreason the Republican-led Senate has been able to pass so much good \nlegislation over the past year is because we resolved to put this \nChamber back to work.\n  That started with the committees. We have seen what is possible in \nthe Commerce Committee; just look at the FAA bill. We have seen what is \npossible in the Energy Committee; just look at the Energy bill. But we \nare also seeing what is possible in many other committees, such as \nAppropriations.\n  Last year, the committee passed all 12 of the bills that fund the \ngovernment. Passing all of those bills through committee used to be \nfairly routine, yet it hadn't happened in years by the time the new \nmajority took over. We\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\nchanged that last year. We resolved to do even more this year.\n  The committee has again gotten the appropriations process off to a \nstrong start, and we would now like to pass as many of the funding \nbills as possible on the Senate floor. Getting this done will require \ncooperation from across the aisle.\n  Our Democratic friends recently wrote a letter pledging cooperation \nin the appropriations process. ``This is a win-win opportunity,'' they \nsaid, and ``we should seize it together.''\n  With the appropriate cooperation, we will, and we are.\n  The Appropriations Committee has already conducted more than 40 \nhearings since January. Tomorrow they will mark up two more funding \nbills, which follows their action last week to pass two others on a \nbipartisan and unanimous basis.\n  We are about to consider one of those funding bills out here on the \nfloor. The Energy and Water appropriations bill is thoughtful, \nbipartisan legislation that will ensure a fiscally responsible approach \nto a variety of issues--things such as national security, energy \ninnovation, waterways, and economic development.\n  I look forward to talking more about it tomorrow, and I would like to \nthank Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein for their many hours of \nhard work on that bill. I would also like to recognize Chairman Cochran \nfor everything he has done with Ranking Member Mikulski to get the \nappropriations process moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2206-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am happy to be here and have the \nRepublican leader talk about the things he has been able to accomplish, \nbut I would note--just to make sure the record is clear--the reason \nthese things are happening is because we have a minority that is \nwilling to work with the majority.\n  The record should also be corrected to the effect that we have had \nover the last 7\\1/2\\ years lots of debates on energy--lots of them. The \nproblem is that they have gone no place because of the obstruction of \nmy Republican colleagues, with filibuster after filibuster on the bill \nthat we are going to soon dispose of.\n  I am glad. It is a really important piece of legislation. It was \nworked on for 5 years, led by Senator Shaheen, but it is really \ndifficult to determine how many different times it was stopped because \nof obstruction--seven or eight times, that I can come up with. So we \nare glad to be able to get it done. Why? Because we wanted to get it \ndone for years, and finally we are able to get it done.\n  So we want to be here and work with the Republican leader and friends \non the other side of the aisle to get things done. That is why we have \nbeen no obstacle to the FAA bill. It is too bad it is such a narrow \nversion of what we wanted to do, but the Republican leader said we will \nfinish the things that we wanted to do to deal with section 48(c) \nbefore the end of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2206-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, my friend also talked about the \naccomplishments of the various committees. My caucus knows how much I \nbelieve in the committee system. I think it is very important that \ncommittees work well. We know one committee that is not working well, \nled by the senior Senator from Iowa.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa claims that he feels no pressure over \nblocking President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. If \nthat is really true, Senator Grassley must not read the papers from \nIowa. To date, there have been two dozen Iowa editorials condemning \nSenator Grassley's refusal to consider President Obama's Supreme Court \nnominee, and there are many more letters to the editor. This is only \nIowa. Around the country there have been scores and scores of \neditorials talking about how wrong it is that the Judiciary Committee \nis taking a vacation.\n  In Iowa there was a column published in the Des Moines Register over \nthe weekend that was especially discerning. It was authored by veteran \nIowa political journalist Kathie Obradovich. This is what she wrote:\n\n       Senator Grassley keeps offering new reasons for refusing to \n     give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote on his \n     appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. He may as well keep \n     trying, as the explanations he's given so far for waiting \n     until after the next presidential election are mostly \n     nonsense.\n\n  I am only going to mention a few of the excuses that the senior \nSenator from Iowa has invented in an effort to avoid his job.\n  Senator Grassley won't consider Merrick Garland because he says he \nwants the American people to have a voice. The Senator either is \nignoring or forgetting or doesn't know that the American people and \nfellow Iowans used their voice twice when they elected and re-elected--\nboth times overwhelmingly--President Obama. They gave President Obama \nthe right to nominate individuals to the Supreme Court as well as all \nthe other obligations a President has.\n  Secondly, Senator Grassley won't consider Merrick Garland because he \nsaid he wants a Justice who abides by the law. Try that one on. If the \nsenior Senator from Iowa wants a Justice who abides by precedent and \nsticks to the law, he need look no further than Merrick Garland, who \nhas developed a reputation on the bench for respecting precedent. \nPeople who served with him--so-called liberal, conservative, and \nmoderate judges--all agree that Merrick Garland is good. In fact, maybe \nthere is somebody who can't stand him, but we haven't heard a peep from \nanybody saying what a bad judge he is--not from anyone.\n  Senator Grassley says he won't consider Merrick Garland for a third \nreason, because the Supreme Court only needs eight Supreme Court \nJustices. The Supreme Court needs all nine. Yesterday they deadlocked \non another question, and it appears that the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is willing to gridlock our Nation's highest Court just to \nkeep Merrick Garland from being confirmed.\n  That decision yesterday is a bad decision because what it does is to \nkeep in place a lower court ruling that most all academics and people \nwho follow the law believe is wrong. It allowed the State of California \nstanding to sue another State--basically, the State of Nevada. Under \ntheir ruling, we are now going to have a free-for-all in the States \nsuing each other. From the time we have been a country, that didn't \ntake place. There was order in interstate commerce.\n  Well, the fourth reason Senator Grassley gives is that it is all \nChief Justice Roberts' fault. The very person who is blocking the \nSupreme Court nominee is accusing the Chief Justice of making the Court \npolitical.\n  Finally--there are others, but this is enough for this morning--the \nsenior Senator from Iowa says he is just doing what Chairman Biden said \n20 years ago. Well, I would suggest--and I am sure his staff has done \nthis, if he hasn't--to look at what Vice President Biden did, not a \npartial part of a speech that he gave, because if you looked at that, \nhe was exemplary. He brought judges to the Senate floor. He even \nbrought nominees to the floor who had been turned down by the committee \nbecause, as he said yesterday and he has said before: I believe we have \nan obligation for advice and consent that is not completed until it is \nbrought to the floor.\n\n  So Senator Grassley should follow Joe Biden's example and process \nmore than part of a speech he gave. None of\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\nthese examples makes sense, as the columnist from Iowa said, but \nyesterday the Judiciary Committee chair came up with another one. \nListen to this one. This is classic. Senator Grassley said he will not \nconsider Merrick Garland's nomination because the hearing would be a \nwaste of taxpayer dollars.\n\n       Well, we could have a hearing, we aren't going to have a \n     hearing, but let's just suppose we did have a hearing. . . . \n     So you have a hearing and you spend a lot of taxpayers' money \n     gearing up for it, you spend a lot of time of members, a lot \n     of research that has to be done by staff.\n\n  That is kind of a strange comment. Staff is not paid by the hour. \nThey are paid each day. I would hope they could squeeze into their busy \nschedules enough time to look at a Supreme Court nominee. Offering our \nadvice and consent on the Supreme Court nomination is what the \ntaxpayers want us to do. Look at polls all over America. That is our \njob.\n  I find it ridiculous--there is probably a better description--but I \nfind it ridiculous that the very Senator who continues to use the \nJudiciary Committee to wage a political war on former Secretary Hillary \nClinton dares to claim he is trying to save taxpayer dollars. Where is \nhe, where is his concern for misusing taxpayer funds while his \ncommittee continues to waste millions of dollars on partisan opposition \nresearch of a Presidential candidate? That is not their job.\n  Where was the penny-pinching when the Judiciary Committee used Senate \nfunds and Senate staff to investigate former Clinton staffers; for \nexample, asking for maternity leave records--maternity leave records--\ntime sheets, anything they could to try to embarrass Secretary Clinton.\n  Where is Senator Grassley's focus on government waste while the so-\ncalled Benghazi Select Committee continues to spend millions and \nmillions of dollars on a political hit job with no end in sight? Every \nday the Judiciary Committee has a new excuse, a new justification for \nwhy it will not do its job. I think we all have news for the Senator \nfrom Iowa: No one is buying it.\n  They are not buying it in Iowa. They are not buying it in Nevada. \nThey are not buying it in New York. They are not buying it in Kentucky. \nThey are not buying it anyplace. The American people are not buying it. \nHis own constituents are leading the pack of people who are not buying \nthis. His behavior reminds me of a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem: \n``It takes less time to do the right thing than it does to explain why \nyou did it wrong.''\n  So the senior Senator from Iowa has spent months trying to explain \naway the obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee. Wouldn't it be easier \nto give him a hearing and a vote? Wouldn't it be easier for him to just \ndo his job? Wouldn't it be the right thing to do to just do his job?\n  Mr. President, I ask the Chair to announce to everyone what the \nSenate is going to do the rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2207-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about to vote on the Energy \nModernization Act of 2016. I know my colleague, the chairwoman of the \ncommittee from Alaska, will probably like to close debate. So I would \nlike to a take a few minutes before that vote this morning to again \nthank all of our colleagues for their diligent consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  We will be passing the first Energy bill since 2007. This Energy bill \nwill be the first one in 9 years. It is a modernization of our energy \nsystem that is so desperately needed because it focuses on cleaner, \nmore efficient, more renewable sources of energy that is more cost-\neffective for the consumer. It does this by modernizing the grid, \nmaking investments in advanced storage technology, smart buildings, \ncomposite materials, and vehicle batteries. It improves cyber security \nand helps plan for the workforce we need for tomorrow.\n  I urge my colleagues to make sure this legislation passes. I want to \nsay that yesterday, we substantially improved this legislation--\nparticularly with the inclusion of both the public lands package that \nincludes the Yakima River Basin Bill from the State of Washington; as \nwell as the bipartisan SAVE Act--which will help homeowners recognize \nthe investments they make in energy efficiency so they can benefit from \nit when they are ready to sell their homes.\n  I think yesterday's efforts helped improve this legislation, but all \nof this would not be possible without the staff and the support of so \nmany people. I thank Angela Becker-Dippman, Sam Fowler, David Brooks, \nRebecca Bonner, Rosemarie Calabro Tully, John Davis, Benjamin Drake, \nDavid Gillers, Rich Glick, Spencer Gray, Sa'Rah Hamm, Aisha Johnson, \nFaye Matthews, Scott McKee, Casey Neal, Bryan Petit, David Poyer, Betsy \nRosenblatt, Sam Siegler, Bradley Sinkaus, Carolyn Sloan, Rory Stanley, \nMelanie Stansbury, Al Stayman, Nick Sutter, Stephanie Teich-McGoldrick, \nBrie Van Cleve, and of course I thank Colin Hayes and Karen Billups \nfrom the majority staff who have worked so hard on this legislation as \nwell.\n  As I said, the improvements we are making in this bill help us reach \nthe goals that have been outlined in the Quadrennial Energy Review. \nDepartment of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz helped us on this \nlegislation, clearly calling for the type of 21st century energy \ninfrastructure investments that will help our country remain \neconomically competitive in the future. It also will help us train the \n1.5 million new workers we will need, over the next 15 years.\n  I should say, one of the provisions we were so happy to defeat \namendments on yesterday was preserving the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the preeminent \nprograms in our country for preserving open space at a time when our \ncountry continues to develop. It has been a program that has nurtured \nthat very important need for all of us to be outdoors, and it has also \nhelped to build an outdoor economy.\n  So we are saying to the American public this is a program we believe \nshould be made permanent, particularly after last September's lapse and \nsuccessfully renewing it for just a couple of years. It is time to say \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that has been around \nsince the 1960s, should be made permanent.\n  I thank everyone again for their work on this legislation. I hope we \nget a resounding vote out of the Senate and a quick conference with the \nHouse of Representatives so we can plan for America's energy future in \na more effective, streamlined way, and we can then realize the \nopportunity to help our businesses and consumers plan for the energy \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the very short time we have before \nthe vote is called, I have just a few comments this morning. We have \ncompleted our work on a bill that includes more than 350 amendments \nthat were filed to this broad, bipartisan bill. We have accepted a \ntotal now of 65 of those amendments.\n  This bill contains priorities from over 80 Members of this body. Not \neverything has been smooth. I think we recognize that. I think this \nbill has shown that the Senate does work, the Senate can work \ncooperatively, that they can work toward a bipartisan product that will \nproduce long-lasting\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nbenefits for the people who have sent us here to serve them.\n  Our next step, our last step, is obtaining final passage. I would \nstrongly encourage all of our colleagues to vote aye this morning. \nThere are plenty of reasons to do that. I will repeat what I said \nyesterday: Our bill will help America produce more energy. It will help \nAmericans save more energy. It will protect our mineral security and \nour manufacturers. It will boost innovation, leading to new \ntechnologies and new jobs. It will increase America's influence on the \nworld stage, allowing us to finally become that global energy \nsuperpower and enjoy the benefits that come with it.\n  This is a good bill. This is an important bill for our country. I \nthank our colleagues who have worked with us to get to this point. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Energy Policy Modernization Act and \nvote for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support \nof the Energy Policy Modernization Act. I think the vote we have just \nconcluded is indicative of what I have been saying for years now. I \nhave a relatively lengthy policy manual or handbook, if you will, of \nhow I view the energy space and how we can work to advance our energy \npolicies, but, as with so much nowadays, if you put down a 115-page \nbook or if you have a multipage white paper, it kind of goes by the \nway. So I have framed my energy policy into three simple words. I don't \nhave it on a chart this afternoon, but it is basically pretty simple: \n``Energy is good.'' I think that is what we have concluded with passage \nof the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016, with 85 Members \nsupporting us in this effort.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Cantwell, for working with me \nthroughout this very collaborative process. The way we built this bill \nwas not just the two of us as colleagues on the Energy Committee but \nworking with Members on the committee across the aisle, working with \nother Members of this body in a very open and transparent manner. And \nit was not just colleagues here within the Senate; it was the outreach \nwe did with numerous listening sessions and the administration.\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nI thank Secretary of Energy Moniz for his assistance in what we built. \nWhat we have in front of us and what we are recognizing today is truly \na strong, committed process that yielded a strong product.\n  I wish to acknowledge the very, very hard work of our staffs. We all \nknow we cannot do what we need to do as Senators without good people \nbacking us at every turn. I am extraordinarily fortunate as chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee to have a team on the \nmajority's side that is not only extraordinarily hard-working, but they \nare all amazing experts when it comes to the energy space.\n  I wish to particularly recognize my staff director, Colin Hayes. \nColin came into this Energy bill midway. He came on as my staff \ndirector at the first of the year after my previous staff director, \nKaren Billups, who had served on the Energy Committee for close to 25 \nyears, retires. So we had that experience and expertise leaving--and \nKaren worked so hard to help craft so much of this bill, but then we \nneeded the technician to move it through this process, and Colin Hayes \nstepped up in an extraordinary and remarkable way, and I thank him for \nall he did to guide us here.\n  I wish to recognize the others on my Energy Committee staff: Pat \nMcCormick, Brian Hughes, Kellie Donnelly, and Lucy Murfitt.\n  I want to give a special shout-out to Lucy because she was able to \nhelp navigate some of the issues that perhaps were not seen upfront and \nin person, but behind the scenes were very important, not the least of \nwhich was the amendment we took a voice vote on yesterday relating to \nthe wild horses in North Carolina. Managing interesting issues and \ndoing it deftly was Lucy's strong suit.\n  I thank Severin Randall. I also thank Annie Hoefler, who made sure \nanything I needed in my book was there, Michael Tadeo, Tristan Abbey, \nChester Carson, Isaac Edwards, Heidi Hansen, Chris Kearney, Chuck \nKleeschulte, Kip Knudson, Brianne Miller, Jason Huffnagle, Ben Reinke, \nKrystal Edens, Melissa Enriquez, Deanna Mitchell, and Karen Dildei. \nThey are all members of our team on the Republican side who have been \nworking day and night for weeks and months now.\n  But we can't work a bill as successfully as we have today without \nworking hand-in-glove with your counterparts on the other side. Just as \nSenator Cantwell and I worked together, our staffs worked together, and \nthey were led very ably by Angela Becker-Dippmann. Angela came to the \ncommittee after being pulled out of another place at the request of \nSenator Cantwell, and her guidance has been extraordinary. I greatly \nappreciate her work.\n  I wish to recognize the other members of the minority Energy \nCommittee staff as well. Sam Fowler has been around since time \nimmemorial guiding us. I thank Rebecca Bonner, David Brooks, John \nDavis, Benjamin Drake, David Gillers, Rich Glick, Spencer Gray, Sa'Rah \nHamm, Aisha Johnson, Faye Matthews, Scott McKee, Casey Neal, Bryan \nPetit, David Poyer, Betsy Rosenblatt, Samantha Siegler, Bradley \nSinkaus, Carolyn Sloan, Rory Stanley, Melanie Stansbury, Al Stayman, \nNick Sutter, Stephanie Teich-McGoldrick, and Brie Van Cleve.\n  This is kind of a list of Emmy Award winners in my book. But as good \nas our teams are, we need help here on the floor. The folks on the \nfloor staff have been fabulous and extraordinary, and we thank them for \ntheir efforts. Laura Dove and Gary, thank you for what you have done. \nThe other members of the Republican floor staff--Robert Duncan, Chris \nTuck, Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Megan Mercer, Katherine Kilroy, Tony \nHanagan, and Mike Smith--are great people to work with, and we \nappreciate their guidance.\n  We had good, strong support from the leader's office. Neil Chatterjee \nwas a kind of energy whisperer for many of us and was a great help, as \nwell as Kate Sterne and Monica Popp with Senator Cornyn's office, Eric \nUeland and Becky Cole on the Budget Committee, Heather Burnham and \nChristina Jacquet at Senate Legislative Counsel, and Megan Carroll and \nKathy Gramp at the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I am proud of the work so many have done in getting us here. We are \nlooking forward to sitting down with our counterparts on the House side \nand getting to work to make sure the benefits we have achieved today in \nthe Senate are replicated with our colleagues in the House so that we \ncan see passage of an energy bill by both bodies and signed into law by \nthe President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the next few minutes, Senator \nFeinstein and I will submit for the Senate's consideration the first \nappropriations bill of the year. This will be the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. It will be the earliest that any appropriations \nbill has been submitted since the Budget Act was passed in 1974. This \nis a good sign for the Senate. It means we are serious about our most \nbasic constitutional responsibilities, which is the oversight of the \nspending of money, the setting of priorities, and doing it in a way \nthat allows every Senator to participate.\n  I am privileged to be able to work with Senator Feinstein, who is \nable to come to a result after we have examined an important piece of \nlegislation. She has a background as a manager, as a mayor, as a \nchairman of important committees, and I am very privileged to have the \nchance to work with her, whether we are in the majority or the \nminority.\n  Before I talk about the bill specifically, since this is the first \nbill, I wish to say a few words about the money we are spending. This \nyear the Budget Control Act, which the Senate adopted in 2015--which \nwas the law passed by the Senate by a vote of 64 to 35, October 30 of \nlast year. This year the Budget Control Act sets the amount of money we \nare to spend at $1.07 trillion. Our bill, the Energy and Water bill, \nwill be $37.5 billion of that approximately $1 trillion. However, the \nentire Federal budget is a lot more than $1 trillion. In fact, it is \nfour times as much. The entire Federal budget this year is $3.9 \ntrillion--nearly $4 trillion.\n  We are talking about appropriated dollars of about $1 trillion, plus \nabout 3 trillion other dollars we will spend this year through the \nFederal Government. Those dollars are what we call mandatory or \nautomatic spending, plus interest on the debt.\n  Federal health care spending, as an example, is about $1 trillion. It \nis about the same amount as all of the 12 appropriations bills that \nwill be considered. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services head, \nMr. Slavitt, is in charge of spending about $886 billion every year--\nalmost all mandatory spending. The part of the budget we are talking \nabout, and we will be talking about for the next 12 weeks, is one-\nfourth of the total Federal spending.\n  I thank Senator McConnell, the majority leader, for making this a \npriority. I thank Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, for suggesting \nto Senator McConnell and to all of us on behalf of the Democrats that \nthey, too, want to see us move through the process. This gives the \nAmerican people a chance to see how we spend their money.\n  The American people care about how we spend their money because we \nhave a big debt. There is a lot of talk about that debt, which is $19 \ntrillion. This year, the total revenues of the Federal\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nGovernment are about $3.36 billion, but the spending is about $3.9 \ntrillion. Elementary school mathematics will show we are adding about \n$534 billion more to our $19 trillion debt this year.\n  It is important to point out that the spending we are talking about \nin this bill and the other 11 discretionary bills is not the problem. I \nwould like to ask the Chair to look at the bottom line, the blue line. \nThat is what we call the discretionary spending. That is the money the \nAppropriations Committee works on. That is the trillion dollars we are \nappropriating in these bills.\n  It has been flat since 2008, and it is rising at about the rate of \ninflation over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. If the entire budget had followed the path of that blue line on \nthe bottom--that is the money we are in charge of in the Appropriations \nCommittee--we would not have a debt problem. Look where the debt \nproblem is coming from. That is the automatic mandatory spending, that \nred line. That does not even include the interest on the Federal debt. \nI have suggested in our conference that maybe what the Senate would \nwant to do is turn the entire budget over to the Appropriations \nCommittee because we are doing our job, and apparently the rest of the \nSenate--or all of us as a whole--is not doing its job and is running up \na big Federal debt.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have been presented an amount of money by the \ncommittee and by the Senate that we allocate. We have done that through \nfour hearings. I will be talking about that. We have set priorities, we \nhave cut wasteful spending, and we are beginning to get big \nconstruction projects under control.\n  We have eliminated funding for an infusion project in France. That \nsaves $125 million in a year, which we can then put on other \npriorities. We have the Uranium Processing Facility in Oak Ridge, TN, \nnow on a project where it will be 90 percent designed before it is \nbuilt, and it will be on time and on budget before it is finished.\n  We are working with the Armed Services Committee to try to do \nsomething similar with a mock facility in South Carolina. We have a red \nteam--the kind of red team that helped us at Oak Ridge and South \nCarolina--working on the New Mexico construction projects. Working \ntogether, our oversight is saving the taxpayers money, staying within \nthe budget, and I am glad to say we are not part of the debt problem.\n  Sometimes we as a full Senate will start working on that top line. \nSenator Corker and I have a bill that would reduce that top-line growth \nby $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The problem is, Senator Corker \nand I are the only cosponsors of the bill, so we will not be talking \nabout that much today.\n  I understand there may be an attempt to change the level of funding \nthat we make, and I will talk about that at the time this afternoon \nwhen the amendments come up. So everybody is thinking about that \nbeforehand, No. 1, we are following the law. That is where our \nbudgeting is. No. 2, the Budget Committee of the Senate has begun to \nstart its budget process based upon the number that the law sets. No. \n3, our appropriations bills are not the debt problem. The problem is \nthe mandatory spending and interest on the debt, and sooner or later we \nneed to deal with it.\n\n  Last Thursday Senator Feinstein and I and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee approved the fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development \nappropriations bill by a unanimous vote of 30 to nothing. Thirty of the \n100 Members of this body who are on that committee all voted for it.\n  This bill includes some items very familiar to the American people, \nthings that they would like for us to fund properly, such as flood \ncontrol; navigation on our rivers; deepening harbors, whether it is in \nCalifornia, Mobile, Charleston, or Savannah; rebuilding locks, whether \nthey are in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or in inland waterways; the 17 \nNational Labs, which are our secret weapon in job growth across our \ncountry; and supercomputing. We seek to lead the world in \nsupercomputing, and it is another great source of job growth.\n  A big part of our budget has to do with nuclear weapons and national \ndefense. At a time when our world is so unsafe, Americans are hoping we \ncan deal with that.\n  We worked together in a fair and accommodating manner under \nchallenging fiscal strengths to create a bipartisan bill. As I said \nearlier, the sum is $37.5 billion, $355 million more than last year. \nReaching a bipartisan consensus wasn't easy. We received an allocation \nfor defense spending that was higher than last year by $1.163 billion \nbut $808 million lower for the nondefense parts of our budget.\n  The funding includes several Federal agencies that do important work, \nincluding the U.S. Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, and the Appalachian Regional \nCommission.\n  We also started with an unrealistic budget proposal from the \nPresident, which cut the Corps of Engineers by $1.4 billion and \nproposed $2.3 billion in new mandatory funding for the Department of \nEnergy.\n  The bill Senator Feinstein and I negotiated supports our waterways \nand puts us one step closer to doubling basic energy research, helps to \nresolve the nuclear waste stalemate, cleans up hazardous material at \nCold War sites, and maintains our nuclear weapons stockpile. We also \nconducted intensive oversight of the President's budget request and the \nDepartment of Energy. As I mentioned earlier, we eliminated at least \none low-priority program which will save about $125 million to reduce \nwaste. That program, the International Thermonuclear Experimental \nReactor, is located in France and started in 2005 with an initial cost \nof $1.1 billion, but we have already invested that much and the project \nwill not likely be completed until after 2025.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we worked together to keep the big uranium \nprojects on time and on budget. It is now on time and on budget. It \nwill be 90-percent designed before it is constructed, and we are also \nworking together to control the MOX facility and the facility in New \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, 77 Senators submitted requests to us, and we worked \nhard to accommodate the request of every Senator. We have had many \nother Senators who have come to us since then with amendments they \nwould like to offer. Most Senators--I would say in the eighties--have \nsomething they think is important in this bill. If Senators decide we \nneed to spend less money, I guess they need to be prepared to send us \nletters suggesting what they would like to take out of the bill, since \nwe put letters into the bill based upon the amount of money the law \nsaid we should spend.\n  The last time the Senate passed this bill, the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, under regular order was 2009. I look forward to a \nregular appropriations process.\n  At this time, I will briefly highlight a few parts of the bill. No. 1 \nis waterways infrastructure. The bill restores $1.4 billion that the \nPresident proposed to cut from the Corps of Engineers. It sets a new \nrecord level of funding for the Corps in a regular appropriations bill. \nMany Senators have urged us to do this. There is not a funding line in \nthe bill that has more support than the Army Corps of Engineers. The \nCorps rebuilds locks and dams, dredges our rivers and harbors, works to \nprevent floods and storm damage, and builds environmental restoration \nprojects. If we had simply approved the President's request, the Corps \nwould have received less than what Congress appropriated in 2006, \nsetting us back more than a decade.\n  In Tennessee, we provided enough funding to continue building a new \nChickamauga Lock in fiscal year 2017. Up to $37 million will be \navailable to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue work on the \nChickamauga Lock. Only last month the Corps reiterated its most recent \nstudy that the Chickamauga Lock continues to be the fourth highest \npriority of essential American waterways to be rebuilt.\n  We included $1.3 billion for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. This \nis the third consecutive year we funded the Harbor Maintenance Trust \nFund consistent with the funding level that Congress recommended in the \nWater Resources Development Act. This will permit us to deepen harbors, \nincluding Gulfport, Charleston, Mobile, Texas, Louisiana, Anchorage, \nSavannah, and harbors on the west coast.\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n  Doubling basic energy research is a goal I have long supported and is \none of the most important things we can do to unleash our free \nenterprise system.\n  Senator Durbin and I worked together on an amendment to the Energy \nbill that increases the authorized funding levels for the Office of \nScience by about 7 percent per year, which would double the budget of \nthe Office of Science from a little over $5 billion today to more than \n$10 billion in 10 years. That is basically the money that the U.S. \nGovernment spends on energy research. The Senate adopted our amendment \nby a voice vote, which demonstrates how much support there is for this \ngoal. The President proposed to spend even more on energy research, \nincluding the Mission Innovation proposal, the pledge launched by the \nUnited States and 19 other countries at the climate summit in Paris, to \ndouble Federal clean energy research over the next 5 years. The problem \nis that President Obama's budget request proposed $2.259 billion in new \nmandatory funding for the Department of Energy. However, his commitment \nto doubling Federal clean energy research with mandatory funding comes \nat the expense of other resources and other agencies, which is at best \nunhelpful and at worse misleading. It is wishful thinking, and everyone \nknows it is not going to happen. Instead, we focused on priorities for \ndiscretionary funding annually approved by Congress. That is the bottom \nline that is under control, and it is not the source of our Federal \ndebt problems.\n  Our top priority was the Office of Science, which includes $5.4 \nbillion to support basic energy research--$50 million more than last \nyear. This is the second year we have been able to increase funding for \nthe Office of Science, which sets a new record level for funding for \nthat office in a regular appropriations bill. This puts us one step \ncloser to doubling funding for Federal basic energy research.\n  The bill includes $292.7 million for ARPA-E, an agency that invests \nin high-impact energy technologies. The funding is a little more than \nlast year's $1.7 million. The bill also supports the Department of \nEnergy's continued efforts to advance exascale computing and includes a \ntotal of $285 million to produce these next-generation computers.\n  Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of our country's electricity \nand 60 percent of our carbon-free electricity. If we are going to have \nthe abundance of clean, cheap, reliable energy that we want and need, \nwe need to unleash nuclear power by removing obstacles in its way.\n  Our legislation sends a strong signal about our support for new \ntechnologies in the next generation of nuclear powerplants. We included \n$94.5 million for advanced reactors, $21 million more than the \nPresident's budget request. We included $95 million for small modular \nreactors, $32.5 million over last year.\n  One way our bill helps is by taking important steps towards solving \nour country's stalemate over what to do with nuclear waste--a \nbipartisan issue and a goal that Senator Feinstein and I agree on and \nhave been working hard to accomplish. Our legislation, therefore, \nincludes a pilot program, which was Senator Feinstein's suggestion 3 \nyears ago, for consolidated nuclear waste storage. She and I introduced \nthat over the past 4 years. The new sites we are seeking to establish \nwill not take the place of Yucca Mountain--we have more than enough \nuseful fuel to fill Yucca Mountain to its legal capacity--but it would \nrather complement it. We also provide funding for the U.S. Department \nof Energy to store nuclear waste at private facilities approved by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, such as the one proposed in West Texas.\n  We are also supporting research in this bill that will help continue \nthe work that is necessary to safely extend nuclear power operating \nlicenses from 60 to 80 years. In my view, that is the simplest, easiest \nway to have a large amount of new carbon-free electricity in the near \nterm.\n  Finally, this legislation provides a total of $12.9 billion for the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration and fully funds the warhead \nlife extension programs recommended by the Nuclear Weapons Council in \nthe design of the Ohio-class replacement submarine. It also supports \ncrucial weapons facilities related to our national security.\n  The bill provides $575 million for the Uranium Processing Facility in \nOak Ridge, TN. It keeps the project on track to be completed by 2025, \nat a cost of no more than $6.5 billion.\n  The legislation also advances our efforts to clean up hazardous \nmaterials at Cold War sites. A total of $5.4 billion is provided to \nsupport cleanup efforts, which is $144 million above the President's \nbudget request.\n  This bill adequately funds our Nation's energy and water priorities \nand fully complies with the spending limits established by the Budget \nControl Act. The Budget Control Act continues a line of spending for \nthe appropriated dollars, which is the bottom line on the chart. The \nblue line on the chart, which has been flat since 2008 and only grows \nwith the rate of inflation for the next 10 years according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, is not the source of the Federal debt \nproblem. The rest of the line spends three times as much as the amount \nof money we are spending in the 12 appropriation bills we will be \naddressing for the next 2 weeks.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership and cooperation. I urge \nSenators to support the bill. We are already working on amendments with \nSenators that they seek to offer. We hope to begin voting on some this \nafternoon in an open amendment process and thereby proving that the \nappropriations process works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe fiscal year 2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.\n  I wish to begin by thanking my friend and colleague, Senator \nAlexander. We have served together as chairman or ranking member of \nthis subcommittee for the past 5 years. I know of no one in this body \nwho is more intelligent or has a greater sense of fairness. I just want \nSenator Alexander to know what a great treat it has been to work with \nhim for 5 years. I think we have a bill that will stand the test of \ntime. Each of us has had different views on different parts of the \nbill, but that is part of what makes this a great country.\n  I say to Senator Alexander, I just want to thank you for being who \nyou are and thank you for being the kind of U.S. Senator you are. Thank \nyou very much.\n  As the chairman mentioned, this bill has reached the floor for the \nfirst time since 2009. It is also being considered as an appropriations \nbill on the floor with the quickest time since the budgeting process \nbegan in 1974. I just want to say thank you to our leadership on both \nsides for the desire to get us back to regular order and particularly \non appropriations bills.\n\n  I wish to thank all of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee \nfor supporting this bill during last week's markup. As the chairman \nsaid, the vote was 30 to nothing, and that is a pretty good vote, so I \nthank my colleagues very much.\n  I believe this is a good bill. It is a fair bill. It does contain \ntrade-offs and hard choices, and we have worked together to settle \ndifferences. Obviously, the chair is the chair and those views come No. \n1, but in the case of this chair, he has been eminently fair and I am \nvery grateful for that.\n  As he said, our allocation is $37.5 billion. That is a $350 million \nincrease over fiscal year 2016, and given the top line budget \nconstraints, this is a good allocation.\n  Let me first speak about the defense portion of the bill. Defense \nspending in this bill is $20 billion, a $450 million increase over \nfiscal year 2016. Our defense spending includes funding for cleaning up \nthe environmental legacy of the cold war, maintaining our nuclear \ndeterrent, supporting our nuclear Navy, and partnering with allies to \nkeep nuclear materials out of the hands of terrorists.\n  Funding for our nuclear deterrent this year is $9.3 billion, $438 \nmillion above last year and equal to the President's budget request.\n  The science and engineering activities needed to maintain the nuclear \nstockpile without explosive testing are fully funded at $1.8 billion. \nThe life extension programs for our nuclear warheads are also fully \nfunded, including for the new cruise missile warhead, which I will \nspeak to a little bit more in a moment.\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\n  I wish to take a moment now, though, to discuss my concerns with the \nlong-range standoff weapon, or the LRSO. I believe the Defense \nDepartment is wrong when it argues that this isn't a new nuclear \nweapon. I think it is, and it carries with it powerful ramifications. \nThe LRSO would carry an upgraded W80 warhead capable of immense \ndestruction, and it would be fitted on to a new missile specifically \ndesigned to defeat the world's most advanced missile defense systems.\n  I firmly believe that the LRSO is unnecessary. The United States has \nalready developed and fielded a conventional cruise missile \nspecifically designed to do the same job as the LRSO. Furthermore, the \nUnited States has a variety of nuclear ballistic missiles that can \nreach any target anywhere in the world.\n  Why do I feel so strongly about this? It is very personal with me. I \nam one of the few who have seen this. I was 12 years old when the \nUnited States of America--my country--dropped nuclear weapons on \nHiroshima and Nagasaki. As the hundreds of thousands of bodies were \nseared with burns as the radiation spread, I have never quite gotten \nover what happened. I have reached the concept that nuclear weapons are \nreally bad for this world. I will not go into it. When we see countries \nlike North Korea practicing tests and other countries struggling to get \na nuclear weapon and the high likelihood of terrorists also seeking out \nradioactive materials, I am very concerned about the probable use of \nthis missile.\n  In a letter sent 2 years ago, Under Secretary of Defense Frank \nKendall wrote the following: ``Beyond deterrence, an LRSO-armed bomber \nforce provides the President with uniquely flexible options in an \nextreme crisis.''\n  This suggestion--that nuclear weapons should be a ``flexible'' \noption--is alarming. We should never lower the threshold for using \nnuclear weapons. In fact, I believe we can further reduce the role of \nnuclear weapons while still maintaining their deterrent effect by \nterminating the LRSO and instead relying on conventional nonnuclear \nweapons.\n  Obviously, this is a point of disagreement between the two of us. \nThis is why I am very thankful to the chairman. He has agreed to \ninclude language in the committee report requiring Energy Secretary \nMoniz and the Nuclear Weapons Council to provide more information on \nthis warhead, including its military justification and the extent to \nwhich conventional weapons systems can meet the same objectives. I \nthink we should have that material.\n  I am also grateful to Senator Alexander for his commitment to hold a \nsubcommittee hearing on the new nuclear cruise missile. I believe this \nissue hasn't received the attention it deserves, and it requires some \npublic discussion. So I want to say thank you to him. I have yielded to \nhis point of view and exchange. I actually am happy with the report \nlanguage and the hearing. So I thank the chairman very much.\n  Going back to the nonproliferation account, it is funded at the \nPresident's requested level of $1.8 billion. But this is a $120 million \ndecrease from last year, and I hope we can do better next year.\n  Work with Russia on securing material and facilities in that country \nhas slowed, but other threats remain at home and abroad, and I believe \nwe should be investing more.\n\n  Funding for the environmental cleanup of legacy cold war sites is the \nhighest it has been in many years--and that is very good--at $5.4 \nbillion, which is a $126 million increase above last year. This \nreflects the importance this subcommittee has placed on addressing \nenvironmental contamination at sites in Washington, New Mexico, South \nCarolina, and Tennessee. I thank the chairman for what he said about \nputting a pilot nuclear waste facility reference in our bill. Nuclear \nwaste is piling up all over this country, with no good place for it to \ngo. I can reference my State alone.\n  Southern California Edison, a huge utility serving over 16 million \npeople, has had two big nuclear reactors, each one 1,100 megawatts. \nThey are now in the process of decommissioning those reactors. This \nfacility sits in the heart of an urban area, and there are now 3,300 \nhot plutonium rods in spent fuel pools at that facility site. We need a \nplace for nuclear waste in this country because it is very dangerous to \nhave it spread all over and to have decommissioned reactors with hot \nplutonium waste in spent fuel pools right on the coast of the Pacific \nRim where we see earthquakes happening, not the least of which was in \nEcuador and a recent quake in Japan.\n  Now let me turn to the nondefense half of the bill. Our nondefense \nallocation this year is $17.5 billion, and that is roughly a $100 \nmillion decrease from fiscal year 2016. One of the anomalies of this \nportfolio is the fact that as defense goes up, it crowds out the \nnondefense--important things like the Army Corps of Engineers, \nimportant things like the Office of Science. So our nondefense \nallocation is at $17.5 billion.\n  Despite this, the bill maintains funding levels for basic scientific \nresearch, energy technology development, and water infrastructure. \nFunding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science sees a modest \nincrease of $50 million to $5.4 billion this year.\n  The Office of Science is the largest single funder of physical \nscience research in the United States--think of that--and supports \nresearch at 300 universities in all 50 States. Its experimental \nfacilities host more than 24,000 researchers each year.\n  Funding for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is \n$2.1 billion, equal to fiscal year 2016, and that program funds \nactivities to develop the technology that makes our homes, cars, and \nfactories more efficient. It lowers the cost of renewable energy \nsources like solar and geothermal.\n  While I wish we could have funded the President's proposed mark for \nMission Innovation climate change, I want my colleagues to know that we \ndid the best we could, but we were simply unable to make it work with \nthe allocation we received.\n  The chairman mentioned the Army Corps of Engineers. With the highway \nprogram and the Army Corps, this is really the Federal infrastructure \nprogram, and it is funded at $6 billion. This is a historic high. It \nmaintains level funding for the Bureau of Reclamation at $1.275 \nbillion. In particular, the bill provides an estimated $1.3 billion \nfrom the harbor maintenance trust fund. That is the highest level ever.\n  While users of our Nation's harbors and ports pay into the fund, the \nmoney does not get disbursed by itself, and it is up to us to \nappropriate the money out of the fund. This has been a challenge under \ncurrent budget caps, and it has been a challenge to me because my \nState--California--pays approximately 40 percent of the fund's receipts \neach year but gets shortchanged by the disbursement formula. So I am \nvery pleased that the chairman and the members have agreed to provide \nan additional $50 million for energy ports and donor ports like L.A.-\nLong Beach and Seattle-Tacoma that otherwise see little benefit from \nthe harbor maintenance trust fund.\n  The bill, once again, includes $100 million for the Bureau of \nReclamation's Western Drought Response program. Ten of the 17 \nreclamation States are currently suffering from severe to exceptional \ndrought conditions that have devastated the agricultural industry, left \nsome rural communities without any water for drinking or bathing, and \nkilled tens of millions of trees that could lead to yet another \ncatastrophic wildfire season in these 10 States. We in California had \nhoped that El Nino storms would refill California reservoirs, but the \ndrought persists and will persist. It is estimated that we need a \nsnowpack, just for point of interest, of 150 percent of the average by \nApril 1 in order to end the drought, and the snowpack was only 87 \npercent of the historical average. Therefore, this $100 million is \ncritical to operating water systems more flexibly and efficiently, \nrestoring critical wetlands and habitat, and ensuring that the best \nscience and observational techniques are being brought to bear.\n  The bill also makes critical investments in new water supply \ntechnologies to help mitigate the current drought and lessen the \nimpacts of future droughts such as desalinization, water recycling, and \ngroundwater recharge.\n  As Members begin to bring amendments to the floor, I very much urge \nmy colleagues, particularly on this\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nside, to exercise restraint, particularly with policy amendments. The \nSenate has just completed a broad energy authorization bill, and I \nunderstand that the Environmental and Public Works Committee will soon \nbe drafting a Water Resources Development Act. So I want my colleagues \nto know that the subcommittee has had to make some tough choices, but \nthese decisions were made in a bipartisan way and have led us to draft \na balanced bill, one that I believe and hope should satisfy Members on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I thank the chairman and the Presiding Officer, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2294-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2294-S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2016\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The senior Senator from Louisiana is here to speak, \nbut I thank Senator Feinstein for her remarks and her leadership.\n  I would remind our colleagues we are open for business, in terms of \namendments. Fortunately, 77 of the Senators had made requests that we \nwere able to accommodate in our basic bill. We have talked to maybe a \ndozen more since then, and are accommodating amendments whenever we \ncan.\n  We would like to begin voting on any other amendments that we need to \nvote on this afternoon, if possible, so we can move on through the bill \nand hopefully get to the next appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank especially the staff of Senator Feinstein--\nDoug Clapp, Chris Hanson, Mark Mendenhall, and Samantha Nelson--for the \nway they have worked with us, whether we are in the majority or the \nminority. I also would like to thank my own staff--Tyler Owens, Adam \nDeMella, Meyer Seligman, Jen Armstrong, and Hayley Alexander--for \nextraordinarily good work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n    Commemorating the 6th Anniversary of the ``Deepwater Horizon'' \n                         Explosion and Oilspill\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the sixth \nanniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oilspill that took \nthe lives of 11 men and devastated so many gulf coast communities. It \nwas a horrible event, but I think it is very important and appropriate \nthat we always recognize the lives lost in that disaster.\n  The 11 lives lost were Jason Anderson, then 35, of Midfield, TX; \nAaron Dale ``Bubba'' Burkeen, 37, of Philadelphia, MS; Donald Clark, \n49, of Newellton, LA; Stephen Ray Curtis, 40, of Georgetown, LA; Gordon \nJones, 28, of Baton Rouge, LA; Roy Wyatt Kemp, 27, of Jonesville, LA; \nKarl Dale Kleppinger, Jr., Natchez, MS; Keith Blair Manuel, 56, of \nGonzales, LA; Dewey Revette, 48, of State Line, MS; Shane Roshto, 22, \nof Liberty, MS; and Adam Weise, 24, of Yorktown, TX.\n  The gulf coast is one of the most resilient parts of the country, of \nthe world, having faced a variety of disasters and yet always bounces \nback, always continues to push forward. In Louisiana, offshore oil and \ngas development is more than just our State's largest economic driver, \nit is a way of life, supporting countless jobs and families across the \nregion. That is why our top priority must always be maintaining the \nhighest level of safety standards. In the last 6 years, we have been \nworking to make sure this kind of human tragedy that we commemorate \ntoday on this sixth anniversary never happens again.\n  It has been a real uphill battle, but the good news is that we have \nhad a few solid wins during that time. Louisiana's resilience and \nrecovery cannot be easily measured in terms of numbers and figures, but \nI can say with confidence that each and every Louisianian should be \nproud of how far we have come, including in these last 6 years. That is \nwhy as a region it continues to be imperative that we fight misguided \nattempts coming out of Washington that would hinder the progress we \nhave made. From fighting President Obama's misguided drilling \nmoratorium to working to pass the RESTORE Act, our region has \ncontinually shown our ability to work together to produce the right \npositive results, but the battle certainly is ongoing.\n  The current dramatic downturn in energy production has had ripple \neffects across Louisiana and the country, which is why the very last \nthing the government should be doing now is imposing new obstructive \nrules and regulations. Instead, we should be focusing\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\non finding commonsense solutions to improve safety and buoy our \nLouisiana-based businesses and preserve thousands of crucial jobs. We \nmust support policies that create a strong balance between having a \nsolid regulatory scheme that certainly promotes strong safety standards \nwhile also allowing the energy industry to thrive and prosper.\n  In the 6 years since the tragic Deepwater Horizon explosion and \nspill, Louisiana has done what we do best: recover, rebuild, and \nprogress. In order to build a broader future for our families, \nbusinesses, and communities, we must also protect the symbiotic \nrelationship between Federal regulations and the oil and gas industry \nand not allow the former to strangle the positive livelihood so many \ndepend on in that industry.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Climate Change Agreement\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on Friday, representatives from more \nthan 130 countries are going to be gathering at the United Nations in \nNew York to sign a broad new climate change agreement. This is the same \nagreement that countries negotiated in Paris last year.\n  Back in December, President Obama said that it was a ``strong'' \nagreement. Hillary Clinton called it a ``historic step forward.'' But \nfor many Americans, it is actually going to be a giant step backward.\n  First, I believe this agreement is terrible for our economy. The \nObama administration is using this international agreement to force new \nregulations on American energy producers and new restrictions on the \nAmerican people. There are new rules on coal producers, and there are \nnew rules on exports of American crude oil and liquefied natural gas.\n  This administration has spent years--years--targeting the men and \nwomen who produce American energy, energy in our country. Well, \nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress rejected the President's radical \nideas. We knew that all of these regulations would cripple America's \nenergy industries and would throw Americans out of work, many in my \nhome State of Wyoming. We knew that all of these destructive rules \nwould cost billions of dollars and produce little or no positive \nbenefit. The Obama administration went ahead and ignored what the \npeople wanted, and they wrote these destructive new rules anyway.\n  All of these regulations have consequences. My home State of Wyoming \nhas seen thousands of hard-working men and women lose their jobs in the \nenergy fields. Just over the past few years, people working in oil, \ngas, coal, and uranium--just a few weeks ago, two of the largest coal \nmines in Wyoming announced that they would let go 15 percent of their \nworkers. Some 465 families were affected by the job losses.\n  Despite all of this pain, the Obama administration went out and \npromised the rest of the world that it was going to keep pushing for \nmore restrictions on American energy, on red, white, and blue energy. \nThe other countries getting together in New York on Friday need to be \naware that there are serious doubts about whether this administration \nis actually going to be able to actually do that.\n  This administration has promised huge cuts to America's greenhouse \ngas emissions, but the promise has already run into legal problems. The \nSupreme Court ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to stop \nenforcing the so-called Clean Power Plan--stop enforcing it \ncompletely--until the courts can decide if it is even legal. I believe \nit is not legal.\n  Now the Obama administration has promised $3 billion to the United \nNations for its climate change efforts. Well, it turns out that giving \naway this money will violate U.S. law. The money the administration \npledged was supposed to go to the Green Climate Fund. This is the money \nthe United Nations plans to use to coerce--really coerce--developing \ncountries to go along with the climate change--what I believe is a \nsideshow.\n  President Obama asked for $500 million for this fund in his budget \nlast year. So what happened when the budget came here to the Senate \nwhere the President had a request? Congress rejected the President's \nbudget 98 to 1. Talk about bipartisan rejection. That is it. But the \nadministration went ahead and transferred the money anyway, even though \nthe money was never authorized by Congress. Now the President wants to \ngive this Green Climate Fund another $750 million in taxpayer money.\n  There is a second climate change organization; it is called the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This \norganization is the foundation for funding this whole climate change \nagreement. The administration has contributed to it in the past. It \nwants to send another $13 million next year.\n  Here is the problem and the legacy the administration faces: As the \nadministration tries to give away money to these international climate \nchange groups, it is now prohibited by law. You may ask why. Well, it \nis because last month, on March 17, the United Nations officially \nrecognized the so-called State of Palestine. They said that the State \nof Palestine is a full member of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. Well, according to a 1994 law passed by \nthe House, passed by the Senate, and signed into law, the United States \ncannot give any money to any affiliated organization of the United \nNations that grants the Palestinians membership as a state. It is \ncalled the 1994 Foreign Relations Authorization Act.\n  These climate change groups are clearly affiliated organizations of \nthe U.N. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change--the \norganization that the Palestinian group, this so-called State of \nPalestine, just joined as a member state--says on its own Web site that \nit is institutionally linked to the United Nations. There is no denying \nit. It says that the Green Climate Fund is one of its ``constituted \nbodies.'' So there is a direct link. The law of the United States on \nthis is clear, it is simple, and it is unmistakable.\n  The pipeline of money the Obama administration is planning to send to \nthese organizations is shut off. That is what happened in 2011 when the \nPalestinian group joined the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization, commonly known as UNESCO. That triggered a \nsimilar 1990 law, and the United States has not given any money to \nUNESCO ever since.\n  The Palestinians have been trying to get international organizations \nconnected to the United Nations to recognize them as a state for a long \ntime. It is part of their strategy. They think that if they can get the \nrest of the world to recognize the ``State of Palestinian,'' then it \nstrengthens their hand in negotiations with Israel.\n  That strategy absolutely undercuts U.S. policy that says the \nPalestinians and the Israelis should be negotiating these things on \ntheir own without the rest of the world getting involved. That is the \nbest way for Middle East peace negotiations to go forward, and that is \nwhat both the Palestinians and the Israelis have agreed to in the past. \nSo U.S. law says that when the Palestinians try to go around that \nprocess, as we just saw with this climate change organization, there \nare legal consequences. That is why a group of 28 Senators wrote to \nSecretary of State John Kerry earlier this week. We wrote to demand \nthat he follow the law, obey the law of the land. We wanted to make \nsure the rest of the world understands clearly that it is unlawful for \nthe United States to give another dime to these U.N. climate change \ngroups.\n  The Obama administration has skirted the will of Congress in the past \nwhen it sent $500 million of U.S. taxpayer money to these groups. It \nwill not get away with sending any more money in violation of the law. \nThe administration needs to understand this fact, and so do the rest of \nthe countries getting together in New York on Friday.\n  The American people do not support shutting down our economy, hurting \nour economy, to support the administration's promises on greenhouse \ngasses. The American people don't support\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\nthe administration spending billions of their hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars to support this alarming climate change agreement. What the \nAmerican people expect is their President and his administration to \nfollow and to obey the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Working Together in the Senate\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday this Chamber passed a bill to \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, another bipartisan \naccomplishment that without a doubt has helped return this Chamber to \noperating the way that I think we all believe it should function. After \nthat, today we were finally able to move forward with an energy bill, \nthe Energy Policy Modernization Act. We have all been working on that \nlegislation for some time now, and I am pleased we got it done earlier \ntoday. I give special credit to Chair Murkowski, the bill manager, and \nher counterpart Senator Cantwell for their incredible patience and \ndiligence in dealing with this legislation that had been stuck on this \nSenate floor for some time.\n  Senator Murkowski, in particular, didn't shy away from addressing \nsome of the most difficult challenges head on. Needless to say, her \ntirelessness, her diligence, and hard work finally paid off earlier \ntoday.\n  This legislation is important to the country because it helps update \nour energy policies and helps America produce more energy, use it more \nefficiently, and save money in the process. One of the most significant \nportions of that legislation was streamlining the approval process for \nthe liquefied natural gas export. This is really an example of how our \nenergy future has been transformed so dramatically.\n  You may recall that years ago there were terminals being built around \nthe country on the shorelines that were going to be the recipients of \nnatural gas produced in some other part of the world and then brought \nto the United States. But thanks to modern drilling technology and the \nuse of fracking--I know in some quarters this is a dirty word, but we \nhave been doing it successfully in the United States for 70 or more \nyears. Thanks to horizontal drilling in fracking and modern drilling \ntechnologies, America is now producing more natural gas than we have \nany use for. It is good for our economy, good for our jobs, and good \nfor the world, really, for America to be able to export more of its \nnatural gas--and oil, for that matter. It is something we dealt with at \nthe end of last year when we lifted the antiquated export ban on crude \noil.\n  This legislation, like the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization bill, is another example of how the Senate is back to \nwork. When I talk to constituents and folks back home, I say: Well, you \nmay not have heard--or if you heard it, you may not actually believe \nit--but we are actually getting some work done in this Congress under \nnew leadership. I think it has been beneficial not only to the country, \nnot just to those directly affected by the legislation we are passing--\nthings such as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to deal \nwith the opioid prescription drug abuse and heroin issue--not only are \nthe people directly affected by the legislation benefiting, but the \nentire country is, and particularly Members of the Senate. We have \nactually been able to debate, discuss, and ultimately vote on \nlegislation. What a concept.\n  It was not too long ago--when the Democratic leader was majority \nleader--that this Senate was virtually shut down. Even if you were in \nthe majority party, even if you were a Democrat when Democrats held the \nmajority in the Senate, basically because of the decision to shut down \nthe legislative process and to deny anyone an opportunity to offer an \namendment, when it came to election time, many of our Democratic \ncolleagues didn't have anything to show for their service representing \ntheir constituents in the Senate, even though they were in the majority \nparty.\n  Under the new leadership of the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, \nthe Senate majority leader is committed to an open process that \nbenefits all Members of the Senate and all 320 million or so people in \nthe United States who we represent. Now any Senator, regardless of \nwhether they are in the majority or minority, can call up and seek \nvotes on amendments to legislation to help make legislation better. I \nthink we have learned an invaluable lesson from the mistakes of the \npast. Only by working together in a bipartisan way can we try to find \nconsensus and get things done. The American people deserve that.\n  Now that we have finished our work on the Energy bill, I hope we can \nwork together to address other problems facing the country. One of the \nmost fundamental jobs the Congress has to perform is the appropriations \nprocess because somebody has to pay for the policies to actually make \nthe policies that we pass work.\n  This week we have a chance to start that process with the Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill. This is another example of great bipartisan \nwork and commitment, a bill that unanimously passed out of committee. \nThis legislation will invest in our Nation's waterways and fund \ncritical infrastructure projects.\n  Yesterday I spoke about the flooding that has been affecting much of \nTexas this week, particularly the Houston area, and that we are \nstruggling to deal with. This appropriations bill, for example, would \ninvest in projects to mitigate risks associated with flooding like that \nwhich Texas has been experiencing over this week. It would also invest \nin our nuclear arsenal to make sure we are ready to meet existing and \nfuture nuclear threats.\n  To put it simply, this appropriations bill plays a big role, not only \nin terms of our national security but also in terms of our public \nsafety. That is both at home and abroad.\n  Last year we got stuck. We tried to move the appropriations bills \nthrough the regular process, but because of a dispute over spending \nlevels, our Democratic friends basically blocked any ability we had to \nmove the appropriations bill through the regular order or the regular \nprocess. Unfortunately, at the end of the year, what that left us with \nwas the need to pass one big Omnibus appropriations bill, something \nthat nobody said they liked. In fact, on the Senate floor I called it \nnot an Omnibus appropriations bill but an ominous appropriations bill. \nThe problem with that is there is very little transparency, and only a \nhandful of people are really directly involved in crafting a bill that \nspends over $1 trillion. That is a terrible way to do business. Now we \nare trying to get back to the old-fashioned way--one bill at a time.\n  I commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Feinstein for the \ngood work they have done so far. This is going to take a little bit of \ncooperation and maybe even a little bit of self-restraint, something \nthat Washington isn't necessarily known for. Even though all 12 \nappropriations bills were sent out of their respective committees last \nyear for the first time since 2009, we weren't able to get it done. I \nam hoping this year will be different.\n  So far our colleagues across the aisle have said they believe we \nought to proceed with a markup of different appropriations bills, \nvoting on them one at a time. This is our first test. Believe me, \npeople are watching to see how we proceed on this legislation and on \nother appropriations bills, including our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Stop passing some stopgap funding bill at the brink at the end of a \nfiscal year where people are talking about shutdowns. That is not the \nway we are supposed to work. We could do better and we could avoid \nthose pitfalls if we would just do our best, show a little restraint, \nand get our work done.\n  I hope the Energy and Water bill is the first of 12 appropriations \nbills that we consider, discuss, and ultimately pass because that is \nwhat the American people deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while the assistant Republican leader \nis on the floor, I wish to say a word\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nabout this chart that I mentioned earlier.\n  He mentioned this is the first bill where we are spending $1 \ntrillion. Most of us on both sides of the aisle, I know especially on \nthe Republican side of the aisle, are concerned about the Federal debt, \nwhich is $19 trillion, and we make great speeches about it. But as we \nbegin to talk about the $1 trillion we are about to appropriate in 12 \nbills, I would like to invite my colleagues to look once again at the \nbottom line. That is the money we are talking about. This is the $1 \ntrillion that we are working on. It has been flat since 2008. It is \ngoing up at the rate of inflation or a little less, but that is $1 \ntrillion.\n  We are spending $4 trillion this year. The other $3 trillion is not \nwhat we are working on in these 12 bills; the other $3 trillion is \nautomatic mandatory spending and interest on the debt. If we add \ninterest to that red line, it would be even higher. So I may offer an \namendment at some point--maybe not on this bill--to turn the entire \nbudget over to the Appropriations Committee because we are doing our \njob. We have kept spending down. That is not the problem.\n  I hear that some people may want to say: Well, let's further reduce \nthe blue line. I invite my friends and colleagues to say--we have \nletters from more than 80 Senators requesting support for projects \nimportant in their States, for flood control, nuclear weapons, national \nlabs, deepening harbors, and for inland waterways. We have included in \nour bill requests from all those Senators.\n  If we cut that blue line by $2 billion, we will need to ask for \nrequests from those 80 Senators about what they would like to cut--\nwhich flood would they like not to clean up, which lock would they like \nto close, and which nuclear operation needs to be slowed down. We need \nto be reasonable about this, and we need to be straightforward about \nit.\n  I want to see us deal with that red line. That is where the real \nspending problem is. I would like to see us be responsible on the blue \nline.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have cut a $125 million program. We have \ncontrol of one big construction project; we are getting control of two \nothers. We are doing our job.\n  As we enter into this discussion, I respectfully ask my colleagues: \nLet's keep a focus on the two lines. The $1 trillion is the blue line. \nIt is under control; it is not the problem. If that were the debt, we \nwouldn't have a problem. It is that red line that we are not doing \nanything about on either side of the aisle.\n  Senator Corker and I have a bill to reduce the growth of that \nspending by $1 trillion. We are the only two cosponsors.\n  After we do these 12 bills, we can talk about the blue line. But I am \ngoing to make sure during this whole process that, if Senators want to \ntalk about cutting spending, they focus on where the problem is. It is \nthe red line--not the blue line--that we are working on, starting with \nthis bill.\n  I thank the Senator for his remarks.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would just ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee, the bill manager--the point he makes is exactly right, \nand I think most Americans would be surprised at this blue line and the \nfact that this is the money the appropriations process spends each \nyear, but it is only about 30 percent of what the Federal Government \nspends--to his point.\n  My recollection is that under current projections, that red line is \ngrowing at about 5.3 percent, it seems like, over the next 30 years or \nso, while the blue line remains roughly flat. But that is a product of \na lot of things that need to be fixed, such as the fact that for every \n$1 put into Medicare, $3 is spent, and the fact that in the not too \ndistant future, the Social Security trust fund is going to run out of \nmoney because people are getting older, more people are benefiting, and \nfewer people are paying into it.\n  But the Senator is exactly right. We actually have been pretty \ndisciplined in dealing with discretionary spending because of the \nBudget Control Act and sequestration. And many people have decried the \nfact that we actually renegotiated the sequester numbers, but one \nreason we did that is for national security purposes, that about half a \ntrillion dollars of the money we spend is for national security.\n  I know the Senator is aware, as I am, that there is good work being \ndone at the Budget Committee level to come up with some budget reforms, \nbut unless we get control of not just the discretionary spending but \nthe nondiscretionary--the mandatory spending, that red line--we are \ngoing to continue to see the deficits and the debt grow. And when \ninterest rates go back up to normal levels, we are going to be spending \nmore money on interest on the debt than we will, perhaps, on national \nsecurity.\n  I told the Senator this was a question and I guess it is more of a \nstatement, but I just wanted to thank him and Senator Feinstein and the \nCommittee on Appropriations for getting us back to regular order and \nback to work, and I hope we will take up and pass this legislation \nwithout undue delay.\n  I would also add that this is not an opportunity for people to empty \ntheir out basket on different pieces of legislation they would like. \nBecause of the rules of the Senate, that would create a lot of \nproblems. So, again, I guess we would counsel for some of the self-\nrestraint that was talked about earlier.\n  I thank the Senators from Tennessee and California for bringing this \nimportant piece of legislation to us. I hope we can get this done \nsometime today or tomorrow.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership and for his comments. He is exactly right. Over the next 10 \nyears, according to the Congressional Budget Office, that red line is \nprojected to increase by nearly 80 percent--nearly 80 percent. The blue \nline--the one that is reasonably under control--will go up about 23 \npercent. But the bigger problem is that the blue line, as a share of \nthe Federal budget, will decrease from 33 percent to 22 percent. That \nis the money for national defense in an unsafe world. That is the money \nfor national laboratories in an economy that needs the job growth that \ncomes from that research. That is the money that cleans up after the \nMissouri River, the Tennessee River, and the Mississippi River flood. \nIt deepens the harbors in Savannah, Los Angeles, San Diego, Gulf Port, \nand all around.\n  After a big spring flood, I have been to Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee hearings where we have had 17 U.S. Senators come in and \nask for more money. Well, we have record levels of funding for the Army \nCorps of Engineers in this budget for the purpose of locks, dams, \nflooding, and environmental cleanup, and it is all within the Budget \nControl Act. We set priorities. We reduced projects. We cut some out \nthat weren't as important. And we have kept that blue line flat. We \nhave done our job on financial oversight.\n  There are a number of advantages to having a full 10 or 12 weeks to \ndeal with appropriations bills.\n  The first advantage is that it allows Senators, such as the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, who is not a member of the Appropriations Committee, to \nhave a chance on the floor to offer their amendments if they would like \nto. The way our system works, Senators may ask us--and, as I mentioned, \n77 did ask us--to include some of their ideas and policies in our bill, \nand we did in every case in some way--in some way. Now we are up in the \neighties. Everybody has had a shot at this and will have more of a shot \nin the next day or two on the floor. So the whole Senate will be \ninvolved. That is one advantage.\n  The second advantage is that it will show the American people that we \nare doing our job, that we are conducting oversight of the government \nagencies, that we have had four hearings, that we have set priorities, \nthat we have cut out lower priority projects and are getting other \nprojects under control.\n  The third advantage is that maybe we can put a spotlight on the \ndifference between the top line and the bottom line--the red line and \nthe blue line. The blue line is an example of good government. The red \nline is an example of malpractice. By whom? By us. By which party? By \nboth. By both.\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\n  So let's be specific. If you are a surgeon, you don't cut off the \nleft arm because your nose is hurting; you work on the left arm. And we \ndon't need to cut off the blue line if the red line is the problem--if \nthe red line is the problem.\n  So as often as I have a chance over the next 2 days, I am going to do \nmy best to remind our colleagues and the American people that we are \ndoing our job on the $1 trillion we appropriate, and Senators will have \na chance to help us do our job if they come to the floor with their \nsuggestions.\n  We are not doing our job on the red line, which is mandatory \nspending, and if we don't do our job, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff has said it is our greatest national security problem.\n  So maybe it will help over these 12 weeks to have a contrast: the way \nwe should be doing it, the bottom line; and the way we shouldn't be \ndoing it, which is that line that is growing out of control.\n  I welcome the opportunity, and I thank both the majority leader and \nthe Democratic leader for getting things in order so we can have a \nregular appropriations process for the first time.\n  I remind our colleagues that this is the earliest we have started an \nappropriations process since the Budget Control Act became law in 1974.\n  The Senator from California has suggested that I remind our \ncolleagues and their staff members that if they have amendments, bring \nthem to our staff, and we will work with them and see if we can include \nthem in the bill, or if Senators would like to offer the amendments, we \nwould like to do that today or tomorrow. There is no need to waste time \nhere. We have 11 other bills we can get to very quickly and other \nimportant legislation that is awaiting the Senate's action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise to express \nmy support for the open debate we are going to have on the fiscal year \n2017 Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  I would certainly like to thank the Senator from California and my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and I would like to thank \nSenator Alexander for his leadership and work on their collaboration. \nAs a person who has only been in the Senate for a year and a half and \non the Appropriations Committee for about that amount of time, it has \nbeen fun for me to watch seasoned pros as they weave their way through \nthe appropriations process. So I thank them for that. But this is what \nour constituents sent us here to do: to legislate, to express an \nopinion, to amend and debate. And I appreciate my colleagues' \nwillingness to do that with this piece of legislation.\n  This is a fiscally responsible, bipartisan bill which unanimously \npassed out of the Committee on Appropriations last week.\n  It is also worth noting--and I have heard it noted already today and \nwill probably hear it many more times--that we are considering \nappropriations bills on the Senate floor at the earliest point since \n1974. I look forward to the bill passing with many priorities that are \nimportant to my home State of West Virginia, and I also look forward to \npassing the other 11 appropriations bills as we move through this \nprocess.\n  We can all agree that governing by continuing resolution is not \nideal. The leadership in the Senate, and through the work of the \nAppropriations Committee, of which I am a proud member, has put us on a \npath to passing bills that will fund our government in a reasoned \nmanner, in a transparent manner, and in a manner which is an open, \ndeliberative, fair, and responsible process. Today marks an important \nstep forward--one of many to come, I hope.\n  The bill before us has enormous importance to every State and \nparticularly my State of West Virginia. It includes resources that \nensure safe and stable infrastructure, promotes and stimulates research \nin the fossil fuel industry, and provides resources for rural areas \nmost negatively impacted by the economic downturn and continued assault \nagainst coal-producing areas in Appalachia, where I live.\n  A few weeks ago, I visited the Bluestone Dam in Hinton, WV. It is an \nengineering marvel. It was built in the late 1940s and completed in the \n1950s. But we must maintain and modernize to make sure we have the \nsafest and the most technologically superior dams for the prevention of \nflooding. The importance of the Bluestone Dam to its surrounding area--\nand really all of West Virginia--cannot be overstated. It is protecting \nthe neighboring capital city of Charleston, where I live, from massive \nand catastrophic flooding.\n  This bill provides construction funds for the Army Corps of Engineers \nfor projects such as Bluestone, as well as operation and maintenance \nfunds for hundreds of locks and dams across the country, including many \nin my State besides Bluestone--from Elkins, to Beech Fork Lake, to \nTygart Lake. Disappointingly, the President's budget cut funding for \nthe Corps of Engineers. I don't know how you can do that. That \nirresponsible action is eliminated in this bill. We restore the cut and \nfund the Army Corps of Engineers by more than $1 billion above the \nPresident's request.\n  A smaller but equally important investment in West Virginia is the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, known as the ARC. I am pleased the \nSenate is again proposing to boost funding for the ARC following the \nincrease in last year's omnibus bill. While it might not be familiar to \na lot of people, the ARC really spearheads many worthwhile efforts in \nthe Appalachian region, including actions to help communities impacted \nby the downturn of the coal industry through worker training, economic \ndiversification, and job services.\n  One way to provide our citizens with greater opportunities is to \nprovide them with broadband access. West Virginia is not wired for \nbroadband like a lot of our other States. We need to meet the \nacceptable standards set by the FCC. We understand we have mountains \nand it is difficult, but if we don't do this, if we don't make this \nchange, West Virginia will be left further behind. This is an economic, \neducational, and health care tool.\n  The ARC is one of the entities that are helping West Virginia connect \nto the Internet, and by doing so, it connects the possibilities for \ncommerce, education, health care, and other things that all of us--\nparticularly these young people in front of me--have come to think of \nas essential to life as bread and water.\n  This bill maintains the funding level for fossil fuel energy research \nand development at $632 million. Sixty-seven percent of the electricity \ngenerated in the United States is from fossil fuels--coal, natural gas, \nand petroleum--and this will not change anytime soon. The Department of \nEnergy's own Energy Information Administration predicts that coal will \nstill make up about one-third of U.S. electricity generation for \ndecades to come.\n  If the administration itself acknowledges that fossil fuels will be \ncritical to electricity generation, we must ensure that we are using \nthese in the cleanest way possible. Therefore, we must continue to make \nthat investment in research and development for clean coal \ntechnologies, which is a large component of this funding. This funding \nis $272 million above the President's request. The President's proposed \ncut and those proposed by some of my colleagues--and as we move through \nthe markup we anticipate proposed cuts to fossil fuel research--in my \nview, are shortsighted because they fail to realize the value of the \nresearch being done in places like the National Energy Technology Lab \nin Morgantown, WV, known as NETL.\n  NETL has reorganized and restructured its budget to be more \ntransparent, so we can understand what is actually going on, where the \ndollars are being appropriated, and better focus on research and \nmaximize those funds. I applaud these efforts. Frankly, I think we \nshould all applaud them. Their work is very important to each and every \none of us.\n  There are many other provisions in this bill that are very \nnoteworthy, but I wish to close with this: For West Virginia, this \nlegislation provides funding and support that will help us in many \nways. I am proud to have supported it in committee and now on the \nfloor. I will be very excited to see my first appropriations bill \nactually come to the Senate floor. Well, we maybe did do one last year, \nbut this will be the first time Energy and Water has been on the floor. \nI look forward to this debate by my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                          FAA and Energy Bills\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I first wish to congratulate my \ncolleagues for the work they have accomplished this week, work on \nreauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration. For those in \nColorado, it is important work. For Denver International Airport and \nfor multiple airports around the State, the aviation industry in \nColorado accounts for tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars \nof revenue generated by not only DIA, but whether it is Vail, Durango, \nGrand Junction, or any number of airports across the State, we have \nbenefited from the work this FAA reauthorization has accomplished. I \ncommend the chairman, Senator Thune, for his work, as well as the \nchairman, Senator Murkowski, for the work she has accomplished on the \nEnergy bill--legislation that will accomplish greater opportunities for \nthe United States to achieve North American energy security, including \nthousands of jobs that can be created by legislation I was able to \nsecure within the bill on performance contracting--a very great \naccomplishment for the Senate. I urge the House and the Senate to come \ntogether quickly in order to find a compromise on the Energy bill and \nto get this signed into law.\n\n\n                         Cheyenne Mountain Day\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an event I \nparticipated in last week with General Hyten in Colorado Springs, based \nin Cyber Command, to talk about an event that was shared by Governor \nHickenlooper as well from the great State of Colorado.\n  Since 1966, the U.S. Air Force at Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station \nin Colorado Springs has been at the forefront of our Nation's capacity \nto track foreign threats worldwide, providing an essential component of \nNorth American defense and global security.\n  Today we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the operational capability \nof Cheyenne Mountain, an event General Hyten, Governor Hickenlooper, \nand I were able to participate in last week.\n  Many people across this country probably know Cheyenne Mountain Air \nForce Station. They know it through popular culture, they know it \nthrough movies like ``Dr. Strangelove'' or through ``WarGames,'' for \nthose who aren't quite of the ``Dr. Strangelove'' generation, and \nperhaps for newer generations yet, they know Cheyenne Mountain Air \nForce Station from ``Stargate.''\n  Colorado is proud to be at the center of the effort to provide for \nthe defense of North America through this facility which has far-\nreaching consequences and whose multiuse services are critical to \nnational and global security.\n  Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station is one of the greatest \nengineering marvels of its time, representing an $18 billion facility, \nunrivaled anywhere in the world, bored into the front range of the \nRocky Mountains. At this world-class facility, countless space and \nground sensor data collections are assimilated to provide our Nation's \nnational security leadership apparatus key information to determine \nthreat assessments and ensure the safety and security of millions of \npeople around the world.\n  The 21st Space Wing at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs \nprovides operational support and infrastructure sustainability, the \n721st Mission Support Group provides the dedicated daily sustainment to \nmore than 13 mission partners performing the national security mission \ninside the mountain complex--or the ``mountain fortress,'' as it has \nbeen nicknamed--and over 1,000 U.S. and Canadian military members and \ncivilians remain vigilant around the clock to defend our great Nation \nat this facility.\n  I am proud the Senate came together last week to approve my \nresolution, which designates today, April 20, 2016, as Cheyenne \nMountain Day, to recognize the 50th anniversary of Cheyenne Mountain \nachieving full operational capability.\n  Today we recognize the strategic importance of Cheyenne Mountain and \ncelebrate the efforts of the 21st Space Wing, the 721st Mission Support \nGroup, and the men and women who work for the common defense of North \nAmerica at Cheyenne Mountain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Abuse\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to once again share the \ndevastating story of the nationwide opiate epidemic that America \ncurrently faces, which is pain pills. It is a crisis I have been \ndealing with since my days as Governor of the great State of West \nVirginia, and each and every one of us as Senators representing our \ngreat States are dealing with it also.\n  It is ravaging my State. West Virginia has been hit harder than most \nStates in our country. The drug overdose deaths have soared by more \nthan 700 percent since 1999. Just last year, we lost 600 West \nVirginians alone to opiate abuse. That is prescription drug abuse.\n  Let me explain what we are dealing with. We are dealing with a \nproduct that is manufactured legally by pharmaceutical companies, a \nproduct that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration--the \nFederal Government--a product that is distributed and prescribed by our \ndoctors--the most trusted people we have in our lives. It goes on and \non.\n  Basically, people don't understand and have not understood for the \nlast two decades the devastating effect that it has. But our State is \nnot unique. This is happening everywhere, and 51 Americans die every \nday. Every day, 51 Americans die. You have to think about that. Every \n30 minutes or less, someone is dying because of an overdose from a \nprescription drug to which they became addicted. Since 1999, we have \nlost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse. We need a \nserious culture change in America to get to the root of the problem. We \nneed to change the approval of all these new, more potent painkillers \ncoming on the market.\n\n  The scope of the problem is this: In the United States of America, we \nhave less than 5 percent of the world population. Seven billion people \nlive on this beautiful planet Earth of ours. We have approximately 330 \nmillion people. How in the world can we explain how 5 percent of the \npopulation consumes 80 percent of all the addictive opioids produced in \nthe world? Our country is the most addicted country on Earth. There is \nnot another one like us. We allow pharmaceuticals to advertise their \nproducts on television. We are the only ones who allow drugs that are \naddictive and have the ability to destroy lives to be advertised, and \nso naturally people are asking for them. They want to go out and buy \nsomething because the market is so slick. How we approach this is \ntotally wrong. There needs to be an overhaul of our culture.\n  My office continues to get flooded with letters. Today I will read a \nletter from my State of West Virginia and the Presiding Officer's State \nof Georgia. We are encouraging people to continue to share their \nexperiences. The reason I am encouraging people to share their letters \nis because for far too long this has been a silent killer. There is not \na person watching this or a person in this Chamber who doesn't know \nsomebody in their immediate family or extended family who has been \naffected by drug abuse. Most of the time, it is legal prescription drug \nabuse. We have an epidemic on our hands.\n  We talk about Ebola, Zika, and all the other things that are of \nconcern to us, but not one of those is killing 51 Americans every day, \nand people are still silent about it. Well, people are breaking their \nsilence and sending these letters to me. I will read them every week so \nI can put a personal touch on this epidemic we face. I don't want \npeople to be ashamed. We have all had it happen to us. It could be your \nfather, mother, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousins, or children.\n  We basically have to look at addiction as an illness. For far too \nlong, we have looked at addiction as a crime. We put people in jail \nbecause they have committed a crime. Most of them are charged with \ngrand larceny because they had to steal to support their habit and as a \nresult end up with a felony on their record. When they get out of jail, \nthey are no better. They are still addicted, and now they have a felony \nand\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\ncan't get a job. We have taken them out of the productive part of our \nsociety. Our society is losing a whole generation of productive, \nunbelievable, beautiful people.\n  This is Debbie's story. Debbie is from West Virginia. She said:\n\n       My daughter started using drugs off and on around the age \n     of 13. It really escalated after her second child was born, \n     her ``husband'' being from Baltimore, MD with access to lots \n     of different kinds of drugs.\n       She told me that after the birth of her baby the doctor \n     prescribed percocet after a vaginal birth. She started off \n     snorting and then injecting them. Her drug abuse spiraled out \n     of control to using meth, on to heroin and cocaine, and who \n     knows what else. Then she started buying Suboxone illegally, \n     supposedly to get off the other drugs.\n\n  Suboxone is supposed to help you get off your addiction, but it is \nalso an opioid.\n\n       When she had her third child, CPS stepped in, but then they \n     walked away 90 days later. She took off to Baltimore, MD, \n     putting her two youngest children in danger, leaving her \n     oldest behind with us. However, we finally got her to bring \n     the children back to us, but she wasn't willing to stay with \n     her children. The drugs were more important. We now have \n     temporary guardianship and she is finally taking steps in \n     recovery.\n       I don't understand why these doctors hand out opioid drugs \n     like it's candy.\n\n  I can tell Debbie why they do it. They don't have the training. They \ndon't understand the effects these drugs are having on people. They are \nbasically told whatever the manufacturer or salesperson has told them. \nIf the drug is a 30-day prescription, they give you 30. If it is 60, \nthey will give you the maximum of 60.\n  Her letter continues:\n\n       I have another daughter that was in a car accident and \n     broke her leg. She had to have surgery and the doctor \n     prescribed her 80 percocet all at one time.\n\n  Can you believe that?\n\n       Already battling one child with addiction I VERY closely \n     monitored her medication. Not all people are strong willed.\n       This has to stop. These are dangerous drugs and they lead \n     to more dangerous drugs! These drugs are killing our \n     children, pulling our families apart!\n       Why are doctors prescribing so many at a time?\n       Why do we have Suboxone, another addictive drug to treat \n     addiction?\n\n  Methadone is another one, methadone clinics. They are the same thing.\n\n       Why isn't Suboxone an in care monitored drug so it can't be \n     sold on the streets?\n       Why don't we have free treatment centers in every county to \n     help with addiction so our children aren't dying?\n\n  I am going to talk about the treatment centers--or lack of treatment \ncenters--and what we can and what we should be doing as a country.\n\n       My daughter is 24 years old with a lifetime of fighting \n     addiction. My mom and sister had to bury their sons because \n     of addiction. I DON'T want to bury my daughter!!!\n\n  That was Debbie's story from West Virginia.\n  This is Winnie's story from Augusta, GA.\n\n       My name is Winnie Garrett.\n\n  She wanted me to use her full name because she is not ashamed and she \nwants to fight this addiction and she needs help.\n\n       I have been living in Augusta, GA, for 15 years with my \n     husband, son, and daughter. My daughter Erin is 21 and a \n     heroin addict. She started opiates when she was 16. She met a \n     guy who was shooting pills and heroin, so in September of \n     2014 she started shooting too.\n       She had a great job, an apartment, and was a highly \n     functioning addict. In May she asked if her boyfriend and she \n     could come and move into our house so they could save money \n     and get an apartment together.\n       In July, her boyfriend attempted suicide and was \n     hospitalized and then sent to rehab. Erin's heroin use \n     skyrocketed at that time.\n       In September, we caught Erin and her friends in our house \n     about to shoot up together, but we intervened. Erin agreed \n     that she needed help and she started methadone at a methadone \n     clinic.\n\n  So we have methadone and Suboxone.\n\n       In October of 2015, one of her ``friends'' that was in our \n     house back in September overdosed and died at her \n     grandmother's house. Erin started to abuse opioids again. In \n     December, she lost her job. By Christmas she had no new job \n     and no money to pay for methadone. She was going downhill \n     fast.\n       On January 2, 2016, she called me and asked me to come and \n     get her. Her friends had left her alone, she had no phone, \n     and she was sick. My husband and I found her and told her she \n     must go to the hospital as we were not prepared to help her \n     go through withdrawal. We just didn't have the ability or the \n     knowledge to do it. She fought with us and didn't want to go.\n       As we drove closer to the hospital and stopped for a light, \n     she jumped out of our moving vehicle and proceeded to walk \n     away from us. We had to walk her into the hospital and commit \n     her.\n       After the hospital went through her belongings, she was \n     civilly committed for a minimum of 72 hours. Erin went \n     through withdrawal and was clean for about 2 weeks but \n     wouldn't consider going to a rehab place because she wouldn't \n     want to leave her ``friends.'' She has relapsed, and I have \n     tried to talk to her, but she is not ready for rehab.\n       It breaks my heart to see my baby girl now. It has affected \n     our entire family. Her brother wants nothing to do with her \n     and her father and I can only pray that God will look after \n     her and keep her safe from harm.\n       She is living on the streets and at anyone's house who will \n     take her in for a day or two. My daughter graduated from Fine \n     Arts Magnet School and was accepted to Savannah College of \n     Art and Design. Erin is smart, beautiful and very capable \n     when she is clean. I don't recognize my little girl on drugs. \n     Something must be done.\n       Thank you for listening.\n\n  Three or four years ago, these people probably wouldn't have written \nthese letters to us. They are desperate and need help. They are willing \nto put their names to it. They want to put a face on this epidemic. \nThey really do.\n  Let me tell you the problem. We do not have--Georgia and West \nVirginia--treatment centers. When people are begging for help, there is \nno place to send them. We have day courts and drug courts, but there is \nreally no treatment center. They end up with a felony on their record. \nI am not talking about those who have a violent or sexual crime; I am \nbasically talking about grand larceny. They end up getting a felony. If \nwe do get them clean, they can't get a job with that felony.\n  There are some things we have to do. Let me tell you what we can do. \nThe first thing we can do is address the treatment centers. Think about \nthis: We have a fee on cigarettes. We know cigarettes are dangerous. \nThey have proved that cigarettes are addictive and dangerous to your \nhealth, and you pay a tax when you buy cigarettes. Most of those States \nuse those taxes for their health clinics. We know alcohol is dangerous. \nWe shouldn't drink alcohol, but we partake in it, and they charge a \ntax.\n  We have no way of funding or supporting the treatment centers. We are \nlooking at and working on this almost every day. I am going to propose \nto my colleagues that one penny per milligram of every opioid produced \nby manufacturers be used to go to a treatment fee. It strictly cannot \nbe used for anything except for treatment centers throughout the United \nStates of America so we can help the people who need help.\n  We should also consider how to get people back to having a productive \nlifestyle. Let's say they go through an approved treatment center for 1 \nyear and then go into a mentoring program. Not only do they become \nclean, but they are mentoring and helping other people become clean. \nThey don't have a violent or sexual crime against them, but they have a \ncrime of larceny. Should that person not be considered--basically from \ntheir good standing of finishing a 1-year rehabilitation program, which \nthey passed with flying colors and are clean and have committed another \nyear of their lives to giving back and helping other people through \nmentoring--to have that felony basically expunged from their record so \nthey can get back into the workforce? If not, we are losing a whole \ngeneration of quality workers. These are all bright, smart people who \ncan do something and contribute back to the economy.\n  I will be coming down here every week, and I will make sure the \npeople of America know they are not alone. We hear you and we are going \nto do something.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for listening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Paris Climate Agreement\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as Secretary of State John Kerry prepares \nto\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\nsign the United States on to the Paris climate agreement on April 22--\nthat is Earth Day--2 days from now, there are lessons from past \ninternational climate agreements, namely the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, that \nwe would be remiss to ignore.\n  Let's keep in mind that the meeting they had was the 21st annual \nmeeting. This is the big United Nations meeting, when everyone tries to \nget 196 countries to come in and have mandatory emissions reductions. \nIt hasn't worked in 21 years, and it will not work this year either.\n  The situation they are facing now is kind of embarrassing. Let's just \ncall the Paris Agreement what it is. It is a political stunt for the \nPresident to do what President Clinton was going to do in the Kyoto \nProtocol back in 1997. To recap, in 1997, the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change adopted the Kyoto Protocol, which set \nforth binding targets and timetables for greenhouse gas emission \nreductions for developed countries such as the United States and the \nEuropean Union. Meanwhile, developing countries such as China, India, \nand Brazil got a free pass. In fact, the Kyoto Protocol exempted 80 \npercent of the world from greenhouse gas emission reductions. That was \nback in 1997.\n  I could talk extensively about how it was known then that without \ndeveloping countries, Kyoto would produce no meaningful impact on \nglobal climate change or reductions. What is most important in advance \nof the Paris Agreement signing, which is 2 days from now, is holding \nthe Obama administration accountable to the lessons learned from the \nfallout of Kyoto.\n  Let's not forget that the Kyoto Protocol--which was a legally binding \ntreaty, as opposed to the Paris treaty, which is all voluntary--was \nsigned by the Clinton administration in late 1998 but was never \nsubmitted to the Senate for ratification. This was because the Senate \nhad already voted, and they knew they weren't going to ratify it.\n  About that time in 1997, we had the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which \nwarned that if the United States came back from Kyoto with a signed \nproduct that economically harmed the United States or exempted \ndeveloped countries from participating, we would not ratify it. The \nresolution passed 95 to 0 in this Chamber. They knew when they came \nback that it wasn't going to be signed. With a vote of 95 to 0, not one \nSenator would have voted to ratify.\n  Ultimately, the 36 developed countries were legally bound to the \ngreenhouse gas targets, and 17 of them failed to meet the greenhouse \ngas targets. First of all, they are not even meeting the targets. Some \ncountries that joined Kyoto, like Iceland, had targets that actually \ngranted increases in greenhouse gas emissions, while others, like \nRussia, had a target of zero that required them to do nothing.\n  The same thing is true for Russia today with the Paris Agreement. \nRussia pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 30 percent but made \ntheir promise based on emission levels from 1990, not their current \nemission levels today. So they could actually increase their emissions \nand still comply with the commitment that they made in Paris.\n  Of course, they were looking at--and I remember from all the other \nmeetings that Russia is sitting back there with areas such as Siberia, \nwithout any development, and they could use that as land that is not \nbeing developed, where there are no emissions, so it sounded as though \nthey are really doing something.\n  I had an occasion many years ago to fly a small Cessna airplane \naround the world, emulating the trip of Wiley Post, the aviator from \nOklahoma. He was the one who was flying the airplane when Will Rogers \nwas killed. I was emulating his flight around the world. I will never \nforget going all the way from Moscow to Provideniya, across Siberia. \nThere is time zone after time zone, and there is nothing down there. It \nis bare down there--no houses, no industry, nothing down there. That is \nthe land Russia has been using to give them the advantage that they \nhave.\n  Others, including Japan, the host country for the signing of the \nKyoto Protocol significantly missed its greenhouse gas reduction \ntargets, and instead they increased. Here is the host country, and they \nincreased their emissions.\n  There were warning signs that the countries would fail to meet the \nKyoto targets. For example, in 2005, the year Kyoto went into force, as \nthen-chairman of the EPW committee, I held hearings on Kyoto where I \nquestioned the U.S. senior climate change negotiator, Harlan Watson, \nabout the European Union countries meeting their targets. Watson \ntestified at the time that only two of the EU countries, the U.K. and \nSweden, were on track to reach their targets. In other words, they all \nhad targets, but only two countries met them.\n  Another witness, Dr. Margo Thorning of the American Council for \nCapital Formation, told the Committee at the hearing that the European \nUnion ``policymakers are beginning to worry about the additional steps \nrequired to meet the targets.''\n  We now know they were right. The EU, one of the staunchest advocates \nfor the global greenhouse gas emission cuts, barely reached half of the \ntargets required by Kyoto.\n  If developed countries like those in the European Union have ignored \nlegally binding gas emission targets in Kyoto, it is highly unlikely \nthat they would meet the voluntary reductions that are in the Paris \nAgreement. Within the EU, some individual countries, such as Poland, \nhave already shown fierce opposition to the Paris Agreement due to the \nfact that they are relying on coal power to run their country. There \nalso has been vigorous debate over EU emissions reductions, and so far \nfurther cuts are off the table due to climate leadership fatigue from \nKyoto. Everybody is tired of it.\n  Some have said Paris is different because developing countries like \nChina agreed to the greenhouse gas targets. However, as is normally the \ncase, you have to read a little bit closer. China's climate change \ncommitment to peak their emissions by 2030 is business as usual. Yes, \nthey signed on. They are a developing country. But what did they sign? \nThey agreed to increase their emissions until 2030, and then they will \nreconsider.\n  After making their pledge, the New York Times uncovered that China \ndramatically underreported the amount of coal it burns per year, \nburning 17 percent more than what China had previously reported during \nclimate talks. Just last month, a London School of Economics and \nPolitical Science researcher found that it is possible that Chinese \nemissions have already peaked. It is no wonder when the country is \nbringing online a new coal-powered powerplant every 10 days.\n  We keep hearing from all of our do-good friends: Just give China a \nchance. They are going to follow our leadership. Yes, they are going to \nfollow our leadership, all right. They are anxious for us to meet our \nreductions as we chase our manufacturing base to someplace like China, \nwhich would be the recipient of it.\n  China is putting online a new coal-fired plant every 10 days. Why \nwould China bother putting forth such a commitment and why would the \nObama administration promote it as historic? First, it is in the \ninterest of China to ensure this commitment is ratified because it \nmakes it more difficult for the United States and the European Union to \nget out of economically damaging regulations. Second, it is in the \ninterest of President Obama to sign this agreement since his own legacy \nhinges on its ratification. For the agreement to come into force, 55 \ncountries representing at least 55 percent of emissions are going to \nhave to sign.\n  We have seen this before. Think back to Kyoto. Clinton did not have \nthe support of the Senate, yet Clinton delegated his U.S. Ambassador to \nsign it.\n  That is exactly what is happening today. President Obama doesn't want \nto go there because President Obama is fully familiar with the fact \nthat they can't reach their targets, and besides that, we have the U.S. \nSupreme Court stepping in and saying that they can't do it.\n  The Obama administration should take note that history does repeat \nitself. If Secretary Kerry signs the Paris Agreement--which he will--it \nwill be an act in defiance of the lessons from the past and in defiance \nof the best interests of the American people, all while achieving no \nmeaningful impact on global temperatures.\n  Just like Kyoto, countries will not comply. Here at home, the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\nmeans to force the United States to achieve a 26- to 28-percent \nreduction in greenhouse gases by 2025--primarily through the so-called \nClean Power Plan, which is likely to get struck by the courts--is \nextremely limited. Its implementation has already been blocked by the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  We have 27 countries that have filed lawsuits against the plan. We \nactually had someone from the National Chamber of Commerce and the \nSierra Club come before our committee just a few weeks ago saying: \nLook, there is no way in the world that you can have this kind of a \nreduction. So it is dead in the water anyway, with 40 percent doing \nbusiness as usual. Only 15 percent could have an effect from the power \nplan, and then the rest--45 percent--are not even in the middle of it. \nBesides that, the Supreme Court has now said that until all the \nlitigation has cleared up, nothing is going to happen. They intervened \nin that as well as the WOTUS regulations--the waters of the United \nStates. So it is not going to happen. They are going to have their \nparty there. The President is embarrassed, and he is sending John Kerry \nto do his dirty work.\n  I hope all 196 of the countries send their representatives to New \nYork because I would love to have them get to know America, travel \naround, spend their money, and go down historic Highway 66 that goes \nthrough my State of Oklahoma. They will have a wonderful time while \nthey are here, but they might as well skip the New York part.\n  I see my good friend from Indiana, and, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n             Nominations of mark McWatters and Adam Szubin\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, for more than a month, many of my \ncolleagues and I have come to this floor to talk about our \nresponsibility as Senators to do our job and consider the President's \nSupreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. That is right. Here in one of \nthe world's greatest deliberative bodies, where we have debated war and \npeace, civil rights, and the right of women to vote, we are now engaged \nin a debate about whether the Senate should carry out one of its most \nbasic constitutional responsibilities.\n  Even more troubling than the refusal of some Senators to consider the \nSupreme Court nominee is that this is one in a series of failures over \nthe past year. It is not an isolated incident; it is a pattern.\n  Back home in Indiana, our priorities are clear. We want good jobs and \nsafe communities. Hoosiers are asking important questions of their \nelected officials, such as: What is the Senate doing to strengthen our \neconomy? What are we doing to keep Americans safe?\n  Today I want to talk about two additional simple things that the \nSenate can do to strengthen our economy and to keep our country \nsafe. Both have strong bipartisan support already. We just have to do \nour job. The first relates to the Export-Import Bank. Last December, \nafter months of negotiations, and a 5-month lapse, Congress agreed, \nwith bipartisan support, to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, the \nofficial export credit agency of the United States of America, which \nhelps American companies, including small businesses from my home State \nand from everyone else's, compete in the global economy.\n\n  It does not get more common sense than approving an agency whose sole \npurpose--sole purpose--is to help create more American jobs at no cost \nto taxpayers. In fact, in 2014, the Bank supported $27.5 billion in \nU.S. exports and more than 164,000 American jobs and returned over $675 \nmillion to the U.S. Treasury.\n  The Bank creates jobs, reduces the deficit, and spurs economic \ngrowth. It is a win-win-win. Yet, despite bipartisan approval last \nDecember, Senate inaction continues to hamstring the Bank, which keeps \nit from fully functioning. You see, in order to approve certain \nfinancing, the Bank needs a minimum of three Senate-approved board \nmembers. Today, we have only two.\n  That is because board nominee Mark McWatters, a Republican, has been \nstuck in the Senate Banking Committee for more than 3 months. At a time \nwhen American companies are struggling to compete in an economy that is \noften rigged by other countries manipulating their currency, by \nintellectual property theft, and by insurmountable foreign regulatory \nbarriers, there are a few Members of this body who are intent on \nobstructing this important economic tool by refusing to consider Mr. \nMcWatters' nomination in order to advance an extreme ideological \nagenda.\n  So here we are again, willfully allowing an important tool for \neconomic growth to sit idle simply because some in the Senate refuse to \ndo their job. While most Americans find it hard to believe we cannot \nagree on something as common sense as supporting the American economy, \nperhaps more troubling is the refusal to confirm an official to lead \nour Nation's efforts to combat terrorist financing around the world.\n  Mr. Adam Szubin is the nominee to be Treasury Under Secretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Crimes. His job is to identify and to disrupt \nthe lines of financial support to international terrorist \norganizations, proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics \ntraffickers, and other actors posing a threat to U.S. national security \nor foreign policy.\n  It is a critical job. Just about anyone you ask will tell you that \nAdam Szubin is the guy we want doing this job. He has helped shape and \nenforce U.S. sanctions against our adversaries for nearly a decade, \nunder both Republican and Democratic administrations. He is recognized \nas a leading expert on terrorism financing and is widely considered one \nof our Nation's best tools in taking the financial footing out from \nunder terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda and countering \nadversaries like Iran, North Korean, and, increasingly, Russia.\n  Today marks 1 year since Mr. Szubin was nominated--an entire year. \nFor 1 full year, our country has worked to combat terrorist financing \nand enforce and expand sanctions against key adversaries without a \nconfirmed official to lead the charge. At a time when our sanctions \nregimes are critical to countering Iran's ballistic missile program, \nNorth Korea's nuclear weapons development, and Russia's renewed \naggression, and at a time when U.S. military personnel are serving in \nharm's way in locations around the world, combatting ISIS and Al Qaeda \nand their affiliates, the Senate is undermining the ability of one of \nour Nation's top counterterrorism officials to do his job.\n  By failing to act on the nomination of Mr. Szubin, who people on both \nsides of the aisle agree is the perfect person for the job, we are \nundermining his credibility with the very countries we need on our side \nto effect these sanctions and to cut off funding flows to terrorists.\n  The American people expect us to use every single resource--every \nsingle resource we have--to keep our Nation safe. Yet, when it comes to \nputting our strongest team on the field to fight back and to cut off \nterrorist financing, some in this body continue to put politics ahead \nof our national security.\n  Why has Mr. Szubin not yet been confirmed as the Under Secretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Crimes? Simply put, the Senate refuses to do \nits job, to have a vote. I understand it is an election year and there \nis much discussion in Washington about what is good political strategy \nfor the different parties. While the timing may be inconvenient for \nsome, I will remind my colleagues that every day outside of Washington, \nlaw enforcement officers, among many others, rely on a fully \nfunctioning Supreme Court for the legal guidance that serves as the \nbasis of our founding promise of liberty and justice for all.\n  I remind my colleagues that every day across our country, millions of \nhard-working men and women go to work to support their families, many \nof whom rely on jobs supported by the Export-Import Bank. Every day \nacross the globe, our service men and women put their lives on the line \nto protect our country from terrorists and from foreign nations intent \non doing us harm.\n  Many of those terrorists and foreign nations are targets of the \ncrippling sanctions the U.S. Treasury implements and enforces to help \nkeep Americans safe. Adam Szubin is leading that team. These men and \nwomen who go to work to support their families, the law enforcement \nofficers who protect our communities, and the service men and\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nwomen who fight for our great country every single day do not stop \ndoing their job because it is an election year. They do not pass on \nconfirmations because it is inconvenient timing.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again. Most Americans \nbelieve Congress can do something to help move our country forward. At \nthe very least, we should do no harm. We are falling short of this most \nbasic standard. But we can change that right now by simply doing our \njob, by considering Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, \nby doing our job to support the economy by considering the nomination \nof Mark McWatters to sit on the board of the Export-Import Bank, and by \ndoing our job to support our troops and protect our country by \nconsidering the nomination of Adam Szubin to be Under Secretary of the \nTreasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes.\n  This should be the very least that we do. We need to do it now. Let's \nfollow the example of those who elected us, who roll up their sleeves \nevery day and go to work. It is time for us to roll up our sleeves and \ngo to work and do our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I just wanted to compliment the \nSenator from Indiana on the remarks he has just made and thank him very \nmuch.\n  I also want to urge Members: Please bring amendments to the Energy \nand Water appropriations bill to the floor. We hope to finish this \nbill. The only way we are going to do it is if Members bring and file \ntheir amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 1 year ago today, the President nominated \nAdam Szubin to serve as Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes at the Treasury Department. Mr. Szubin's nomination was pending \nin the Banking Committee for more than 11 months before we finally \nacted on it.\n  So far in this Congress--not this session, but the entire Congress--\nthe Senate has not acted on a single nominee from the Banking \nCommittee, even those who play critical national security roles like \nMr. Szubin. We have not even acted yet on certain nominees eligible for \nexpedited consideration by the full Senate. In the past, the Senate \nacted on these ``privileged nominees'' as a routine manner.\n  The hard-working people of Ohio, Arkansas, and Georgia expect the \nSenate to do its job. Part of our job is to give the President's \nnominees fair, respectful, and timely consideration. Unfortunately, the \nunprecedented partisan obstruction we have seen over Judge Merrick \nGarland's nomination to the Supreme Court has been a fact of life \nlonger than that at the Banking Committee.\n  The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes is one of the \nmost important national security posts in our government. Mr. Szubin \nserves in an acting capacity in that position. Despite having \nbipartisan support, as evidenced by the vote out of committee and as \nevidenced by his initial appointment to the executive branch by \nPresident Bush, his nomination has languished for a year--a full year--\nbecause of one thing: Republican obstruction.\n  Allowing this proven leader to remain unconfirmed weakens his \nposition and undermines American influence in our efforts to track \nterrorists and stop them from raising money on the black market or \nelsewhere. The mission of Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial \nIntelligence is too important right now for us to have anything less \nthan our best person in that role with the full backing of this Senate.\n  Mr. Szubin served Republican and Democratic administrations in senior \npositions related to economic sanctions and countering terrorist \nfinancing. His job is focused on leading our country's efforts to \ndisrupt terrorist financing by ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other groups.\n  There is absolutely no question that he is qualified. Over the last \ndecade and a half, Mr. Szubin has distinguished himself as a tough and \naggressive enforcer of our Nation's sanctions laws against Russia, \nIran, and North Korea, against money launderers and terrorists and \nnarcotraffickers.\n  Given all the concerns surrounding terrorist financing, you would \nthink a nomination for this position would be a priority. In the Senate \nBanking Committee and in the Senate in 2015 and 2016, that has not been \nthe case.\n  I repeat. One year ago he was nominated. One year ago the Senate \nBanking Committee got his nomination.\n  Mr. Szubin's mentor, Bush administration Under Secretary Stuart Levy, \nwas confirmed by the Senate 3 weeks after his nomination came to the \nBanking Committee, when the Democrats were in control of this Senate. \nMr. Szubin's immediate predecessor took the Senate just 2\\1/2\\ months \nto consider.\n  This is a critical national security post that must be filled \npermanently. Szubin heads what is, in effect, Treasury's economic war \nroom, managing U.S. efforts to combat terrorist financing and fight \nfinancial crimes. He leads the charge to choke off ISIL's funding \nsources and prevent it from developing additional capacity to strike \ntargets around the world.\n  Cutting off the money supply, including profits from illicit oil \nsales, money-laundering extortion, and other crimes by ISIS actors is a \ncritical part of our strategy to defeat this terrorist organization. He \nworks to hold Iran to its commitment under the nuclear deal and to lead \na campaign against the full range of Iran's other terrorizing, \ndestructive, and destabilizing activities, including its support for \nHezbollah and other terror proxies.\n  He has broad support across the political spectrum. Even groups \nopposed to the Iran nuclear deal support his nomination. Banking Chair \nShelby described Szubin as ``eminently qualified.''\n  The recent Panama Papers scandal shows how some of the richest and \nmost powerful people may have used shell companies in offshore accounts \nto evade taxes, launder money, and dodge sanctions. The leak of these \ndocuments underscores the role that Mr. Szubin and the Office of \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence play in combatting money \nlaundering and terrorist finance networks. It is yet another reminder \nof why Szubin's confirmation is so urgent.\n  Mr. Szubin is well-regarded around the world for his intellect, his \ncourage, his experience, his expertise, and his integrity. He deserves \nthe strong backing of the Senate. Confirming him would demonstrate the \ncommitment of the United States to disrupt and destroy the global \nfinancial networks of terrorist organizations. Without it, his ability \nto operate here and abroad is undermined.\n  Treasury must have in place an experienced watchdog with the know-how \nand with the authority to lead U.S. efforts to track and choke off the \nfinancial lifeblood of terrorist organizations.\n  The bottom line is Republicans in Congress need to stop holding our \nnational security apparatus hostage to political demands. We need to \nallow Adam Szubin and other national security nominees to be approved. \nThe Senate needs to do its job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 478, the nomination of Adam \nJ. Szubin to be Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes; \nthat the Senate proceed to vote on the nomination without intervening \naction or debate; and that following disposition of the nomination, the \nSenate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Reserving the right to object, and I will object.\n  Until just a few weeks ago, I did not object to Mr. Szubin's \nnomination.\n  I did oppose the nomination in the Banking Committee because he \nsupports a clearly inconsistent interpretation of the Iran threat \nreduction act because it would hinder the implementation of the Iran \nnuclear deal. To be fair to Mr. Szubin, he is well respected on both \nsides of the aisle, having worked in the former Bush administration. I \nsuspect this is not his interpretation. This is the interpretation of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\ncommunity organizer, the failed novelist, and the political operative \nwho are in charge of implementing these parts of the Iran nuclear deal. \nHowever, I couldn't, in good conscience, support the nomination given \nthat clearly flawed interpretation.\n  But just 2 or 3 weeks ago, Secretary Jack Lew gave a speech in which \nhe all but announced that the U.S. Government would allow Iran access \nto the U.S. dollar. This would truly unravel every last sanction we \nhave against Iran, not just for their nuclear program but for their \ncampaign of aggression and terror throughout the Middle East.\n  This is in direct contradiction to what Secretary Lew said and in \ndirect contradiction to what Mr. Szubin said. In fact, I would note Mr. \nSzubin's testimony before the Banking Committee last summer:\n\n       Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars \n     through New York, hold correspondent account relationships \n     with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing \n     arrangements with U.S. banks. . . . In short, Iran will \n     continue to be denied access to the world's principal \n     financial and commercial market.\n\n  Further, in another quote, he said:\n\n     . . . nor will Iran be able to access the U.S. banking \n     sector, even for that momentary transaction to, what we call, \n     dollarize a foreign payment.\n\n  Yet Secretary Lew has all but announced that the U.S. Government will \nallow Iran to dollarize their foreign transactions. In fact, Secretary \nof State John Kerry just this week is meeting with his Iranian \ncounterpart to try to figure out more ways we can heap economic \nbenefits on the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism.\n  So until President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and Secretary Lew publicly \nand conclusively renounce any intent to allow Iran to dollarize a \nforeign transaction, I will object to this nomination.\n  If the Senator from Ohio and 41 other Democrats don't like that, they \nshould have considered that before they voted for a deal that gave over \n$100 billion to the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I find it ironic. This is the first time we \nhave actually heard specific reasons--all seeming fairly recent, mostly \nseeming fairly recent about objections to Mr. Szubin. But I also find \nit interesting that they talk about sanctions not being fully enforced. \nWell, don't you need someone in place who has the imprimatur of a full \nappointment to the position, not just nomination and serving as interim \nor acting but full appointment with Senate confirmation?\n  I just stand puzzled by that, but I also understand the partisan \nnature of this. I remember my colleague's letter to the country of Iran \nthat 46 Republican Senators signed saying, for all intents and \npurposes: Don't negotiate with President Obama.\n  This is a lot about President Obama, but I don't care about that. \nWhat I care about is that he is acting in that position, and not \nconfirming him makes no sense for our country.\n  A full year has gone by. I intend to continue to press for approval \nof Adam Szubin and others before our committee in the weeks ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the conflict over the \nSupreme Court vacancy created by the untimely death of Justice Antonin \nScalia. This conflict has two dimensions, one focusing on the nominee \nand the second focusing on the confirmation process.\n  America's Founders established a system of government that preserves \nliberty by limiting government and including a defined role for judges. \nThree of America's Founders provide principles helping to define that \njudicial role. James Wilson signed the Declaration of Independence, \nhelped draft the Constitution, and was one of the six original Supreme \nCourt Justices appointed by President George Washington. He explained \nour system of government by saying that ``here, the people are the \nmasters of the government.''\n  The second principle is from President Washington himself, who said \nin a farewell address, on behalf of our system of government, that the \nbasis of our system of government is that authority to control the \nConstitution belongs to the people.\n  Alexander Hamilton served in the Continental Congress, helped draft \nthe Constitution, and became the first Secretary of the Treasury. He \nwrote 51 of the 85 installments of the Federalist Papers, the single \nmost important reference for understanding the Constitution. In \nFederalist No. 78, he wrote that the judiciary is the weakest and least \ndangerous branch because judges exercise judgment but not will.\n  These three principles outline the proper role for judges in our \nsystem of government. The people are the masters of government. They \nalone have the authority to control the Constitution, and judges may \nexercise judgment but not will. Our system of government and the \nliberty it makes possible requires judges who leave control of the law \nin the hands of the people.\n  The conflict over the appointment of judges is really a conflict over \nthe power of judges--a conflict over whether this should still be the \nproper judicial job description. Those whose political agenda fares \npoorly with the American people and their elected representatives want \na very different kind of judge. They want willful judges who will \nimpose their political agenda by manipulating statutes or the \nConstitution.\n  This is the first dimension of the conflict over filling the Scalia \nvacancy. I have spoken and written extensively about how the Senate \nowes the President some deference regarding nominees who are qualified \nby both legal experience and judicial philosophy. Those considerations \nare relevant when the confirmation process takes place.\n  However, the second dimension in the conflict over filling the Scalia \nvacancy focuses on the process, rather than the nominee. When and how \nthe nomination process should occur is rarely a question at all, but it \nis a serious one under the circumstances we face today. Ignoring the \nintegrity of the process, acting as if the ends always justify the \nmeans, would be a serious dereliction of the Senate's duty.\n  The President has the constitutional power to nominate judges, but he \ncannot appoint them without the advice and consent of the Senate. \nHowever, the Constitution does not tell either the President or the \nSenate how to exercise their powers. Deciding when and how to conduct \nthe confirmation process is as valid an exercise of the Senate's \nadvice-and-consent power as is taking a final confirmation vote at the \nend of that process.\n  Our late colleague Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York once said that \neveryone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts. The \nmajority leader recently offered a similar axiom when he said that ``no \nmatter how many times you tell a falsehood, it is still false.'' When \nit comes to falsehoods, Democrats and their liberal allies are telling \nsome real whoppers. For example, the minority leader has said the \nSenate's obligation to hold a hearing and a floor vote for President \nObama's nominee is ``in the Constitution.'' He has made that claim in \ndifferent forms on the Senate floor more than 40 times.\n  I understand Democrats want the Senate to confirm the President's \nnominee to the Scalia vacancy, but I cannot understand why they would \nput all their eggs in this completely fictional basket. As falsehoods \ngo, this one is especially easy to expose because the Constitution \nobviously says no such thing. This is why the Washington Post Fact \nChecker called the Democrats' claim that the Constitution requires \nSenate consideration a politically convenient fairytale.\n  One of the reasons the Constitution says nothing about Judiciary \nCommittee hearings is that the committee was not created until 29 years \nafter the Constitution was written. In fact, the committee's practice \nof nominees regularly appearing in public hearings did not begin until \nthe 1960s. During the\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\n110th Congress, Chairman Patrick Leahy denied a hearing to dozens of \nPresident George W. Bush's judicial nominees. If the minority leader is \nright that the Constitution requires such a hearing, then Chairman \nLeahy was guilty of serially violating the Constitution.\n  Between 2003 and 2007, Senators Patrick Leahy, Charles Schumer, and \nRichard Durbin voted dozens of times to deny floor votes to Republican \njudicial nominees. So did Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Biden, and \nJohn Kerry. If the minority leader is right that the Constitution \nrequires a floor vote on every nominee, then these Senators were guilty \nof deliberately attempting to violate the Constitution over and over \nagain. So was the minority leader, himself, because he voted 25 times \nto deny the very floor votes that today he claims the Constitution \nrequires.\n\n  The Constitution does not require committee hearings, and it does not \nrequire floor votes. The Constitution leaves to the Senate the judgment \nabout when and how to conduct the confirmation process in each \nsituation. Republicans have made that judgment by deciding that the \nconfirmation process for filling the Scalia vacancy should be deferred \nuntil after the Presidential election season is over. We are following \nthe recommendation of Vice President Joe Biden in 1992, when he chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee. The circumstances compelling his \nrecommendation to defer the confirmation process exist in equal or \ngreater measure today.\n  Neither Democrats nor their leftwing allies have even attempted to \nargue that the 1992 Biden speech and his recommendation do not apply \ntoday. Instead, they have had three different reactions. First, some \nhave simply dismissed it as not worth taking seriously. For example, \nPresident Obama responded by saying that ``we know Senators say stuff \nall the time.'' Others have complained that Republicans are \nmisconstruing that speech or somehow taking it out of context. Just as \nanyone can test the minority leader's claim about the Constitution by \nreading the Constitution, however, they can test our discussion of \nChairman Biden's 1992 speech by reading that speech--a rather long one \nindeed. The Washington Post read it, and reported this on February 23:\n\n       Biden's remarks were especially pointed, voluminous and \n     relevant to the current situation. Embedded in the roughly \n     20,000 words he delivered on the Senate floor were rebuttals \n     to virtually every point Democrats have brought forth . . . \n     to argue for the consideration of Obama's nominee.\n\n  In his 1992 speech, Chairman Biden addressed how the confirmation \nprocess should be conducted in two different scenarios. First, he spoke \nabout a Supreme Court vacancy in a Presidential election year. This was \nhis recommendation:\n\n       It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the \n     political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme \n     Court nomination must be put off until after the election \n     campaign is over.\n\n  That was then-Senator Biden, chairman of the committee.\n  Second, Chairman Biden separately discussed how the confirmation \nprocess ``might be changed in the next administration, whether it is a \nDemocrat or a Republican.'' He used the phrase ``the next \nadministration'' no less than four times. This was his recommendation:\n\n       If the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or \n     moderates his selections absent consultation, then his \n     nominees may enjoy my support. . . . But if he does not, as \n     is the President's right, then I will oppose his future \n     nominees as is my right.\n\n  Two separate scenarios, two separate recommendations. The first \nscenario involved a Supreme Court vacancy in a Presidential year like \n1992, and the recommendation involved the entire appointment process. \nThose circumstances and that recommendation apply fully today.\n  The second scenario Chairman Biden addressed involved the next \nadministration, outside a Presidential election year, and his \nrecommendation involved his personal support or opposition. Those \ncircumstances and that recommendation do not apply today.\n  I understand Chairman Biden's recommendation for deferring the \nconfirmation process in a Presidential election year is a very \ninconvenient truth for his party today. However, the only ones \nmisconstruing that speech today are those trying to create confusion \nwhere none exists by conflating these two separate scenarios and \nrecommendations.\n  The third reaction to Chairman Biden's 1992 speech is to pretend that \nhe said something he simply did not say. For example, I have heard the \nclaim that Chairman Biden would have gone forward with the confirmation \nprocess in 1992 if the President consulted the Senate before choosing a \nnominee. Let me once again quote the minority leader. It is pretty \nclear: ``No matter how many times you tell a falsehood, it is still \nfalse.'' Read the speech. Chairman Biden said no such thing.\n  I also want to comment on the President's recent remarks at the \nUniversity of Chicago on the Scalia vacancy. For example, he said that \n``there has not been a circumstance in which a Republican President's \nappointee did not get a hearing.'' Of course, the Senate's power of \nadvice and consent applies across the board. If the Constitution \nrequires hearings and floor votes for some nominees, it requires them \nfor all nominees.\n  Last month, the Congressional Research Service confirmed in a new \nmemo that during the 102nd Congress, when Democrats controlled the \nSenate, 52--52--Republican judicial nominees never even got a hearing. \nVice President Biden chaired the committee and denied those hearings. \nIn September 1992, the New York Times reported on page 1 that this was \npart of a deliberate strategy to keep judicial vacancies open in the \nhope that Bill Clinton would be elected.\n  The President also said there has not been a circumstance when a \nRepublican President's nominee did not get a floor vote. Obviously, \nnone of the dozens of nominees denied a hearing ever got a floor vote. \nThe 52 Republican judicial nominees I just mentioned were not only \ndenied a hearing, they were never confirmed at all. When the President \nserved in this body, he voted to deny floor votes to multiple \nRepublican judicial nominees. In fact, he has the distinction of being \nthe only President ever to have voted to filibuster a Supreme Court \nnominee. The President was a Senator during the 110th Congress, when \nChairman Leahy denied a hearing to dozens of Republican nominees. I \ncould find no record that then-Senator Obama objected in any way that \nthese nominees were being denied full consideration.\n  The President also said that the increasing use of the filibuster to \ndefeat nominees is unacceptable. Democrats first used the filibuster to \ndefeat a majority-supported judicial nominee in 2003. They are the ones \nwho started this. They led nearly two dozens filibusters during the \n108th Congress alone, preventing one appeals court nominee after \nanother from being confirmed. President Obama should know this because, \nas I mentioned, he participated in and supported this filibuster \ncampaign. The President should also know filibusters of judicial \nnominees declined by 65 percent after he took office in January 2009. \nThat did not matter to Democrats who, in November of 2013, abolished \nthe very filibusters they had used so aggressively.\n  The President also expressed concern that an increasingly partisan \nconfirmation process would erode the judiciary's institutional \nintegrity and that the American people would lose confidence that \ncourts can fairly decide cases. I submit that the kind of judge a \nPresident advocates has a much bigger impact on the American people's \nview of the courts.\n  When he was a Senator, the President said judges decide cases based \non their personal views, core concerns, and what is in their hearts. \nWhen he ran for President, he told Planned Parenthood that he would \nappoint judges who have empathy for certain groups. As President, he \nhas nominated men and women who share this politicized, activist \napproach, believing that judges may make the Constitution conform to \ncurrent social practices and evolving cultural norms. I think our \nfellow citizens can easily see that relying on personal empathy and \npersonal concerns is the opposite of impartiality.\n  Since President Obama took office, the percentage of Americans \ndisapproving of the way the Supreme Court is handling its job has risen \nby more than 20 points, and the percentage saying the Court is too \nliberal has\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\nrisen steadily. Three-quarters of Americans now believe Supreme Court \nJustices decide cases based on their personal or political views, even \nthough most Americans think they should not do so. The kind of judge \nPresident Obama and other liberals favor has much more to do with such \ntrends than how we handle some procedural matters within the United \nStates Senate.\n  Finally, I want to respond to the minority leader's recent attack on \nthe Judiciary Committee and its distinguished chairman, Senator \nGrassley. The minority leader recently made the bizarre claim that \nChairman Grassley ``forced his committee members to sign loyalty \noaths.'' I first thought I must have heard wrong. That statement is \ncompletely detached from reality, and, I thought, no Senator would \nutter something so strange on the Senate floor, but there it is in the \nCongressional Record.\n  The minority leader may be referring to the letter dated February 23, \nsigned by the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee affirming \nthat there will be no hearing for any nominee from President Obama for \nthe Scalia vacancy. The chairman did not force anyone to sign anything. \nIt may come as a surprise to the minority leader, but we sincerely and \nfreely came to the conclusion that the confirmation process should be \ndeferred.\n  If the minority leader really wants to characterize Senators acting \ntogether as evidence of a ``loyalty oath,'' then I have another example \nfor everyone to consider. When Democrats led 20 filibusters of \nPresident George W. Bush's judicial nominees during the 108th Congress, \nnot a single Democrat voted even once to end debate--not one. Every one \nof the 868 total votes for those filibusters was cast by a Democrat, 20 \nof them by the minority leader himself. Now, that is loyalty.\n  I have yet to hear an argument from the other side regarding the \nScalia vacancy that is not contradicted by present facts, by their own \npast actions or both. The Constitution assigns to this body the \nresponsibility of advice and consent as an important check on the \nPresident's power to appoint. Advice and consent begins with a judgment \nabout the best way to exercise that power in each situation. We have \ndone so in different ways, at different times, under different \ncircumstances.\n  Democrats and their leftwing allies are peddling the false claim that \nthe Constitution requires the Senate to conduct the confirmation \nprocess now for this President's nominee to the Scalia vacancy. Of \ncourse, they are free to claim the Constitution requires today the very \nhearings and floor votes they denied to Republican nominees in the \npast. They may say those falsehoods as often as they wish, but they are \nstill false.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Adam Szubin\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today to remind everybody that \ntoday is the 1-year anniversary of Adam Szubin's nomination to a key \nFederal post that works to stop financing for terrorism; yet he still \nwaits a confirmation vote in the full Senate.\n  Mr. Szubin, if you have met him--I think almost anyone would agree he \nis one of the most qualified people for this job to enforce U.S. \nsanctions on terrorism, finance laws against countries such as Syria, \nIran, North Korea, as well as against terrorist organizations, \nnarcotraffickers, and money launderers. The Senate needs to do its job \nby holding a vote on Mr. Szubin's nomination, as well as the \nnominations of so many other Federal nominees. We have to stop putting \npolitics above national security.\n  Exactly 1 year ago today, Adam Szubin was nominated to serve as the \nU.S. Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes. For 1 year, Adam Szubin and his family have been waiting for a \nvote in the Senate--and his family. I think way too often when we delay \nvotes, when we string out these nomination processes, we forget that it \nis not just the nominee, it is also the families of the nominees who \nare waiting for a final decision. Mr. Szubin received a vote in the \nSenate Banking Committee in March. Now the Senate needs to do its job \nand vote up or down on his confirmation.\n  I have a particular soft spot for Adam because I am convinced that he \nis one of the most intelligent people I have ever had in my office, and \nespecially in this critical and important job. He has 15 years of \nexperience countering the financing of terrorism in both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. During Mr. Szubin's confirmation in the \nSenate Banking Committee last September, Chairman Shelby called Mr. \nSzubin eminently qualified.\n  If we are serious about enforcing sanctions against Iran and \ndefeating terrorist organizations such as ISIL and Al Qaeda, we have to \nstop the financing of terrorism. That means we need Adam Szubin to be \nable to do his job at the U.S. Department of Treasury.\n  In January, I visited the Mideast on an official Senate trip with \nseven other Senators. We visited Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, and \nAustria. The goal was to learn more about the ongoing threats posed by \nterrorist groups such as ISIL and the progress we have made to roll \nback Iran's nuclear program. We met with allies in the region to learn \nmore about how to best prepare the United States to face these issues. \nThis trip was about protecting the safety and well-being of our \ncountry.\n  During our meetings, the issue that came up over and over again was, \nhow do we stop the financing of terrorism? We know that financing is \nthe linchpin of a terrorist organization being able to do everything \nthey do, threatening our country and threatening the world. For the \nUnited States to ably and effectively do that work, Adam Szubin needs \nto be confirmed to the job for which he has been recommended.\n  Some would say that it doesn't really matter, that Adam Szubin is \nstill at the Department of the Treasury and we really don't need to do \nthis. I think we need to look at, No. 1, what it means for the \nindividuals and their families when we delay these confirmation votes. \nI am not saying--and Members on both sides of the aisle will have to \nmake up their minds on how they are going to vote on that confirmation, \nbut why is it that we can't even get a vote? Why is it that we can't \neven get our job done?\n  Here is a position which most people in this body would say is \nabsolutely critical to the security of our country. If Adam Szubin \nisn't the right guy for the job, the right person for the job, then \nlet's find that out--according to the advice and consent of this body--\nand nominate somebody else. But why are we holding back on this \ncritical job against a nominee who I would tell you is eminently \nqualified? We should be so lucky as to have someone with his \nqualifications, his capability helping protect our country. Yet we ask \nhim to wait. We ask other nominees to wait. We ask that they sit by the \nsidelines with their professional lives in limbo while we have \npolitical discussions here in the Senate.\n  Is this a political decision? It might be. You know what. Let's take \nthe vote. Why is this so hard? Why is it so hard to actually put up a \nnumber of nominees, take the vote, make the decision, and move on? I \nthink that as I and many of my colleagues spend a lot of time talking \nto young people, encouraging them to be involved in public service, \nencouraging them to be part of a system that really does benefit all \nthe people of this country. We ask people to go into public service, \nand then, when they aspire and work to achieve some of the highest \npositions in our country, we say: Not only are we not going to consider \nyour nomination, we are not going to vote on it even after it comes out \nof committee. That is not a formula that speaks well to our recruitment \nof the best and brightest to serve the American people.\n  A year later, Adam Szubin remains in limbo. His family remains in \nlimbo. His confirmation remains in limbo. Please, let's just vote. \nThere are plenty of votes probably on the other side to say ``We are \nnot going to confirm you,'' but it is not right. It is not right. It is \nnot fair to his family, it is not fair to him, and it is not fair to \nthe people of this country to not have a confirmed\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nperson in the position for which Adam Szubin has been nominated.\n  I hope we can take a look at all of these nominees, break this \nlogjam, and eventually get folks put in positions that are essential \nfor American security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from \nCalifornia and myself, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported substitute to H.R. 2028 be withdrawn and that amendment No. \n3801 remain pending and be considered the committee-reported substitute \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Prescription Opioid Abuse\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about a huge \nproblem that I am pretty sure is affecting every one of our States. It \nis certainly affecting my State in a very serious way, and the abuse of \nopioid painkillers often leads to the abuse of heroin, overdoses, and \ndeath. This is wreaking havoc all across Pennsylvania. It is affecting \nevery geographic part of the State. It is in urban areas, suburban, and \nrural areas. It affects every demographic group and every age group. \nThe scale of the problem is shocking. The increase in the number of \npeople who are overdosing and becoming addicted is disturbing. I began \nhearing about this issue immediately when I became a Senator in 2011, \nand frankly this problem is getting worse.\n  I recently became the chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on \nHealth, and that has given me an opportunity to delve into this ever \nmore deeply. We have had a series of hearings across Pennsylvania to \nget as much expertise as possible so we can learn about what is causing \nthis and how we should deal with it. There are three areas that have \ncome to my attention--three directions--that I think the Federal \nGovernment can pursue to help deal with this very complex and very \nwidespread problem of opioid addiction. No. 1, we need to improve the \naccess and quality of treatment for people who are addicted. There is \nno question that this is a very difficult disease to treat. There is so \nmuch we don't understand. We don't understand what predisposes someone \nto be more likely to develop an addiction. We don't understand the \ngenetic implications. We know there are some behavioral issues, but we \ndon't understand as much as we need to know about it. We do know there \nare often underlying mental health issues which contribute to this \nproblem. Whatever these causes are, we need to learn more so we can \ntreat and prevent them better, and we need to treat the people who \ncurrently find themselves in the very difficult situation of facing \naddiction. As I said, that is category No. 1.\n  There is another thing we can do in the Federal Government. We need \nto take steps to reduce the diversion of these powerful prescription \nnarcotics to the black markets. In fact, prescription opioids are \navailable on the street for a price. There is a market for them, and \nthey contribute to the addiction problem we have. They don't get there \nbecause a burglar broke in and stole them from a pharmacy. That is not \nthe typical way these narcotics get to the street. They get there \nbecause someone prescribed it and a prescription was filled. We need to \nlook at ways to reduce that phenomenon.\n  I introduced legislation with Senator Casey, my Pennsylvania \ncolleague, Senator Portman, Senator Brown, and Senator Kaine. That \nlegislation is designed to reduce the frequency and occurrence of \nprescription opioids finding their way into the black market. Our bill \nprovides Medicare with a tool that Medicaid and private insurers have \nlong had, and that tool is called Lock-In. When an insurer--in the case \nof our legislation it would be Medicare--discovers that a patient is \ndoctor shopping, which is systematically going to multiple doctors and \ngetting multiple prescriptions for opioids, filling them at multiple \npharmacies, and ending up with a commercial scale quantity, our \nlegislation would allow Medicare to lock that patient into a single \nprescriber and single pharmacy. Any person with a legitimate need can \nget that need met, but we can put an end to some of these very large \nquantities reaching the black market.\n  The good news is our legislation was offered as an amendment. Senator \nCasey and I offered it as an amendment to the CARA legislation a few \nweeks ago. It was adopted by the Senate, and of course the underlying \nCARA legislation was passed by the Senate. I am hoping the House will \ntake this up, pass it, and get it to the President, and I am confident \nhe will sign it. That would be a big step in the right direction.\n  The third category of action that I think we need to consider are \nsteps that would reduce overprescribing in the first place. One of the \nthings I have learned from the many hearings I have had across \nPennsylvania are doctors who have told and described to me a culture \nwithin medicine in recent decades which has put so much emphasis on \neliminating all pain that doctors are tending to prescribe these \nopioids in far greater quantities than would have been imagined a \ncouple of decades ago. That is an important piece.\n  I have raised questions about whether it is appropriate to use \nopioids to treat long-term chronic pain as opposed to short-term acute \npain. That is another area we ought to be raising questions with health \ncare professionals so they can help us understand so we have an answer. \nThere is yet another way I think we can address this in the Senate, and \nthat is an unintended consequence of ObamaCare--a provision in \nObamaCare that I think is encouraging doctors to overprescribe opioids \nin the hospital setting. That is what I want to talk about today.\n  First, a little background on this. ObamaCare created a system that \nprovides financial rewards to hospitals that perform well on certain \noutcomes, such as reducing readmissions and hospital-acquired \ninfections, for instance. If they do badly in those areas, then they \nare penalized and get lower reimbursements. It is a financial set of \nincentives to get better outcomes. Those two examples I just mentioned, \nreadmissions and hospital-acquired infections, are objective, \nmeasurable, quantifiable, and there is little doubt we want to see less \nof those things. You can argue that it makes sense to have financial \nincentives to deal with that.\n  ObamaCare also links reimbursement for hospitals to a much more \nsubjective outcome separate and apart from the ones I just mentioned; \nthat is, patient satisfaction as defined by the government. \nSpecifically, the Federal Government mandates that hospitals survey \ntheir patients about their stay at a hospital using a form known as the \nHospital Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems, or \nHCAHPS. It is known as HCAHPS. That is the survey hospitals are \nrequired by ObamaCare to administer to their patients. Hospitals that \nhave a higher score on this survey get more money and hospitals that \nhave lower scores on this survey get less money. There is a roughly \n$500 million swing nationally across the country based on these \npersonal patient satisfaction scores alone.\n  It is not just that the government is saying these scores are \nimportant, the government is making it financially important to these \nhospitals. This raises a question, and the question is, Is the hospital \nscore on some bureaucrat's test always in the patient's best interest? \nIt is not clear to me that it always is. There is no doubt that \nhospitals, physicians, nurses, and health care providers generally want \nto have satisfied patients. We all do. We want to be a satisfied \npatient when we go to see a doctor or go to a hospital. It is obviously \na good thing if a patient has as good an experience as possible, but it \nis specifically the survey questions on pain management per se that are \nraising a lot of red flags and not just with me but with health care \nprofessionals and those who have been studying it. There was a recent \nTime magazine article entitled ``How ObamaCare is Fueling America's \nOpioid Epidemic.''\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nThis article is a lengthy investigation into the unintended but as I \nsaid predictable consequences of this ObamaCare-created HCHAP survey \nand specifically the questions in the survey that relate to pain \nmanagement and the prescription of opioids.\n  One of the questions from the study is: ``During this hospital stay, \ndid you need medicine for pain?'' Second question: ``During this \nhospital stay, how often was your pain well controlled?'' Finally, \nduring this hospital stay: ``How often did the hospital staff do \neverything they could to help you with your pain?''\n\n  These are the questions that patients respond to, and they contribute \nto the overall score on the test. The score on the test determines, in \npart, the level at which the hospital is reimbursed by Medicare. There \nis a very powerful financial incentive for hospitals to make sure that \npatients are answering these questions in a way that will get the \ndesired response from CMS--from Medicare. They are graded on these \nquestions. So it is a big incentive. When you tie the measurement of \nthese kinds of questions to reimbursement, you are very likely to get \nchanges in behavior. In fact, that seems to be what is happening.\n  I think we need to ask ourselves whether we are striking the \nappropriate balance here when 27,000 people are dying from heroin and \nprescription painkiller overdoses. Many of the people who are dying \nfrom heroin overdoses began with prescription opioids, and they moved \non to heroin when they discovered that it was cheaper and more \navailable than the prescription opioid that they got addicted to in the \nfirst place.\n  So there is increasing evidence now that physicians and hospitals \nare, in fact, responding to these financial incentives, and they are \nresponding by prescribing more opioids.\n  Dr. Nick Sawyer, a health policy fellow at the UC Davis Department of \nEmergency Medicine told Time Magazine:\n\n       The government is telling us we need to make sure a \n     patient's pain is under control. It's hard to make them happy \n     without a narcotic. This policy is leading to ongoing opioid \n     abuse.\n\n  A survey by the South Carolina Medical Association found that almost \nhalf of over 150 doctors responding reported that they were prescribing \ninappropriate narcotic pain medication because of the patient \nsatisfaction questions. One doctor wrote that drug seekers ``are well \naware of the patient satisfaction scores and how they can use these \nthreats and complaints to obtain narcotics.''\n  Here are two examples from a story entitled ``Patient Satisfaction is \nOverrated,'' published by the Pennsylvania Academy of Family \nPhysicians, about Press Ganey, a company that administers patient \nsatisfaction surveys that often include these HCAHPS questions.\n  One doctor reported that he had to give Dilaudid--and that is a \npowerful prescription opioid--for minor pain because his score on this \ntest was too low in the previous month.\n  An emergency room doctor with poor survey scores started offering \nhydrocodone goody bags to discharged patients to improve his ratings.\n  Now, as I said, I have had multiple field hearings across \nPennsylvania to hear firsthand from health care providers, recovering \naddicts, law enforcement--people who are dealing with this epidemic in \na variety of ways. One of our witnesses in Pittsburgh last October was \nDr. Jack Kabazie. He is the system director of Allegheny Health \nNetwork's Division of Pain Medicine. He testified: ``Physicians who \nhave compensation or employment tied to patient satisfaction scores may \nfeel pressured to prescribe opioids in response to patient pain \ncomplaints.''\n  Another ER doctor told my office how his hospital administrator \ninformed him that the ER patient satisfaction scores are in the 50th \npercentile--or average--and that he should find a way to get them \nhigher or ``I'll find someone who can.''\n  This is a big concern. There is a range of evidence that doctors and \nhospitals have been changing their prescribing habits in response to \nthese pain questions.\n  Now, let me be clear about one thing. None of us wants to see anyone \nneedlessly suffer. None of us wants to themselves go through pain that \nis unnecessary. None of us want to see a loved one or anybody \nexperiencing pain if it could be appropriately managed. For the \nterminally ill, of course, it makes sense to do everything possible to \nmake those folks as comfortable as they can be in their final days. But \nwhat I am asking is this: Are we appropriately weighing the risks and \nthe benefits here?\n  Sure, there is a benefit to complete and immediate elimination of all \npain that a powerful narcotic can temporarily provide, but we know that \nthere is also a risk of addiction to that narcotic. That risk is very \nsignificant, and it has increased exponentially. That addiction is \nincredibly dangerous because it can spiral out of control and even lead \nto heroin abuse, addiction, and death.\n  Have we gone too far in creating an expectation that the results for \nevery patient must be zero pain? Or are there some circumstances in \nwhich it is better to treat pain as best we can with nonnarcotics--\nother ways or other medicines? There are other treatments, including \nphysical therapy. There are other ways to diminish pain. It may not be \n100 percent effective all the time, but if it is temporary and it has \nzero risk of opioid addiction, then maybe we ought to be considering \nthat a little more frequently.\n  So this is definitely a complicated issue. There are many factors \ncontributing to the heroin epidemic, the opioid epidemic. But it is \nincreasingly looking like one of the contributing factors at some level \nis the financial incentives created by this aspect of ObamaCare, this \nparticular questionnaire that focuses significantly on complete \nelimination of pain. I think we need to ask ourselves whether this is \nappropriate.\n  Last week, the group Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing \nsent a petition signed by more than 60 nonprofit groups and medical \nexperts--including Pennsylvania's Department of Health Secretary Karen \nMurphy--to CMS, calling for the removal of the pain questions from the \nHCAHPS survey. Now, that is one approach.\n  Senator Johnson from Wisconsin has introduced a bipartisan bill that \nhas a lot of merit. His bill is called the Promoting Responsible Opioid \nPrescribing Act. What his bill does is it removes the results of the \npain questions from Medicare's calculations of reimbursement. So the \nquestions would still be asked, and we would still learn about how \npatients feel about the extent to which their pain was managed. But it \nwouldn't affect the hospital's reimbursement. I think there is a lot of \nmerit for that proposal. Again, it is because we are in the midst of a \ndeadly crisis. It is killing people every day.\n  The impact of opioid addiction and heroin addiction and overdose on a \nfamily is so devastating. I can only imagine the grief, but I know \npeople who have been through the grief of losing a child, losing a \nloved one to this terrible scourge. That is why I am here on the Senate \nfloor today. That is why I want to continue to focus on this.\n  I think there are many things that we need to consider, but one of \nthem is decoupling the results of these pain questions from the level \nof reimbursement, because the evidence is starting to mount that the \nfinancial tie is creating incentives to change behavior.\n  So I hope we will, as a body, address this issue seriously, because \nthere is a lot that needs to be done on this.\n  I appreciate the recognition, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the faces and voices of the opioid and \nheroin epidemic are all around us. The victims and survivors are \neverywhere, in Connecticut and across the country.\n  Just this past weekend, one of them perished. A young woman, Erikka \nLyn Hughes, was found unconscious in her boyfriend's apartment, later \ndying from a heroin overdose. Erikka was only 21 years old. She had her \nwhole life ahead of her, and her future was destroyed as a result of \nthis epidemic.\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nHer family, bravely and strongly, has chosen to speak out and stand up \nin the midst of their shock and grief to say that they hope that \nErikka's story will inspire action to combat this epidemic of overdose \nand addiction.\n  Rampant opioid overdose and abuse and misuse in our country has \nreached epidemic proportions, and it shows no signs of slowing. In \nConnecticut, I have seen these stories firsthand. This public health \nhurricane has swept our State and our Nation, crashing down on the \nlives of families and innocent people, much as a natural disaster would \ndestroy homes or landscapes, leaving a path of pain, heartbreak, and \naddiction in its wake.\n  The numbers in Connecticut are as shocking as they are tragic. Last \nyear in my State, a record number of people--nearly 700--died from \nopioid overdoses. Sadly, this number is abstract, but it reflects a \ndisheartening trend that has led to a 75-percent increase in \nprescription drug overdoses in Connecticut since 2012. I have heard \nstories, seen faces, and heard voices firsthand in roundtables that I \nconducted around the State of Connecticut--nine in all--involving \npublic health experts, doctors, specialists, public officials, law \nenforcement, and--maybe most movingly and profoundly--recovering \naddicts and their families.\n  I heard from parents who have buried children far too young. I heard \nfrom first responders whose quick action saved lives using Narcan. I \nheard from doctors who understand that change is needed to prevent this \ndisease from spreading further and from families and professionals from \nTorrington and Rocky Hill, Willimantic and Wethersfield, Bridgeport and \nNew London, New Britain and New Haven--across our State--people who \ncame forward to break the silence and defeat the denial that is one of \nour greatest enemies in this fight against opioid addiction and abuse.\n  This problem knows no boundaries and no distinctions in income, race, \nreligion, ZIP Code. It afflicts and affects everyone everywhere, and \nthat is the beginning truth to solve the problem.\n  I heard heartbreaking stories from a woman who lost both of her sons \nto addiction. The sobering conversations I had with her family and \nothers, while not always easy, were absolutely crucial to my \nunderstanding how widespread and pervasive this problem is. What I \nheard from them and what I believe is necessary is a call to action. It \nis more than an effort to honor the legacy of Connecticut citizens who \nwere lost last year--mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and \nbrothers--but to teach every one of us to reach those who are still \nfighting their own private battle against this disease.\n  Make no mistake. It is a disease. It is every bit a disease--as much \nas any we have discussed on this floor--requiring research and action \nand urgent and drastic steps that we can and must provide because it is \ndemeaning and reducing our Nation's fabric. It goes to the core of \nAmerica.\n  These conversations led me to do a report. I was inspired by the \nloved ones and families who have lost the most to do a call to action. \nIt is called ``Opioid Addiction: A Call to Action,'' and it has 23 \nspecific and definite recommendations. Some require funding, but others \nare without fiscal impact. I hope to discuss them at length in a series \nof speeches on the floor and not to leave this issue at one talk, one \nspeech, one remark, but to talk about it continuously, as we all should \nbe doing in our communities, because, again, denial and silence are the \nenemies here.\n  This report outlines 23 policy proposals focused on curing our \nNation's addiction to opioids. The proposals are all grassroots, \ncommunity-based solutions suggested by people who have firsthand \nknowledge. They are experts--maybe not in academic training, maybe \nwithout Ph.D.s and qualifications based on formal studies, but they \nknow this pervasive problem. They have seen it firsthand, and they have \nobserved the wreckage and destruction that opioid addiction causes. \nThey cannot bring back the lives of their loved ones, but they are \ndetermined that others will be spared this hurricane's effects.\n  These proposals, which touch on prescribing practices, adequate \ntreatment, emergency medical response, law enforcement, and help for \nour veterans, have the common goal of ending this crisis. They are a \nresponse to the most pressing issues I heard throughout our \nconversations. While none is a panacea, none is a single bullet, all of \nthem together are the beginning of a long process that must be \nundertaken toward curbing this epidemic.\n  A place to start is with our prescribing practices, which is where \nmisuse and abuse so often begin. Our Nation makes up 5 percent of the \nworld's population; we use 80 percent of its opioid painkillers. In \n2012, doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers, enough \nfor every American adult to have a bottle of these controlled \nsubstances for themselves.\n  Many of us have children. My wife Cynthia and I have four. Every one \nof them plays sports and every one of them has suffered sports \ninjuries. Most of them could have availed themselves of these \npainkillers. We drew the line and said no. Other parents should be \ndoing the same, but more importantly, the providers should be \nexercising greater discipline and self-restraint because every one of \nthose bottles, even if prescribed for legitimate injuries such as \nbroken bones, repaired LCLs, and other kinds of injuries, is \npotentially a risk.\n  Just last week a couple in Connecticut was arrested for selling \npainkillers out of their home. For 2 years they collected 1,400 \npowerful painkillers from their local pharmacy, abusing their own \nprescriptions in the process. In the pharmacy that got them arrested, \nthe couple picked up 300 oxycodone and 140 oxymorphone tablets. This \nflagrant abuse of the system should not be possible in our State or any \nothers.\n  There are legitimate reasons for painkillers to be prescribed, \nespecially in chronic pain or end-of-life situations. There is no need \nto deprive people of those painkillers when they need them for those \ninevitable reasons, but my call to action outlines steps to confront \nthis issue where it can be addressed so as to minimize the risk of \nabuse or misuse or overuse, especially when young people such as our \nchildren are involved.\n  It would mandate training for medical professionals to reduce opioid \noverprescribing. It would call for drug enforcement agency guidelines \nfor partial fills of these prescription opioids, meaning fewer of these \nprescription drugs would make it onto our streets.\n  Of course, reducing prescriptions can't be the only answer, \nparticularly when so many who need care go without it. My report also \nseeks to improve treatment options, calling for meaningful mental \nhealth parity, implementation of the law requiring it, and much more \nvigorous and effective enforcement to ensure that people who need help \nactually receive it. This step includes access to medication-assisted \ntherapy that can prove essential to the recovery process.\n  We can do more to guarantee that Naloxone, a powerful antidote to \nheroin overdose, remains both affordable and successful. This means \nholding manufacturers accountable when they begin raising prices to \nastronomic levels. The prices have been skyrocketing. Local police and \nfirefighters are often unable to afford it in their current budgets. It \nmeans also pushing for elimination of copays when it is prescribed at \npharmacies. Insurance ought to cover it. It also means that the Federal \nGovernment must do its part and increase funding for Narcan so that \ncash-strapped first responders can actually afford it to save lives.\n  Our law enforcement officials require both the training and resources \nneeded to keep our streets safe and our communities healthy and drug-\nfree. That means funding to establish prescription drug monitoring \nprograms--effective programs to facilitate training so that police \nofficers can recognize when suspected criminals are actually people \nstruggling with addiction and to assist drug take-back programs \nthroughout our States and Nation that allow the return of unused \nprescription drugs.\n  Finally, in my role as ranking member on the Senate Veterans Affairs \nCommittee, I have encouraged the establishment of more consistent and \nsafe VA prescribing practices and the creation of an integrated service \nmodel for mental health and pain management.\n  I am pleased that the Senate raised this issue and addressed it and \npassed\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act earlier this year, but \nthat measure is a downpayment. It is only the beginning. I hope policy \nlevels at all levels of government will draw on the strategies \ndelineated in this legislation and in my report and elsewhere to combat \nthe devastating epidemic of addiction and abuse.\n  Passing new laws is not the only answer. Enforcement and \nimplementation of existing ones is necessary too. The prime example is \nmental health care, where still, years after President Bush signed that \nmeasure in 2008, its implementation is inconsistent and inadequate, and \nenforcement of mental health parity remains an aspiration, not an \naction. Part of what we need to do is make sure that existing laws are \nimplemented effectively and fairly and that the investment is made in \ncommonsense, practical measures like the 23 recommendations I have \noutlined in this report--by no means an exclusive way to deal with this \nproblem.\n  I have no pride of authorship in these 23 recommendations. I would \nyield to wiser and better suggestions, but the point is that action is \nnecessary. It is necessary now because every day we lose lives. Despite \nthe best efforts of our first responders and our medical community, we \ncontinue to lose lives and futures, and our families continue the grief \nand heartbreak that I saw in my roundtables and that families in \nConnecticut feel today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                              Puerto Rico\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the fiscal \ncrisis that faces Puerto Rico. In addition to some thoughts on what the \nisland's own leaders need to do, I would like to commend the House \nleadership for their efforts to solve this problem with the recent bill \nthey proposed. We need to take a close look at their proposed \nsolutions, but they are right to tackle this problem head-on, and I \nlook forward to offering more ideas as the debate reaches the Senate.\n  Whenever I speak about Puerto Rico, I like to start by reminding \npeople of a very basic fact: The people of Puerto Rico are American \ncitizens and right now they are living in dire economic conditions. \nMore than 3.5 million of our fellow Americans on the island are facing \ntremendous economic hardship, in large part because of irresponsible \nleadership from the government in San Juan.\n  As we all know, Puerto Rico has a debt crisis of enormous \nproportions, and it has thrown off the stability of its economy from \ntop to bottom. While some have suggested that Washington can deliver a \nsilver-bullet solution to help Puerto Rico out of its debt, the reality \nis that nothing Washington does will be effective unless Puerto Rico's \nleaders turn away from decades of failed policies.\n  The debt crisis goes hand in hand with a deeper problem: Puerto \nRico's economy is not growing, and if the economy in Puerto Rico does \nnot start growing, they will never generate the revenue necessary to \npay their debt or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities they \ncurrently have on their books; in other words, the promised payments \nthey have made to future generations that are completely unrealistic.\n  Why is their economy not growing? The primary reason is decades of \nleft-leaning policies that have made it too expensive to do business. \nTax revenue is too high. Government regulations are stifling. The \nisland is unattractive to investors. Their leadership has simply been \nirresponsible. This year alone, even with all the fiscal problems they \nare having, they barely reduced their budget from last year. In that \nsense, the problem in Puerto Rico is not unlike the problem we have \nhere in Washington, DC. Puerto Rico's government is spending more than \nit takes in, and any time you spend more than you take in, you are \ngoing to have debt. No restructuring is going to solve that unless you \nrestructure the way you spend money. Bankruptcy protection alone is not \ngoing to solve it either. Without reforms, if we grant bankruptcy \nprotection by itself, Puerto Rico will simply be bankrupt again not far \ndown the road.\n\n  As a result of all of these problems, there is a massive exodus of \nprofessionals and others from Puerto Rico. They are leaving and heading \nto Florida and other places in the mainland United States. If we don't \nsolve the problem on the island, we are going to continue seeing \nthousands of Puerto Ricans leave, which is going to further cripple the \nisland's economy and reduce its revenue.\n  The leadership in San Juan has to show its willingness to get their \nfiscal house in order. They need to accept that their decades of \nliberal policies have not succeeded and must now be traded in for pro-\ngrowth policies. If they keep refusing to do this, our options in \nWashington will be more limited and we won't have support.\n  To help Puerto Rico, first and foremost, we need to do the same \nthings that are necessary to help the rest of the United States. We \nneed pro-growth and pro-family tax reform at the Federal level. We also \nneed to repeal and replace ObamaCare so we can end the disproportionate \ndamage the Obama administration has inflicted on the island by raiding \nits Medicare Advantage funding and reducing reimbursement payments for \nMedicare, which have left patients with fewer health options and higher \ncosts.\n  Puerto Rican consumers need to be treated the same as other American \nconsumers on the mainland.\n  It may be that the best path forward for Puerto Rico would be at some \npoint to include a limited opportunity to restructure its debt, but \nthat will require a serious discussion first to ensure that the \nsolution is responsible and fair to creditors as well. Any mechanism \nfor debt restructuring must be a last resort. It must come after Puerto \nRican leaders have shown seriousness, initiative, and courage in \ntackling the problem, and it cannot be seen as the silver bullet that \nleaves the creation of conditions for economic growth by the wayside. \nOtherwise, protection will only amount to a cosmetic solution that does \nnothing to deal with the underlying disease.\n  In closing, the problem must be addressed for the sake of the people \nof Puerto Rico. While there is a significant amount of responsibility \non the shoulders of the government on the island, we cannot ignore that \ncrisis here either. We, too, have a responsibility to our follow \nAmericans who live on the island of Puerto Rico to tackle this issue \nwith the same urgency and the same attention we would if this fiscal \ncrisis were confronting one of our 50 States.\n  I hope we will take up this calling and act. I again congratulate the \nleadership in the House for trying to do something. We hope they will \ncontinue that work to arrive at something that can pass there. But I \nthink it is important for us to take up the cause here as well.\n  For over a century, Puerto Ricans have contributed to our economy, \nenriched our culture, and nobly sacrificed in our wars. Puerto Ricans \nare Americans. They deserve better than indifferent leadership in \nWashington and atrocious Big Government mismanagement in San Juan. \nPuerto Rico's leaders must answer the challenge, but by taking some of \nthe steps outlined here, leaders in Washington can and must do their \npart as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Military Readiness\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last week a story appeared on FOX News \nthat captured a glimpse of the real damage being done to our military \nby years of senseless budget cuts known to many of us here as \nsequestration. I don't think there are 100 Americans who know what the \nword ``sequestration'' means. What it means is senseless budget cuts \nthat have emasculated our military and dramatically harmed our ability \nto defend this Nation. This poses a risk to the lives of the men and \nwomen who are serving our Nation in uniform.\n  In a story entitled ``Budget cuts leaving Marine Corps aircraft \ngrounded,'' senior marine officers warn FOX News that the ``[Marine] \nCorps' aviation service is being stretched to the breaking point.''\n  I quote from the story:\n\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\n\n  \n\n       Today, the vast majority of Marine Corps aircraft can't \n     fly. . . . Out of 276 F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters in the \n     Marine Corps inventory, only about 30 percent are ready to \n     fly. Similarly only 42 of 147 heavy-lift CH-53E Super \n     Stallion helicopters are airworthy.\n\n  In short, Marine Corps aviation is in a crisis and being left \ngrounded. What is the cause of this crisis? According to dozens of \nmarines interviewed by FOX News:\n\n       The reason behind the grounding of these aircraft includes \n     the toll of the long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the fight \n     against ISIS, and budget cuts--\n\n  For example, sequestration--\n\n     precluding the purchase of the parts needed to fix an aging \n     fleet.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       U.S. military spending declined from $691 billion to $560 \n     billion in 2015.\n       So, as the world has become more dangerous, as conflict has \n     spread throughout the world, the cuts have taken place in an \n     unscheduled, unplanned, and unorchestrated operation.\n       The cuts came just as the planes are returning from 15 \n     years of war, suffering from overuse and extreme wear and \n     tear. . . . Lack of funds has forced the Marines to go \n     outside the normal supply chain to procure desperately needed \n     parts. Cannibalization, or taking parts from one multi-\n     million dollar aircraft to get other multi-million dollar \n     aircraft airborne, has become the norm.\n\n  One marine likened the difficult job of maintaining this aircraft to \n``taking a 1995 Cadillac and trying to make it a Ferrari.''\n  This job is only more difficult because 30,000 marines have been cut \nfrom the force as a result of sequestration and its misguided budget \ncuts. As Maj. Michael Malone put it:\n\n       We don't have enough Marines to do the added work \n     efficiently. We're making it a lot harder on the young \n     Marines who are fixing our aircraft.\n\n  Lt. Col. Matthew Brown added that this burden ``is coming on the \nbacks of our young Marines. . . . They are the ones who are working 20 \nto 21 hours a day to get them ready to go on deployment.''\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Robert Neller said, ``we \ndon't have enough airplanes that we could call `ready basic aircraft,' \n'' and that aviation readiness is his No. 1 concern. It is no wonder, \nbecause this readiness crisis is literally putting the lives of our \nmarines at risk.\n  Lt. Col. Harry Thomas commands a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18s. He \ntold FOX News that last year he deployed to the Pacific with 10 jets, \nbut only 7 made it. His own jet caught on fire in Guam. Lieutenant \nColonel Thomas was able to land the aircraft safely, but the incident \nnearly cost taxpayers $29 million and Lieutenant Colonel Thomas his \nlife. Now his squadron is getting ready to deploy in 3 months, but only \n2 of his 14 Hornets can fly.\n  The aircraft shortage also means training is suffering and our pilots \ncould be losing their edge. As the FOX News report details:\n\n       Ten years ago, Marine pilots averaged between 25 and 30 \n     hours in the air each month. Today, in Lieutenant Colonel \n     Thomas's squadron, the average flight time per pilot over the \n     last month was just over 4 hours.''\n\n  I assure my colleagues, you cannot maintain readiness and capability \nin a modern-day fighter aircraft flying 4 hours a month. It can't be \ndone.\n  Super Stallion helicopters have flown thousands of marines into \ncombat over the past three decades, but these aging aircraft, filled \nwith a tangled web of hundreds of wires and fuel lines, present a \ndaunting challenge for young marines assigned to inspect each and every \none. As the FOX News report explained, ``One failure can be \ncatastrophic, as happened in 2014 when [a Navy version of the aircraft] \ncrashed off the coast of Virginia after a fire engulfed the aircraft \ndue to faulty fuel lines.''\n  The bottom line is this: Years of budget cuts have left us with a \nMarine Corps that is too small and has too few aircraft. The aircraft \nit does have are too old and can barely fly and only by cannibalizing \nparts from other aircraft. Young marines are being asked to muddle \nthrough this crisis with shrinking resources, knowing that if they \nfail, their comrades flying and riding in those aircraft could pay a \nfatal price.\n  The crisis in Marine Corps aviation would be shocking if it were not \nsuch a tragically common story throughout each of our military \nservices. Arbitrary budget cuts and sequestration have shrunk the Army \nby nearly 100,000 soldiers since 2012, bringing the Army to a size that \nArmy Chief of Staff GEN Mark Milley testified has put the Army at \n``high military risk.''\n  These budget-driven reductions were decided before Russia's invasion \nof Ukraine and the rise of ISIL. As the force has shrunk, readiness has \nsuffered. Just one-third of Army brigade combat teams are ready to \ndeploy and operate decisively. Indeed, just 2--just 2--of the Army's 60 \nbrigade combat teams are at the highest level of combat readiness.\n  To buy readiness today, as lackluster as it is, the Army is being \nforced to mortgage its future readiness and capability by reducing end \nstrength and delaying modernization needed to meet future threats.\n  The result of budget cuts, forced reductions, and declining readiness \nis clear: In an unforeseen contingency, General Milley testified this \nmonth before the Armed Services Committee that the Army ``risks not \nhaving ready forces available to provide flexible options to our \nnational leadership . . . and most importantly, [risks] incurring \nsignificantly increased U.S. casualties.\n  I repeat: ``significantly increased U.S. casualties.''\n  Likewise, by any measure, the Navy's fleet of 272 ships is too small \nto address critical security challenges. Even with recent shipbuilding \nincreases, the Navy will not achieve its requirement of 308 ships until \n2021. There is no plan to meet the bipartisan National Defense Panel's \nunanimous recommendation for a fleet of 325 to 346 ships.\n  A shrinking fleet operating at high tempo has forced difficult \ntradeoffs. For example, the last five carrier strike group deployments \nhave exceeded 8 months. Keeping sailors at sea for 8 months is damaging \nto morale and will sooner or later affect retention. It takes a toll on \nsailors, ships, and aircraft.\n  Unable to continue years of deferred maintenance, the Navy is no \nlonger able to provide constant carrier presence in the Middle East or \nthe Western Pacific.\n  The Air Force is the oldest and the smallest in its history. The \ncombination of decades of relentless operational tempo and misguided \nreductions in defense spending in recent years has depleted readiness. \nToday, less than 50 percent of the Air Force's combat squadrons are \nready for full-spectrum operations--well below the Air Force's stated \nrequirement of 80 percent. The Air Force does not anticipate a return \nto full-spectrum readiness for another decade. In other words, after \nflying in uncontested skies over the Middle East for more than a \nquarter of a century, our Air Force is not ready for a high-end fight \nagainst a near-peer adversary.\n  The truth is this: The ongoing war in Afghanistan, the rise of ISIL, \nRussia's aggression in Europe, and China's assertiveness in the Pacific \nhave all increased the demands imposed upon our servicemembers and \ntheir families. But at the same time, the requirements of our military \nhave continued to grow.\n  For 5 years--5 years now--the Budget Control Act of 2011 has imposed \ncaps on defense spending. Despite periodic relief from those caps, \nincluding the Bipartisan Budget Act passed last year, every one of our \nmilitary services--the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and, yes, the \nMarine Corps--remains undersized, unready, and underfunded to meet \ncurrent and future threats.\n  Unfortunately, the President's defense budget request for the coming \nyear does little to nothing to address this problem. Instead, it \ncontinues down the dangerous path of budgeting based not on what our \nmilitary needs but on what arbitrary defense spending constraints \nallow. In order to strictly adhere to the defense spending floor in \nlast year's Bipartisan Budget Act, the Department of Defense cut $17 \nbillion from what it said it needed last year.\n\n  Does anybody believe the situation in the world has improved to the \npoint where you can reduce by $17 billion from what we paid last year, \nwhat we spent last year? Those are billions of dollars of cuts for \nthings our military needs right now: Army helicopters, Air Force \nfighters, Navy ships, Marine Corps fighting vehicles, and critical \ntraining and maintenance across the services.\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\n  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey, \ndescribed last year's budget as ``the lower ragged edge of manageable \nrisk in our ability to execute the defense strategy.''\n  One year later, the President of the United States has sent us a \nbudget request that is less in real dollars than last year and $17 \nbillion less than what our military needed and planned for. The \nmilitary service's unfunded requirements totaled nearly $23 billion for \nthe coming fiscal year alone. Meanwhile, sequestration threatens to \nreturn in 2018, taking away another $100 billion from our military \nthrough 2021.\n  I don't know what lies beneath ``the lower ragged edge of manageable \nrisk,'' but this is what I fear it means; that our military is becoming \nless and less able to deter conflict. If, God forbid, deterrence does \nfail somewhere and we end up in conflict, our Nation will deploy young \nAmericans into battle without sufficient training or equipment to fight \na war that will take longer, be larger, cost more, and ultimately claim \nmore young American lives than it would otherwise would have.\n  If that comes to pass, who will be responsible, who is responsible \nfor the military's readiness crisis? Who is to blame for the increasing \nrisk to the lives of the men and women who volunteer to serve and \ndefend our Nation? The answer is clear: We are--the White House, \nCongress, Democrats, and Republicans, every politician who designed, \nagreed to or went along with the Budget Control Act and the mindless \nmechanism of sequestration, and every politician who in the past 5 \nyears has failed to realize our mistake or, perhaps having realized it, \nfailed to do anything and everything possible to fix it.\n  What is worse is the two-faced hypocrisy of it all: Democrats who \nwill say they favor more funding for our military but only if they get \ndollar-for-dollar increases for their pet domestic programs first and \nRepublicans who say they favor a strong defense, but when it comes time \nto do the hard work of funding it, are nowhere to be found.\n  For 5 years, we have been playing politics with funding that our \nmilitary servicemembers need and deserve. For 5 years, we have been \nplaying a rigged game, where the politicians win and our military \nloses.\n  This must all end before it is too late. We cannot continue to avert \nour eyes and ignore the grave impact budget cuts are having on our \nmilitary. The warning signs are clear: a marine aircraft that can't \nfly, pilots who can't train, and young marines trying to hold it all \ntogether by stealing parts from one aging airplane to give to another.\n  The potential consequences are clear. Our Nation could soon find \nitself in a position where it must either abandon an important national \ninterest or send young Americans into a conflict for which they are not \nprepared.\n  This is the reality our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are \nfacing. It is our urgent and solemn task to confront it. This Congress \ncan begin to chart a better course, one that is worthy of the service \nand sacrifice of those who volunteer to put themselves in harm's way on \nour behalf.\n  I am committed to doing everything I can as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee to accomplish this task, and I will work with any of \nmy colleagues to find a solution. Despite the odds, I am ever hopeful \nwe can live up to our highest constitutional duty and moral \nresponsibility to provide for the common defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his comments.\n  One of the advantages of having a full appropriations process is it \nputs the spotlight on the money we spend. I am asking to put this chart \nwhere the Senator from Arizona can see it.\n  We will be debating 12 appropriations bills hopefully in the next few \nweeks. This is the first one. It is $37.5 billion. A little more than \nhalf of it is defense spending--our weapons, plutonium enrichment, and \nnecessary things for our country--but all of the spending we are \ntalking about in these 12 bills adds up to $1 trillion.\n  The Federal spending for this year is $4 trillion. The money the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, was talking about is \nour defense money. It is down here on this blue line. It is in the \ntrillion dollars. It is nearly half of that. As we look back since \n2008, this blue line has stayed level. Over the next 10 years it is \nprojected to rise at about the level of the rate of inflation.\n  At the same time, this line, which is the $3 trillion line--mandatory \nspending, entitlements, all that--is going up. After about 10 years, \nthe end result will be that this will go from about 32 percent of our \ntotal spending to about 22 percent. What is that going to do to our \ndefense spending?\n  We have strong speeches made sometimes about let's get the spending \nunder control, but on both sides of the aisle there is not a lot of \ncourage shown when it comes to this red line because this is Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, entitlements, and other benefits. It is \nsqueezing out not only our national defense but our cancer research and \nthe other things we need to do as a country.\n  It is important over these next few weeks that we use this as an \noccasion on both sides of the aisle to recognize what we are doing with \nmoney. No one can say this is part of the budget problem. In fact, we \nhave just heard an eloquent speech from the Senator from Arizona, who \nsaid we have not spent enough to defend ourselves in an unsafe world. \nNobody is doing anything about this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the interest on the national debt included in that red \nline?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The answer to the Senator from Arizona is, no, it is \nnot. In fact, if it were, this line would be higher. So it is this line \nplus the interest on the debt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Obviously, it makes it much more compelling. Obviously, \nthat all would be moved one way or another. Obviously, it is going to \ngo up, but a return to inflation would dramatically increase that red \nline, would it not?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  I have heard there might be an effort to commit our bill back to the \ncommittee in order to reduce spending to a lower level. If we do that, \nsomeone needs to say which division needs to lose troops, which country \ndo we not want to defend, which airplane do we not want to fly, and \nwhich pilot do we not want to train.\n  We are talking about real decisions, and we are talking about not \nsetting priorities. I don't think most of the American people know that \nwhen we talk about the Federal debt, it is not national defense that is \ndriving up the Federal debt. It is in the blue line. It is our \nunwillingness on both sides of the aisle to confront this.\n  One statistic that I was reminded of by my colleague the Senator from \nTennessee is an American family today--think of an average age couple, \n50 years of age, would pay about $140,000 into Medicare. They will get \nback about $430,000 in Medicare. We can understand how people who pay \ninto Medicare would want to get their Medicare back, but we can also \nunderstand how that is not a sustainable program, and I think all of us \nas Americans can see that.\n  One of the things I hope we do over the next several weeks is talk \nhonestly about that problem. We are not solving that problem in this \ndebate. We are talking about this $1 trillion. What are we going to do \nabout the other $3 trillion that adds to our $19 trillion debt? Thank \nyou.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, my amendment is pretty straightforward.\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\nIt eliminates duplicative and wasteful spending. It eliminates $200 \nmillion from the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional \nAuthority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border Regional \nCommission.\n  These entities have a mission to provide ``strategic investments'' \nfor economic development, broadband deployment, infrastructure \nimprovements, and housing. You name it; there is funding for it. That \nis laudable, but there are already several Federal, State, and local \nprograms that fund these types of projects.\n  What is worse is that a quick look at some of the grants awarded from \nthese entities show questionable choices: Should $100,000 be awarded to \nthe Lake Placid Ski Club to build ski jumps? Should $125,000 be awarded \nfor a Chinese medicine herb growers consortium? Should $250,000 be \nawarded to a tribe in Maine to build a maple processing facility--after \nit was awarded about $100,000 from USDA to launch maple syrup ventures? \nThis is through the Federal Government. I don't believe so.\n  I ask us to support my amendment and stop such duplicative and \nwasteful spending.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand that it is likely that we \nwill shortly be considering Ernst amendment No. 3803, eliminating \nfunding for the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional \nAuthority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border Regional \nCommission. I want to talk about the Appalachian Regional Commission. I \nknow a little bit about this.\n  The western part of my State, known as Mountain Maryland, is a \nbeautiful part of Maryland. I visit there frequently. There are not a \nlot of people, and it is certainly a hearty life. It is not easy. It is \nnot easy to attract business to the western rural part of Maryland. \nThese people work hard, and they are preserving a way of life in an \neconomy that is critically important to the State of Maryland.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission is absolutely essential for the \neconomic growth of western Maryland. The Appalachian region is a region \nof a proud history, and we have given them a future. The Ernst \namendment would take away one of the most important tools towards their \nfuture.\n  Let me just mention a few things about the Appalachian Regional \nCommission and the projects they fund on an annual basis.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request so we can call the amendments up?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 3802 and 3803 to Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nSenator Feinstein and myself, that the following amendments be called \nup and reported by number: 3802, Schatz; and 3803, Ernst; further, that \nat 4:55 p.m. on Wednesday, April 20--today--the Senate vote in relation \nto the amendments in the order listed and that no second degree \namendments be in order to either of the amendments prior to the votes, \nand that there be 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments by number.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander], for others, \n     proposes amendments numbered 3802 and 3803 to amendment No. \n     3801.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3802\n\n (Purpose: To modify funding for certain projects of the Department of \n                                Energy)\n\n       On page 28, line 16, strike ``$292,669,000'' and insert \n     ``$325,000,000''.\n       On page 46, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       (4) ``Energy Program--Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan \n     Guarantee Program'', $9,500,000.\n       (5) ``Energy Program--Energy Efficiency and Renewable \n     Energy'', $20,600,000.\n       (6) ``Energy Program--Nuclear Energy'', $231,000.\n       (7) ``Energy Program--Strategic Petroleum Reserve'', \n     $150,000.\n       (8) ``Energy Program--Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale \n     Reserves'', $150,000.\n       (9) ``Energy Program--Science'', $1,700,000.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3803\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission, \n the Delta Regional Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern \n                      Border Regional Commission)\n\n       On page 53, strike lines 3 through 12.\n       Beginning on page 53, strike line 20 and all that follows \n     through page 55, line 8.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nallowing me to interrupt his comments.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am glad to see we have the ability to \nvote on a couple of amendments. I am glad I was able to accommodate and \nyield the floor. If I might, let me continue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3803\n\n  Now that the Ernst amendment is going to be voted on in a few \nmoments, I urge my colleagues to reject that amendment. The Appalachian \nRegional Commission approves funding for more than 400 projects \nannually throughout this 13-State region.\n  As I was saying, the western part of our State--in order for them to \nbe able to have a viable economy, to have a valuable future, they need \nhelp on economic opportunities. They need help in improving health \ncare.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission has helped the communities of \nWestern Maryland improve health care. The ARC funding was used for the \nGarrett County Hospital telehealth initiative to enhance community \nhealth care.\n  Just by happenstance, the CEO of Garrett County Hospital was in my \noffice yesterday. That is a hospital located in Oakland, MD. For those \nwho are not familiar with where Oakland, MD, is, it is on the border \nwith West Virginia. It is not too far from Pennsylvania in the western \npart of Maryland.\n  People who use the Garrett County Hospital come from West Virginia \nand they come from Maryland. It provides hospital service in a rural \narea that otherwise would not be there. But for the type of help they \nget through the Appalachian Regional Commission, it is difficult to see \nhow they could perform the quality access to affordable health care \nthat is absolutely essential for the economic growth of Mountain \nMaryland, for the Appalachian region.\n  Appalachian Regional Commission funding was used for phase III of the \nlast-mile wireless broadband network so that they could have high-speed \nbroadband access in the western part of Maryland. I know the Presiding \nOfficer and my colleagues know that if you don't have broadband, it is \ndifficult to see how you can attract industry. The Appalachian Regional \nCommission has been critically important in making sure we can \neffectively provide high-speed access to the western part of our State.\n  ARC grants have also been used to assess the impacts of energy \nproduction and consumption on our economy and the environment. ARC \nfunding was used for the ``Garrett County Marcellus Shale Impact \nStudy,'' which assessed the impact of hydraulic fracturing on the \neconomy and environment of Western Maryland.\n  ARC has been essential for the development in the Appalachian region. \nIt has worked, and it is continuing to work. I urge my colleagues to \nmake sure this tool continues for the benefit of the people in the \nAppalachian region--a commitment that we made.\n  Lastly, let me remind my colleagues of what my friends who are \nactively engaged in the Appalachian Regional Commission in all of the \n13 States tell me. Since 1978, this program--every dollar that has been \ninvested by the Appalachian Regional Commission has leveraged an \naverage of $6.40 from the private sector. It leverages private sector \ninvestment in the Appalachian region, which is critically important to \nthe economic growth of the Appalachian region. Otherwise, this is a \ntough area.\n  If we are committed to economic growth in this country, I would urge\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nmy colleagues to reject the Ernst amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Maryland. I must say that when \nI first came to the Senate, I looked at these perhaps with not as full \nan understanding of them as I have now. But I think the committee \nsupports it, the bill supports it, and the Appropriations Committee \nsupports it. I certainly agree with the Senator and support him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment for 3 \nminutes, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  First of all, I don't think the Senate is going to adopt the Ernst \namendment because we authorized--reauthorized this important ARC \nprogram just last year on a bipartisan basis in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  I want to make this point: This is discretionary spending that is \nlargely under control. This is discretionary spending. It is 2008 \nprojected out to 2026. As you can see, it hardly keeps up with \ninflation. We have a spending problem in this country, but it is \nmandatory programs--the red line--not this discretionary line from \nwhich comes the Appalachian Regional Commission. I want to make that \npoint. This amendment is targeted at the wrong type of spending.\n  What do we get out of ARC? My friend from Maryland is exactly right. \nWe leverage private dollars for investments to create jobs. We build \ninfrastructure that creates jobs and supports jobs. We have revolving \nloan programs that have created 50,000 jobs since 1977 and retained \n51,000 jobs.\n  Let's attack spending. Let's get together and talk about Bowles-\nSimpson and do what we need to do about the problem that has given us \nthis $19 trillion debt. But for heaven's sake, we have a program that \nwas reauthorized almost unanimously last year that helps people get a \njob and persuades private industry to contribute to that effort at a 6- \nor 7-to-1 ratio. We want to keep that type of investment to create jobs \nfor our families.\n  I will be voting against the Ernst amendment and urge my colleagues \nto do so.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3802\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I wish to call up my amendment No. 3802.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I wish to thank the chair and the vice chair of the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee for their great work, and \nespecially their staff, who were instrumental in finding offsets to \nincrease funding for a great, successful, bipartisan program, ARPA-E, \nwhich funds research at the cutting edge of clean energy.\n  This amendment takes unspent money from prior years' appropriations \nfor expired programs. This is an important point. CBO has confirmed \nthat this amendment does not score. This amendment does not score. This \namendment uses unspent balances to increase funding for ARPA-E.\n  I again thank the chair and the vice chair for helping us to find \nsome resources for this very successful program and for cosponsoring \nthis amendment. I ask all of my colleagues for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Schatz. I \nsupport and cosponsored the Schatz amendment. He has identified a \npriority that Senator Feinstein and I already made a priority. It is \none of the two parts of the Department of Energy that got any increase \nin the nondefense area--the Office of Science and this one.\n  He has worked with us in committee. He has worked with us on the \nfloor. He found an offset so that it is paid for. We are reducing other \nspending to increase this spending. This is called setting priorities \nin discretionary spending, which is under control. It is not the part \nof the budget that creates Federal debt.\n  We should do more of this energy research, but we should do it by \nreducing other spending. I would suggest that reducing subsidies to \nwind power, oil, and gas would be a good way to start.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the Schatz amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I heard what our chairman said. I \nthoroughly support him.\n  I commend the Senator from Hawaii for seeing this and proposing this \namendment. We recommend that it be adopted.\n  Can we call the vote?\n  We yield back any time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We yield back any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3802.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cruz).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey), and the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 70, nays 26, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 55 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--70\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Booker\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Capito\n     Cardin\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gardner\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Perdue\n     Peters\n     Portman\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rounds\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Sullivan\n     Tester\n     Toomey\n     Udall\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--26\n\n     Barrasso\n     Burr\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Daines\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Grassley\n     Heller\n     Lankford\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Paul\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cruz\n     Sanders\n  The amendment (No. 3802) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to make an announcement on \nbehalf of Senator Feinstein and myself. This is important. This is \nscheduling.\n  Senator Feinstein and I wish to thank all of the Senators on both \nsides--Senator McConnell, Senator Reid--for creating an environment in \nwhich we could get so much done. We have more than 80 Senators who have \npolicy that is already a part of this bill. That has happened over the \nlast few weeks. Several amendments have been adopted and accepted. We \nare voting on two this afternoon.\n  Tomorrow, we expect to have two votes in the morning and one vote \nafter lunch.\n  We have a request of Senators. This doesn't always work, but we would \nlike to get an agreement to have all of our amendments in by 1 o'clock \ntomorrow. If we can do that, we can finish the bill early next week. So \nif Members can ask their staff and legislative counsel to do that, we \nwould like to do that by consensus as much as possible. That is the \nold-fashioned way of doing a bill. I would like to set a good example \nfor the other 11 bills that are coming.\n  So that is the schedule as we look forward. Senator Ernst has the \nremaining amendment, and there will be no further votes after her vote.\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3803\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3803, offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mrs. Ernst.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, my amendment is straightforward. I am \nasking for support on amendment No. 3803.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 3803.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The Senator has 1 minute to debate the amendment.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The amendment is pretty straightforward. What we are doing is \neliminating duplicative programs. Many programs exist out there already \nwhich will provide for housing needs, for infrastructure needs, many \nother needs. What we are doing is stating that we shouldn't be \nproviding separate funds for very specific regions and duplicating \nprocesses that are found in the Federal Government.\n  Just a few examples: $100,000 awarded to Lake Placid Ski Club to \nbuild ski jumps, $125,000 awarded for Chinese Medicine Herb Growers \nConsortium, and $250,000 awarded to a tribe in Maine to build a maple-\nprocessing facility after it received $100,000 from the USDA to launch \nMaple Syrup Ventures.\n  I don't believe this is activity the Federal Government should be \nengaged in. Again, these are duplicative programs. There are many other \nprograms available out there. So I am asking for the support of my \ncolleagues on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would certainly oppose this amendment. \nThe regional commission is a joint Federal-State economic development \neffort that includes some of the most economically distressed counties \nof Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and northern New York. For decades, \nthese people have faced tough economic circumstances. These programs \nhave helped.\n  More importantly, every Federal dollar invested leverages, on \naverage, 2.6 dollars in matching funds in return. New jobs are created. \nThousands of jobs are retained. That is how we should be investing our \nFederal dollars.\n  We invest in other countries around the world, and we ought to be \ninvesting them in our own country and support programs like the \nNorthern Border Regional Commission and not eliminate them.\n  I hope Senators will oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as the manager of the bill, I was going \nto take that time. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes and to allow \nSenator Ernst 2 more minutes to make her point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The issue is spending. This is discretionary spending. This is an \nopportunity, as we consider these 12 bills, to consider where the \nspending problem is. This is discretionary spending. It includes \ndefense, it includes cancer research, it includes roads, it includes \nlocks and dams, and it includes the Appalachian Regional Commission, \nthe Denali Commission, and other commissions that would be defunded by \nthis amendment.\n  This is not our spending problem. That is $1 trillion we are spending \nthrough these 12 bills. We are spending $3 trillion more through \nmandatory spending and interest on top of that.\n  We have not been very brave on the Republican side of the aisle or \nthe Democratic side of the aisle on the real spending problem. We have \ndone pretty well on this.\n  I have said to some of my colleagues that maybe the Senate should \nturn over to the Appropriations Committee the real spending problem and \nsee if we can make the red spending line like the blue spending line \nbecause that is what we have done.\n  So we have set a priority for projects like sewer improvement in \nAlabama and planning and development in Mississippi, automotive \nworkforce in Georgia, rural dental in Kentucky. These are all \npriorities within spending that are under control.\n  This is not under control. We can't fix that in these 12 weeks, but I \nhope we pay attention to this difference and sooner or later have the \ncourage to deal with it.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, again, this is $200 million. I would beg \nto differ that this is not a lot of spending, and $200 million is a lot \nof money for folks back in Iowa.\n  Iowa does not have one of these funds. Many other States don't have \nthese same types of funds. This is just an additional way for certain \nregions to tap into Federal dollars. So there are many programs. As I \nstated earlier. I have heard folks say this is about jobs. We have \nworkforce investment programs that everyone across the Nation can dive \ninto to provide opportunity for everyone. Everyone needs opportunity, \nso everyone should be able to tap into these Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, $200 million is a lot of Federal spending.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cruz).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Casper), \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey), and the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Sanders), are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendment be called up and reported by number: Hoeven No. \n3811; further, that at 11:45 a.m. on Thursday, April 21, the Senate \nvote on that amendment and that it be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold for adoption; and further, that no second-degree amendments \nbe in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senators for their cooperation \ntoday. As I indicated earlier, Senator Feinstein and I have been in \ntouch with every Senate office over the last few weeks, asking for \nadvice, policy, and amendments. Senators have been terrific in getting \nthat to us. For example, there is Senator Schatz' amendment. He offered \nand withdrew it in committee. We worked with him and were able to adopt \nit once it came to the floor. That is typical of what has happened.\n  I would judge that about 83 or 84 Senators have contributed policy to \nthis bill. There are really not many more amendments that will be \noffered. But we will have this one amendment, at least, tomorrow \nmorning at 11:45. Then, the last vote will be at about 2:00 p.m., \ntomorrow after lunch. There may be other votes before that.\n  I would ask, as I did earlier, that Senators and their staffs get any \nother amendments that we do not know about to us by 1 o'clock tomorrow. \nThen, perhaps we can come to an agreement about how to proceed from \nthere to the end of the bill, maybe even without the necessity of \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wanted to reassure the Senate and thank \nChairman Alexander for making sure that this legislation has $285 \nmillion in it for advanced computing. It also includes the Kirk \nlanguage to ensure that the United States is home to the No. 1 \nsupercomputer in the world.\n  Today, China has the fastest computer in the world. It is called the \nTianhe-2. It is clocked at 33.8 petaflops per second. Computers in the \nU.S. National Labs should soon topple China. It is a priority issue \nthat I share with Chairman Alexander.\n  The Titan computer, which is now at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in \nTennessee, is ranked at No. 2 in the world. At Argonne National \nLaboratory in Illinois, we are working on a computer to be upgraded \nwhich will soon be No. 1 in the world. It will clock in at 180 \npetaflops per second. That is 18 times faster than the current computer \nthat is at Argonne called Mira and three times faster than China's top \ncomputer today.\n  With that, supercomputing is essential for American competitiveness \nin the future. I think it is essential that we pass this legislation to \nmake sure that we are all No. 1 in supercomputing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nhis advocacy of keeping America No. 1 in the world in supercomputers \nand exascale computing. He has a special knowledge of that because of \nhis intimate knowledge of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. I \nknow something about it because of the work at the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory in Tennessee.\n  The Obama administration has consistently funded exascale and \nsupercomputing, and we have consistently supported that recommendation \nof funding. We have been able to do that for the last 4 or 5 years, \nSenator Feinstein and I. There has been no more vigorous advocate to \ncause our country to be No. 1 in supercomputing than Senator Kirk of \nIllinois. I thank him for his leadership and his contributions to this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2323-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I am here for the 134th time to urge \nthe Senate to wake up to the growing threat of global climate change. I \nam afraid my chart here is getting a little bit beat up after all of \nthese speeches. I hope we can begin to make progress.\n  But we continue here in this body to be besieged by persistent and \nmeretricious denial. Of course, the polluters want us to do nothing. \nThey are so happy to offload to everybody else the costs of the harm \nfrom fossil fuels: the cost of heat waves, the cost of sea level rise, \nthe cost of ocean acidification, the cost of dying forests, and the \nrest of it. They are running a very profitable ``we keep the profits, \nyou bear the costs'' racket. They spend rivers of money on lobbying and \non politics and on a complex PR machine that fills the airwaves with \nsound bites of cooked-up, paid-for doubt about climate change.\n  I believe the worst of them actually know better, but they do it any \nway. In this turbulence, the Wall Street Journal editorial page \nregularly sides with the rightwing climate denial operations. So, \nnaturally, they have challenged my call for an appropriate inquiry into \nwhether the fossil fuel industry's decades long and purposeful campaign \nof misinformation has run afoul of Federal civil racketeering laws.\n  Now, it is very hard for them to argue that the fossil fuel industry \nshould be exempt from fraud laws. It is very hard for them to argue \nthat the tobacco lawsuit years ago was ill funded, although certainly \nthey tried right up until the government won the case. So they turn, \ninstead, to invention. The Wall Street Journal repeatedly and falsely \nhas accused me of seeking to punish anyone who rejects the scientific \nevidence of climate change. That is, of course, a crock. I never said \nanything close to that, but that does not stop them.\n  In fact, this line of counterattacks fits the Journal's playbook for \ndefending polluting industries. The Wall Street Journal's editorial \npage has a record on acid rain, on the ozone layer, and now on climate \nchange. There is a pattern. They deny the science, they question the \nmotives of those who call for change, and they exaggerate the costs of \ntaking action.\n  At all costs, they protect the polluting industry. When the Journal \nis wrong, as they have repeatedly been proven to be, they keep at it, \nover and over. In the 1970s, scientists first warned that \nchlorofluorocarbons could erode the ozone layer of the Earth's \nstratosphere, and that would increase human exposure to cancer-causing \nultraviolet rays.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial page doggedly fought back against \nthe science, questioning it, and attacking any regulation of the CFCs.\n  In at least eight editorials between 1976 and 1992, the Wall Street \nJournal proclaimed that the connection between CFCs and ozone depletion \n``is only a theory and will remain only that until further efforts are \nmade to test its validity in the atmosphere itself.'' They called the \nscientific evidence ``scanty'' and ``premature,'' suggested that the \nozone layer ``may even be increasing,'' insinuated that ``it is simply \nnot clear to us that real science drives policy in this area,'' and \nwarned of ``a dramatic increase in air-conditioning and refrigeration \ncosts,'' with ``some $1.52 billion in foregone profits and product-\nchange expenses'' as well as 8,700 jobs lost. Those are all actual \nquotes from the ed page.\n\n  Well, back then Americans listened to the science. Congress acted, \nthe ozone layer and the public's health were protected, and the economy \nprospered. All those terrible costs that the Journal predicted, \naccording to the EPA's 1999 progress report, ``Every dollar invested in \nozone protection provide[d] $20 of societal health benefits in the \nUnited States''--$1 spent, $20 saved.\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\n  When scientists began reporting that acid rain was falling across our \nNortheastern States, out came the Wall Street Journal again saying the \n``data are not conclusive and more studies are needed''; arguing that \n``nature, not industry, is the primary source of acid rain''; claiming \n``the scientific case for acid rain is dying''; and charging that \n``politics, not nature, is the primary force driving the theory's \nbiggest boosters.''\n  Again, those are all actual quotes, even as President Reagan's own \nscientific panel said that inaction would risk ``irreversible damage,'' \nwhich brings us to the Wall Street Journal on climate change.\n  In June 1993, they claimed ``growing evidence that global warming \njust isn't happening.''\n  September 1999, they reported that ``serious scientists'' call global \nwarming ``one of the greatest hoaxes of all time.''\n  June 2005, they asserted that the link between fossil fuels and \nglobal warming had ``become even more doubtful.''\n  February 2010, they said: ``We think the science is still \ndisputable.''\n  June 2011, they called global warming a ``fad-scare.''\n  December 2011, an editorial said that the global warming debate \nrequires ``more definitive evidence.''\n  As recently as last January, the page called extreme weather \n``business as usual,'' while still erroneously clinging to the \n``hiatus'' argument.\n  Just this week they published an editorial that any link people have \ntalked about between climate change and national security threats--\nsomething we hear from our armed services, from our intelligence \nservices--that all is ``silliness,'' to use the word of the author they \nquoted.\n  The polluter playbook also produced the usual Journal warnings about \ncosts, that ``a high CO2 tax would reduce world GDP a \nstaggering 12.9 percent in 2100--the equivalent of $40 trillion a \nyear,'' making ``the world poorer than it otherwise would be''; about \nmotivations, that this was all really motivated by what they called \n``political actors'' seeking to gain economic control; and about the \nscience, claiming that ``global service temperatures have remained \nessentially flat.''\n  This is my particular favorite. A December 2009 Wall Street Journal \nclaimed that climate scientists were suspect because they ``have been \non the receiving end of climate change-related funding,'' the Journal \ncontinues ``so all of them must believe in the reality (and \ncatastrophic imminence) of global warming just as a priest must believe \nin the existence of God.''\n  Set aside their suggestion that funding is why priests believe in \nGod. Look at what they are saying about scientific funding.\n  If the Wall Street Journal can make it a conflict of interest for \nscientists to be on the receiving end of scientific funding related to \ntheir field of inquiry, that covers virtually all science. That would \nmake virtually all science not discovered by accident a conflict of \ninterest. That is a great trick, because if science itself is a \nconflict of interest, that neatly moots the real conflict of interest \nof the masquerade talk-show science produced by the polluting \nindustry's PR machinery. And there is such machinery, according to \nnumerous investigative books, journalists' reporting, and academic \nstudies.\n  Look at the academic work of Professor Robert Brulle of Drexel \nUniversity, Professor Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State University, and \nJustin Farrell of Yale University, among others.\n  Look at the investigative works of Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in \ntheir book ``Merchants of Doubt'' or David Michaels' book ``Doubt is \ntheir Product'' and Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner's book ``Deceit \nand Denial.'' Look at Jeff Nesbit's new book ``Poison Tea.''\n  Look at the journalistic work of Neela Banerjee, Lisa Song, David \nHasemyer, and John Cushman, Jr., in InsideClimate News, which is \nevidently now shortlisted for a Pulitzer Prize looking at what \nExxonMobil knew about climate change versus the things that it chose to \ntell the public. Look at the parallel probe by the Energy and \nEnvironment Fellowship Project at the Columbia Journalism School, \npublished in the Los Angeles Times, which brings us to the Journal's \nquestion: ``Why even raise the possibility of RICO suits--and suggest \nit to the Justice Department--if Mr. Whitehouse's goal isn't to punish \nthose who disagree with him on climate?''\n  One reason is that a RICO suit was won by the U.S. Department of \nJustice under the Clinton and Bush administrations against the tobacco \nindustry. So there is this little matter of this being the law. The \nJournal never seems to mention the fact that the government won the \ncivil case against the tobacco industry.\n  Before the RICO lawsuit was won by the Department of Justice, the \nWall Street Journal editorial page had worked it over pretty well, \ncalling it ``abuse,'' ``hypocrisy,'' and ``a shakedown.'' So I \nunderstand that they don't like that fact, but it is now a fact that \nthe Department won that case.\n  A second reason is that if there is indeed a core of deliberate fraud \nat the heart of the climate denial enterprise, no industry should be \ntoo big to dodge the legal consequences. Most of the writers I \nmentioned noted themselves similarities between the tobacco fraud \nscheme and the climate denial operation--as has Sharon Eubanks, the \nlawyer who won the tobacco lawsuit for the Department of Justice--and, \nso it seems, have now more than a dozen State attorneys general who are \nlooking at Big Oil and coal for misleading statements, which leads me \nto my last point.\n  Note the breadth of the Wall Street Journal editorial page's language \nthat I want to ``punish those who disagree with [me] on climate,'' but \nthat is just false. As the RICO case itself shows--the tobacco RICO \ncase that is the model we would like to have the Department look at--\npeople who disagree with me on climate change would no more be the \ntargets of such an investigation than smokers or people who disagreed \nwith the Surgeon General about tobacco's dangers were targets of the \ntobacco case. Those folks may very well have been victims of the \ntobacco industry's fraud. They may be the dupes.\n  For the record, fraud investigations focus on those who lie, knowing \nthat they are lying, intending to fool others and doing it for gain, \nfor money. Even fossil fuel companies should not be too big to answer \nfor that conduct if it were proven in court.\n  Why would the Wall Street Journal editorial page and other rightwing \neditorialists be trying to saddle me with an argument I am not making? \nWell, one obvious reason would be because they don't have a good \nresponse to the one I am making. Let's say, if they were operating as a \nshill for the industry here and emitting industry propaganda, they \nwould be providing their industry clients a very valuable service of \nmisdirection. Like squid ink released to create a helpful distraction, \nan imaginary argument to quarrel with gives them an advantage. As I \nsaid, it is going to be tough to convince people that the fossil \nindustry should be too big to sue, no matter what they did or that it \nshould deserve different rules under the law than the tobacco industry.\n  If you are going to lose those arguments, you have to make another \none, and they invented that I want to jail people--including contrarian \nscientists and skeptics.\n  This is not rational argument. This is not the kind of rational, \nfact-based argument that a court would demand. It is defensive behavior \non behalf of a creature that feels itself threatened and desperately \nwants to avoid that fair courtroom forum, a forum where the evidence \nmatters, where the truth is required, and where the industry doesn't \nget to put in the fix.\n  Everybody should know I take climate change very seriously. Rhode \nIsland is the Ocean State. Just this week we had major news stories in \nour statewide paper about drowning sea coast marshes, endangered \nhistoric buildings, and ocean fisheries in upheaval, all from climate \nchange. This is the first one.\n  ``Drowning marshes: Buying time against the tide, they pour sand in \nan uphill fight.''\n\n       As the climate warms, causing the ice caps to melt, \n     currents to slow and ocean waters to expand, sea levels are \n     rising at a rate that could eventually wipe out many of Rhode \n     Island's salt marshes.\n\n  Just days later:\n  ``Newport sees the firsthand threat of climate change.''\n\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\n\n  \n\n       But the confluence of rising seas and more extreme storms \n     caused by climate change could present an insurmountable \n     challenge for those trying to protect this and thousands of \n     other historical structures near the coast.\n\n  Then, finally:\n  ``Is commercial fishing sustainable? An industry at crossroads.''\n\n       John Bullard, regional administrator with NOAA's Northeast \n     Regional Office, said that he believes commercial fishing can \n     be sustainable but a number of issues, including climate \n     change, need attention for that to happen.\n\n  I represent a State whose fishing industry depends on doing something \nabout climate change, whose historic buildings are at risk of being \nflooded and lost by the insurmountable problem of climate change, and \nwhose salt marshes, which are very important to our State, are rising \nat a rate that could eventually wipe them out.\n  Am I supposed to ignore that? Am I supposed to ignore this? It is not \ngoing to happen.\n  I am proud to stand with our leading research institutions and \nscientists around the country, our national security experts, \ncorporations such as Apple, Google, Mars, and National Grid. I am proud \nto stand with President Obama and Pope Francis, who both agree about \nthe seriousness of climate change.\n  If the polluter machine wants to score more ink, so be it. I cannot \nstop them, but I am not going anywhere. My State is in the crosshairs. \nThis is one of those fights worth having.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2325-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ATVM LOAN PROGRAM AMENDMENT\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I am thankful the Senate is taking up \nthe appropriations bills. The appropriations process is the only way \ncitizens can truly hold their elected representatives accountable. It \nalso allows the American people to see just what the priorities are for \nthe Senate.\n  Through my votes upon appropriations bills, I have to decide which \ngovernment programs to prioritize and which government programs need to \nbe cut. These are tough choices, but Nebraskans sent me to Washington \nto make these hard decisions.\n  Again, I am hopeful that the Senate is taking up these bills and that \nwe can make important spending decisions on behalf of the American \npeople. That is why I am proud to join Senators Coats, Toomey, and \nFlake to submit an amendment that targets what I see is overspending in \nthe Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  This amendment would wind down the Department of Energy's troubled \nAdvanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. The ATVM \nProgram was designed to provide loans for businesses that produce fuel-\nefficient, advanced-technology vehicles and components in the United \nStates. The program was created in 2007. In 2009, Congress appropriated \n$7.5 billion in subsidies to cover $25 billion in loans authorized \nunder that program.\n\n  Unfortunately, as Senator Coats and Senator Toomey have pointed out, \nthis program has struggled for many years. The record speaks for \nitself. Take Fisker Automotive as an example. In April of 2010, Fisker \nreceived a loan through the ATVM program for the purpose of producing \ntwo lines of plug-in hybrid vehicles at its plant in Wilmington, DE. In \n2011, because Fisker was not meeting its performance targets, the DOE \nsuspended its original loan of $529 million.\n  Unfortunately, $192 million in taxpayer dollars had already been \nloaned to the company. Fisker halted operations, and they filed for \nbankruptcy in November of 2013. The company's ATVM loan was sold at \nauction for $25 million and the DOE was able to recoup $28 million from \nan escrow account. However, this loan still resulted in a $139-million \nloss for taxpayers.\n  In February of 2014, Fisker's assets were auctioned to a Chinese \nmanufacturer, Wanxiang, through the resulting bankruptcy proceedings. \nThis was one of the many failures resulting from the ATVM Program.\n  In 2013, a Government Accountability Office report found few auto \nmanufacturers and program applicants willing to participate in the \nprogram due to high costs and the limited benefits. As a result, the \nSecretary of Energy announced a number of changes to the ATVM Program \nin April of 2014. Not a single new loan has been approved since the \nannouncement of these revisions.\n  This program is a clear example of waste. It reveals the dangers of \nallowing our government to pick winners and losers in the private \nsector. That is why I am here today to join Senators Coats and Toomey \nand Flake in offering an amendment that would prohibit new loan \napplications from being reviewed if they are not submitted by the date \nof this bill's enactment. Furthermore, our amendment would prohibit any \nloan credit subsidies after the end of fiscal year 2020. Through these \nprovisions, we can responsibly wind down a very ineffective program.\n  Our national debt continues to grow, and it now exceeds $19 trillion. \nAccording to the March 2016 report of the Congressional Budget Office, \nannual deficits will exceed $1 trillion in 2022 and every year \nthereafter. This makes the need for commonsense provisions like ours \nall the more urgent. We simply cannot afford to continue spending money \non programs that are not effective.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this sensible amendment when it is \nbrought up for a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     United States Congress to enact the Retail Investor Act and \n     also to enact legislation that prohibits the United States \n     Department of Labor from amending fiduciary duty regulations \n     to define retirement savings brokers and agents as \n     fiduciaries, including those previously not deemed \n     fiduciaries; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 223\n\n       Whereas, With over 10,000 people retiring every day, each \n     year for the next 17 years, it is imperative that future \n     retirees plan, save, and have choices about who they consult \n     for retirement guidance. Financial professionals provide \n     guidance to consumers about their investments, including \n     investments in IRAs, 401(k) accounts, and other assets \n     invested to produce retirement income; and\n       Whereas, Financial professionals are generally compensated \n     through one of two business models. A majority of \n     transactions fall into the broker-dealer model, in which \n     compensation is paid by the product provider to the broker-\n     dealer and registered representatives, and not by the \n     consumer. In other transactions, the buyer is more \n     financially sophisticated and has significant assets and may \n     prefer to engage an advisor under a fee-based arrangement, \n     paying the advisor directly; and\n       Whereas, For many, especially those with small- to medium-\n     size accounts, consulting with a trusted professional using \n     the broker-dealer model is more cost efficient, more \n     accessible, and preferable to a fee-based arrangement; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Department of Labor has proposed \n     regulations that would define certain professionals operating \n     under the broker-dealer model to be fiduciaries. And if \n     receiving third-party compensation is a violation of the \n     fiduciary standard, the effect will be to force retirement \n     account savers to use a fee-based model or not receive \n     advice; and\n       Whereas, The Retail Investor Protection Act (H.R. 1090) \n     would prohibit the U.S. Department of Labor from prescribing \n     any regulation pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 that defines the circumstances under \n     which an individual is considered a fiduciary until 60 days \n     after the Securities and Exchange Commission issues a final \n     rule governing standards of conduct for brokers and dealers \n     under specified law. Similar legislation passed the U.S. \n     House on a bipartisan vote in the previous Congress; Now; \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives, That we oppose \n     efforts by the United States Department of Labor to place \n     onerous regulatory rules on the broker-dealer community\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\n     that will adversely affect low- and middle-income investors' \n     ability to have access to affordable, reliable, retirement \n     advice; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact the Retail Investor Protection Act and also \n     to enact legislation that prohibits the United States \n     Department of Labor from amending fiduciary duty regulations \n     to define retirement savings brokers and agents as \n     fiduciaries, including those previously not deemed \n     fiduciaries; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Secretary of Labor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2328-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. MARKEY:\n       S. 2820.

Res. 432\n\n       Whereas the first pillar of the 2012 United States Strategy \n     Toward Sub-Saharan Africa is to strengthen democratic \n     institutions, and the United States Agency for International \n     Development Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance Strategy \n     states that strong democratic institutions, respect for human \n     rights, and participatory, accountable governance are crucial \n     elements for improving people's lives in a sustainable way;\n       Whereas the third pillar of the 2012 United States Strategy \n     Toward Sub-Saharan Africa is to advance peace and security, \n     including supporting security sector reform;\n       Whereas democratic space in Ethiopia has steadily \n     diminished since the general elections of 2005;\n       Whereas elections were held in 2015 in which the ruling \n     Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front claimed 100 \n     percent of parliamentary seats;\n       Whereas the 2014 Department of State Human Rights Report on \n     Ethiopia cited serious human rights violations, including \n     arbitrary arrests, killings, and torture committed by \n     security forces as well as restrictions on freedom of \n     expression and freedom of association, politically motivated \n     trials, harassment, and intimidation of opposition members \n     and journalists;\n       Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has repeatedly abused \n     laws such as the 2009 Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to limit \n     press freedom, silence independent journalists, and persecute \n     members of the political opposition;\n       Whereas laws such as the 2009 Charities and Societies \n     Proclamation have been used to restrict the operation of \n     civil society and nongovernmental organizations in Ethiopia \n     across a range of purposes, particularly those investigating \n     alleged violations of human rights by governmental \n     authorities;\n       Whereas the case of the ``Zone 9 Bloggers'', whose arrest, \n     detention, and trials on terrorism charges brought \n     international attention to the restrictions on press freedom \n     in Ethiopia, is indicative of the coercive environment in \n     which journalists operate;\n       Whereas the Ethiopian Human Rights Council reports at least \n     102 protestor deaths, and according to Human Rights Watch, \n     Ethiopian security forces have killed at least 200 peaceful \n     protestors in the Oromia region, and that number is likely \n     higher;\n       Whereas state sponsored violence against those exercising \n     their rights to peaceful assembly in Oromia and elsewhere in \n     the country, and the abuse of laws to stifle journalistic \n     freedoms, stand in direct contrast to democratic principles \n     and in violation of Ethiopia's constitution; and\n       Whereas, during President Barack Obama's historic visit to \n     Addis Ababa in July 2015, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn \n     expressed his government's commitment to deepen the \n     democratic process and work towards the respect of human \n     rights and improving governance, and noted the need to step \n     up efforts to strengthen institutions: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) killings of peaceful protesters and excessive use of \n     force by Ethiopian security forces;\n       (B) arrest and detention of journalists, students, \n     activists and political leaders who exercise their \n     constitutional rights to freedom of assembly and expression \n     through peaceful protests; and\n       (C) abuse of the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to stifle \n     political and civil dissent and journalistic freedoms;\n       (2) urges protesters in Ethiopia to refrain from violence;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Ethiopia--\n       (A) to halt the use of excessive force by security forces;\n       (B) to conduct a full, credible, and transparent \n     investigation into the killings and instances of excessive \n     use of force that took place as a result of protests in the \n     Oromia region and hold security forces accountable for \n     wrongdoing through public proceedings;\n       (C) to release dissidents, activists, and journalists who \n     have been jailed, including those arrested for reporting \n     about the protests, for exercising constitutional rights;\n       (D) to respect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly \n     and guarantee freedom of the press and mass media in keeping \n     with Articles 30 and 29 of the Ethiopian constitution;\n       (E) to engage in open and transparent consultations \n     relative to its development strategy, especially those \n     strategies that could result in people's displacement from \n     land; and\n       (F) to repeal proclamations that--\n       (i) can be used as a political tool to harass or prohibit \n     funding for civil society organizations that investigate \n     human rights violations, engage in peaceful political \n     dissent, or advocate for greater political freedoms; or\n       (ii) prohibit or otherwise limit those displaced from their \n     land from seeking remedy or redress in courts, or that do not \n     provide a transparent, accessible means to access justice for \n     those displaced;\n       (4) calls on the Secretary of State to conduct a review of \n     security assistance to Ethiopia in light of recent \n     developments and to improve transparency with respect to the \n     purposes of such assistance to the people of Ethiopia;\n       (5) calls on the Administrator of the United States Agency \n     for International Development to immediately lead efforts to \n     develop a comprehensive strategy to support improved \n     democracy and governance in Ethiopia;\n       (6) calls on the Secretary of State, in conjunction with \n     the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, to improve oversight and \n     accountability of United States assistance to Ethiopia \n     pursuant to expectations established in the President's 2012 \n     Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (7) stands by the people of Ethiopia, and supports their \n     peaceful efforts to increase democratic space and to exercise \n     the rights guaranteed by the Ethiopian constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/senate-section/article/S2330-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2330-S2331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 433--RECOGNIZING LINEMEN, THE PROFESSION OF LINEMEN, \n AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PROTECT PUBLIC \n SAFETY, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF APRIL 18, 2016, \n                AS ``NATIONAL LINEMAN APPRECIATION DAY''\n\n  Mr. TILLIS submitted the following resolution;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Food Security Act of \n     2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of \n     the United Nations (referred to in this section as the \n     ``FAO''), 805,000,000 people worldwide suffer from chronic \n     hunger. Hunger and malnutrition rob people of health and \n     productive lives and stunt the mental and physical \n     development of future generations.\n       (2) According to the January 2014 ``Worldwide Threat \n     Assessment of the US Intelligence Community''--\n       (A) the ``[l]ack of adequate food will be a destabilizing \n     factor in countries important to US national security that do \n     not have the financial or technical abilities to solve their \n     internal food security problems''; and\n       (B) ``[f]ood and nutrition insecurity in weakly governed \n     countries might also provide opportunities for insurgent \n     groups to capitalize on poor conditions, exploit \n     international food aid, and discredit governments for their \n     inability to address basic needs''.\n       (3) A comprehensive approach to sustainable food and \n     nutrition security should not only respond to emergency food \n     shortages, but should also address malnutrition, resilience \n     to food and nutrition insecurity, building the capacity of \n     poor, rural populations to improve their agricultural \n     productivity and incomes, removing institutional impediments \n     to agricultural development, value chain access and \n     efficiency, including processing and storage, enhancing \n     agribusiness development, access to markets and activities \n     that address the specific needs and barriers facing women and \n     small-scale producers, education, and collaborative research.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY OBJECTIVES; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy Objectives.--It is in the national \n     security interest of the United States to promote global food \n     security, resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national \n     food security investment plans, which is reinforced through \n     programs, activities, and initiatives that--\n       (1) place food insecure countries on a path toward self-\n     sufficiency and economic freedom through the coordination of \n     United States foreign assistance programs;\n       (2) accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth \n     that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, \n     particularly among women and children;\n       (3) increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of \n     small-scale producers, especially women, by working across \n     agricultural value chains, enhancing local capacity to manage \n     agricultural resources effectively and expanding producer \n     access to local and international markets;\n       (4) build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable \n     populations and households while reducing reliance upon \n     emergency food assistance;\n       (5) create an enabling environment for agricultural growth \n     and investment, including through the promotion of secure and \n     transparent property rights;\n       (6) improve the nutritional status of women and children, \n     with a focus on reducing child stunting, including through \n     the promotion of highly nutritious foods, diet \n     diversification, and nutritional behaviors that improve \n     maternal and child health;\n       (7) align with and leverage broader United States \n     strategies and investments in trade, economic growth, science \n     and technology, agriculture research and extension, maternal \n     and child health, nutrition, and water, sanitation, and \n     hygiene;\n       (8) continue to strengthen partnerships between United \n     States-based universities, including land-grant colleges, and \n     universities and institutions in target countries and \n     communities that build agricultural capacity; and\n       (9) ensure the effective use of United States taxpayer \n     dollars to further these objectives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the President, in providing assistance to implement the \n     Global Food Security Strategy, should--\n       (1) coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the \n     efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies to \n     implement the Global Food Security Strategy;\n       (2) seek to fully utilize the unique capabilities of each \n     relevant Federal department and agency while collaborating \n     with and leveraging the contributions of other key \n     stakeholders; and\n       (3) utilize open and streamlined solicitations to allow for \n     the participation of a wide range of implementing partners \n     through the most appropriate procurement mechanisms, which \n     may include grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and \n     other instruments as necessary and appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of \n     the United Nations (referred to in this section as the \n     ``FAO''), 805,000,000 people worldwide suffer from chronic \n     hunger. Hunger and malnutrition rob people of health and \n     productive lives and stunt the mental and physical \n     development of future generations.\n       (2) According to the January 2014 ``Worldwide Threat \n     Assessment of the US Intelligence Community''--\n       (A) the ``[l]ack of adequate food will be a destabilizing \n     factor in countries important to US national security that do \n     not have the financial or technical abilities to solve their \n     internal food security problems''; and\n       (B) ``[f]ood and nutrition insecurity in weakly governed \n     countries might also provide opportunities for insurgent \n     groups to capitalize on poor conditions, exploit \n     international food aid, and discredit governments for their \n     inability to address basic needs''.\n       (3) A comprehensive approach to sustainable food and \n     nutrition security should not only respond to emergency food \n     shortages, but should also address malnutrition, resilience \n     to food and nutrition insecurity, building the capacity of \n     poor, rural populations to improve their agricultural \n     productivity and incomes, removing institutional impediments \n     to agricultural development, value chain access and \n     efficiency, including processing and storage, enhancing \n     agribusiness development, access to markets and activities \n     that address the specific needs and barriers facing women and \n     small-scale producers, education, and collaborative research.\n\n     SEC. 3.
