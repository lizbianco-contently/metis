Mr. President, later this morning we will welcome an \nimportant friend of the United States to the Capitol, Shinzo Abe, Prime \nMinister of Japan.\n  I am looking forward to hearing what he has to say. I know many of my \ncolleagues feel the same way because Prime Minister Abe doesn't just \nlead one of the most important economies and countries in the Asia-\nPacific region, he leads one of the most important countries and \neconomies in the entire world. Abe has proposed to tackle some tough \nstructural problems other leaders in his country might not touch, but \nhe knows the Japanese people can be persuaded to reward their leaders \nfor taking risks.\n  Abe previously served in the Cabinet of a free-market Prime Minister \nwho grabbed hold of economic third rails of Japanese politics and then \nrolled to a landslide victory when others counted him out. Perhaps that \nis why Abe feels liberated to pursue new initiatives of his own.\n  On the domestic side, Abe has proposed structural reforms. On the \ninternational front, Abe has worked to enhance the role and influence \nof democratic nations, such as the two of us, in the Asia-Pacific. Just \nthis week in Washington, he signed important agreements with the United \nStates on both cyber security and defense.\n  This all serves to underline the enduring importance of the U.S.-\nJapan alliance. It also reminds us that the Obama administration must \ndo its part, too, by investing in the platforms and capabilities needed \nto make its announced pivot to Asia real. That is the only way to both \nbolster democratic nations such as Japan in the region, while also \neffectively countering China's aggressive encroachment upon the \nterritorial and navigational rights of its neighbors.\n  Trade is another way to advance our common values and strengthen our \nnational security and our economy. For years, Japan and the United \nStates had a difficult trading relationship. Today, though, the U.S. \nand Japanese negotiators actually appear close to reaching an agreement \nthat could significantly lower existing barriers to trade, benefiting \nboth of our economies.\n  That breakthrough is being negotiated as part of the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, a trade agreement between Pacific nations such as Japan, \nAustralia, and the United States. That would help ensure the region and \nthe world play by fair rules, instead of ceding the fields to an \nincreasingly aggressive China.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership could also, according to one estimate, \nsupport up to nearly one-quarter of a million new jobs in the United \nStates, including more than 50,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector \nalone. But American and Kentucky workers and farmers will never be able \nto reap the rewards of selling more ``Made in America'' goods to the \nPacific until Congress passes a bipartisan trade promotion bill.\n  Passing that bipartisan legislation is key to enhancing Congress's \nrole in the trade process, while simultaneously ensuring Presidents of \neither party--because this is a 6-year TPA, it will apply\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nto the next President--have the tools they need to secure a strong and \nenforceable trade agreement for American workers.\n  The bill recently passed the Finance Committee on an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote, and I intend to take it up after we complete action on \nthe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  But, for now, let me just say that Congress is pleased to have the \nPrime Minister join us today. We thank Prime Minister Abe and his \ncountry for their enduring friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2492-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They started off in a very bad \nfashion, losing, now--last night, they were in the process of a six-\ngame losing streak. They brought in a pitcher because their star was \ninjured. He gave up nine runs in two innings. So I think we were both \nfairly well going to acknowledge they were going to lose their seventh \nstraight, but they won the game 13 to 12.\n  I admire the tenacity of the Republican leader because he watched the \nend of the game. I couldn't do that. I tried, but at the beginning of \nthe ninth inning--they had given up more runs earlier--they were behind \nwith one out, and I said: I am going to go to bed. I was surprised when \nI got up this morning and they had won. So we had a good laugh talking \nabout the game today that they had won. As I indicated, I am sorry I \ndidn't get to watch the last of the game. I decided I didn't have \nenough faith in the team, and I went to bed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2492-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2492-S2493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, budgets should be about reality, not \nideology. The reality of the budget today is that our middle class is \nbeing pushed to the edge of extinction, and that is the truth, while \nthere is an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor. As I have \nsaid--I will continue to say--the rich are getting richer and the poor \nare getting much poorer. But perhaps the most brutal reality is that \nCongress is not doing its job, and the real brutal reality is that \ncongressional Republicans don't even seem to care.\n  In the very near future, the Senate is expected to consider a \nconference report on the Republican budget resolution. It is a budget \nthat is as irresponsible as it is immoral.\n  It is a budget based on the failed ideology of a political party out \nof touch with America's middle class, a political party that is out of \ntouch with reality. It amounts to an all-out attack on working \nfamilies, an attack designed to protect only the interests of \nmillionaires, billionaires, and many special interests.\n  The Republican budget would deprive more than 16 million Americans of \ntheir health insurance. It allows big insurance companies to, once \nagain, discriminate against women. It would cause people who have \ndisabilities to be unable to get insurance--as it used to be before \nObamaCare came into being. It threatens the coverage of hard-working \nAmericans who lose their jobs or suffer from, as I have indicated, \npreexisting medical conditions.\n  The budget that is proposed by my Republican friends would also make \ndeep cuts to Medicare at the expense of our Nation's seniors. It would \nraise taxes on working Americans by allowing the expansion of the \nearned-income tax credit and allows the child tax credit to simply \nexpire, go out of existence.\n  It would end key supports that help young Americans afford college. \nAt a time when student debt is higher than credit card debt--we have \ntried to resolve it on the Senate floor, but the Republicans vote \nunanimously no. They are not going to cut parents--these young men and \nwomen who have debt--any slack.\n  The budget they propose would undermine job training--and certainly \nat a time when we need it with the changing technology that creates \njobs--for Americans who are simply trying to better themselves and get \na good job or a better job.\n  Meanwhile, Republicans refuse to close a single tax loophole to \nreduce the deficit--not one. They will not end tax breaks for companies \nthat send jobs overseas. They will not close loopholes for wealthy \nhedge fund managers. They will not do away with wasteful tax breaks for \nthe oil and gas industry.\n  Once again, Republicans are attacking the middle class, and they are \nattacking it forcefully, while protecting the superwealthy.\n  The budget is just wrong. It is also dishonest.\n  It claims to be balanced. There is no balance in this budget. That is \na word. The budget is no more balanced than the earthquakes they have \nhad in Nepal. It claims to reach balance, but the claim is laughable, \nbased on gimmicks and massive cuts that are left unspecified.\n  When you have editorials from magazines such as Forbes, a \nconservative magazine, denigrating the Republican budget, you know it \nis wrong. One of the worst aspects of this budget is it uses \nsequestration to undermine America's middle class, to underfund the \ninvestments needed for our security and our future.\n  Let's talk about sequestration for a minute, these automatic cuts. \nThe example is the National Institutes of Health. It becomes very \npersonal when you see these issues that face Americans--diabetes, the \nflu. The Presiding Officer is a physician who specializes in eyes. But \nthe flu kills tens of thousands of people in America every year, and \nthe NIH was on the verge of a universal vaccine for flu, any type of \nflu. As we know, what they do now, they try to find out what the flu is \ngoing to be, the variety of flu in a given year, and then they try to \nmix and match. Last year, that was effective at less than 50 percent. \nSo if you got the flu shot--60 percent of people who got the flu shot \ngot the flu anyway. But because of sequestration, they had to drop \nthat. They have never gotten that money back--$1.6 billion.\n\n  I mentioned eyes. I have become very concerned about eyes in the last \ncouple of months, and there are all kinds of programs at the NIH that \ncould be funded much better dealing with problems such as I have.\n  So it is simply wrong that they are going to go forward with this \nsequestration. It is wrong.\n  Sequestration was never intended to be implemented. It was designed \nwith cuts so deep and so stupid that Congress would never let them \nhappen. But my Republican colleagues let them happen. Republicans \nrecognize that sequestration poses a threat to our national security, \nand their budget uses a gimmick.\n  I am not calling it a gimmick--or at least I am not alone. We have \nRepublicans--the junior Senator from Tennessee is talking about how he \nwon't support the budget because he thinks there are some gimmicks in \nit, and many editorials have been written using that term over and over \nagain. Their budget is not balanced, and it uses gimmicks to pretend.\n  They do everything in this budget to protect the Pentagon, but it \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\nreally because it is phony. They use the overseas contingency fund, \nwhich everybody knows is phony. They want to help the military. I want \nto help the military also. But, sadly, the Republican budget does \nabsolutely nothing to provide similar protections for the middle class.\n  There is, however, some good news about the Republican budget, and it \nis this: The Republican budget isn't worth the paper it is written on. \nIt is going to go nowhere. There is no chance of the budget actually \nbeing implemented. President Obama and the congressional Democrats are \ncommitted to the middle class, so we are not going to let it happen.\n  The administration has made it very clear that President Obama is not \nwilling to lock in sequestration in any appropriations bill or in \nanything else. In a Statement of Administration Policy--the forerunner \nof a veto--the Obama administration said: ``The President's senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto . . . any legislation that \nimplements the current Republican budget framework.'' Nor will the \nPresident accept fixes to defense without also fixing nondefense budget \nitems. For President Obama, it is simply a matter of principle, and \ncongressional Democrats fully agree with his principle. So the \nRepublican budget isn't going anywhere.\n  If Republicans insist on moving appropriations bills based on that \nbudget, it is a waste of their time. It will not happen. We will not \nlet that happen. What we need is a budget that is based in reality, a \nbudget that is fair to the middle class, fair to the American people, a \nbudget that will only happen when Republicans abandon their extreme \nattacks on the poor and middle class and sit down and talk to us about \nthe way forward.\n  I note that no one is seeking the floor, and I would ask that the \nChair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2493-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nS. 615, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This bill establishes a \nprocess to guarantee congressional review of any agreement reached \nbetween the P5+1 and Iran.\n  Like everybody else here, my goal is to ensure that Iran does not \nacquire nuclear weapons. With that goal in mind, I have avoided \nsupporting measures over the past 18 months that would impact the \nadministration's ongoing negotiations. I believe it is incumbent upon \nus to explore every avenue of diplomacy to stop Iran from getting a \nnuclear weapon.\n  There have been suggestions that this legislation we are considering \ntoday will negatively impact the negotiations for a final agreement. To \nthe contrary, I think this legislation will improve the chances of \nreaching a final accord. Most importantly, it will improve the chances \nthat this accord will stand the test of time.\n  If approved, the President will have to negotiate knowing that \nCongress will ultimately review this agreement. That is only proper \ngiven that the terms of the agreement go far beyond--far beyond--the \ncurrent administration.\n  In truth, Congress has always had a role here. It was the U.S. \nCongress that passed the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable. It is only the U.S. Congress that can permanently lift the \nsanctions. Unfortunately, the administration would prefer to go it \nalone when it comes to the implementation of this agreement by using \nthe waiver authority that was granted when these sanctions were passed.\n  There is no dispute that the President can lift these sanctions on a \ntemporary basis. But since this agreement is slated to last well beyond \nthe President's term and even the next President's term, any effective, \nenduring agreement has to have congressional buy-in. Let me repeat. If \nthis legislation fails, the President will be able to sign a final \nagreement and have a nice signing ceremony, but an effective, enduring \nagreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon will require \ncongressional buy-in.\n  We also need to recognize that we are not operating in a vacuum. Once \nan agreement that includes our allies is reached, the multilateral \nsanctions regime that has been so effective in bringing Iran to the \nnegotiating table will be defunct. These sanctions have been effective \nbecause it has been Iran versus the West rather than Iran versus the \nUnited States. It is unreasonable to assume that such a united front \ncan be reassembled before Iran obtains a nuclear weapon.\n  That is why the bill before us today is so important. It sets up a \nprocess for review by Congress of any agreement, preventing the \nadministration from presenting Congress with a fait accompli. This \nlegislation will not repeal any sanctions currently in place against \nIran. Congress will still have to take action to lift these sanctions \npermanently. Its passage ensures that if Congress does repeal the \nsanctions, it does so because it chooses to, not because it has no \nother choice.\n  I would also like to take a moment to reflect on the process that \nbrought this bill out of committee. Tough issues were thoughtfully \nworked out and compromises were made to get this bill language to a \nplace where the bill was voted unanimously out of committee with a \nrecorded vote. Thanks to firm commitments made by the chairman and the \nranking member to keep this bill bipartisan, the White House--which for \nweeks had threatened to veto the bill--reversed its position just hours \nbefore the markup. This about-face was likely due to the fact that \nthere were so many Senators on a bipartisan basis lining up to support \nthis bill.\n  This legislation signals to the administration that it needs to keep \nCongress in mind when it negotiates. And, without poison pill \namendments being added, the President will be forced to sign it.\n  Most importantly, I am hopeful that the passage of this bill out of \ncommittee signifies a return to a time the Foreign Relations Committee \nis able to work across the aisle on foreign policy matters. I realize \nit cannot always happen, but the ideal is when partisan politics can--\nas Senator Vandenberg put it--stop at the water's edge.\n  The reality is that given the myriad of foreign policy challenges \nthat confront us around the globe, we do not have the luxury of \npartisanship, and nowhere is this more evident than with the \nlegislation we are considering today. I hope we can come together and \npass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2494-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nJOINT MEETING OF THE TWO HOUSES--ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1191, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1191) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not \n     taken into account as employees under the shared \n     responsibility requirements contained in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Corker/Cardin amendment No. 1140, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Corker/Cardin amendment No. 1179 (to amendment No. 1140), \n     to require submission of all Persian text included in the \n     agreement.\n       Blunt amendment No. 1155 (to amendment No. 1140), to extend \n     the requirement for annual Department of Defense reports on \n     the military power of Iran.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because I \nnoticed that the minority leader, the Senator from Nevada, had some \nnice things to say about me on Monday in his remarks. He said that I \nwas ``relentless'' in my ``condemnation of ObamaCare.'' Those are his \nwords. I appreciate the minority leader's kind remarks, because he is \nright. As a doctor, I am relentless in my condemnation of the \nPresident's health care law, a law that has done incredible harm to so \nmany people all across this country.\n  Minority Leader Reid also said that he had the facts about the law. \nMost of those facts seemed to come from a New York Times opinion column \nby the renowned liberal icon Paul Krugman.\n  So let me share some real facts with the minority leader. The \ninsurance plans offered in the health care exchanges are so expensive \nthat they are a horrible deal for most Americans. That is why the \nPresident had to give out subsidies--to help hide the costs. The \nCongressional Budget Office said that Washington will spend $850 \nbillion on those subsidies over the next decade. That is a fact.\n  According to a new study by the health research company Avalere, \nObamaCare plans are extremely unpopular among people who don't get the \nhuge subsidies to buy the plan. Only 2 percent of the people who don't \nqualify for subsidies have actually bought insurance through the \nexchanges. That is a fact. It is an alarming sign of how high the cost \nof ObamaCare really is.\n  It is not just the premiums that are sky high. This year, the average \ndeductible for ObamaCare's silver plan is almost $3,000 for a single \nperson and more than $6,000 for a family. Now, that is according to \nsomething called HealthPocket, which is a Web site that helps people \nactually compare insurance plans. That is a fact, and $6,000 is a lot \nof money for a hard-working family to pay for their deductible.\n  Now, the minority leader said that Paul Krugman's opinions should be \ntreated like facts--not as facts but like facts--because as Senator \nReid said, ``this isn't some high school teacher talking about the \nmerits of ObamaCare.'' Well, I agree on that point. High school \nteachers are far more likely to have had actual experience with the \ndamage that is done by the ObamaCare health care law than has this New \nYork Times columnist.\n  That is what we learned from a report at KMOX TV in St. Louis on \nApril 23. Their report talked about the Parkway School District in \nMissouri. It was Senator Reid who said this isn't some high school \nteacher. Well, this report from St. Louis said ObamaCare is forcing the \nschool district to outsource the employment of substitute teachers. Why \nwould they want to do that? It is in the face of a $4 million penalty \nfor not offering health insurance to the part-time teachers. That is a \nfact. And those substitute teachers are real people who are being hurt \nby President Obama's health care law.\n  Here is another fact reported by Politico on Monday afternoon. This \nwas their headline on April 27: ``Study: ACA exchange enrollees take \ntax hit.''\n\n  According to a new study by the tax preparers at H Block, almost \ntwo-thirds of people enrolled in ObamaCare exchanges had to pay back \nsome of their subsidy with their taxes this month. The average amount \npeople owed the IRS was $729. That is a fact. It is a big hit to a lot \nof families who thought they were going to get help to pay for their \nObamaCare premiums. It does not even count the people who decided that \nthe insurance was just too expensive and decided not to buy it. \nAccording to H Block, those people paid the IRS an average tax \npenalty of $178. That is a fact. It is only going to be higher next \nyear when people sit down and fill out their taxes.\n  I remember another speech Senator Reid gave on the floor on \nObamaCare. On February 26, 2014, he said: ``Despite all that good news, \nthere's plenty of horror stories being told.'' ``All of them are \nuntrue.''\n  That was Senator Reid a year ago.\n  Republicans had been citing--this is Senator Reid--examples of people \nbeing harmed by ObamaCare, and Senator Reid said that all of them were \n``stories made up from whole cloth.''\n  Well, here is a horror story from the minority leader's home State \nnewspaper--Nevada--very recently. This was an article from earlier this \nmonth, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, April 7. The headline was ``Past \nstate ObamaCare sign-up glitches now haunt Nevadans at tax time.''\n  Here is what the article says:\n\n       How did a Reno collections agent end up in collections \n     himself?\n\n  The answer:\n\n       He bought coverage in 2014 through the state's health \n     insurance exchange.\n\n  According to the article:\n\n       Rick Furst is still ironing out wrinkles in a plan \n     purchased in May through the Nevada Health Link and its \n     contractor, Xerox. His cascade of issues has included bad \n     coverage dates, unpaid medical bills and an incorrect tax-\n     credit form.\n\n  This man told the Las Vegas newspaper, ``My credit was excellent, and \nnow my credit is shot.'' His credit was excellent, and now his credit \nis shot. Does Senator Reid think this man from his home State of Nevada \nmade up his story out of whole cloth?\n  People are having their lives turned upside down by the disgraceful \nfailure of these ObamaCare exchanges. That is a fact. It is a cruel and \ncostly side effect of this terrible health care law. Paul Krugman of \nthe New York Times did not talk about that fact in his opinion column \nin the New York Times the other day.\n  Another thing he and the minority leader are not talking about is the \nfact that many Americans now have less access to actual care because of \nthe health care law. Well, they should have known about that fact; it \nwas reported right there in the New York Times itself on Sunday, \nFebruary 8, 2015, with the headline ``Insured, but not covered.'' ``New \npolicies have . . . many\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\nAmericans scrambling.'' The article talks about the narrow networks \nmany insurance plans had to create. This was to try to meet the \nrequirements of ObamaCare without the premiums going even higher.\n  The story starts off by talking about one woman in New York City. Her \nname is Karen Pineman. First, she lost her existing health insurance \npolicy because it did not meet all of the mandates President Obama said \na health insurance policy had to include.\n  The President calls those benefits ``essential benefits.'' I call \nthem excessive benefits. It is much more insurance than many people \nneed, want, or can afford.\n  The article in the New York Times says that she accepted that she \nwould have to pay a higher premium for a plan with a narrower network \nof providers and no out-of-network coverage. According to the article, \nshe also accepted the fact that she would have to pay out of her own \npocket to see her primary care physician because her doctor was not \npart of the narrow network that was now covered under her insurance. \nWell, she even accepted having copays of nearly $1,800 to put a cast on \nher ankle after she broke it playing tennis. Finally, the article says, \nher frustration bubbled over when she tried to arrange a followup visit \nwith her orthopedic surgeon. The nearest doctor available in her \nnetwork who treated ankle problems was in Stamford, CT. Remember, she \nlives in New York City.\n  This woman finally had enough. She told the newspaper: It is \nridiculous. Didn't they notice that I was in another State?\n  Well, that woman, as reported in the New York Times, did not make up \nher story out of whole cloth. Those kinds of narrow networks are a fact \nunder President Obama's law.\n  It is a fact that there are people who now have coverage and can't \nhave access to care. There is a difference between coverage and care. \nYou do not have to take my world for it; it is right there in the New \nYork Times.\n  So the minority leader is correct. Republicans have been relentless \nin condemning the horrifying costs of the President's health care law. \nRepublicans have been relentless in condemning the intolerable damage \nthe health care law has done to people's access to health care.\n  Republicans will continue to be relentless because this health care \nlaw has been bad for patients, it has been bad for providers, and it \nhas been terrible for American taxpayers. Republicans will continue to \ncome to the floor to offer the facts about how the health care law has \nharmed American families. We will continue to offer solutions that \ndeliver the real reform people have been asking for all along--the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at lower cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, if the Senator from Iowa is intending to \nspeak, this Senator will only use about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to embrace this package that the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee has brought forth to the floor.\n  First, it is much needed bipartisanship which has been shown on the \ncommittee. That is a very good thing, given the fact that we have had \nso many contentious and divisive issues.\n  But, secondly, what it does is set up a process by which the Congress \nwould express its approval or disapproval with regard to a future \nagreement that may be made between Iran and the United States to \nprevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.\n  First is the process by which we would express that vote, and then if \nthe agreement is concluded by the end of June, the actual vote on \nwhether sanctions under the agreement should be lifted. So it is a two-\nstep process, and it is often confused. That is why it is important to \nkeep this committee bill clean.\n  As I have already expressed to the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on the floor of the Senate 2 or 3 days ago, it is this \nSenator's intention that all of the amendments, which generally have a \ndeleterious effect and that are generally considered poison pill \namendments--this Senator will oppose them. It is my understanding that \nleadership of the Foreign Relations Committee will likewise oppose \nthose amendments.\n  Then, I might say, assuming this legislation is passed and we have \nthis process in place and the President has said he will sign it into \nlaw--if the framework, as announced a few weeks ago by the President, \nis fleshed out in the final details of the agreement, and those \ndetails, by the end of June, reflect the framework of the agreement \nthat has been announced, it is this Senator's intention to support the \nagreement.\n  I do that, very simply, on what is in the best interests of the \nUnited States. If, in fact, this agreement, once completed--if the \nframework is fleshed out--prevents Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon for at least a 10-year period--and there are other 15-, 20-, and \n25-year period benchmarks in the framework--but if they are prevented \nfrom developing a nuclear weapon within 10 years, and we know there is \na regime in place in order to detect that so we have the verification, \nand that because of the verification we have at least a year's advance \nnotice so that appropriate action could be taken--if all of that is \nincluded within the agreement, it is this Senator's intention that I \nwill support the agreement.\n  Why? Because if we keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon for 10 \nyears at least, the world is going to be a very different place in 10 \nyears. And what we will have done as a country is prevented Iran from \ngoing ahead and developing a nuclear weapon now, of which we would have \nto face those consequences with possible military action.\n  I do not shy away from supporting military action if that is \nnecessary to prevent a nuclear weapon from being developed. But if we \nhave a path to achieving the same thing, doing it diplomatically and \nhaving the guarantee of at least 10 years--if not 15 and 20--then, to \nthis Senator, that seems to be in the interests of the United States.\n  I want to clearly state where this Senator is coming from. I happen \nto think that is in Israel's interests as well. The interests of the \nUnited States and Israel are inextricably entwined when it comes to the \ndefense of that little democracy that is a beacon of democracy in that \npart of the world. I have some familiarity with the integration and the \nsharing of our military forces, as well as our intelligence apparatus.\n  It is clearly in the interests of the United States that we see that \nIsrael's security is protected. From what I see of the framework of \nthis agreement, if fleshed out, then I think that is in the interests \nof our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise to stress the importance of \nensuring nuclear negotiations with Iran to preserve our national \ninterests and our security, one that protects the security of our \nallies and partners in the region and maintains peace and stability in \nthe world.\n  As a member of the Iowa Army National Guard and serving on the Armed \nServices Committee in the Senate, I am focused on strengthening our \nnational security, developing strategies to confront terrorism, and \ndiscussing ways to support our exceptional military.\n  While I believe Iran's long-term goal is developing nuclear weapons, \nits most effective line of effort against us and our allies has been \nthrough its unwavering support of terrorism. The Obama administration \nshould only accept a final deal which prohibits sanctions relief until \nIran abandons its support of terrorism.\n  Providing Iran with sanctions relief would only enhance their \nopportunity to fund proxy groups which threaten our Israeli allies and \nwhose activities have led to horrible consequences for\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\nmillions of people in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.\n  While the Obama administration has been seemingly eager to relieve \nsanctions in an effort to convince Iran to sign a nuclear deal, \nCongress cannot stand by and watch as a deal is negotiated that paves \nthe way for Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. We must take a step back \nand examine their actions, and it is absolutely crucial we understand \nwho is on the other side of the negotiating table.\n  Iran continues to be the world's lead sponsor of terrorism and a \nsupporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is responsible for \nkilling hundreds and thousands of his own people, creating the gravest \nhumanitarian crisis in modern history, and who facilitates the \ncontinued rise of extremism and sectarianism across the region.\n  Iran has shown unwavering support of terrorism and has aligned itself \nwith groups that are hostile to the United States, our allies, and \npartners in the region. In fact, Iran continues to fund groups that \nthreaten our Israeli allies, who are very concerned about Iran amassing \nnuclear capabilities and the direct threat they pose to the region. \nAfter this longstanding pattern of behavior, I do not believe we can \ntrust that Iran will curb its ambitions or support for terrorist \nactivity on their own.\n  Despite any agreement Iranian President Hassan Rouhani may agree to, \nI believe Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will ultimately \nmaintain his policy of attempting to obtain a nuclear weapon and may \nuse any funds obtained through prematurely providing sanctions relief \ntowards that end, as well as to support terrorists.\n  Iran's more than a quarter century long effort to obtain a nuclear \nweapon will not subside overnight. It is a faulty assumption to trust \nthat Tehran is on the side of the rule of law. Iran has a very \ntroublesome track record of deception when it comes to compliance and \ntrustworthiness, which is why we need a deal that ensures America's and \nthe world's ability to verify and enforce any agreement with Iran. This \nincludes complete and open access at any time to all of Iran's \nfacilities, to hold them true to their word and to verify their \nactions. We must also have the proper enforcement mechanism in place so \nthat any broken promise garners an appropriate and immediate response.\n  This accountability can be enforced through renewed and strengthened \ncongressional sanctions. Sanctions have been effective in the past, and \nwe must keep this option on the table. In fact, these sanctions are \nwhat brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place. So we \nmust not be too quick to suspend them.\n  The ever-increasing and complex threats we face in the Middle East \nunderscore how crucial it is that any longstanding agreement with Iran \nmust go through Congress. This enables the American people to have a \nvoice. Congressional review is supported by a bipartisan majority of my \ncolleagues and a majority of Americans. It is common sense. We must \nhave more oversight of this process and the opportunity for thoughtful \nconsideration to ensure we have been very clear about our demands and \nthe framework of any final agreement.\n  There is no doubt the administration shares my concern and the \nconcern of many of my colleagues regarding the hundreds of thousands of \nSyrians who have been murdered with barrel bombs, sarin gas, the \nindiscriminate shelling of cities, been in prisons or the millions more \nwho have been forced to flee their homes.\n  We must stop Iran from supporting this criminal regime which has \nhelped engulf the region. Sanctions relief without ensuring funds would \nnot go to Assad or to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, which are key \nto the survival of the regime, would do nothing to help achieve a \nfavorable political or military solution in Syria.\n  With that in mind, I cosponsored the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct, which has bipartisan support and is before the Senate today. This \nlegislation embraces fundamental and core principles that lay the \nfoundation for a good deal with Iran. This deal ensures congressional \nreview of a final agreement. It demands that no congressional sanctions \nbe lifted during the review period, and it safeguards congressional \noversight of Iranian compliance.\n  This bill is a good starting point, and I want to praise the good \nwork by the chairman of the committee for continuing to push for \ncongressional review. Our ultimate goal must be to curb all Iranian \nterror, and this will never happen if we do not confront and contain \nIran's nuclear ambitions.\n  I believe a final deal which does not address Iran's support of \nterrorism and other groups which subvert recognized governments is not \nin the best interests of our Nation, and an agreement without these \nassurances will miss an opportunity to provide stability in the region.\n  In closing, the bottom line is that Iran must never be allowed to \ndevelop a single nuclear weapon--not now or at any point in the future. \nA nuclear Iran presents one of the greatest threats to peace and \nstability in our time.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thought I would take this time--I know \nSenator Corker is at a lunch with some of our colleagues and is going \nover some of the issues concerning how we are going to move forward, \nbut I thought I would take this time to at least tell our Members that \nwe are working very hard to try to resolve some of the amendments \nMembers want to offer.\n  I must point out that there have been no requests for amendments on \nthe Democratic side. I know Senator Corker is a little bit more busy \nthan I am. He is trying to work with the number of amendments that have \nbeen filed by Republican colleagues. But we are trying to go through \nthose amendments and see if there is a way consistent with the purpose \nof the bill that we can work out language that would accomplish what \nthe author of the amendment is attempting to accomplish but consistent \nwith the purpose of the bill--to make sure that we have an orderly way \nto review any agreement reached between the United States and our \nnegotiating partners and Iran on its nuclear weapon program and that we \nget timely notice from the administration in regard to material \nbreaches so that we can take action to prevent Iran from becoming a \nnuclear weapon state. There are also provisions in the bill that \nprovide notification by the administration and important information so \nthat we can do our work.\n  We are taking a look at these amendments and trying to see whether we \ncan work our way forward in order to move this bill in the same method \nthat it moved through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, we worked together to try to get that \naccomplished.\n  We started the debate yesterday, and we are going to continue it \ntoday. Senator Barrasso brought an amendment forward, which he wants to \nhave pending, that would change the certification requirements. We are \ntrying to work out a way in which we will be able to take that issue up \nbefore the full Senate. Senator Corker and I are trying to resolve that \nissue as to how we can bring that forward.\n  I talked about this issue yesterday and explained the certification \nrequirement to all the Members of the Senate. The President has to \ncertify on a regular basis that Iran is basically in compliance with \nthe agreement. If they can't do that, then we get into an expedited \nprocess for imposing sanctions or to take action against Iran.\n  There are a lot of amendments that have been filed--they are not \npending--that would require additional certifications by the \nadministration, and if the administration cannot make those \ncertifications, there is an expedited process. The problem with going \nbeyond the terms of the nuclear agreement on any of those \ncertifications is that it affects the bill itself, and that is why we \ncall them poison pills. I will try to explain that.\n  Senator Barrasso's amendment dealt with a certification that Iran \nwill\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\nnot be involved in terrorism against the United States or any of our \ncitizens. But there are several other amendments that have been filed \nthat would change the certification requirements so that the President \nwould have to make those certifications or it could trigger expedited \nprocedures.\n  Why do we call those poison pills? First of all, it changes the \nbalance of what we are trying to do, and it is highly unlikely that we \nare going to be able to get that bill to the President for his \nsignature. It will compromise what we are trying to do, and we are not \ngoing to be able to get the bill done. We will end up losing the bill. \nWe will lose the opportunity for the committee to get the information \nand consider it. The committee needs to have a period of time in order \nto go through the review process. And the administration will not be \nable to exercise its waiver power for additional sanctions relief. All \nof that hard work will be lost. It is really counterproductive to what \nthe authors of these amendments are trying to do.\n  The second consequence that could happen, if this is in the bill, is \nthat the President would not be able to make the certification and we \nwould very likely never get an agreement. Therefore, what will happen \nis that the United States will be accused of walking away from trying \nto negotiate an agreement with Iran. We would be isolated, and our \nchances of preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state \nbecomes that much less likely to happen.\n  The third reason why these amendments are problematic and are poison \npills has to do with the fact that it becomes a negotiating objective \nfor the United States. These are good objectives. We don't want Iran to \nbe able to sponsor terrorism. It is certainly something that is part of \nour policy. But if we make it a negotiating objective, then the \nadministration has to achieve that in order to prevent sanctions from \ngoing into effect in order to achieve our objective. That makes it much \nmore difficult to achieve the primary objective, and the primary \nobjective is to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\n  Although these amendments are well intended, they have the \nconsequence of just the opposite. These amendments will make it less \nlikely that we will prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\n  The same is true on any certification. One of the amendments that \nhave been filed says that we have to certify that Iran recognizes \nIsrael's right to its own sovereignty. I want Iran to recognize \nIsrael's sovereignty. We put very strong language into this bill and \nmade it clear that Israel's security is of prime concern to us. It is \nin the bill. If we make it a certification requirement--think about \nthis for a moment--it means our negotiators will have to figure out a \nway to negotiate with Iran something they don't want to do. And what \nwill we have to give up in order to get that? What will they put on the \ntable in regards to international recognition? It distracts us from \nobjective to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state, which \nis critically important to the security of Israel. These amendments do \njust the opposite of what they are intended to do.\n  I mentioned that because we are trying to move forward with this \nlegislation. I hope that we can do it very quickly and we can find a \npath forward. We are going to try to accommodate the fair \nconsiderations of these amendments. But I urge my colleagues to take a \nlook at their amendments, to work with Senator Corker, to work with me, \nand let's see whether we can accommodate, within the framework of the \nlegislation, any concerns that the sponsors of the amendments may have. \nThen we can do what the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was able to \ndo on a 19-to-0 vote. It makes the Senate much stronger, and it makes \nthe United States much stronger when we can come together on these \namendments.\n  Our objective is to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons \nstate, and the best way for us to do that is to speak with a united \nvoice and the type of work we did in a bipartisan manner.\n  The people of Maryland and the people of this country want us to work \ntogether. They want us to resolve issues. The Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee was able to do that.\n  I urge Members who have filed amendments to work with us so we can \nfind a way forward to make sure this bill remains intact and gives \nCongress the best chance for an orderly review of the process and gives \nus the tools we need to make America's position even stronger to \nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  First, I wish to commend my colleagues, Senator Corker and Senator \nCardin, for their leadership on this important bipartisan legislation. \nBecause of their crucial leadership, the Foreign Relations Committee \nrecently passed this bill unanimously in a 19-to-0 vote. One thing that \nis so important to remember, as we debate this bill, is that without \nthis legislation, we would not have a say at all on the President's \nnuclear deal with Iran.\n  Now, I will be the first to say that an international agreement of \nthis magnitude should have been considered the same as a treaty. But, \nunfortunately, the President chose to completely circumvent Congress in \nthis process.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, did \nall we could to ensure that the American people, by way of Congress, \nget a say in this deal. If we let the perfect become the enemy of the \ngood, however, and fail to pass this bill, the President will be able \nto go ahead and implement any and all aspects of a nuclear deal with \nIran. This bill prevents the President from having a total free hand \nwith regard to this potential deal with Iran and from prematurely \nlifting sanctions.\n  According to CRS, this lifting of sanctions would mean an estimated \n$130 billion in sanctions relief would start flowing to Iran. That is \nmore than Iran's entire annual defense budget. Imagine what they could \ndo with over $100 billion. They could continue to fund terrorism. They \ncould continue to prop up Assad's regime in Syria. They could continue \nto fuel the Houthi rebellion in Yemen. And, yes, they could further \nfund development of their nuclear weapons program.\n  Congress passed the very sanctions credited with bringing Iran to the \ntable, and I firmly believe that Congress should play a role in any \ndecision to lift those sanctions. While the President may be able to \nwaive sanctions on Iran later this year, permanent sanctions relief can \nonly come from Congress.\n  My colleagues and I still have many questions about this deal, and we \nmust take this opportunity to get a period of congressional review so \nwe can get answers to these questions and prevent the President from \nprematurely lifting sanctions. We are truly facing a global crisis, and \nthe world is watching.\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu recently said before Congress, a nuclear \nIran is not just a threat to Middle East security, and it is not just a \nthreat to U.S. security. It is a threat, indeed, to global security. \nThere is no scenario in which a nuclear Iran would be anything but \ncatastrophic. Indeed, a nuclear Iran would spark a wave of \nproliferation in the Middle East and potentially worldwide. And if we \ndon't like Iran's behavior today, imagine what their actions will be \nlike if they have a nuclear weapon with the missiles to deliver \nthem. Under no circumstances can we allow Iran to become a nuclear \nweapon state--not now, not in 10 years, not ever.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the important \nlegislation we have pending right now on\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\nthe Senate floor. I do not see a greater threat to our security \ninterests in this country than a nuclear-armed Iran. Our national \nsecurity interests require a permanent and verifiable end to Iran's \nnuclear weapons program.\n  Today, I come to the floor to support the legislation that I was \nproud to be an original cosponsor of that will ensure that Congress \nreviews this agreement if there is an agreement reached with the \nIranians and that we will have a voice on this agreement because \nwithout Congress's involvement in this--I believe it would be a huge \ndisservice to the American people to not have their elected \nrepresentatives weigh in on such an important matter.\n  What matters most is, is this agreement one that is transparent, \nverifiable, and will actually end their nuclear program because the \ncountry of Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. \nWe cannot give one of the most dangerous regimes in the world the most \ndangerous weapon.\n  Iran described the United States of America as the ``Great Satan.'' \nIran said it wants to annihilate or wipe out the State of Israel. Iran \nis a country that is supporting terrorist groups around the world. We \ncan only imagine the devastation that could be wrought if Iran gets a \nnuclear weapon. So the stakes cannot be any greater with what is \nhappening right now with the administration negotiating with this \nregime, which is not a regime we can trust, unfortunately. So the terms \nof this agreement matter.\n  The elected representatives of this country need to have a vigorous \ndebate about this agreement in the Congress, and we need to make sure \nit is not an agreement that allows them to continue their march toward \na nuclear weapon.\n  Some of the information that has been released so far about the \nframework the administration has put together has raised a number of \nred flags about where this agreement is going. It is my hope that this \nlegislation passing will ensure that Congress is able to review the \nagreement to make sure it is one that ends their nuclear program.\n  Some of the concerns I already see with this framework agreement \nsuggest that the administration is moving in a direction that would not \nfully force Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure or require \nIran to address its long history of deception regarding its nuclear \nprogram, including long-term questions about the program's military \naspects. The framework that has been released would not address Iran's \nsupport for terrorism, its intercontinental ballistic missile program, \nor its stated desire to knock Israel off the map.\n  In order to ensure that we have an agreement that would end Iran's \nnuclear program and hold them accountable, we cannot have a situation \nwhere Iran keeps so much of its infrastructure and then can run up to a \nnuclear weapon or walk to it instead of running to it.\n  Even worse, as we look at the framework of this agreement and the \ninspection framework the agreement would require, we cannot have an \nagreement that does not allow unlimited inspections of Iran's nuclear \nprogram at any time, unannounced, because this is a regime which is not \na trustworthy regime. Yet, as I look at the terms of the framework that \nthe administration has announced, it seems we have a ``mother, may I'' \napproach to asking Iran whether we should go in and inspect their \nfacilities. Well, that is going to be unacceptable. We need to ensure \nthat the terms of this agreement, if reached, make sure we can show up \nat any time, anywhere, without notice to Iran, to inspect their \nfacilities to make sure they are adhering to the terms of the \nagreement.\n  In short, the framework of the agreement that has been released by \nthe administration suggests that this potential deal could eliminate \nhard-fought sanctions on which we worked together in this Congress on a \nbipartisan basis--economic sanctions that brought Iran to the table, \nwhich would take years to restore--in return for concessions that have \nonly reversed Iran's program by days or weeks. Iran would retain a \nmassive nuclear infrastructure, and they don't seem to be answering the \ntough questions about their support for terrorism or their missile \nprogram.\n  Iran's activities during these negotiations in supporting terrorism \nhave continued. As their diplomats sit at the negotiating table and \nsmile for the cameras, their government continues to support terrorist \norganizations such as Hezbollah and provide arms and funding to the \nmurderous Assad regime in Syria that has murdered hundreds of thousands \nof innocent people. It has continued to destabilize Yemen. It is \nimprisoning innocent Americans and developing an intercontinental \nballistic missile whose obvious purpose is to potentially deliver a \nnuclear weapon to the United States of America.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to the pending legislation that will \naddress Iran's ICBM program because one of the concerns I have is that \nthere doesn't seem to be any mention in these negotiations of Iran's \ndevelopment of ICBM capability that could be the delivery mechanism to \ndeliver a nuclear weapon to hit the United States. I will offer that \namendment to indicate to this administration that this issue needs to \nbe on the table. We need to not only stop their nuclear program, we \nneed to stop Iran's ICBM program, which some of our intelligence \nestimates have indicated could be successful as soon as the end of this \nyear.\n  That is the testimony we have heard in the Armed Services Committee. \nSo there is real urgency that we stop not only their nuclear program \nbut also their support for terrorism and their work on an ICBM that \ncould deliver harm--very grave harm--to our country. In fact, in \nFebruary, Iran had actually successfully launched a long-range missile \nsystem and used a space launch that could be the potential manner in \nwhich they would deliver a nuclear weapon capability to our country.\n  So this is a real concern that we address their missile program in \nthe context of this agreement. In fact, on January 29, 2014, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, James Clapper, testified that ``we \njudge that Iran would choose a ballistic missile as its preferred \nmethod of delivering nuclear weapons'' capability. One of the real \nimportant issues that we need to debate and address when it comes to \ntheir state sponsoring of terrorism is what is happening in Yemen right \nnow.\n  As we stand here, we have had a situation where Iran has been \nharassing and threatening cargo ships in the region, challenging a core \nAmerican national security and economic interest in the freedom of \nnavigation, particularly in key chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz \nand the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.\n  If you look at our interest in what has happened in Yemen, Iran has \nsupported the Houthis that have undermined the Government in Yemen. Why \nis that important to us? It is important to us because we had to leave \nYemen, in part, as a result of Iran's support of terrorism in Yemen. \nWho presides in Yemen? Who is one of the great presences in Yemen? Al \nQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a group that has vowed to attack our \ncountry, a group that has made attempts to attack us and our country. \nIran is aiding the way, through their terrorism there, to give Al Qaeda \nin the Arabian Peninsula more space to conduct attacks that can harm \nour interests and the interests of our allies.\n  So this legislation that is pending on the floor right now--if we \nwere to not pass it, I think people need to understand the implications \nof it. The implications of not passing this legislation that is on the \nfloor is that Congress would not have any say on these issues that are \nso important, would not have any say on whether the agreement that the \nadministration is negotiating with Iran actually will end their \nprogram, actually will dismantle their nuclear program, actually will \nhave a verifiable inspection regime that allows inspectors to go \nanywhere unannounced at any time to ensure that they are not cheating \non whatever agreement is reached between us and the Iranians.\n  So this bill could not be more important. I thank the sponsors of \nthis bill. I certainly thank Senators Corker and Cardin for their \nleadership in the Foreign Relations Committee, to ensure that the \npeople of this country, through their elected representatives, on \nsomething of such importance when it comes to the national security of \nthe United States of America--that their elected representatives \nperform their important oversight role here.\n  So I am hopeful we will pass this legislation that the U.S. \nCongress--I hope\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nthe administration, with some of the concerns I have raised about this \nframework, really toughens what they are doing in this framework to end \ntheir program, to have a transparent, verifiable inspection regime to \naddress the ICBM Program, to address Iran's state sponsorship of \nterrorism. I hope they will do that.\n  But I know that on behalf of my constituents, it is important, if any \nagreement is reached, that we have that debate here, that we have a \nvoice in it on behalf of the American people. In doing so, we will \nprotect the national security interests of this country to make sure \nthat whatever agreement is entered into is really a good agreement, one \nthat protects our country, which protects our allies, and ends Iran's \nnuclear program, as none of us can look in the mirror and think about \none of the most dangerous regimes in the world having the most \ndestructive weapon in the world. That is something that--as I think \nabout all of the national security issues, this is on the top. So I \ncannot think of a more important debate we could have now or more \nimportant legislation that we could work on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n                   The New Congress and Patent Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 114th Congress is just a little over \n100 days old now, but we have actually seen what used to be called the \nworld's greatest deliberative body actually get back to work and be \nproducing results for the American people. Just a few months into this \nsession, we have passed important legislation, from a budget--we will \nperhaps, as early as Tuesday, pass the first budget since 2009.\n  We repaired something called the doc fix, which maybe is inelegantly \nnamed but basically fixed a problem that had been lurking since 1977, \nwhen somehow we got the idea that we would be able to save money by \ncutting the reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals. Then we were \nshocked, absolutely shocked, that some doctors would not see Medicare \npatients and some hospitals could not afford to build or expand in \nrural areas and the like.\n  Well, we got that off the table as well. Then, I am glad to say, last \nweek we were able to pass some major antitrafficking legislation which, \nof course, dealt with the victims of human trafficking, the profile of \nwhich is about a 12- to 14-year-old girl who is literally in human \nbondage. So we have done some, I think, good work. There is a lot more \nwe need to do.\n  Of course, the present legislation that enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport is the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. I, too, \ncommend the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I know this can be a frustrating process because other \nMembers of the Senate now have ideas they want to offer by way of \namendment. We are working through this. I think this will test their \npatience and ours in the process.\n  But this Chamber is poised to continue in the spirit of \nbipartisanship on other important issues as well: trade promotion \nauthority, which, to me, is the essential link between us and the \nability to pass important trade agreements.\n  Texas, as the Presiding Officer knows, is the leading export State in \nthe Nation. We benefit from that because we understand that when you \nhave markets for the things we grow or the livestock we raise or the \nmanufactured goods we make, it is good for our economy, it is good for \njob creation. Well, trade promotion authority will be good for hard-\nworking Texas families and families all across the country.\n  But there is another area that may not seem of great significance but \nI think is important, where I think we have another opportunity. That \nhas to do with patent reform and particularly lawsuit abuse reform. \nNow, patents do not just affect the technology sector. They just do not \naffect the financial sector and Wall Street. It literally is a Main \nStreet problem because you have restaurants now, you have real estate \nagents, you have hotels, motels, you have construction companies that \nhave been sued by patent trolls, people who do not make anything, \nmerely they hold a license to a patent and use that to file--\nfrequently--frivolous litigation in order to literally shake down the \ndefendant.\n  Many times it is people who cannot adequately defend themselves. \nMaybe they are a startup business, an innovator who has come up with a \nnew idea or a better idea and they are thinly capitalized. Can you \nimagine what happens when they get sued by the patent trolls? Well, it \nis a sad and short story. Either they have to capitulate and pay the \nransom or they go out of business entirely.\n  But patent reform is an issue whose time has come again. It is one I \nhave been involved in for a number of years in the Senate. In 2011, \nafter years of negotiations, Congress passed something called the \nAmerica Invents Act. This is the first major patent reform in decades. \nThis is something that makes America unique. You know, in Texas we \nbelieve in property rights. Well, what we are talking about is \nintellectual property rights. But when somebody smart or creative or \ninnovative comes up with a better idea, our Constitution and our laws \nprovide a means to protect that against people who would take it or \nsteal it or infringe upon it. That is why patent law is so important.\n  But one of the issues left unaddressed was this rising tide of \nlawsuits and the threat of litigation, of which a wider and wider swath \nof stakeholders are now complaining loudly--again, not just the big \ntechnology firms but restaurants, hotels, motels, builders, real estate \nagents, and the like. So, in 2013, a number of Members of Congress \nbegan working on this legislation to address those frivolous claims, \nwhich really kill jobs because it kills innovation in the process.\n  Bills were introduced in the House and the Senate targeting the \nvarious aspects of this problem but focusing primarily on lawsuit \nabuse, lawsuits brought not to vindicate a legitimate claim by somebody \nwho actually has lost something of value but merely somebody who is a \nholder of a license to sue, in essence, and uses it to shake down these \nsmall startup companies and innovators.\n  Well, we were able to see the passage, in December of 2013, of \nsomething called the Innovation Act in the House of Representatives. \nThat legislation passed overwhelmingly, 325 to 91, with almost all \nRepublicans and the bulk of Democrats supporting the bill. Here is the \nother thing. This is not just a Democratic or Republican issue. This is \nsomething the administration wholeheartedly supports.\n  In fact, this is one of the stories I told last year as I was \ntraveling around Texas and elsewhere as evidence of the dysfunction, \nbecause, I asked: If Republicans are for something and Democrats are \nfor something, if the majority of Congress is for it and the White \nHouse is for it, why is it we can't get it done? Well, the obstacle to \ngetting it done was eliminated with the new majority in the Senate.\n  So I think we are poised to take good action here very soon. We are \nin a new Congress with a new leadership and a new majority. That is \neverything when it comes to reforming our broken patent system. Today, \nwe had a broad bipartisan group of people, from the ranking member and \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the former chairman, Senator \nHatch, to Senator Schumer, who is in the leadership of the Democrats in \nthe Senate, Senator Klobuchar, and Senator Lee.\n  All of us announced this broad, bipartisan support for a new piece of \npatent reform legislation designed to attack this problem of lawsuit \nabuse and the shakedown of America's innovators and job creators and \ntechnology creators. So Republicans and Democrats alike have come to \nrealize that under the status quo, too many of our most promising \ninnovators, not to mention other businesses, are wasting time and money \nin frivolous, costly litigation. This legislation takes a number of \ncommonsense steps that ends the exploitation of these so-called patent \ntrolls.\n  Many of those are not particularly earth-shaking, but the culmination \nof them, I think, will have a real positive impact on this problem.\n  First, it would require plaintiff's in patent cases to simply explain \nthe substance of their claim when filing the initial lawsuit. What \nfrequently happens is a lawsuit will be filed with no real detail as to \nthe nature of the claim\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\nor the infringement of the patent. Then there would ensue costly and \ntime-consuming discovery, until finally the plaintiff would figure out \nsome claim they could make to hang their hat on. Well, we eliminate \nthat by requiring upfront specific notice of what the infringement is \nin the nature of the claim.\n  Second, it would stay cases against the end users, including \nrestaurants, motels, hotels, construction companies, and the like, and \nwould give the party with the major incentive to defend the case the \nopportunity to do so. So the person who is actually responsible for the \nmanufacture of a product--let's say a Wi-Fi device--the manufacturer \nwould defend that case and not the hotel or motel that happened to \ndeploy that Wi-Fi device in their hotel or their motel.\n  Third, the bill would bring greater fairness to the discovery process \nby limiting discovery until the court resolves threshold motions in the \ncase. This is important because the court is going to have to make a \ndecision whether this is a legitimate case that could go on and thus \nauthorize the expensive and time-consuming discovery. If it is not a \nlegitimate case, then that is the time for the court to address it by a \nmotion to dismiss or some other legal device.\n  Fourth, it would curb the practice of sending abusive demand letters. \nWhat I have learned is that in patent litigation these days, there \nwould be demand letters which literally would carpet bomb the people \nwho were using some of this innovation, in an effort to shake them \ndown. It causes a lot of expense, delay, and other consternation.\n  Fifth--and this is perhaps one of the most critical elements--it \nwould allow courts to shift responsibility for the cost of patent \nlitigation more often to the losing party when the court finds that the \nclaim was not a reasonable claim to be brought. In other words, it was \na privileged claim. So no longer can you file a lawsuit and pursue it, \neven though it is a bogus case, without any fear of actually having to \npay the costs of the other side that prevails in a case involving an \nunreasonable use of the legal process.\n  So I believe, as many of my colleagues do, that these are sensible \nreforms, and it is one way we can take a step to protect better the \naccess to justice for plaintiffs with legitimate claims of infringement \nand to deter those who simply abuse the system.\n  This is another promising area where I think the 114th Congress can \ndistinguish itself from the 113th and previous Congresses by showing we \ncan actually work together to try to solve real problems in a \nbipartisan way that hopefully will improve life just a little bit for \nthe people we represent.\n  Entrepreneurs in Texas and throughout the country need this \nlegislation to protect them from abuse of patent litigation practices \nthat have burdened America's private sector for far too long.\n  The last point I would make is that I saw this morning the news that, \nbasically, America's economy did not grow in the last quarter. \nBasically, the gross domestic product was, I think, a 0.2 percent \nincrease. That is simply too slow of an economic growth to create the \njobs we need for the population increases we are seeing.\n  So if we are going to get our economy growing again, which is the \nbest way to raise the wages of hard-working American families, we are \ngoing to need to do a number of things, such as reform our tax system. \nWe are going to need to rein in overreaching regulation, which is a wet \nblanket on the private sector and on job creation, and we are going to \nneed to do efforts such as patent reform, as in this litigation reform \nlegislation I have just been talking about. That will unleash this \nsleeping giant of the great American economy for the benefit of all \nAmericans once again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the pending business \nbefore the Senate. Of all the things we will do, probably in our \npolitical lifetime, I can't think of anything more important than \ngetting the Iran nuclear ambitions right.\n  I stand in two camps. I would love a good deal, and a bad deal would \nbe a nightmare.\n  What is a bad deal? A bad deal would be one that would result in a \nNorth Korean outcome, where you lock in a capacity in the hands of the \nIranians to be monitored by the international community. And one day \nthey break out, you wake up, and you have a bomb.\n  A bad deal would be too much capacity in the hands of the Iranians. \nThat would spook the Sunni Arabs who want to go buy a bomb of their \nown.\n  I cannot tell you the consequences to the world and to our Nation if \nyou have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. That is what a bad \ndeal leads to.\n  A good deal allows us to wind down a hotly contested dispute between \nIran and the world over the last 20 years without firing a shot. A good \ndeal would be allowing the Iranians a peaceful nuclear power program, \nwhat they claim they want, with no real capability in a year--or any \ntime--to make a bomb.\n  If all they want is a peaceful nuclear power program, I do not \nobject.\n  I do object to the capability to enrich the uranium in a fashion that \none day they could break out, as North Korea did--because I don't trust \nthe Iranians.\n  So to Senator Cardin and to Senator Corker, you have navigated this \nvery well. You have a Democratic President, who I think wants the deal \nway too badly, and we have a Congress who I think wants to have a say.\n  We created the congressional sanctions, and we should have a say as \nto whether they are waived based on the deal and the quality of the \ndeal that they may negotiate with the Iranians and the P5+1. Since we \ncreated the sanctions, I don't think it is unfair to this President or \nto any other President to say: You need our vote. You need a debate to \noccur before we will agree to do that.\n  Now, is it a treaty? I don't think so. I would love it to be a \ntreaty, but it is not.\n  The one thing I don't want to do, in the process of dealing with a \nvery dangerous situation in the Middle East, is to turn the rules \nupside down in the Senate because I like a particular outcome.\n  Senator Johnson sincerely believes this is a treaty. I do not doubt \nhis motivations at all. But I have come to conclude, right or wrong, \nthat it doesn't meet the definition laid out by the Supreme Court and \nthe precedents of the past.\n  When we did a deal with North Korea, it wasn't a treaty. Maybe it \nshould have been, but it wasn't. So I don't think we are going to \nchange the rules just because we have a very dangerous moment in \nAmerican history, in world history, and a President some of us don't \ntrust or like.\n  Condoleezza Rice says it is not a treaty. I don't think she would \nhave said that if there had been any doubt in her mind.\n  I have had discussions with other Republicans who have served in \nprior administrations, and they have come to the same conclusion.\n  So we had a vote, which was a good thing, and the concept of it \nbecoming a treaty was voted down. The debate was worthy of the Senate, \nand I applaud all those who were involved.\n  There are aspects of amendments that are pending that I would embrace \nin a New York minute, but I believe that some of these amendments--no \nmatter how much I support the concept--would break apart a bipartisan \ncoalition that has taken a year to form.\n  To Senator Cardin and Senator Corker, you have struck a balance that \nI think makes sense to me. A Democratic minority, I don't believe, is \ngoing to turn all the power regarding this deal surviving or being \nstruck down to the Republican majority. If I were in your shoes, I \nwould not do that.\n  And to my colleagues who ask that the Democratic minority with a \nDemocratic President cede the entire process to us, as Republicans, \nthat is probably a bridge too far.\n  I don't think a Republican President would like that outcome. I don't \nthink a Republican minority would turn over to a Democratic majority \nthe ability to act unilaterally on something of this consequence.\n  So what have Senators Corker and Cardin been able to do? They have \nbrought the bill to the floor without a filibuster, allowing the debate \nand, hopefully, more votes.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, don't shut my Republican friends out. \nThey\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nall have a say, and I will vote with you against some of the amendments \nthat I like but that I just think would break the deal apart. Let's get \nthe Senate back in business in a reasonable fashion.\n\n  What I would say is that the construct of this bill makes perfect \nsense to me. You need 60 votes to disapprove the deal. Sixty votes are \nrequired for any major action in the Senate. That has been the \nhistorical precedent of the Senate. So the Democrats are not asking us \nto do something that hasn't been around as a concept for a long time.\n  What does it require? It requires the 54 Republicans, if we are \ntogether, to convince 6 Democrats that this is a bad deal.\n  I think, if it truly is a bad deal, our Democratic colleagues--for \nthe good of the Nation--and the consequences of a bad deal are \nunderstood by them--would join with us and say: This is not what we \nwant, Mr. President; try harder. Rejecting a bad deal does not mean \nthat we want to end diplomatic efforts. It means that we believe the \ndeal in question falls short.\n  To Senator Corker, you did a good job, because I don't think anybody \nin your shoes could have convinced the Democratic Party basically to \ndeal themselves out.\n  To Senator Cardin, you made it possible, along with Senator Menendez, \nfor us to have this debate and create, I think, a standard of \ndisapproval consistent with the traditions of the Senate.\n  There may never be a deal, but if there is one, it has to come back \nhere, and every American will get to hear the contents of the deal--\nwhile some think it is good, and while others think it is bad--and you \nwill not have to wonder what we are doing with regard to the Iranians.\n  If the Republican Party cannot convince enough Members of the \nDemocratic Party that it is a bad deal, then we will be disappointed, \nbut that is democracy.\n  Israel is very worried about the framework. The Sunni Arab States are \nvery worried about the framework. It is not a final deal yet.\n  Three things, I think, have to be there for me to be on board: \nanytime, anywhere inspections in Iran by international organizations of \nour choosing, including military facilities; no upfront signing bonus \nin terms of money until the Iranians comply with the initial phases of \nthe deal, because they will take the cash and put it in their war \nmachine; and whenever the inspection regime is supposed to terminate--\n10 years, 15 years or whatever date you pick--at that moment, the then-\nexisting President, whoever he or she may be, has to certify that Iran \nis no longer a state sponsor of terrorism, because you would not want \nto end an inspection regime if they were still involved in state \nterrorist activity.\n  So the two leaders on this bill, from my view, have crafted a very \ngood piece of legislation. People dislike it for different reasons, \nwhich means it is probably the balance we need--and I can't think of a \nbetter way to do this.\n  To those who think they have a better way, the only thing I can tell \nyou is you better get some Democrats to agree with you. Because if you \ncannot, it is just all talk.\n  What Bob Corker and Ben Cardin have been able to do is they have \ngiven the Senate a voice that we wouldn't have otherwise. They have \ngiven the American people a chance to understand the deal better than \nany opportunity I know of, and they have given us the power that every \nMember of the House and Senate should want in this regard, a chance to \nhave a say and to be recorded in history.\n  The outcome may not please you, but this is the best process I could \nthink of, given the way the Senate works and the way democracy works, \nwhich means both parties are going to require a say in something this \nimportant.\n  So, well done. I look forward to voting for this deal. Any amendment \nyou want to bring to the floor, I will vote for it if I think it is a \ngood amendment that will not deconstruct the deal or unravel the deal. \nI will vote against the amendment if I think it will break the deal \napart, even though I am sympathetic to it, because my goal is to get \nthis right, to make sure that any final deal with the Iranians is \nexplained to the American people through the House and the Senate \ndebate, and that can only happen if this bill becomes law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to say, while the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is on the floor, that at the end of the day, this bill \nis the Graham vision. I mean, the fact is that this is Graham-Corker, \nCorker-Graham. It has evolved so that we could have the kind of support \nthat we need to pass this into law.\n  But I thank Senator Graham for his pushing to make sure we got to \nthis point. There is no question. Look, you have been on this issue for \nmonths. You have pursued this. You have sold this publicly. You have \nworked with us as we have caused this to evolve to get the number of \nvotes that we may get actually to cause this to become law. I don't \nknow of anybody in our caucus or anybody in the Senate that has more of \na foreign policy national security background--no one.\n  I thank you for your efforts to ensure that we do everything we can \nto make sure we have a voice in this agreement that may happen on June \n30 or a few days thereafter. We wouldn't be here without your continual \npushing.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, before Senator Graham leaves the floor, I \nwish to concur with Senator Corker's observations.\n  It was several months ago that Senator Graham grabbed me on the floor \nof the Senate to talk about this being the most important \nresponsibility we have--to have an orderly way to oversight any \npotential agreement.\n  So I really thank Senator Graham for his attention to this issue. We \nwouldn't be here today if it weren't for his leadership on this issue, \nand I thank him for the manner in which he brought this issue forward \nso that we could find a way to get this done in a constructive manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I, too, want to begin today by thanking the \nSenators from Maryland and Tennessee for the work they have put into \nthis process. It is important. It is important that Congress have a \nrole in reviewing any deal the President concludes with Iran.\n  This is an extraordinary threat to the world. This is a nation which \nis run not by the individual with whom they are negotiating; Iran is a \ncountry governed and run by a radical Shia cleric who has ideas about \nthe future of the world that are frightening.\n  What is more frightening is the information we have received from \nthis administration about the framework they agreed to on April 2. It \nis a framework, for example, that would allow Iran to retain thousands \nof centrifuges and grant them the right to enrich uranium. It is an \narrangement that would allow Iran to avoid dismantling its key \nfacilities. It is an arrangement that allows Iran to continue to deny \nits past work on nuclear weapons. It is an arrangement that would allow \nIran to retain a significant ballistic missile program, including \nefforts to develop a missile capable of hitting the very spot on which \nwe stand right now. It is an arrangement that does nothing whatsoever \non the cases of those Americans who are currently unjustly detained in \nIran. It is an arrangement that does nothing to impact Iran's state \nsponsorship of terrorism or its brutal treatment of its own people. In \nfact, it is an arrangement that, if it goes through, will turn over \nbillions of dollars into the hands of the chief state sponsor of \nterrorism on the planet. And it is an arrangement that will do nothing \nto bring an end to Iran's self-proclaimed support at the highest levels \nof its government for the destruction of the State of Israel.\n  Since April 2 of this year, by the way, the Iranians have made clear \nthat they are not willing to do many of the things the White House \nitself has claimed are part of this deal. We are going to get to that \nin a moment, but understand that when the White House announced this \ndeal, they put out a fact sheet. They said: This is what the deal is \nabout. Iran is disputing it. They do not have the same fact sheet. In \nessence, what Iran is saying was agreed to and what the United States \nis saying was agreed to are, apparently at this\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\nmoment, two very different things. That alone should be concerning.\n  In addition to that, this deal is going to be a dangerous deal, a bad \ndeal not just for the United States and our allies in the region but \nespecially for our allies in Israel.\n  That is why it is important that Congress take a stand and ensure \nthat this deal is not implemented unless its fundamental flaws are \naddressed.\n  That is why I supported this legislation in the committee. I voted \nfor it so we could be here on the floor to strengthen it--not in a \ncommittee of just 20 members but here with all of our colleagues--over \na number of days, potentially weeks, so the country could see what is \nat stake.\n  The first amendment I will offer today and hope we can overcome \nobjections to is pretty straightforward. Here is what the amendment \nsays: It says to the President that no deal can go forward unless the \nPresident certifies that the Iranian leadership has accepted Israel's \nright to exist as a Jewish state.\n  Why is that important? Because we will hear the argument that this \nhas nothing to do with nuclear weapons, that this has nothing to do \nwith the nuclear capacity of Iran. I am going to make the argument that \nthat is not true.\n  The first reason is--we have to understand why it is important for \nIsrael to exist as a Jewish state. Israel is not just a country; it is \na homeland for the Jewish people, created in the aftermath of the \nHolocaust with the belief that never again would there not be a place \nfor the Jewish people to go and seek refuge and be able to live if they \nfaced persecution--as they have for thousands of years and as they do \neven now but especially in the aftermath of the Holocaust. So Israel is \nnot just a country. It has a special and unique purpose that sets it \napart from any other nation on Earth. It was created as a homeland for \na persecuted people who survived despite the deaths of 6 million human \nbeings in the Holocaust, maybe more. It is now a homeland where they \nwill be safe.\n  It is also important to remember that beyond that, it is in the \nnational security interests of the United States. What is Israel? \nIsrael is a pro-American, free enterprise democracy. I promise that if \nthere were more pro-American, free enterprise democracies in the Middle \nEast, our lives would be a lot simpler and the world would be a lot \nsafer and a lot better. But there is one, and this country must always \nbe firmly on the side of that one country, this free enterprise, pro-\nAmerican democracy in the midst of a region full of chaos and \nuncertainty.\n  Why is that relevant to this deal? Here is why it is relevant. This \nis not just a deal about what Iran is allowed to do in its nuclear \nprogram; this is a deal that would lift billions of dollars' worth of \nsanctions off of the Iranian Government. And what is the Iranian \nGovernment going to do when they get access to those billions of \ndollars? Are they going to donate it to charity around the world to \nfeed the hungry and house the homeless? No. Are they going to use it to \nsubstantially improve the rights of their people in their own country? \nNo. They are going to use those billions of dollars to do what they are \ndoing now with less money: export terrorism to every corner of the \nglobe.\n  Today, Iran is an active sponsor of terrorism in Lebanon, Syria, \nIraq, Yemen, Bahrain, Latin America, and Europe. This is the same \ngovernment that tried to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador here in \nWashington, DC. This is the same Iranian Government that blew up a \nJewish center in Buenos Aires. This is the same Iranian Government that \ntried to detonate a bomb in Uruguay. They use terrorism the way normal \ncountries use diplomacy. Yet, now we are going to turn over billions of \ndollars to them.\n\n  The reason why this has something to do with Israel is, what are they \ngoing to do when they have even more money to carry out these sorts of \nacts? They are going to invest it not just in their nuclear program, \nbut they will invest it in their sponsorship of terrorism and they will \ninvest it in their long-range rockets.\n  What have they told us they want to do with this increased capacity? \nWhat have they told us is the chief goal of this Government in Iran? \nWhy do they need this terrorism? Why do they need those weapons? Why do \nthey need those long-range rockets? Well, let's take them at their \nword. Here is why they need it. They need it because, according to a \ntweet put out by the Ayatollah in July of 2014, ``This barbaric, \nwolflike and infanticidal regime of Israel which spares no crime has no \ncure but to be annihilated.''\n  In November of 2014, the Supreme Leader posted a chart on his Twitter \naccount. It had ``9 key questions about the elimination of Israel.'' I \nam holding it here, but it can be found online. Here are some of those \nquestions:\n  ``Why should the Zionist regime be eliminated?''\n  ``What does elimination of Israel mean in the viewpoint of the Imam \nKhomeini?'' Meaning him.\n  ``What is the proper way of eliminating Israel?''\n  ``How will the proposed referendum succeed?'' Well, here he is \ntalking about actually calling for a referendum in Israel, but the Jews \ncan't participate in the referendum, according to him.\n  ``Why do we oppose compromise proposals?''\n  The point is that this is a country led by a leader who has made it \nvery clear repeatedly, time and again, that one of their main \nobjectives is the destruction of Israel and ending Israel's existence \nas a Jewish state. When someone says that over and over again, we \nshould believe them. This is not for domestic consumption to make him \nlook good in Iran, the way some in the administration would argue. I \nbelieve they mean it. Do you know why I believe they mean it? Because \nthey sponsor terrorism in an effort to kill Jews and Israelis.\n  In January of 2015, a suitcase full of explosives was found near the \nIsraeli Embassy in Uruguay. The day after an individual left a suitcase \nbomb near the Embassy, a senior Iranian diplomat by the name of Ahmed \nSabatgold left the country. Uruguayan authorities clarified a report \nclaiming that he had been expelled from the country. They said no. They \nsuggested that, in fact, he was a person of high interest with whom \nthey would like to speak but that he left the country on his own.\n  So the reason why the existence of Israel as a Jewish state is \ndirectly tied to this deal is simple. We are about to turn over \nbillions of dollars into their hands, and we have every reason to \nbelieve they will spend a significant portion of that money to destroy \nour strongest and most important ally in the region and one of the most \nimportant allies in the world.\n  The first amendment I have offered is pretty straightforward. It \ncalls for any deal to require that Iran recognize Israel's right to \nexist as a Jewish state.\n  The second amendment I will propose is even more straightforward, \neven more on point. Here is what it requires. It requires that this \nfinal deal be the deal the President says it is. Here is what I mean by \nthat. I filed an amendment that basically took the White House's own \nfact sheet--by the way, I have problems with that fact sheet. The deal \nas the President describes it is not a deal I believe will work. It is \nnot a deal I believe will prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. \nBut just to take them at their word, just to prove this point and to \nensure we are building safeguards into what we are doing here, I took \nthe White House's own fact sheet, what they said the deal was about, \nand I say in this amendment that the final deal must be about those \npoints that the White House already says it is. For the life of me, I \ndon't understand why that would be controversial. My amendment is \nbasically this. It says the deal has to be what you say it is. That is \nall my amendment says. Yet, somehow I have been told this is going to \nbox in the White House. If it does, it boxes them in with their own \nwords.\n  But here is the reason I am doing it. Iran apparently negotiated a \nvery different deal than the one the White House thinks we have. For \nexample, the White House says this deal will impose permanent \ninspections on Iran. The State Department fact sheet says: ``Iran's \nadherence to the Additional Protocol of the IAEA is permanent, \nincluding its significant access and transparency obligations.'' The \nIranian fact sheet says: ``Iran will implement the Additional Protocol \non a voluntary and temporary basis for the sake of transparency and \nconfidence building.''\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nThat doesn't sound like the same deal to me.\n  How about the inspection of military sites? In an interview on CNN, \nDeputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said: ``If we see a site \nthat we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to \nthat site and inspect it.'' But on April 9, Iranian Brigadier General \nHossein Dehghan said: ``Visiting military centers are among the red \nlines and no visits to these centers will be allowed.''\n  How about the scope of the sanctions relief? The State Department \nfact sheet says: ``United States and European Union nuclear-related \nsanctions will be suspended . . . All past U.N. Security Council \nresolutions on the Iran nuclear issue will be lifted simultaneous with \nthe completion, by Iran, of nuclear-related actions addressing all key \nconcerns.'' But Iran says: ``According to the reached solutions, after \nthe implementation of the Comprehensive Plan of Joint Action, all of \nthe U.N. resolutions will be revoked and all of the multilateral \neconomic and financial sanctions by the EU and the unilateral ones by \nthe U.S. will be annulled.'' So are the sanctions limited or total? We \nsay they are limited; Iran says they are total.\n  There are three more differences. On the timing of the release, at a \nnews conference on April 2, the President said:\n\n       In return for Iran's actions, the international community \n     has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain \n     sanctions--our own sanctions and international sanctions \n     imposed by the United Nations Security Council. This relief \n     will be phased as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal.\n\n  So the President is basically saying that every time Iran complies \nwith a portion of the deal, an additional sanction will be phased out; \nit will be in steps. If they do something, sanctions come off slowly. \nTrust but verify. That is what the American Government says. That is \nwhat the President said in his own words. But Iran says: ``We will not \nsign any deal unless on the very first day of its implementation all \neconomic sanctions against Iran are lifted all at once.''\n  How about restrictions on enrichment? Are there restrictions for 10 \nyears or for 15 years? The United States and the State Department Fact \nSheet says:\n\n       Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for \n     at least 15 years . . . Iran has agreed to not build any new \n     facilities for the purpose of enriching uranium for 15 years \n     . . . Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium at its Fordow \n     facility for at least 15 years . . . Iran has agreed to not \n     conduct research and development associated with uranium \n     enrichment at Fordow for 15 years.\n\n  That is a lot of 15 years.\n  What does Iran say? On April 4, on an Iranian state TV channel, its \nForeign Minister said:\n\n       The limitations are for 10 years and then enrichment will \n     continue its own scientific progress. We have accepted 10 \n     years of limitations.\n\n  Last but not least, research and development--is it limited or not \nlimited? The United States, in our fact sheet, says it is limited.\n\n       Iran will not use its IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, or IR-8 \n     models to produce enriched uranium for at least 10 years. \n     Iran will engage in limited research and development with its \n     advanced centrifuges, according to a schedule and parameters \n     which have been agreed to by the P5+1.\n\n  The group that negotiated all this.\n  That is what the U.S. fact sheet says. But what does Iran say? Iran \nsays no.\n\n       Iran will continue its research and development on advanced \n     machines and will continue the initiation and completion \n     phases of the research and development process of IR-4, IR-5, \n     IR-6, and IR-8 centrifuges during the 10 year period of the \n     Comprehensive Plan for Joint Action.\n\n  So these are at least six major points of difference where Iran is \nsaying the deal says one thing and the United States is saying the deal \nsays another. What my amendment does is it takes what we say the deal \nis and puts it in the bill and says: Any final deal must be what you \ntold us it is, not what Iran says it is. Yet, somehow, apparently, that \nis controversial.\n  This is not a game. This is a very serious matter because this is a \ncountry--and I don't mean its people but its leaders--that has shown \nthe willingness to sponsor terrorism and do atrocious things all over \nthe world.\n  When you read in the newspaper about civilians being barrel-bombed \nand gassed and killed in Syria, do you know why Assad is able to do \nthat? Because of the help he gets from Iran.\n  When you read about the rockets that flood into Tel-Aviv and \nJerusalem and Haifa and cities all across Israel every couple years as \nHezbollah launches attacks, hiding behind human shields while they are \ntrying to kill Israelis, do you know how they are able to get them? \nBecause of help from Iran.\n  When you read in the newspaper that yesterday the Iranian military \nhijacked a vessel in international waters, when you read that they \ntried to kill the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, DC, when you read \nthat they tried to set off a bomb in Uruguay, when you read how in 1994 \nthey did set off a bomb at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina--\nthis is who we are dealing with. Now they are on the verge of being \nable to enrich weapons-grade uranium and reprocess weapons-grade \nplutonium. Now they are headed quickly toward building a long-range \nrocket capable of reaching not just Israel but Europe and the United \nStates.\n  This is a very significant moment because this President is about to \nsign a deal that will place in their hands billions of additional \ndollars. If this is the terrorism and the nuclear activity they are \npursuing now with sanctions on them, imagine how much more they will be \nable to afford to do once the sanctions are lifted. That is why it is \nso relevant on this point of Israel but also on the details of this \ndeal.\n  By the way, as I said, and I will repeat it, the State Department \nfact sheet, what the President says the deal is--I am not comfortable \nwith that either. I don't think that will work. It is not as if I am \ncelebrating what they say the deal is.\n  All I am asking is this: At a minimum, before you bring and sign a \ndeal, at least let it be what you say it is. Don't come back here in 6 \nmonths and surprise us with ``By the way, it was the Iranian's fact \nsheet that had it right and not ours.''\n  So I hope we will be able to move on these amendments. I don't think \nthey undermine this one bit. I think they are relevant to the debates \nwe are having. I think they are relevant to the decision we are being \nasked to make. And it is about time this body takes this up. Congress \nhas an important role to play. The people of Florida whom I represent \nspeak on these issues on this floor through me and the senior Senator \nfrom Florida. We have a right to have these issues debated. This is not \nsome minor issue we are talking about; this is the security not just of \nour strongest ally in the region but of our very own country.\n  So I hope we will have an opportunity to have debates on these \namendments. When we hear people say: If these amendments pass, we are \ngoing to lose the support of the bill; the President might veto it--\nwell, if you want to make that argument, make that argument, but let's \nhave a vote on it. What is wrong with having a vote on an amendment? If \nyou don't want to vote on the amendment because you disagree with me, \nstand up and say you disagree with the amendment and you vote no. If \nyou agree with the amendment but you are going to vote against it \nbecause you think it unravels this process that is being put in place, \nthen say that. But let's have a vote on it.\n  If you don't want to vote on things, don't run for the Senate. If you \ndon't want to vote on things, don't run for office. Be a columnist. Get \na talk show. Everyone who runs for office knows that what we are called \nto do here is vote on issues on which sometimes we are uncomfortable.\n  There is a microphone at your desk. Come to the floor and give a \nspeech and explain to the world why you are voting against a deal that \nrequires Israel to have a right to exist. And if you say you believe \nIsrael has a right to exist but you are voting against it because you \ndon't want to unravel the deal, people will respect it. You can make \nyour argument, but vote. Don't tell me we can't have votes on these \nthings. You can argue that we shouldn't pass it, and I will argue \nagainst you, but don't tell me we can't even vote on it because then \nwhat you are saying is you want to be protected from taking a position \non it, you don't want to take a position that you think is tough, and \nthat I find to be unacceptable.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up the two\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\namendments I just described, amendment No. 1141 and amendment No. 1148, \nen bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nexplain to my friend from Florida--a very valued member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee--that we have two pending amendments. We \nhave also been working to get a vote on Senator Barrasso's amendment \ndealing with terrorism. Senator Corker and I are trying to work through \nmany amendments that we can clear that Members have brought forward. \nThey are working with us to get those amendments where we can consider \nthem.\n  For an orderly process, since so many amendments have been filed--\nand, I might say, they have all been filed by Republican Members of the \nSenate--we need to make sure we have an orderly way to consider these \namendments and vote on these amendments. For those reasons, I do \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, just as a point of clarification, I am a \nmember of the committee that heard these amendments, particularly the \none on Israel's right to exist. They were available to me at the time. \nI chose not to offer them in consultation with the Senators who worked \nso hard to put them together. I could have offered my amendment in the \ncommittee. I did not in order to work in a cooperative way to move it \nfrom the committee onto the floor.\n  I will admit that I did not speak to Senator Cardin about this in \nparticular, but I was told by multiple Members that the right place and \nthe right time for me to offer this amendment would be on the floor, \nnot in the committee, because the hope was to get it to the floor as \nquickly as possible. So in an effort to move this issue to the floor, I \nheld back on filing this particular amendment with regard to Israel's \nright to exist on the assurances and on the conversations that we had \nthat, in fact, when we got to the floor, these amendments would be \nheard.\n  Now, if, in fact, it turns out that today is not going to be the day \nwe vote on the amendment, I understand that. I know there are a lot of \nother people with ideas they want voted on.\n  My understanding is and I have been told that there is potentially \nthe effort here to say we shouldn't have any amendment or just have \nthree or four amendments, and I think that is an unfair position to \ntake. I am not saying that is what the Senator from Maryland is \narguing. But I hope that at some point, as the order is established--I \nwill continue to make this motion in the hope that this amendment can \nnot just be pending but can be part of this debate.\n  I respect the views of my colleagues, some who I think will come to \nthe floor and say they agree with me on the substance of it but don't \nwant to vote on the amendment because they think it endangers the \nagreement we have in place or the bill that is in place. But I do think \nit deserves a vote, and I do think it deserves that debate.\n  So I hope in this orderly process that is established, these two \namendments--I have filed seven, but I prioritized these two--these two \nwill get the consideration I believe they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Senator Rubio pointed out, we had no \ndiscussions about this. I don't know what Senators he is referring to, \nbut let me just talk briefly about some of the points Senator Rubio \nmentioned because I think it is important that we respond to them.\n  First, the bill we are considering, S. 615, is a bill that doesn't \ndeal with the merits of a potential deal. It deals with the right way \nfor Congress to review a potential deal that is reached between the \nUnited States and our trading partners and Iran concerning its nuclear \nweapon program. That is what this bill does. It doesn't say whether the \nPresident's agreement is a good one, a bad one, et cetera. It is a \nprocess for us to review it and take appropriate action because we are \nthe ones who impose the sanctions. Only the Congress can permanently \nchange or eliminate the sanctions. Therefore, it is important that we \nhave an orderly way to review the potential deal. That is what it \ndoes--nothing more, nothing less.\n  It also, by the way, gives us the opportunity to get notice of \nmaterial breaches and be able to take action to prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear weapons state if they, in fact, breach the \nagreement.\n  So the two points Senator Rubio mentioned--the first is that there \nare different interpretations being given, one by the United States and \none by the Iranians. Well, we think the first amendment we filed is \ngoing to help deal with that. It is pending right now. It requires us \nto get every official document of a potential deal in the language in \nwhich it is agreed to. So that amendment is pending--it is followed by \nSenator Corker and me--for the reasons Senator Rubio mentioned, and \nthat is, we want to see the original text. We don't want to have the \ninterpretation by the Iranians; we want to know what the language says. \nThat is our responsibility. We are going to get that once we take up \nthis first amendment--I hope it is approved--that will give us the \noriginal language text of every agreement and exhibit that is agreed to \nbetween the parties.\n  The second issue Senator Rubio mentioned is Israel's right to exist \nand Iran acknowledging Israel's right to exist. I fully agree with \nSenator Rubio. I don't think there is a Member of this body who doesn't \nwant Israel legitimated by every country in the world. It is our key \nally in the Middle East. It is a country that shares our values, that \nhas a strategic relationship with the United States, and I could go on \nand on.\n  Since 1948, the United States and Israel have enjoyed a very close \nand important relationship, and we have taken so many actions in this \nbody in order to protect Israel's right to exist. That is why we \nincluded your language and Senator Boxer's language in this bill where \nwe say, ``The President should determine that the agreement in no way \ncompromises the commitment of the United States to Israel's security or \nits support for Israel's right to exist.'' We have that in the bill.\n  What Senator Rubio's amendment would have us do--and let me explain \nthis. What his amendment would have us do is require that the President \ncertify to us before he could submit any agreement--enter into any \nagreement--that Iran has recognized Israel's right to exist.\n  This agreement we are negotiating with our negotiating partners and \nIran is to deal with Iran's nuclear weapon program. I know from my \nconversations with the Israeli Government that they think that is the \nmost important thing for their existence--the most important thing--\nthat Iran not become a nuclear weapons state. That is what Israel \nneeds, and that is what we are trying to get.\n  The Rubio amendment, although it is not intended to do that, would \nsay: No, that is not the most important thing. The most important thing \nis to negotiate the language, what Iran says about Israel, not their \nnuclear weapons program, and that the President must achieve that.\n  When you are negotiating, the more things you put on the table, the \nweaker position you are in in achieving the most important point, and \nthat is making sure we have a strong agreement that Iran can never \nbecome a nuclear weapons state.\n  That is why this amendment will accomplish just the opposite as far \nas Israel's security is concerned. Yes, it is a poison pill. Yes, it \nwill defeat this bill. That also happens to be true. And, yes, it will \nmean it will be almost impossible for the President to negotiate a \nnuclear agreement with Iran.\n  I think most people in this body and most people in America believe \nthat the best course is a negotiated agreement with Iran. The \nunintended consequences of this amendment would make it virtually \nimpossible to have that agreement completed.\n  So, yes, we could get into debate on the specifics of your amendment. \nI am more than happy to do that. But we have an orderly process here, \nand there are a lot of amendments that have been filed, and we are \ntrying to work out a way to do this. Senator Corker and I have been on \nthe floor now for 4 or 5 days debating this issue, and we will debate \nany Member who wants to come by because we want do make sure we do have \nan open debate. But we are\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\ngoing to follow an orderly process. And this amendment, as well-\nintended as it is, is an amendment that would very much compromise what \nwe have tried to do in a bipartisan way, and that is to make sure that \nthis Senate and the House have an orderly way to consider any deal \nstruck between our negotiating partners and the United States and Iran. \nThat is our responsibility, and we are going to stay focused on that, \nand we are going to end with a bipartisan product that is in I think \nthe best traditions of the United States Senate.\n  So I respect very deeply my colleague's commitment to Israel. I do.\n  All of us are committed to Israel, but let's think about what is the \nmost important thing for Israel, and that is having a strong agreement \nthat prevents Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon state. Let's focus on \nthat because that, I think, this bill helps us achieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I appreciate the passion of the Senator \nfrom Maryland. He makes points that I think are very relevant to debate \nonce we are on the amendment. That is all I am asking for, a vote on \nthe amendment. He is making an argument right now why he thinks we \nshould not pass this amendment.\n  I respect the orderly process. I did not necessarily recognize that \ncoming to the floor and trying to get my amendment pending would \nsomehow unravel this orderly process, but I am more than happy to work \nwithin the orderly process, whatever that process entails. I would be \nmore than happy to have it explained to me, where I fit in, in this \norderly process, and at the appropriate moment we will file the \namendment. But I wanted a vote on the amendment, and then the argument \nyou made here today can be made.\n  The only other point I would make is it is true, tragically, that \nthere are a number of countries in the Middle East that do not \nrecognize Israel's right to exist. The difference is those countries \nare not trying to build a nuclear weapon, nor are they building long-\nrange rockets, nor do they use terrorism as an instrument of \nstatecraft, nor do they every Friday hold ceremonies in which their top \nleader chants ``Death to Israel'' and ``Death to America,'' nor do they \nactively support terrorist groups around the world that exist for the \nsole purpose of destroying Israel itself, nor do they have billions of \ndollars in sanctions that are about to be released.\n  At the end of the day, there is a big difference between what is \nhappening in Iran and the billions of dollars we are about to turn over \nto them and these other countries that, unfortunately, do not recognize \nIsrael's right to exist but are not going around actually actively \ntrying to destroy the State of Israel.\n  The last point is on the differences in the details. Listen, I do not \nthink the fact sheet the State Department put out is sufficient. I \nthink the deal, as described by the President, is not good enough and \nwill not lead to the prevention of a nuclear weapon. But all I am \nasking for in my amendment is for the deal he submits to be the one \nthat he says he negotiated.\n  He has told us already we have reached a preliminary agreement. He \nhas announced it to the world what that preliminary agreement is. All I \nam saying is what you submit to us must be what you told us it is. Here \nis why I say this: Because this negotiation has been going on for a \nwhile. Every month that goes by, Iran gains more concessions, and our \nposition slips further and further.\n  If you look where we were at the beginning of this process to where \nwe are today, it is a very different place from where we were not that \nlong ago. We are in a very different place than we were in terms of \nwhat we had originally said. When this whole thing started 10 years \nago, 12 years ago, the U.N. Security Council put sanctions on Iran and \nsaid you are not even able to enrich or reprocess. Now they are allowed \nto enrich and reprocess. They are even allowed to enrich and reprocess \nat an even higher rate for research purposes.\n  If these negotiations keep going on, we are going to end up building \nthe bomb for them at the rate it is going, because every year and every \nmonth that goes by, they gain more and more concessions. All I am \ntrying do is, at a minimum, freeze this in place and say, Mr. \nPresident, you have told us that you have negotiated a deal. Mr. \nPresident, you put out a fact sheet that told us what the deal is. You \nhave represented it to the American people as the deal, and now all \nthis will say is what you submit to us must be what you told us you \nagreed to on April 2. Do not come back here in 6 months and submit to \nus a deal, and as it turns out the Iranian fact sheet is the one we \nshould have been relying on.\n  All I am asking, even though I do not think that what he has agreed \nto is sufficient--all I am asking in my second amendment is that the \ndeal he submits be the deal he says it is, nothing more and nothing \nless.\n  I hope that through this orderly process the moment will arrive, \nbefore we vote on passage of this, that my amendments can be heard and \nvoted on. I respect the arguments that others make about why they \ncannot support them and what they think they will ultimately do to the \nprocess. All I am asking for are votes on these amendments, and then \neverybody is free to vote the way they want and for the reasons they \nwant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I can, quite frankly, share the Senator \nfrom Florida's frustration, and I urge us to fully debate and begin \nvoting on important amendments to this bill. I am all for any \nproductive, orderly process, but I want it to be productive, to be \ninclusive, and to get going. I share the frustration that has been \nexpressed on the floor that that is not quite happening right now.\n  In light of that, I want to be assured of moving forward and getting \na vote on a very important amendment for me. I send a second-degree \namendment to the desk, Vitter amendment No. 1186, as modified. I ask \nthat it be a second-degree amendment to Corker amendment No. 1179 and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Corker amendment is not pending.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: What is \nthe pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 1155.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1179\n\n  Mr. VITTER. In that case, I call for regular order with respect to \nthe Corker amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment No. 1179 is pending.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1186, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1179\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I send this second-degree amendment to the \ndesk, Vitter amendment No. 1186, as modified, to be a second-degree \namendment to Corker amendment No. 1179, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Cardin, proposes an amendment numbered 1186, as modified, \n     to amendment No. 1179.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require an assessment of inadequacies in the international \n    monitoring and verification system as they relate to a nuclear \n                          agreement with Iran)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``(C) Assessment of inadequacies in international \n     monitoring and verification system.--\n       ``(i) In general.--A report under subparagraph (A) shall \n     include an assessment by the Secretary of State, in \n     conjunction with the heads and other relevant officials of \n     agencies with responsibilities under this section, detailing \n     existing inadequacies in the international monitoring and \n     verification system to the extent such inadequacies relate to \n     the agreement transmitted pursuant to paragraph (1), as \n     outlined and in accordance with findings and recommendations \n     pertaining to verification shortcomings contained within--\n\n       ``(I) the September 26, 2006, Government Accountability \n     Office report, ``Nuclear Nonproliferation: IAEA Has \n     Strengthened Its\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\n     Safeguards and Nuclear Security Programs, but Weaknesses Need \n     to Be Addressed'';\n       ``(II) the May 16, 2013, Government Accountability Office \n     Report, ``IAEA Has Made Progress in Implementing Critical \n     Programs but Continues to Face Challenges'';\n       ``(III) the Defense Science Board Study, ``Task Force on \n     the Assessment of Nuclear Treaty Monitoring and Verification \n     Technologies'';\n       ``(IV) the IAEA Report, The Safeguards System of the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency; and the IAEA Safeguards \n     Statement for 2010;\n       ``(V) the IAEA Safeguards Overview: Comprehensive \n     Safeguards Agreements and Additional Protocols;\n       ``(VI) the IAEA Model Additional Protocol; and\n       ``(VII) the IAEA February 2015 Director General Report to \n     the Board of Governors.\n\n       ``(ii) Recommendations.--The assessment required under \n     clause (i) shall include recommendations based upon the \n     reports referenced in such clause, including recommendations \n     to overcome inadequacies or develop an improved monitoring \n     framework and recommendations related to the following \n     matters:\n\n       ``(I) The nuclear security program's long-term resource \n     needs.\n       ``(II) A plan for the long-term operation and funding of \n     the IAEA and relevant agencies increased activities in order \n     to maintain the necessary level of oversight.\n       ``(III) A potential national strategy and implementation \n     plan supported by a planning and assessment team aimed at \n     cutting across agency boundaries or limitations that impact \n     its ability to draw conclusions--with absolute assurance--\n     about whether Iran is developing a clandestine nuclear \n     weapons program.\n       ``(IV) The limitations of IAEA actors.\n       ``(V) Challenges within the geographic scope which may be \n     too large to anticipate within the sanctioned treaty or \n     agreement or the national technical means (NTM) monitoring \n     regimes alone.\n\n       ``(iii) Presidential certification.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the Secretary of State submits a report under \n     subparagraph (A), the President shall certify to the \n     appropriate congressional committees and leadership that the \n     President has reviewed the Secretary's shortfall assessment \n     required under this subparagraph, including the \n     recommendations contained therein, and has taken necessary \n     actions to address existing gaps within the monitoring and \n     verification framework.\n       ``(D) Classified annex.--A report under\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I would be happy to explain the substance of the \namendment.\n  This is about verification, obviously a really crucial part of this \ndebate. Many of us who have concerns about the President's proposed \nagreement do not think we have adequate means to verify any agreement \nin the context and the structure he has proposed. So, clearly, those \nverification issues are very, very important.\n  This amendment tries to address those in a substantive and \nsignificant and meaningful way. What the amendment does is actually \nspecifically lists documented reports from groups such as the IAEA, the \nU.S. Defense Science Board Task Force, and others, which have \nhighlighted specific verification problems. The amendment would require \nthe President to report in a very detailed, specific way on those \ndocumented verification problems and make certifications regarding \nmaking progress on and solving those verification problems.\n  Again, I think this is absolutely necessary because I believe the \npresent deal, as it is being put together, does not have adequate \nverification capability. This would help fill that hole. I am not sure \nit would completely fill that gap, quite frankly, but this is a good-\nfaith attempt to address those very real issues by, again, delineating \nspecific documented verification problems and requiring the President \nand his administration to address them, to report on that, and to make \ncertifications regarding how they are addressing those specific \ndocumented verification problems.\n  I urge strong support of this good-faith amendment. This would \ndramatically, in my opinion, improve this agreement by helping address \nthose verification concerns. I believe they are very legitimate \nconcerns shared by many people on both sides of the aisle. I urge \nstrong consideration and, ultimately, approval of this verification \nenhancement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1180.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know the good Senator from South Dakota \nknows that we are working with the other side to get a number of \namendments ready to vote on today, and we certainly appreciate his \nconstructive effort in letting us know what he is doing.\n  I object to making it pending because the other side--I am doing this \non their behalf--wants to work through the tranche that we have right \nnow.\n  I hope he discusses his amendment and maybe we can make it pending \nlater today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, who is \nmanaging this bill. I know they are trying to find a way forward, and I \nhope that will include getting some votes on amendments, including this \none. I think this is a very reasonable amendment and one that certainly \nfits within what we are trying to accomplish here.\n  The Senate is in the midst of an important debate. This week we began \na discussion on the role of Congress in approving or disapproving a \nnuclear agreement with Iran. Any agreement we reach with Iran must \nensure one thing, and that is that Iran will never be able to acquire a \nnuclear weapon. That should be everything that this discussion is \nabout.\n  A nuclear-armed Iran would threaten the safety, stability, and \nsecurity of the entire world. It would also pose a direct threat to the \nUnited States and to our allies in the region. Given the stakes of this \ndebate, it is critical that Congress have a role in reviewing any \nagreement so that the American people's voices can be heard. That is \nreally what this is all about--giving the American people a voice on \nsomething that is of critical importance to America's national \nsecurity.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee for forging together a bipartisan path forward to \nallow for such a congressional review.\n  While I support the underlying bill and appreciate the work of our \nbill managers, I do believe the bill could be significantly \nstrengthened, and the amendment I am introducing today will help to do \nthat.\n  My amendment, No. 1180, is one way that the Senate can strengthen the \nunderlying bill. This amendment will require the Secretary of State to \nverify whether the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, \nwhich would be in charge of inspections in Iran under any agreement, \nwould have access to Iranian military bases. There have been recent \nreports that have indicated that the Iranian military is hostile to any \ninspection of military facilities.\n  General Hossein Salami, the deputy head of Iran's Revolutionary \nGuard, recently told Iranian media: ``They [the inspectors] will not be \npermitted to inspect the most normal military site in their dreams.'' \nAgain, that statement was made by General Hossein Salami, who is the \ndeputy head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.\n  If the administration enters into an agreement that doesn't guarantee \nthe inspection of Iranian military sites, the American people and our \nallies in the region will have very little reason to believe that Iran \nwill comply with any agreement. Without such an agreement, Iran can \nconduct research on nuclear weapons systems on military bases outside \nthe reach of international inspectors. That is not an acceptable \nscenario.\n  We must ensure that any deal with Iran is verifiable, enforceable, \naccountable, and promotes security and stability in the region and \naround the world. That goal is hard to achieve without a robust \ninspections regime that allows for international inspections of Iran's \nmilitary sites.\n  Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, which \nwill help ensure that Iran cannot circumvent an agreement conducting\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nresearch on nuclear weapons systems at military facilities. A nuclear-\narmed Iran is a threat to the safety, security, and stability of the \nentire planet.\n  I hope that when an agreement about how to proceed with regard to \namendments is reached, this amendment will be included among those \namendments that will be debated and voted upon, because I do think it \nwill strengthen the underlying agreement. I certainly look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides, not only to get this \namendment adopted but also to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear \nweapon. That is first, foremost, and what this always needs to be \nabout.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am here on the floor this afternoon \nwith my good friend from North Dakota, and I want to speak to an issue \nas it relates to the Iranian sanctions bill that we have on the floor \nin front of us.\n  This is about an issue that so many of us care deeply about--about \nour own domestic production here, about the strength of our economy, \nabout the strength of our national security and how the United States \nin a global environment really stands toe-to-toe in good strong \ncompetition around the world. I want to speak today about U.S. oil--the \nban on U.S. oil--and how this all intersects with Iran, Iranian \nsanctions, and specifically, the sanctions on Iranian oil.\n  I am submitting a bipartisan amendment to allow U.S. oil to compete \nwith Iranian oil on the global market. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by Senator Heitkamp, Senator Hoeven, Senator Lankford, and, \nhopefully, others, as this discussion progresses.\n  Iran's Government is largely dependent on its exports of oil for its \nrevenue source. It sends oil to countries such as China, Japan, India, \nand South Korea. The sanctions that have been imposed have really hurt \nIran's economy. They have brought Iran to the table. The sanctions that \nhave been in place have cost the government in Tehran some $40 billion \nin lost export revenues in 2014 alone, according to the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  Under the sanctions regime and the Joint Plan of Action, countries \nare still able to purchase Iranian oil, and I don't think a lot of \nfolks understand that. They think the sanctions are in place and Iran \ncan't derive a benefit from the oil exports. But in fact, companies are \nstill able to purchase Iranian oil, up to 1 to 1.1 million barrels per \nday and--no surprise--countries have purchased up to that limit nearly \nevery month since the JPA was implemented in November of 2013. So \nsanctions are in place, but Iran is still deriving the benefit of being \nable to sell Iranian oil to other nations.\n  It is worth pointing out that this is only possible because the State \nDepartment does not include condensate in its definition of crude oil. \nIf you include the condensate volumes, then the limit of 1.1 million \nbarrels per day was breached back in January of 2014, in February, \nMarch, April, and May--not June--in July, September, October, and \nDecember, and also in February of 2015, according to reports that came \nout of the International Energy Agency.\n  It simply does not make sense for us to lift sanctions on Iranian oil \nwhile we keep them on American oil. It just doesn't make sense that we \nwould tell Iran that we are going to allow these sanctions to be lifted \nover there, but by keeping our oil export ban in place, we are \neffectively imposing sanctions on U.S. oil producers. This is a de \nfacto sanctions regime against ourselves.\n  Now, one can understand why we have imposed sanctions on certain \nplaces--on Tehran, Moscow, and Damascus. However, we are effectively \ntalking about sanctions on the Permian, on the Utica, on the Niobrara, \nand on regions where we have the ability to produce a resource that \nhelps this country, helps to create jobs, and helps with all aspects of \nour economy. We are going to say: Iran, OK, we are going to relieve \nsanctions on you, but we are going to keep in place sanctions on U.S. \noil producers.\n\n  So what this amendment does is to add a third section to the Corker-\nCardin Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. It would require a \nDOE report on Iranian crude oil and condensate exports. It would then \nlift the de facto ban on U.S. crude oil and condensate exports. It \nstill preserves the emergency authorities of the President to prohibit \nexports if it is warranted. So there is that safety valve there.\n  The deadline for submission of this report to Congress would be 60 \ndays following the enactment of the act. It would still be required \neven if an agreement with Iran were not reached. It would effectively \naddress two issues--the relative ability of U.S. and Iranian oil \nproducers to compete in the global market, which is pretty important \nout there, and the extent to which any agreement with Iran would \nincrease Iranian oil exports through the lifting of sanctions.\n  As we know, American oil producers are generally prohibited from \nexporting overseas. Alaska is the one exception to the oil export ban. \nA very limited amount is exported over the years. Iran, on the other \nhand, currently exports over 1 million barrels per day of oil onto the \nglobal markets.\n  Now, we had a hearing in the energy committee a week or so ago. The \nPresiding Officer was there. We heard from the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration, the EIA. They estimated that lifting the sanctions on \nIran would increase Iranian volume by some 700,000 to 1 million barrels \nper day. So if we lifted that, EIA estimates that Iran would then be in \na situation where they would be able to put out onto the market, \nbasically to new purchasers, 1 million barrels per day.\n  Think about what that does--giving them new markets for their oil. As \nthey have new markets for their oil, they get paid for it. EIA \nestimates that given the price of Brent being where it is in this range \nright now, it would be $25 billion per year to Iran from the ability to \nput that out onto the market and gain new customers--an extra $25 \nbillion.\n  How comfortable are we with that? How much of that $25 billion is \ngoing to fund terrorist organizations, terrorists, in areas that we are \nfighting directly and immediately today? What kind of sense does it \nmake that we would say that we will remove sanctions on Iran, allowing \nthem to move their product to new customers, gain potentially $25 \nbillion additionally into their treasury to do who knows what with it.\n  At the same time, what this does is it harms American producers who \nare unable to compete with Iranian oil due to this outdated ban on U.S. \nexports that was imposed 40 years ago. So we are going to let a 40-\nyear-old policy sanction us, sanction our economy and benefit Iran's. \nLifting the ban on U.S. oil exports would let American oil compete with \nIranian oil. It would reduce Iranian revenue from oil exports. It would \nsend a strong signal to U.S. allies that still depend on Iranian oil \nthat alternative supplies are available and lower global oil prices \nwhich would decrease the price of gasoline and other consumer fuels.\n  A few hours ago, on the other side of the hallway here, over in the \nHouse of Representatives, we heard from the Prime Minister of Japan. \nJapan is currently purchasing and is able to purchase oil from Iran. \nDon't you think that our friend Japan would much rather have security \nand diversity of supply if it were to come from their friend the United \nStates? I sure think so.\n  The amendment that we have introduced lifts the ban by requiring, \nafter 30 days have elapsed from the enactment of S. 615, that crude oil \nexports may be authorized on the same basis that they are currently \nauthorized for petroleum products, whether it is gasoline, diesel, jet \nfuel or whatever it is. Currently, these petroleum products can be \nexported without a license. In fact, we are, here in this country, the \nlargest exporter of petroleum products in the world. So think about \nthis as you kind of shake your head and say: What is going on here? We \nare the largest exporter of refined products, but yet we impose a flat \nban--an outright ban--on the crude itself.\n  So, again, we have a safety valve in the amendment that preserves the\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nPresident's emergency authority, which is derived from the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, the National Emergencies \nAct, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. They prohibit exports, \nunder these various proposals, if needed for the safety and security of \nthe Nation. We do not touch those. We do not impact them in that \namendment at all.\n  So it is important to recognize that what we are doing here is we are \nlooking at an outdated policy that is 40-years old. We are moving into \npresent time and space, where we have a situation with a country that \nwe have tried desperately to bring to the table to be a nation that \nwill work with us rather than against us. Yet part of what we are \nconsidering is an action that would remove sanctions on them and \ncontinue to keep in place sanctions on this country.\n  It makes no sense to me. I would hope that my colleagues would \nconsider it. I know that my colleague from North Dakota has given great \nthought to this, has great understanding about the issue, and also has \ngreat passion about how we ensure that from a national security \nperspective we are covered in all corners.\n  So I would ask my colleague from North Dakota, as she has reviewed an \nantiquated and an outdated policy, and being from a producing State \nsuch as North Dakota, where she is working to advance the opportunities \nnot only for North Dakotans but for people all over this country, how \npeople in North Dakota feel when it is suggested that we are imposing, \neffectively, domestic sanctions on them, while at the same time we \nwould relieve sanctions on Iran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend from \nAlaska for giving me an opportunity to talk about this policy of \nsanctions that is wrong, wrong, wrong on so many levels. When we first \nlooked at it, we need to understand that the embargo, or the limitation \non the exportation of crude oil in this country, is a policy decision \nmade by the President--initially, President Nixon--in response to a \nnumber of producers going around oil price support controls.\n  So this is a 1970's policy. Unfortunately, when we transitioned away \nfrom price supports for crude oil, we never removed this embargo, we \nnever removed this restriction. That was a mistake at that time. It \ncontinues to be a colossal mistake for our growth towards energy \nindependence in this country and our ability to use our energy and our \noil for soft power and to actually provide a consistent and ready \nsupply of crude oil to our allies so they are not beholden, not only to \nIran, but to countries such as Russia.\n  So it is critically important that we examine some of the concerns \nthat people have about lifting the embargo. Obviously, in North Dakota, \nwe do not see any logic, because we are kind of a commonsense State. We \ndo not see any logic behind not allowing crude oil to be exported but \nallowing every refined product that we could produce in this country \naccess to a foreign market.\n  That makes absolutely no sense. If the logic behind this is to try \nand maintain stability and a lower gasoline price, then we should lock \ndown gasoline and we should not export gasoline. The antiquated policy \nthat we are talking about today did not have a lot of logic after we \nderegulated oil. It has even less logic in the dangerous world we live \nin. We know that so many of our foreign enemies rely on oil revenue \nbasically to fund their terrorism activities, to fund their government, \nto supply the necessary government services that keep them in power.\n  We have an opportunity to say to our allies, whether it is Japan or \nin Europe, don't worry about whether someone is going to hold you \nhostage because you will not be able to heat your homes in the winter \nor provide gasoline to your communities and your consumers. Do not \nworry about that because we have your back.\n  But we cannot have their back if we don't have the ability to export \nour crude oil. The bottom line is that on every level, in terms of \nforeign policy, in terms of what we should be in this country--on every \nlevel--a policy of maintaining an embargo, a restriction against \nexports of crude oil makes no common sense--absolutely none.\n  But let's talk about domestic policy because I think some of the \nconcerns that have been expressed to me by my colleagues, and I am sure \nSenator Murkowski's colleagues, have been this: Well, won't this \nincrease gasoline prices? I have to applaud Senator Murkowski because \nvery early on she heard that, and she said: Let's have some real \nintellectual work done. Don't rely on my economics 101. How about we \nactually get economists from Brookings, economists from the Aspen \nInstitute, economists from all over the country, who have come to one \nsingle conclusion, which is, that it will not raise gasoline prices.\n  In fact, the conclusion is quite the opposite--that allowing us \naccess to an international market could, in fact, reduce gasoline \nprices. Why would that be, you wonder? Because of the fluke of how we \nrefine crude oil in this country, most of our refineries are based on \nheavy sour crude. The crude we produce in North Dakota is light sweet \ncrude. We don't have a big refining capacity for light sweet crude, so \nwe have a price reduction in our country.\n  So how are gasoline prices established? They are based on that higher \ncrude oil price, because they are refining crude oil that comes in from \nother places such as Saudi Arabia. They are refining crude oils that \ncome in from Venezuela, and they are charging an appropriate price. \nSome people would say there is a little bit of price creep here as we \nare looking at gasoline prices.\n  The ability to get our crude to market is absolutely critical. Now, \nthere are a lot of people who also think that we should keep a captive \nmarket on a lot of our resources. We have heard this argument in \nnatural gas, and we heard this argument in crude oil. They said: We \nshould have a captive market. I have a constant reply. I say: I have a \nlot of hog farmers who like low corn prices. The solution for low corn \nprices has never been not to export corn.\n  This is the only commodity that is traded on a global price that does \nnot have the ability to find its market. Now, what is the consequence \nof that? I would tell you, to my friend from Alaska, and I think she \nsees this, one of the things I sincerely believe is that the ability to \nproduce oil--our domestic production of oil--had a lot to do with \ndriving Iran to the negotiating table.\n  They saw that we could, in fact, infiltrate the market and take \nmarket share. That is threatening to a lot of the former OPEC countries \nthat are wanting that captive market. If we had access to that market, \nwe would be sending a message. So why don't we do the right thing here? \nWhy don't we understand how this export ban on American crude oil is \nrestricting our ability to use crude oil as an appropriate soft power \nopportunity? Why don't we talk about how actually allowing for the \nexport of crude oil could drive down gasoline prices in the United \nStates of America and continue the energy renaissance?\n  If we cannot find our market, if we cannot find our market in North \nDakota for this production, guess what happens? It either goes into \nstorage or it gets shut in where it is, which is in the field. Hundreds \nof thousands of jobs will be lost. But more importantly, our energy \nsecurity in this country will be jeopardized and harmed.\n  This policy of opening up this restriction is so right on so many \nlevels. I applaud the Senator from Alaska for bringing it forth in this \ncontext. I think it is critical to talk about it in this context. But I \nalso applaud her for all of the work she has done and we have \nsupported, as she has built out the case--the economic case--for why \nthis policy makes no sense at any level.\n  It is wrongheaded. It is time to change it. This is an opportunity. \nWe will not end because it is only fair to every oilfield worker out \nthere, it is only fair to every owner of a royalty or minerals in \nplace, it is fair to every operator, and it is fair to the people of \nthis country to engage in trade, level the playing field, and make sure \nwe are telling our friends and allies that they don't have to buy their \noil from countries that threaten their security every day. We have a \nsupply of oil that can readily be exported and provided to them.\n  I thank my good friend from Alaska for her continued advocacy on \nbehalf of\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nconsumers of this country and her continued advocacy on behalf of an \nenergy-appropriate policy in the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nShe has articulated the case so well not only from a domestic \nperspective but from the international perspective as well. We need to \nappreciate that as we are recognized as a nation, as that superpower \nwhen it comes to our military strength and all those who serve us have \nto offer, that we are also an energy superpower. We have not yet \nembraced that as a responsibility, as an obligation to use that not \nonly to our advantage but to the advantage of our friends and allies \naround the globe. That is an important transition, transformation we \nneed to make.\n  We are mired down in policies that are decades old, based on history \nthat is no longer relevant given the geopolitics of today. We have an \nopportunity to wake up to where we can be, how we can lead from an \ninternational perspective. It can begin with the strength of our energy \nand our energy resources, but we have to believe in our own \npossibilities. Right now, I think we are lagging in that.\n  I appreciate all that my colleague is doing in this effort to help \neducate people. I recognize that it takes a little bit of time to \nrecalibrate the thinking, but we are doing that, and we are doing it \nfor the right reason, based on common sense, based on strength of the \neconomy, and based on national security, which should be our primary \nconsideration right now. We will never have sufficient boots on the \nground or budget for defense to be everywhere many would like to be \naround the globe. What other assets do we have? What else can we \ncontribute? It can begin with our energy resources.\n  So we have great opportunities, and I forward to further discussions \nabout not only what we are proposing in this amendment but how we can \nlead as a nation in the energy sector.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                    FDA Tobacco Deeming Regulations\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to the dangers \nof new and insidious tobacco products that are ensnaring our youth and \nto urge the FDA to take long overdue action to protect our children \nfrom these products.\n  First, I thank the Senators for coming to the floor today to join in \nmaking this critically important point. Senator Boxer is present, and \nshe will be speaking next. Other Senators are planning to join us. So I \nappreciate their lifting their voices on this important issue.\n  Dr. Richard Wender, the chief cancer control officer for the American \nCancer Society, said last year, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary \nof the landmark Surgeon General report on smoking and health, that \n``the single greatest threat to the future control of tobacco is \ncomplacency.''\n  We are here today to call attention to a dangerous complacency that \nthreatens the lives of our children, a complacency in completing rules \nthat are essential to protecting our children from a lifetime of \nnicotine addiction. We are on the floor of the Senate today because \nthis week marks the 1-year anniversary of the Food and Drug \nAdministration's proposed ``deeming regulations'' on tobacco. Deeming \nregulations essentially say the FDA has the power to do what the law \ngave them to do in 2009 when we passed the act. These critical \nregulations have yet to be finalized, and it appears that there are not \ngoing to be finalized regulations this month or next or the month after \ndespite the fact that we are now 6 years into this rulemaking \nregulation process.\n  Six years is a very long time. In 6 years, a lot of young Americans \nhave become addicted to nicotine products. In 6 years, the industry has \nmade huge strides in inventing new products designed to attract our \nchildren. In 6 years, a lot could have been done, and nothing has been \ndone.\n  These critical regulations have not been completed, and it is time \nfor the FDA and the administration to make getting this done a \npriority. This is one of the things that can truly impact the health of \nthe next generation.\n  The tobacco industry is, as Judge Kessler said in United States v. \nPhilip Morris, ``an industry . . . that survives, and profits, from \nselling a highly addictive product which causes diseases that lead to a \nstaggering number of deaths per year, an immeasurable amount of human \nsuffering and economic loss, and a profound burden on our national \nhealth care system.''\n  That is why, when it comes to tobacco and public health, the best way \nto save lives 20 or 30 or 40 years down the line is to prevent young \nAmericans from becoming addicted to tobacco products today. But Big \nTobacco knows this as well. They know that the best way to create a \nlifelong, reliable customer for their deadly product is to get our \nchildren hooked as young as possible. Now the industry refers to our \nchildren as ``replacement smokers'' to replace those who are dying. \nThat is why they are working day and night to come up with new \nstrategies and new products to keep kids in the pipeline, to keep new \nreplacement smokers coming forward. They use cigars, cigarillos, \ntobacco candy, and snus.\n  Now they have the real winner--e-cigarettes. These products, such as \nflavored cigars, cost as little as 99 cents and are sold in colorful or \ncool packaging and come in flavors such as bubble gum, cotton candy, \nwild cherry, grape, candy apple, blueberry, chocolate, peach, and gummy \nbear e-cigarettes. Many of these products are cheaper and more \naccessible than cigarettes, and the candy-flavored versions are \npreferred overwhelmingly by young people.\n  This is a chart which shows the bottles of liquid nicotine that fuel \nthese e-cigarettes. We have everything here from cotton candy to \ncoffee. You name it, it is there. These are not flavors designed to \nappeal to adults; this is all about forming addiction in our children.\n  A new study released by the CDC this month found, alarmingly, that e-\ncigarette use had tripled among middle and high school students in just \n1 year. In 2011, 1.5 percent; it doubled in the course of a year to 2.8 \npercent. It increased substantially in the year 2012 and 2013, and then \nwe see it soared. E-cigarettes and vape shops have exploded across the \ncounty, and that has profound consequences for our children. Nearly one \nin seven high school students has used an e-cigarette in the last 30 \nyears. That is 2 million teenagers nationwide, 2 million of our \nchildren responding to this very deliberate targeting by this demonic \nindustry.\n  We have the power to do something about this. The FDA has power to do \nsomething about this because we, the legislature, gave it to them in \n2009.\n  It is true that the long-term health effects of smoking e-cigarettes \nare yet to be fully calculated because it is a newer product, but there \nare some troubling studies we should pay attention to. What we know \ntoday is that nicotine is highly poisonous and that this vast, \nunregulated market of nicotine liquids threatens public health \nimmediately.\n  Since 2011, poison calls related to e-cigarettes have skyrocketed--\n271 in 2011 to 3,808 poison calls in 2014, again showing the exploding \nuse of this product. This industry doesn't even put this liquid \nnicotine into childproof containers. One brand called JJuice looks like \nlittle bottles of juice. It says ``juice'' on it. Yet, it is deadly if \na child takes off that cap and drinks it. There were 14 times more \npoisonings in 2014 than in 2011, and yes, people die. A toddler died of \nnicotine poisoning just last December, and there were lots of close \ncalls.\n  But tobacco companies see opportunities in these unregulated markets. \nThey see opportunities to appeal to kids directly, market to kids more \neasily, and to sell to kids with fewer barriers.\n  There is no Federal law in place about the age at which children can \nbuy e-cigarettes or the liquids that go into them. So it has been up to \nlocal communities to try to fill in those gaps, and they have been \ntrying to do so, trying to catch up with the problem. The industry of \ne-cigarettes has exploited these opportunities.\n  This is where we are. Time is ticking. E-cigarette use is rising. And \nthe rising numbers on this chart aren't just numbers, they represent \nour children, kids who every day, when we don't act, are\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nmore at risk for a lifetime of dangerous addiction. This is 100 percent \nunequivocally unacceptable.\n  So to the FDA, to Health and Human Services, and to the Obama \nadministration, it is time to quit stalling. Children are getting \naddicted, children are dying, and children will die more from nicotine \ndiseases in the decades ahead. It is unacceptable.\n  No more complacency. Let's get it done, have it be the top item you \nwake up to fix every day. We expect more. I urge the administration to \nact quickly. Let's get these rules done.\n  It is a pleasure to yield the floor to my colleague from California, \nwho has been a tremendous champion on this topic and will provide her \ninsights. I am so delighted that she is on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Merkley for his \nleadership.\n  This is an issue which is not getting the attention it should be \ngetting, and we hope today, with the series of speeches we will start \nto make now, to wake up America to this threat.\n  I have a bill that would ban the advertising of these cigarettes to \nchildren. Senator Merkley showed you and told you the names. Let's take \na look at that again. Can anyone really tell you with a straight face \nthat these marketers are not going after children? Cotton candy, gummy \nbear, and popsicle--those are the flavors. I mean, we really were not \nborn yesterday. This is what they are doing.\n  This is a moment for us--parents, grandparents, loving aunts and \nuncles--to stand up and say no to this. There are ways to do it.\n  Before I get into those ways, I thank Senators Corker and Cardin for \ntheir extraordinary leadership on the underlying bill in Iran that is \non the floor. I express my thanks to the entire committee, both sides \nof the aisle of the Foreign Relations Committee. I have been on that \ncommittee the longest of anyone else, and this was a tough time. \nEveryone had a different position, and everyone was in a corner. We all \ncame together, and we crafted a delicate compromise that essentially \nallows the Senate and the House to vote on whatever agreement may \nemerge. I say ``may.'' We don't know if there will be one from the \nadministration on Iran's nuclear weapons. We know that if we go down \nthe path of poison pill amendments, this whole thing could be lost.\n  I will close this little part and get right to the e-cigarettes with \nthis.\n  I was listening to Senator Rubio, whom I work with on the committee, \nand I love to work with him on issues where we find agreement, but he \ngot up here and he said: All I want is a vote on my amendment, and we \nall know his amendment will derail this very delicately balanced \nagreement. He said: All I am asking for is a vote. And he said very \neloquently: If you don't want to vote, don't be a Senator. And I \nthought: You are right about that. Then I checked his voting record and \nhe stopped us voting on nominees 18 times in December alone.\n  So I say to my friends: Don't come down here and preach to us about \nthe fact that we are trying to keep poison pills off this for the good \nof the world, to stop a war; OK? And don't tell us we are stopping you, \nwhen you stopped a lot of us 18 times in December alone and once on \nLoretta Lynch--once on the new Attorney General. I had to say that.\n  Mr. President, when I turn on the television, I don't know if it is \n2015 or 1950. Tobacco companies are preying again on our youth. Just as \nwe should be celebrating the decline of youth cigarette smoking rates, \na new product is taking our high schools and middle schools by storm \nand they are called e-cigarettes.\n  As Senator Merkley so well explained, we are seeing a startling \nincrease in the use of these cigarettes by our teens, with 2.5 million \nteens using them--2.5 million teens. If we do nothing, the CDC says \nthat every year another 1\\1/2\\ million kids are going to be using e-\ncigarettes.\n  Now, what are they exposed to? Let us be clear, nicotine. We know \nnicotine is very dangerous to adolescent brain development. Let me say \nthat again. Nicotine is very dangerous to adolescent brain development. \nIn addition to nicotine, e-cigarettes have--and I hope young people are \nlistening, including the ones right here--potentially dangerous \nchemicals, and chemicals we already know are dangerous, such as \nbenzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, propylene glycol, and they also have \nnanoparticles that are present in traditional cigarettes--this all \naccording to my health department in California.\n  Now, we already saw how these children are lured. They are lured by \nthe cigarette companies. And by the way, the big cigarette companies--\nand I will finish in 1 minute and this is critical--have bought up the \ne-cigarette companies. I wrote to the executives and I said: Please, \nfor the good of your children and my children and my grandchildren, \ndon't advertise on television.\n  If you ever saw these ads on TV, Senator Merkley, and Mr. President, \nyou would just think that e-cigarettes were curing all the illnesses of \nthe world. Well, they are not. They are not, and the studies that are \nalready coming out are quite alarming. Sales to minors should be \nbanned, and 42 of our States have done so, but it is not nationwide. \nOnline sales should be banned. Companies should not be advertising.\n  We have a potential crisis on our hands, and I will be working with \nSenator Merkley, Senator Blumenthal, and all of my colleagues because \nwe were not born yesterday. We have seen this movie before and we want \nour kids to be healthy. The FDA can take a stand by finalizing the \nproposed regulation today. Too many lives have been endangered while we \nstand here waiting.\n  Last month, more than 5,000 of my constituents signed a petition \nurging FDA to regulate e-cigarettes. Some of them told me why they were \nconcerned, and I would like to share the words of Californian parents \nand teachers.\n  Susan from Long Beach wrote:\n\n       I am a 7th grade health teacher and it is clear that \n     students think ``vaping'' is okay and a healthy alternative \n     to smoking. Shops selling e-cigarettes have popped up in all \n     the stores around their neighborhoods advertising their \n     products. A clear message needs to be sent that e-cigarettes \n     are not for children under the age of 18.\n\n  Judith from Fairfield wrote:\n\n       I teach high school, and too many students are using e-\n     cigarettes, thinking they are safer than regular cigarettes. \n     In the meantime, they are getting addicted to nicotine, and \n     putting them at risk for a lifetime of impacts to their \n     health.\n\n  Sondra from Corona wrote:\n\n       I have worked in our local high schools for almost 15 \n     years. The e-cigarettes definitely need to be regulated for \n     people under 18. I am consistently told by students that \n     ``these are better'' than traditional cigarettes. They don't \n     realize the harm and the addictive qualities are still \n     present.\n\n  Bob from Cathedral City wrote:\n\n       We need to know what health and/or safety dangers are \n     associated with e-cigarettes.\n\n  And finally Julie from Huntington Beach wrote:\n\n       My 14-year-old son was offered an e-cig. They are too easy \n     for children to get.\n\n  My constituents deserve Federal oversight of e-cigarettes. To protect \nthe public health and our children, I join my colleagues and urge the \nAdministration to finalize the pending regulation. I also call upon \nCongress to advance legislation that protects consumers from the health \nconsequences of e-cigarettes. The data does not lie. We cannot wait \nanother day.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher kindness and my apologies for all the talking in the background.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we should be doing everything we can to \nensure that our children are safe from products that harm their health. \nThanks to life-saving public health interventions, and FDA regulation \nunder the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, we have \nseen reduced smoking rates among young people across the country. But, \nunfortunately, in recent years tobacco companies have found new ways to \ntarget children, through the promotion of e-cigarettes and other \nunregulated tobacco products.\n  Last year, the FDA took an important initial step toward regulating \nthese products with its proposed tobacco deeming rule. But, we are here \ntoday, a full year later, without a finalized rule to help ensure \ntobacco companies aren't profiting off of selling our children an \naddictive, hugely harmful bill of goods.\n  Today, tobacco companies are marketing e-cigarettes with celebrity \nendorsements and cartoons that are\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\ngeared toward a younger audience--using tactics that they are banned \nfrom using to promote traditional cigarettes. They are producing kid-\nenticing candy and drink flavored products, which we know children are \nmore likely to use. In fact, because they are unregulated, children can \ngo online and buy them without their parents knowing.\n  Mr. President, it is unacceptable that e-cigarette companies are \nusing the same tactics that tobacco companies used for years to promote \nsmoking. So we should be doing everything we can to right this wrong, \nand prevent our youngest generation from becoming a new generation of \nsmokers.\n  We know just how harmful and addictive these products can be and I am \nproud my home State of Washington has begun to regulate these products \nand is taking strong steps towards combatting their use among children.\n  But, there is still much more work to do to across the country to \nkeep e-cigarettes and other unregulated tobacco products out of the \nhands of our kids, and that work starts with making sure the FDA \nfinalizes its deeming rule.\n  So I stand with all of my colleagues today to urge the FDA to move \nquickly to finalize and implement last year's proposed rule, and put in \nplace restrictions that would:\n  Prevent marketing targeted to minors,\n  Eliminate the sale of flavored e-cigarettes that appeal to children,\n  And end online sales.\n  These would be strong steps to further protect our children and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues, and the FDA to ensure they \nare implemented as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am glad to join with several of my \ncolleagues to talk about electronic cigarettes and the Food and Drug \nAdministration's, FDA, role in regulating these products.\n  Over the last year, e-cigarette use among high school students has \ntripled from 4.5 percent to 13.4 percent, according to recent CDC data. \nIn fact, research from the University of Michigan's annual Monitoring \nthe Future survey shows that in 2014 more teenagers reported using e-\ncigarettes than traditional tobacco products. One year ago, the FDA \ntook an important initial step by proposing to regulate e-cigarettes, \nbut more must be done to strengthen this rule and ensure that the same \npractices used by Big Tobacco for years to promote smoking are not used \nby e-cigarette companies to create a new generation of smokers.\n  I am pleased that the FDA has proposed prohibiting e-cigarette sales \nto minors, as well as prohibiting vending machine sales and free \nsamples, to prevent sales and use by minors. Further, the proposed FDA \nrule requires e-cigarette manufacturers to list product ingredients and \nfor tobacco products containing nicotine to carry an addiction warning \nlabel. While I commend FDA on proposing these important steps, the rule \nmust be improved to address the marketing of these products to children \nand e-cigarette flavorings and be finalized as soon as possible. \nIndeed, I sent a letter last week with nine of my colleagues--many of \nwhom are also speaking about e-cigarettes today--urging the FDA to \nstrengthen and finalize this rule.\n  E-cigarette companies are taking a page out of the Big Tobacco \nplaybook, using celebrity endorsements of their products, cartoons, and \nadvertising in magazines with youth readership and at music festivals \nand sports events targeted at children. According to a 2014 study in \nthe journal Pediatrics, exposure to e-cigarette marketing by children \naged 12 to 17 increased by 256 percent between 2011 and 2013, exposing \n24 million children to e-cigarette advertisements. In this context, it \nis unsurprising that youth use of e-cigarettes has skyrocketed during \nthe same timeframe. It is well known that tobacco advertising \ninfluences consumer behavior, especially that of children, so it is my \nhope that the final e-cigarette deeming rule will address this issue.\n  As for the use of candy, soft drink, fruit, and other flavors in e-\ncigarettes, the FDA itself acknowledged in the proposed rule that \nchildren are the most likely to be attracted by and use these flavored \ntobacco products. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act \nprohibits these kinds of flavorings from being used in traditional \ncigarettes and that same scrutiny should be applied to e-cigarettes and \nrefill liquids so that children are not attracted to these products.\n  We have come a long way since I proposed legislation in the late \n1990s to deny tobacco companies tax deductions for advertising to \nchildren. I was an original cosponsor of the Family Smoking Prevention \nand Tobacco Control Act, which became law in 2009 and incorporated the \ngoals of my bill to keep the tobacco industry from targeting children \nas new customers. This law provides the FDA with the explicit authority \nto protect the public from deceptive cigarette advertisements, prevents \nthe targeting of minors, and removes certain harmful ingredients from \ncigarettes.\n  This was an important effort. But we must be ever vigilant and \ncontinue to address new tobacco-related concerns as they arise, such as \ne-cigarettes. Until the deeming rule is finalized, e-cigarettes will \ncontinue to operate completely unregulated, with an increasing number \nof children taking up this addictive habit every day. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues on the issue and I join them in \nstrongly urging the FDA to strengthen and finalize the e-cigarette \ndeeming rule quickly so that the agency can begin regulating these \ntobacco products.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5:25 p.m. \ntoday be equally divided in the usual form and that it be in order to \ncall up the following amendment: Barrasso No. 1147; further, I ask that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the \namendment; that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the \namendment and that there be a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1147 to Amendment No. 1140\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Barrasso, I call up \namendment No. 1147.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker], for Mr. Barrasso, \n     for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Risch, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Gardner, \n     Mr. Toomey, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Lee, Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Sasse, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1147 to amendment No. 1140.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a certification that Iran has not directly \nsupported or carried out an act of terrorism against the United States \n            or a United States person anywhere in the world)\n\n       On page 17, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(v) Iran has not directly supported or carried out an act \n     of terrorism against the United States or a United States \n     person anywhere in the world; and\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the hard work \ndone by Senator Corker and Senator Cardin and their efforts on getting \nthis bill to the floor in a bipartisan way through the committee and \nbringing it up for a vote.\n  The amendment I am bringing today is something that was in the \nbipartisan agreed-upon bill that was introduced in the first place, \nwith nine Democratic cosponsors. Then, this specific component, dealing \nwith terrorism and the certification of terrorism, was removed in the \nmanagers' package as it went to committee. So I think it is important \nand there is bipartisan support for what I am doing. This amendment \nbasically restores--restores--the terrorism certification that was in \nthe original bipartisan Senate bill.\n  Every 90 days, the President will be required under this amendment to \ncertify to Congress that Iran has not directly supported or carried out \nan act of terrorism against the United States or against an American \ncitizen anywhere in the world. If there is evidence of terrorist \nactivity by Iran against us, then Congress will have a more streamlined \nprocess to address it.\n  Right now there a number of different reports that have to be made to \nCongress as a result of this bipartisan legislation. This was the only \none that\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nwas removed in the managers' package. I think it is very important the \nAmerican people get regular certifications from the President on this \nimportant point. Congress and the American people need to know if Iran \nis directly supporting acts of terrorism against our country and our \npeople. If they are, I believe Congress must have an opportunity to \nrespond quickly.\n  There actually have been some changes in the legislation to require \nsome additional reporting components with relation to terrorism. I \nagree it is an improvement, but reports to Congress with information \nand evidence of Iran's terrorist activities are critically important, \nand I think it is even more critical for the President of the United \nStates to acknowledge Iran's actions and for Congress to be able to \nhave the opportunity to respond quickly. That is why I believe this \namendment is so important.\n  Congress can always do more to ensure the safety and security of our \ncitizens, but we must make it clear to Iran that Congress will be able \nto respond immediately to terrorist actions against us. I am restoring \nthis opportunity with my amendment and recommending an ``aye'' vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Barrasso for \nthe way he has worked with our committee, the way he has worked with us \non the floor to get this amendment pending. We had a chance to debate \nthis amendment yesterday, and today we have debated it. So I think the \nissue has been well debated.\n  I certainly agree with the intent of the sponsor of the amendment. As \na result of his work in our committee, we have strengthened the \nreporting requirements on Iran's terrorist activities, which I have \nread into the Record before. It is very strong, and it has been \nstrengthened as a result of the managers' amendment that Senator Corker \nand I worked on.\n  We also have an assessment on Iran's human rights violations. We make \nit clear that nothing in an agreement would affect the sanctions \nimposed against Iran for its terrorist activities, its ballistic \nmissiles or its human rights violations. So all those tools are \navailable to us.\n  I object to this amendment because it affects the underlying bill \nitself. It jeopardizes the bill because it requires the President to \nmake a certification that, in fact, he will probably not be able to \nmake. Therefore, it not only jeopardizes the bill, it jeopardizes the \nability to have a negotiated agreement and it weakens our position \ninternationally and makes it less likely we can get Iran to give up its \nnuclear weapons program.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \namendment. We have already covered this in the notice requirements that \nhave been provided in S. 615. It is an issue we all care about. This \namendment, though well intended, would not advance it, and I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  I yield back all of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, as we discuss the Iran nuclear agreement \nand the President's administration is attempting to negotiate the \nagreement, I come to the floor of the Senate to remind Coloradans, and \nindeed Americans, about some of the activities that have taken place in \nour relationship with Iran over the past several decades.\n  Following the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the ruling mullahs held 52 \nAmerican diplomats hostage for 444 days, releasing them only on January \n20, 1981, the day that President Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. \nTwo years later, on April 18, 1983, a truck ladened with explosives \nrammed into the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 17 Americans. \nOn October 23, 1983, there was a similar attack on the U.S. Marine \nbarracks in Beirut which killed 241 American servicemen. \nOverwhelmingly, the evidence led to Iran and its wholly owned \nsubsidiary Hezbollah as the perpetrator of these attacks.\n  Several weeks ago, we had the opportunity to visit with Prime \nMinister Netanyahu in Israel to discuss the negotiations that were \ntaking place and the details of the negotiations. Those details have \nemerged in a couple of pages of documents which were released by the \nWhite House. But they are still lacking in great detail and in the \nspecifics of the framework.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu described the negotiations to be a dance of \nporcupines in the Middle East. There is concern about the negotiations \nand where they would lead. Indeed, the Prime Minister made the comment \nthat Iran is now putting its finger on the jugular of the world. Over \nthe past 24 to 48 hours, we have indeed seen that happen in the Strait \nof Hormuz and with the boarding by Iran of a cargo ship that falls \nunder the protective umbrella of the United States of America.\n  So we continue to see an Iranian regime that has not changed in more \nthan 30 years. It has not changed in the last 48 hours. They have \ntargeted and killed Americans during the Iraq war, supported Shiite \nmilitias, and supplied deadly explosives that have been used to kill \nand target our troops. Iran continues to prop up the murderous Assad \nregime in Syria. They regularly threaten to wipe Israel off the map and \nabuse the human rights of their own people. They have imprisoned \nAmericans, reporters, and refused to release them.\n  There is no doubt that we must avoid a nuclear Iran and do everything \nin our power to make sure that Iran doesn't possess a nuclear \ninfrastructure. But the questions that we have today lead more and more \nto a conclusion that they will continue to maintain a nuclear \ninfrastructure.\n  Secretary Schultz and Secretary Kissinger made it very clear in an \nop-ed they wrote for the Wall Street Journal several weeks ago. We have \nentered this negotiation and somehow siloed off or bifurcated the issue \nof political restraint with nuclear restraint. We have somehow decided \nwe will have tunnelvision on one issue without acknowledging, admitting \nor negotiating the other acts of violence, death, and destruction that \nthe Iran regime has pursued for not just 30 years ago, not just 15 \nyears ago, and there is also what is happening around the world and in \nthe Middle East today.\n  I hope we can emerge from these negotiations with a strong deal, a \ndeal that allows us the inspection of military bases without question \nupon demand, and with the fact that we will remove their nuclear \ninfrastructure, that we can assure that they are no longer a regime \nthat is leading state-\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\nsponsored efforts to wipe Israel off the map, and that we can indeed \nprotect Americans from the reign of terror that has been a state-\nsponsored effort.\n  There is nothing less that we should ask of this administration or \nany administration. We need to protect the American people. At the \nnegotiating table--when we sit 2 or 3 feet across from the people with \nwhom we are negotiating--we cannot ignore what is happening through \nstate-sponsored terrorism. We cannot ignore the cargo ships in the \nStrait of Hormuz that have been stormed. We cannot ignore what has \nhappened in Yemen or Hezbollah. We cannot ignore the reality that we \nface today of an Iran that has not changed in 30 years.\n  The fact is our sanctions have worked, and the fact is that increased \nsanctions could work as well. I hope before this negotiation is signed \noff and agreed to, they will realize who is making the negotiations \nhappen and possible and that more needs to be done to protect Americans \nand protect the world from an Iran that simply doesn't have a dangerous \nthreat posed to us from nuclear weapons but which poses the danger \nthrough state-sponsored terrorism which they continue to pursue today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2513-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GARDNER.

DOWNING\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the exceptional \nservice and the extraordinary life of Rockingham County High Sheriff \nMichael ``Mike'' W. Downing of Salem, NH, who passed away recently \nfollowing his battle with cancer.\n  Sheriff Downing was a knowledgeable, respected and compassionate \npublic safety professional, a problem solver, and a concerned community \nmember. He was one of a kind, and was beloved by everyone who knew him.\n  Raised in Salem, Mike attended Saint Joseph's School and graduated \nfrom Salem High School in 1972. He went on to serve our Nation as a \nmember of the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division, after which Mike began \nwhat would be a long career of service to the State of New Hampshire, \nfirst as a N.H. State trooper after graduating from the 47th New \nHampshire Police Academy. He continued his career in law enforcement \nservice, joining the Salem Police Department where he rose to the rank \nof detective sergeant. Mike was a graduate of the Command Training \nInstitute at Babson College, and earned an associate's degree from \nSouthern New Hampshire University and a bachelor's degree from Franklin \nPierce College.\n  After his retirement from the Salem Police Department, Mike continued \nhis public service through his work in the State legislature. He served \nthree terms as a State representative and then served two terms as a \nState senator, where he held the position of senate minority leader. In \n2010, Mike returned to his law enforcement roots and was elected the \nHigh Sheriff of Rockingham County. Downing was serving in his third \nterm as sheriff at the time of his passing.\n  In addition to his professional and elected service to the State of \nNew Hampshire, Mike was very active in his local community. He gave \ngenerously of his time and energy as the 301st captain commanding of \nthe Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, an ASA \nSalem softball coach, a NH Little League coach, a member of the Knights \nof Columbus, trustee of Amvets Post 2, a past president and board \nmember of Salem Haven Nursing Home and Silverthorne Adult Daycare, a \nmember of the Rockingham County Law Enforcement Association, Rockingham \nCounty Chiefs of Police Association, International Chiefs of Police \nAssociation, the National Sheriffs' Association, the NH Sheriffs' \nAssociation and a founding board member of Isaiah 58, a nonprofit \norganization focused on helping the homeless population of Rockingham \nCounty.\n  Most recently, he was honored as the 2015 recipient of the Chief John \nP. Ganley Community Service Award which is presented to an individual \n``who has exhibited concern, involvement and leadership in the \ncommunity of Salem; while providing inspiration to others, through his \nor her dedication, integrity and courage in the manner exemplified by \nChief John P. Ganley during his life on earth.''\n  Sheriff Downing leaves behind the love of his life, his wife Heidi \nDowning and their five children, Jennifer, Jessica, Kaitlin, Kelsey, \nand Michael along with six grandchildren, Charlotte, Bella, Jacob, \nLogan, TJ, and Max. He also leaves his parents, Delbert and Teresa \nDowning. We are all deeply saddened by the loss of our friend Mike, an \nextraordinary man and proud New Hampshire son who served our State and \nNation with honor, courage, and dedication. He represented the very \nbest of our State, and I ask my colleagues to join me in sending Heidi \nand her family our deepest condolences and our gratitude for Mike's \nlife of service to the people of New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSanders and I be permitted to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2513-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2513-S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week marked an important step as we \nworked in a bipartisan manner to improve the lives of survivors of \ntrafficking. We were able to move the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act forward and help provide direct supports and services \nfor these survivors, thanks to support from the Community Health Center \nFund.\n  Community health centers are the safety net providers of our health \ncare system. In my home State of Washington, they provide full health \ncare services for working families across the State, and they work \ntirelessly to ensure that individuals get the supports and services \nthey need. Community health centers help keep health care costs down \nand keep people out of the emergency room by improving health outcomes \nfor the populations they serve.\n  Our community health centers were strengthened by the work in the \nAffordable Care Act, and I am proud that we were able to once again \nwork together to strengthen them as part of the Medicare and CHIP \nReauthorization Act earlier this year.\n  This was a very unique circumstance, and it is not a precedent for \nCongress to draw on the Community Health Center Fund for other \npurposes. It is my hope and intention that this was the one and only \ntime Congress draws money from the health center fund to pay for other \nprograms. This funding was intended to keep the health centers program \nwhole so that more than 1,300 health centers nationwide can continue to \nprovide access to care for their patients for the next 2 years.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as you know, I have worked for many years \nto ensure all Americans have access to primary care. Community health \ncenters are instrumental in providing that access to primary medical, \noral, and mental health care. Right now, community health centers \nprovide primary care to 24 million patients in 9,000 underserved \ncommunities in every State and territory across the country.\n  Until last month, health centers were facing a 70-percent reduction \nin funding this fall due to the expiration of the Community Health \nCenter Fund. On an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, I was very pleased \nthat Congress was able to extend the health center fund in the Medicare \nand CHIP Reauthorization Act bill for 2 years to avert this massive cut \nto the program.\n  Although I supported legislation to provide funds for victims of \ntrafficking, taking money recently allocated to community health \ncenters in the SGR bill to pay for health care services for victims of \ntrafficking was not a good solution. Both of these programs serve \nimportant populations with significant health care needs, and I \nunderstand from those who negotiated this agreement that the funding \ntransfer was a special circumstance as a way to move forward on this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\n  It is my hope and understanding from the bill sponsors that this was \nthe one and only time Congress draws money from the Health Center Fund \nto pay for other programs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am proud of the progress we have been able to make for \nsurvivors of trafficking and that we were able to use community health \ncenters funding to help this very vulnerable population at a time when \nthey need it the most.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Casey \nand I be permitted to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this year, Senator Casey and I had \nthe honor of serving as the cochairs of the National Prayer Breakfast. \nThe annual event is a longtime tradition that celebrates the importance \nof faith and fellowship in our lives. This year's breakfast featured \nmoving prayers, songs, and speeches from a number of notable guests, \nincluding race car legend Darrell Waltrip.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, Senator Wicker and I would like to thank \nall of the individuals who were involved in making the 2015 National \nPrayer Breakfast a great success. Thousands of people from across the \ncountry and world participated, including President Obama and His \nHoliness the Dalai Lama.\n  On behalf of Senator Wicker and myself, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full transcript be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n63rd National Prayer Breakfast, Thursday, February 5, 2015, Washington, \n  DC, Co-Chairs: Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr., Senator Roger F. Wicker\n\n       The Honorable Roger F. Wicker: Good morning, everyone. I am \n     Senator Roger Wicker from Mississippi, and together with my \n     colleague, Senator Bob Casey from the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania, we welcome you to the 63rd Annual National \n     Prayer Breakfast.\n       It is an honor to serve with Bob as co-chairman this year, \n     and we thank you for joining us this morning. Each year this \n     event is one of the most special and memorable in Washington. \n     Today, some 3,500 of us have gathered in this ballroom and in \n     auxiliary rooms down the hall. We represent all 50 states and \n     130 nations. As the Psalm says, ``Oh, let the nations be glad \n     and sing for joy, for Thou shall judge the people righteously \n     and govern the nations of the earth. Let the people praise \n     Thee, oh God. Let all the people praise Thee.'' So, for the \n     130 nations represented in this room today--be glad, be \n     joyful, and praise God.\n       Since 1953, the National Prayer Breakfast has exemplified \n     and celebrated the power of prayer and fellowship in our \n     lives. We come together as Ephesians 5:19 directs us, \n     ``Addressing one another in Psalms and hymns, and spiritual \n     songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your \n     heart.''\n       We have a truly remarkable program with guests and \n     performers this morning. Like our weekly prayer breakfasts in \n     the Senate and the House, we will have Scripture, prayers, \n     songs, and speakers sharing their stories and reflections. \n     Our hope is that you leave today with new blessings and \n     perspectives about the strong community of faith in this \n     country and around the world.\n       The Honorable Robert P. Casey, Jr.: My name is Bob Casey \n     and I'm honored to be here this morning with my co-chair, \n     Roger Wicker, my friend who has labored with us these two \n     years. Roger, we're grateful for your work.\n       In just a few minutes we'll have the opportunity to give a \n     warm welcome to the President and the First Lady when they \n     arrive. And in the meantime, we hope you are enjoying your \n     breakfast and getting to know those at your table, if you \n     don't know them already. We're honored you're with us.\n       And now to lead us in our first prayer, I'm happy to \n     welcome Rabbi Gregory Marx to the podium. For more than \n     twenty-five years, Rabbi Marx has been the spiritual leader \n     of Congregation Beth Or in Maple Glen, Montgomery County, \n     Pennsylvania. We are grateful that he is with us today. And \n     he will do our prayer and then we'll have a break, and then \n     we'll go to the second part of the program. Rabbi Marx.\n       Rabbi Gregory S. Marx: Thank you, Senator. Good morning.\n       The Biblical prophet, Micah proclaimed: It has been told \n     you what is good, and what the Lord requires of you, only to \n     do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God. \n     Justice without mercy leads to harsh judgment. Mercy without \n     justice creates a world where there's no accountability, no \n     moral goodness. At this moment, may God bless us with both \n     mercy and justice so that we may tenderly care for those in \n     need of compassion and rejoice in the good of others. We \n     celebrate this morning our uniqueness as well as our \n     commonality. We come from our different faith perspectives, \n     yet are united in a fervent desire to strengthen the hands \n     and the hearts of those who seek to build an enduring \n     society, which tolerates neither bigotry nor hatred. Master \n     of the universe, inspire us to release those reservoirs of \n     spirit and mind which make us truly partners with you. Grant \n     us patience and hopefulness in our daily tasks. May we never \n     give in to despair, despite their enormity. Give us love for \n     truth above cleverness, for people above things, for God \n     above all else. Remind us in the immortal words of Abraham \n     Lincoln, that religious devotion is not about having God on \n     our side, which mistakenly prompts us to condemn the faith of \n     others, but rather it is about being on God's side, which \n     requires devotion to civic duty, tolerance, humility, \n     justice, mercy, and peace. Be with us, oh God, as we seek to \n     establish new ties of friendship across religious, racial, \n     and ethnic boundaries, to create innovative opportunities of \n     service, to rejoice in the growth of all of our children. And \n     to lovingly and faithfully support our fellow men and women \n     who are in need of God's care and affection. May God bless \n     our beloved and noble country and those who defend her, so \n     that each may one day sit under their own vine and fig tree \n     and none shall be afraid. Give us, oh God, the good sense and \n     understanding to buttress the moral fiber of American life, \n     that we may gird ourselves with integrity, and to \n     successfully meet the immense challenges before us. Keep us, \n     oh God, from pride which prevents us from seeing the need for \n     real change and steel us with a commitment to stay the course \n     when necessary. Most of all, oh God, shield us from impatient \n     judgment towards those who differ from us. May we always \n     remember that you are exalted, oh God whenever and wherever \n     men and women work together to fulfill Micah's prophetic \n     vision of justice, mercy, humility. And let us say, Amen.\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you Rabbi Marx. At this point, \n     continue enjoying your breakfast and the conversation with \n     our table guests. The President and his party will be here in \n     a few moments.\n       [Applause]\n       Senator Casey: May everyone have a seat. Thanks very much \n     everyone. We're honored that the President and the First Lady \n     are with us. As Senator Wicker and I said earlier, we're \n     honored you're with us this morning, and we're grateful for \n     the folks who helped put this breakfast together every year.\n       I'm honored to share with everyone in this audience an \n     excerpt from a message from Rome, by Pope Francis. This \n     message is to all of us gathered here at this National Prayer \n     Breakfast, and he writes in part, and I quote:\n       ``Dear Friends, I send prayerful good wishes for you, for \n     the fruitfulness of your work. I ask you to pray for me, and \n     to join me in praying for our brothers and our sisters \n     throughout the world who experience persecution and death for \n     their faith. Upon you, your families, and those whom you \n     serve, I cordially invoke God's blessings of wisdom, joy, and \n     peace.''\n       We're honored that the Holy Father would send us that \n     message. The entirety of the message will be read at today's \n     luncheon. While Pope Francis couldn't be with us today in \n     person, His Excellency the Papal Nuncio, the Holy Father's \n     representative in the United States is here today and we're \n     honored by his presence.\n       All of us, as well have the extraordinary privilege today \n     to be joined at this breakfast by another inspirational \n     spiritual leader and peacemaker, His Holiness the Dalai Lama. \n     We're honored by his presence. [Applause]\n       When I was in state government in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, \n     I worked in the finance building, and right over the building \n     in the front of the building, was an inscription that I think \n     is a good summation of what it means to be in public service. \n     And I'm quoting from that precept inscribed on the building--\n     here's what it says: ``All public service is a trust given in \n     faith and accepted in honor.'' Senator Wicker and I, and \n     those who are in the room who are elected officials, have \n     accepted that honor to serve. We also feel privileged. I know \n     this is true of Roger, and me, and so many others, but we're \n     privileged to do our work in the Senate, but the excessive \n     partisanship and politics that occurs in this town too often \n     gets in the way and divides the Senate. That's why the weekly \n     prayer breakfast on Wednesdays, on every Wednesday that the \n     Senate is in session, is a way for us to have an oasis from \n     the politics of the place. We gather at that breakfast for \n     prayer and to share some time with each other every Wednesday \n     morning--just as we're doing this morning with people from so \n     many different states, different countries, backgrounds, \n     faiths, and beliefs. We're reminded this morning of the \n     journey, the journey of faith that we're all on, and we \n     believe that faith is a gift, and a gift that we're blessed \n     by today and express gratitude. Senator Wicker. [Applause]\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you, Bob. The Senate prayer breakfast \n     dates back to World War II when a group of legislators met in \n     the Senate restaurant. We can only imagine the conversations \n     that took place during those early days as the deadliest \n     conflict in human history swept the globe. Then as now, the \n     weekly meetings which occur when the Senate is in session \n     have remained largely low profile. In January of 1943, an \n     article from\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\n     the Washington Post describes them as without fanfare, front-\n     page publicity or ballyhoo, and that is still true. In many \n     ways our prayer breakfast is a welcome sanctuary from the \n     politics and the partisanship we hear about. Each week we \n     sing a hymn, we hear prayer requests that we call the ``sick \n     and wounded report.'' We actually join hands and we pray \n     together. And we hear a presentation from one of our members, \n     but not before a very thorough introduction of that member by \n     either Senator Mike Enzi or Senator Jim Inhofe. Now, Senator \n     Inhofe and Enzi are here today, and I think it's high time \n     that something be said about their introductions. Everything \n     we do at the prayer breakfast is off the record, but this \n     needs to be said about Senator Enzi and Senator Inhofe's \n     introductions. Neither opposition research professionals nor \n     the FBI have a thing on Enzi and Inhofe when it comes to \n     background checks. Mike and Jim relentlessly call former \n     classmates, teachers, old friends, and relatives to discover \n     something a little unusual about each week's presenter. \n     Sometimes I wince. Sometimes I cringe. But the introduction \n     always ends on a high note with a verse of Scripture and the \n     suggestion that our speaker is much like a Biblical character \n     of old. Thank you for that, Jim. Thank you for that, Mike.\n       And then we hear from the Senator himself or herself, a \n     Democrat one week, a Republican the next week. What we learn \n     about each other is a lot. During my time in the Senate \n     prayer breakfast, we've heard from our own American sniper, \n     our own astronaut, he's here today, our own missionaries, and \n     we've had several, and our own award-winning composer. From \n     camp directors, to university presidents, we've heard the \n     good and the bad. We've heard about difficult family \n     backgrounds. We've heard about financial bankruptcy and home \n     foreclosures, and we've heard about spiritual journeys, from \n     the heights of achievement to really, really tough times. It \n     has been said, ``There is so much good in the worst of us and \n     so much bad in the best of us that it ill behooves any of us \n     to find fault with the rest of us,'' and that is true about \n     the attendees in the Senate prayer breakfast. In short, on \n     Wednesday mornings we learn we are a lot like you, and you, \n     and every other child of God, and almost always I come away \n     with a blessing. This morning, I acknowledge and thank the \n     people who have gone before Bob and me in the Senate prayer \n     breakfast leadership over the period of six decades, and \n     along with Bob, I'm honored to continue in their tradition.\n       Now at this time, it is my pleasure to recognize a few \n     distinguished guests at our head table who will not be given \n     the opportunity to speak. And I'll ask the next three ladies \n     to stand and remain standing, Mrs. Stevie Waltrip, Mrs. \n     Therese Casey, and Mrs. Gayle Wicker. Thank you for joining \n     us, ladies. Thank you so much, you may be seated.\n       And it is my very special honor at this point to ask each \n     of you to give our appreciation and love to the First Lady of \n     the United States, Mrs. Michelle Obama. [Applause]\n       And now, it is a special privilege for me as a Senator from \n     Mississippi to introduce a familiar face from home. Jasmine \n     Murray is from Columbus, Mississippi. She has been a \n     broadcast communication major at Mississippi State \n     University. She was a finalist on American Idol. And she was \n     a finalist in the Miss America Pageant where she proudly \n     represented my home state of Mississippi. Ladies and \n     gentlemen, please welcome Miss Mississippi, Jasmine Murray. \n     [Applause]\n       Ms. Jasmine Murray: [Singing]\n     Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,\n     Why should my heart feel lonely, and long for heaven and \n         home,\n     When Jesus is my portion? A constant friend is He:\n     His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches over me;\n     His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches over me.\n     I sing because I'm happy,\n     I sing because I'm free.\n     His eye is on the sparrow,\n     And I know He watches me.\n     His eye is on the sparrow,\n     And I know He watches, I know He watches, I know He watches \n         me.\n     I sing because I'm happy,\n     I sing because I'm free.\n     His eye is on the sparrow,\n     And I know He watches me.\n     His eye is on the sparrow,\n     And I know He watches me.\n     He watches me. I know He watches me. He watches me.\n       Ms. Murray: Thank you.\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you! Jasmine, that was wonderful. \n     Thank you, that was just great. I'm delighted to introduce \n     our next guest. He's a former Mayor of San Antonio and \n     current Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. As a \n     member of the President's Cabinet, he represents the \n     executive branch of the family while his twin brother, \n     Joaquin, covers the legislative side as a member of the House \n     of Representatives. Please warmly welcome to read from the \n     Old Testament, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, \n     Julian Castro. [Applause]\n       The Honorable Julian Castro: Thank you. Thank you so much \n     Mr. President for the great assist, good morning, and to Mrs. \n     Obama, and to co-chairs Senator Casey and Senator Wicker, and \n     to all of our distinguished guests. It's a great honor to \n     join you on this day of prayer and of peace. Last week I had \n     the opportunity to travel to Los Angeles where I met some of \n     our nation's most vulnerable citizens, men and women living \n     every day with homelessness. Although they have endured \n     incredibly difficult circumstances, it was clear to me that \n     they have never let their hardship extinguish their hope. I \n     spoke with an older woman who spends her nights on a tattered \n     quilt over cold concrete. Night after night, that wears on a \n     person's body, yet this woman's spirit was unbroken and her \n     faith is a true testament of strength and of grace. And it \n     was this angel in the City of Angels, who reminded me that \n     the true measure of our progress is how we care for those \n     with the least.\n       The passage that I will read speaks to the hope we must \n     preserve, the needs we must meet, and the common humanity \n     that we must always honor. A reading from the book of Isaiah:\n       Is this the manner of fasting I would choose, a day to \n     afflict one's self, to bow one's head like a reed and lie \n     upon sack cloth and ashes? Is this what you call a fast, a \n     day acceptable to the Lord? Is this not rather the fast I \n     choose--releasing those bound unjustly, untying the thongs of \n     the yoke, setting free the oppressed, breaking off every \n     yoke? Is it not sharing your bread with the hungry, bringing \n     the afflicted and homeless into your house, clothing the \n     naked when you see them and not turning your back on your own \n     flesh? Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and \n     your wound shall be quickly healed. Your vindication shall go \n     before you and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear \n     guard. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer. You \n     shall cry for help, and he will say, ``Here I am.'' If you \n     remove the yoke from among you, the accusing finger and \n     malicious speech, if you lavish your food on the hungry and \n     satisfy the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the \n     darkness and your gloom shall become like midday.\n       Thank you, and may God bless you. [Applause]\n       Senator Casey: Thank you, Secretary Castro. Our prayer for \n     the poor this morning will be offered by Sister Mary \n     Scullion, a woman who has devoted her life to service, \n     advocacy, and of course, God. She is one of the founders of \n     Project HOME in Philadelphia; I'm proud to say that today. \n     Project HOME is a truly exceptional organization that does \n     the important work of providing housing, employment \n     opportunities, and medical care and education for the \n     homeless and the impoverished. For her work, Sister Mary was \n     named one of Time Magazine's world's 100 most influential \n     people in 2009. Sister Mary.\n       Sister Mary Scullion: It's an honor to be here, Mr. \n     President and Mrs. Obama, thank you very much, and all \n     honored guests. And greetings to everyone from Philadelphia, \n     Pennsylvania.\n       God of compassion and justice, we humbly come before you \n     with gratitude and a clear understanding that it is in you \n     that we all find our home. For when we are rooted in your \n     truth and grace, we are empowered to pray: thy kingdom come. \n     We recall how through the ages, you've been a God of \n     compassion, justice, and liberation, with a special love for \n     the poor and the oppressed. We remember your servant Moses \n     leading your people out of bondage. We recall Jesus, healing \n     the sick and proclaiming good news to the poor. We recall \n     those times in our own nation's history when moved by the \n     promise of liberty and empowered by Your Spirit, courageous \n     leaders worked to end slavery, to enfranchise women, to \n     welcome immigrants, and to expand economic opportunity for \n     all. Your constant revelation, God, is one of nonviolent \n     liberation from anything that oppresses the human spirit. As \n     we gather here, millions of your beloved children are \n     suffering under the burden of poverty, oppression, and \n     violence. Our prayers today can only be authentic if they \n     compel us to act. Let us hear the cry of the loving parents \n     struggling to provide for their children. Let us hear the cry \n     of those all around our world impacted by violence, and those \n     in our nation who suffer the wounds of gun violence. Let us \n     hear the cry of millions of children whose magnificent gifts \n     and possibilities are lost in under-resourced schools and \n     economically plundered neighborhoods, condemning them to a \n     life of persistent poverty. Let us hear the cry of our \n     veterans suffering from the wounds of war, especially those \n     who are homeless. Open our eyes, Lord, so we can see \n     suffering as a prophetic sign that calls us to radical \n     transformation. God, we know that our faith does not give us \n     answers; it gives us courage. As a people of faith, we pray \n     for the courage to live truthfully, justly, and \n     compassionately. Help us to see through our hypocrisy and \n     falsehood, empower us to stand squarely on the side of those \n     who are poor and struggling on the margins. Help us to move \n     beyond our ideological polarizations and economic \n     disparities. Form us into a united community that affirms \n     each person's dignity and works towards a shared prosperity. \n     Let us build a society free from the scourge of poverty, a \n     society that truly reflects Your Kingdom. Most of all, let us \n     understand that your ancient call for compassion and justice \n     is in truth, an invitation to us for fullness of life, and \n     richness of human community. As we meet the needs of those \n     who are poor, we are healing ourselves and our nation. As we \n     ensure that all families have enough to eat, we are building \n     the banquet table for everyone. As we work to provide health \n     care and education, we are making our whole society healthier \n     and wiser. As\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\n     we bring those living on our streets home, we are finding our \n     own way home because none of us are home until all of us are \n     home. Fill us with that same spirit of liberation that filled \n     Jesus and the prophets. Fill us with that spirit of joy, of \n     hope that inspired the prophet Isaiah in his powerful \n     challenge. If you spend yourselves on behalf of the hungry \n     and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will \n     rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noon \n     day. God of compassion, God of justice, fill us with this \n     yearning and give us the strength, the grace, the courage to \n     make it real each and every day as we pray: thy kingdom come. \n     Amen. [Applause]\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you, Sister Mary. A few minutes ago \n     when I said, ``Perhaps someone within the sound of my voice \n     could come to my assistance,'' I guess that did include you, \n     Mr. President. Though I thought perhaps someone else would \n     step forward, but thank you young man for figuring that out.\n       I first became involved in the Prayer Breakfast as a House \n     member, and I'm delighted today to introduce to say a few \n     words, the co-chairs from the House Prayer Breakfast. \n     Congressman Robert Aderholt, serving his 10th term from \n     Alabama, and Congressman Juan Vargas, serving his second term \n     from California, are the co-chairs in the House, and by \n     virtue of that, they will be the co-chairs of the next \n     breakfast, the 64th Annual National Prayer Breakfast. Ladies \n     and gentlemen, Robert Aderholt and Juan Vargas. [Applause]\n       The Honorable Robert B. Aderholt: Good morning. It's a real \n     honor for Juan and myself to be here on behalf of the House \n     breakfast, which meets every Thursday morning at eight \n     o'clock, about this time in the Capitol, when the House is in \n     session. The House of Representatives weekly prayer group \n     meets and we come together as Democrats and Republicans. We \n     come together once a week, not promoting a party; we're not \n     promoting a particular issue, or a particular agenda. I'm a \n     Republican from Alabama, Juan is a Democrat from California \n     but we come together that one hour during the week to promote \n     Jesus.\n       We're told in John 3 that Jesus said, ``Just as Moses \n     lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the son of man must \n     be lifted up . . . that everyone who believes may have \n     eternal life in him.'' And that is what we promote during \n     that week--Jesus of Nazareth. And we are honored to be here \n     this morning. We're glad to be here with our colleagues and \n     all of our friends, and our family from literally around the \n     world and it is an honor to work together in a bipartisan \n     effort and to work as I say, with our colleagues and \n     especially this year to work with my colleague, Juan Vargas \n     from California. [Applause]\n       The Honorable Juan C. Vargas: Thank you, and greetings from \n     the Prayer Breakfast. Mr. President, it was great to see the \n     assist that you gave today. We went to law school together, \n     played against him a couple times in basketball, he didn't \n     assist like that. It was a little rougher out there. That was \n     great to see.\n       We do come together every Thursday morning and we call it \n     the best hour of the week. We come together as Democrats and \n     Republicans. Who would have guessed--a California Democrat \n     and someone from Alabama who is a Republican? But we come \n     together and we pray, and we bring Jesus into our prayers and \n     we lift up the country, we lift up the Congress. And we know \n     that special things can happen, and they do. And because of \n     that, I think we're all here today and appreciate very, very \n     much the prayers that you all have for us. We know that you \n     pray for us throughout the country. I've gone to many, many \n     services where we hear that you pray for your leaders, you \n     pray for the President, you pray for all of us in public \n     office. And we love that and understand that, and we bring \n     those prayers up too. So again, thank you very much. And for \n     all of my colleagues, I invite you to come and pray with us \n     every Thursday morning. It's the best hour of the week from \n     eight in the morning until nine, and it really is something \n     special. You get to meet people that you wouldn't otherwise. \n     Who would have known that I would have loved Louie Gohmert? \n     Louie Gohmert has been one of our leaders and it's just \n     fabulous to come and pray with him. He brings us Jesus every \n     Thursday, so thank you very much. It's an honor to be here. \n     [Applause]\n       Senator Casey: Thank you very much for the Members of \n     Congress. I'm pleased to introduce The Honorable Deborah Lee \n     James, the 23rd Secretary of the United States Air Force. She \n     joins us today to offer a prayer for the leaders of our \n     nation. Secretary James, of course is a distinguished leader \n     in her own right for our nation's military, and has the \n     responsibility of managing more than 690,000 Air Force \n     personnel and a budget of 110 billion dollars. Please welcome \n     Secretary Deborah Lee James. Madam Secretary. [Applause]\n       The Honorable Deborah Lee James: Thank you so much, Senator \n     Casey, Senator Wicker. It is truly an honor and a privilege \n     for me to come before all of you today. Mr. President, Mrs. \n     Obama, Senators, Congressmen, distinguished guests, friends \n     and allies from around the world, may I please invite all of \n     you to join me in a prayer for our national leaders.\n       Oh mighty God, it is in you that we trust. We ask for your \n     blessings on our President, Barack Obama. Lord, grant him the \n     wisdom and the vision to lead our nation toward a more just, \n     peaceful, and prosperous world. Help him to keep the beacon \n     of American freedom burning brightly as an inspiration to all \n     who long to live free from fear, free from want, free to \n     speak, and free to worship as they choose. We ask you also, \n     Lord, to bless our First Lady, Michelle Obama. Strengthen her \n     as she works to inspire all of America's children to reach \n     higher and to live healthier lives, so that one day they will \n     be ready to build strong families of their own, compassionate \n     communities, and contribute to a better world. Please guide \n     our Vice President, Joe Biden, Lord, and all the members of \n     the President's cabinet. Grant to these and all others who \n     serve and advise our President the grace to lean not only on \n     their own understanding, but also to trust in you with all of \n     their hearts. Lord, bless our lawmakers sent from every \n     corner of America to form our Congress. Grant them the \n     priceless gifts of insight, courage, and unity. Shepherd them \n     by your spirit to do what is right, to love mercy, and to \n     walk humbly with you. Grant our Chief Justice and all of our \n     judicial leaders across the nation your wisdom, Lord, that \n     they may judge the law impartially as instruments of your \n     will. And very close to my heart, Lord, please, please \n     protect our men and women in uniform and all who stand in \n     harm's way to preserve the freedoms we cherish for our \n     children and grandchildren. And as you watch over those \n     serving far from home, also please encourage those who wait \n     for their return, and comfort those who have suffered \n     unspeakable losses. Lord, may the service and sacrifice of \n     those who have gone before us, and the lives of the heroes \n     who walk amongst us, let those individuals inspire the rest \n     of us to give our country, and our communities, and our \n     families the very best that we can with our wholeness of \n     heart, particularly in these uncertain times. Being always \n     mindful and grateful to you, Lord, for the many blessings \n     that you have bestowed on us, Amen. [Applause]\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Thank you so \n     much. As you can see from the program in front of you, our \n     next speaker was to be King Abdullah II of Jordan. We all \n     know the heartbreaking circumstances his country is \n     experiencing at this point. They required that His Majesty \n     King Abdullah return to Jordan. Our prayers are with the \n     people of Jordan during this troubling time of crisis. The \n     passage that King Abdullah was expected to read is from the \n     New Testament, Luke 10, and I will read this passage at this \n     point. Luke 10:\n       On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test \n     Jesus, ``Teacher,'' he asked, ``What must I do to inherit \n     eternal life?'' ``What is written in the law?'' he replied. \n     ``How do you read it?'' He answered, ``Love the Lord your God \n     with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all \n     your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor \n     as yourself.'' ``You have answered correctly,'' Jesus \n     replied. ``Do this and you will live.'' But he wanted to \n     justify himself, so he asked Jesus, ``And who is my \n     neighbor?''\n       In reply, Jesus said: ``A man was going down from Jerusalem \n     to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him \n     of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half \n     dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and \n     when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, \n     a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on \n     the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where \n     the man was and when he saw him he took pity on him. He went \n     to him and he bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, \n     and then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an \n     inn and took care of him. The next day, he took out two \n     denarii and gave them to the inn keeper. `Look after him,' he \n     said, `and when I return I will reimburse you for any extra \n     expense you may have.' Which of these three do you think was \n     a neighbor to the man who fell into the hand of robbers?''\n       The expert in the law replied, ``The one who had mercy on \n     him.'' Jesus told him, ``Go and do likewise.''\n       May God add His blessing to the reading of His Holy Word.\n       Senator Wicker: At this point it is my pleasure to \n     introduce to you our next guest. He too has been recognized \n     by Time Magazine. For 2014, he was one of the persons of the \n     year of Time Magazine. Dr. Kent Brantly and his colleagues \n     became known as the Ebola fighters for their work saving \n     lives and caring for those affected by this deadly disease. \n     As a doctor with the Christian relief organization, \n     Samaritan's Purse, Dr. Brantly contracted Ebola in Liberia. \n     Now fully recovered, he gives thanks to God and to the power \n     of prayer. Today he is with us to offer a prayer for the \n     leaders of the world, please warmly welcome Dr. Kent Brantly. \n     [Applause]\n       Dr. Kent Brantly: Let us pray. Our Father who art in \n     heaven. The Lord, the Lord, the God of compassion and mercy, \n     slow to anger and abounding in love and faithfulness, lover \n     of all peoples of the earth, there is no God like you in all \n     of heaven above or on the earth below. You keep your covenant \n     and show unfailing love to all who walk before you in \n     wholehearted devotion. Hallowed by thy name. Remind us that \n     all nations are as nothing before you, their governments but \n     a shadow of passing age, all authorities are intended to be \n     your servants, to do good to the people under their care and \n     to ensure justice for those who have been wronged. But we \n     all, including our leaders, will stand before your judgment \n     seat, oh God, and as surely as you live, oh Lord, every knee \n     will bow\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\n     and every tongue confess and give praise to you. Thy kingdom \n     come on earth. Grant to thy children throughout the world, \n     and especially to the leaders of the nations the gifts of \n     prayerful thought and of thoughtful prayer that following the \n     example of our Lord, we may discern what is right and do it. \n     Bless the leaders of the nations that they may not walk in \n     the council of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners, or \n     sit in the seat of mockers. Bless the leaders of the nations \n     that they might delight in the law of the Lord, that they \n     might meditate on it day and night that Thy will might be \n     done on earth as it is in heaven. Help us, Lord to protect \n     and to provide for all who are hungry and homeless, \n     especially those who are deprived of food and shelter, family \n     and friends. For true religion that is acceptable to you, oh \n     Lord, is this, to care for orphans and widows in their \n     distress, and to flee corruption. Give us this day our daily \n     bread. Forgive us for neglecting to seek peace and pursue it, \n     and finding ourselves in each new crisis more ready to make \n     war than to make peace, for choosing violence and war over \n     peace and reconciliation. We have not loved you with our \n     whole heart, and we have not loved our neighbors as our \n     selves. Forgive us for neglecting the needs of our people, \n     for choosing corruption and greed over integrity and \n     generosity. Forgive us for oppressing the minority while the \n     majority is filled with pride and self reliance. We have all \n     sinned and fallen short of your glory, oh Lord. Forgive us \n     our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. \n     Let us not seek revenge but reconciliation. Let us not \n     delight in victory but in justice. Let us not give ourselves \n     up to pride, but to prayer. Lead us not into temptation. Be \n     present, Lord, to all your children. Be present to those who \n     are killing, and to those who are being killed. Be present to \n     the oppressed and to the oppressor. Be present to the leaders \n     of the nations. Deliver us from evil. Subdue our selfish \n     desires to possess and to dominate. Forbid us arrogance and \n     victory, and self-pity, and defeat. Bless the leaders of the \n     nations, Father, that they might act justly and love mercy, \n     and walk humbly with you, oh God. For yours is the \n     kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever and ever. In \n     the name of Jesus we pray, Amen. [Applause]\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you Dr. Brantly, and please pass \n     along our good wishes to our friends at Samaritan's Purse. \n     Ladies and gentlemen, the National Association of Stock Car \n     Auto Racing, commonly known as NASCAR, is second only to the \n     National Football League in terms of TV ratings in our \n     country. NASCAR races are broadcast in over 150 countries. \n     Our keynote speaker this morning is one of the best known \n     figures in NASCAR. Simply put, Darrell Waltrip is one of the \n     great race car drivers in history. In 1 Corinthians 9:24 we \n     hear, ``Do you not know that in a race, all runners run.'' \n     (The internal combustion engine had not been invented back \n     then.) ``All runners run but only one receives the prize.'' \n     Well, Darrell Waltrip has received that winning prize some 84 \n     times. He's driven 809 races and 237,773 laps. His life story \n     includes an important faith journey. I believe God has placed \n     a message on Darrell's heart that can benefit us today. But \n     first, let's see this clip from 1991 at the Daytona Speedway.\n       [Clip from Daytona Speedway, showing Darrell Waltrip's car \n     crashing]\n       Senator Wicker: Well, he made it. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. \n     Darrell Waltrip. [Applause]\n       Mr. Darrell Waltrip: Let's go racing boys. I always chuckle \n     when I see that clip because my insurance man says, ``Have \n     you ever had an accident?'' I've had a couple. But good \n     morning, Mr. President, First Lady, all of the distinguished \n     guests, Congress members, everybody that's here this morning. \n     This is a huge honor for a kid that grew up in Owensboro, \n     Kentucky, and now resides in Franklin, Tennessee.\n       So, I knew about the Prayer Breakfast. I'd heard about it. \n     It's been going on since the early 1940s, so I'd heard about \n     it for a long time. But I have to tell you a quick story:\n       When the ``committee'' called me and asked me, ``Would I \n     like to come have breakfast with the President?'' I said, \n     ``Wow, they must know it's my birthday. What an honor to go \n     to Washington, D.C., and have breakfast with the president. \n     Oh, this is going to be great.'' ``And by the way, we'd like \n     for you to be the keynote speaker.'' ``Ah, I'll get back to \n     you on that.'' But I thought about it, prayed about it--and \n     I've got a lot of really great friends that pray for me all \n     the time--but I thought about it, Mr. President, and said, \n     ``I've got it. I'm not a brain surgeon, and I'm not running \n     for office, so I'm the perfect guy to be here this morning.'' \n     [Applause]\n       I hope that was okay. My wife told me maybe I shouldn't say \n     that, but she's sitting down there shaking her head now. But \n     anyway, I'd like to introduce my family. You've already met \n     my beautiful, redheaded wife Stevie. Jessica and Sarah, my \n     two daughters, and their husbands, Fausto and Matthew, are \n     out there, and it makes me feel so good to have them here \n     this morning with me. I love my family, and I love the Lord.\n       If the room should start vibrating just a little bit--don't \n     get excited, don't get nervous--it's just all my friends back \n     in Franklin, Tennessee, my Tuesday morning Bible study group, \n     all my friends over in Charlotte, North Carolina, at Motor \n     Racing Outreach, our ministry at the track. All my friends \n     are praying for me right now. And I don't know if you can \n     feel it or not, but I certainly can, and I'm thankful for it. \n     So if it starts shaking a little bit, it's okay. It's just \n     the Lord. He's amongst us. [Applause]\n       Being here this morning reminds me of this: Before you \n     start a big event as a driver, like the Daytona 500, which \n     comes up in a couple of weeks on Fox, you go down on pit \n     road, you get in your car--and quite honestly, I did it for \n     30 years but it never failed, always that adrenaline, those \n     butterflies, being excited, nervous. Because when they \n     dropped the green flag and they say, ``Let's go racing \n     boys,'' you didn't really know what was going to happen. And \n     so, that's kind of how I feel this morning. I really don't \n     know what's going to happen here, folks. They kept asking me, \n     ``Do you have an outline?'' I said, ``No, I've never really \n     done an outline for a speech before.'' That's when they \n     thought maybe I wasn't the right guy for this show.\n       I've got to tell you this. I probably shouldn't, but I'm \n     going to: So, they call me up, and they tell me all the great \n     speakers that have been here before. And as they went down \n     the list, I said, ``Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait just a minute, \n     boys. I'm just not sure I'm qualified for this job.'' And \n     they said, ``Well, we kind of knew that going in.'' So, right \n     away I knew I was in good company.\n       I think all of us in this room know that sometimes your \n     biggest assets can be something that works against you. They \n     can be a blessing and a curse, and that's really how racing \n     was for me. It was sort of a blessing and a curse. I grew up \n     in Owensboro, Kentucky. My dad drove a Pepsi-Cola truck. My \n     mom was a cashier at the local grocery store. I had two \n     brothers and two sisters. We didn't have a lot of money; we \n     worked hard to put food on the table. And so, when I went to \n     races as a six-year-old kid with my grandmother and came home \n     and told Mom and Dad that someday I wanted to be a race car \n     driver, they said, ``Good luck, son.'' My dad was a believer \n     in hard work. He said, ``You know, if you really work hard, \n     and that's what you want to do, then maybe someday you'll be \n     successful.'' But that was about all the encouragement my dad \n     gave me, because racing is expensive. It costs a lot of money \n     to go racing, so we didn't have a lot of money. So, I had to \n     figure out a way to make that happen. I became a self-\n     promoter--in other words, I bragged a lot. God had given me a \n     talent; there was no question about that. I don't know where \n     it came from. There's no reason for me to be able to do what \n     I did other than that was my passion, that's what I cared \n     about. I tell kids every day--and Mr. President, you know \n     this--there's nothing any more discouraging and disheartening \n     when you ask a kid, ``What are you going to do when you grow \n     up?'' ``I don't know.'' ``Really? Embrace something. You've \n     got to have a passion.'' Well, my passion was racing, and \n     quite honestly, I went at it all the wrong ways in the early \n     years. I was just as aggressive off the racetrack as I was \n     on. I didn't have a lot of friends. I didn't think I needed \n     friends. I looked over in the car, and I was the only one \n     ever in there, so I didn't need any friends to be with me. \n     So, my relationships early on in my life were shallow. I \n     didn't have any really close friends. Quite honestly, I \n     looked back, and it's the hardest thing for me to do this \n     morning--to look back--because when I look back, I see things \n     that are disturbing to me. I can see things and say, ``How \n     could I have felt that way? How could I have acted that way? \n     How could I have been that way?'' But I was.\n       And you're going to love this. This is what people said \n     about me: They said I was brash, ruthless--ruthless?--pushy, \n     cocky, conceited, aloof, boastful, arrogant, and just \n     downright annoying. I hope you don't feel that way this \n     morning, but if you do, I'm sorry. And I've got to tell you, \n     those were people that liked me. You could imagine what \n     people who didn't like me had to say about me. The fans booed \n     me when we'd have driver introductions. It would be just like \n     if I got up this morning to speak, and they started booing. \n     Instead of hollering ``boogity, boogity, boogity,'' they \n     would start booing. Fans wore ``Anybody but Waltrip'' T-\n     shirts to the track. They hated me. The drivers despised me. \n     Richard Petty once told me: ``I don't know how you keep a \n     sponsor. You're so unpopular with the fans; I don't know how \n     you keep a sponsor.'' And this is Richard Petty. He's the \n     icon of our sport. He's the king of our sport. I wanted to be \n     king, but I went at it all the wrong ways, for sure. I was \n     always arguing with NASCAR. I didn't like the rules, mainly \n     because they never worked in my favor, so I was always trying \n     to change the rules. We know guys like that, right? Always \n     wanting to change the rules. [Laughter, Applause.] I always \n     like to say I fought the wall, [and] the wall won. I fought \n     the law, and the law won. Those were the things that were \n     going on at the track, and quite honestly, my personal life \n     wasn't much better. I was so arrogant. I really was, and \n     that's why I say it's the hardest thing for me to do. My kids \n     are sitting out here for heaven's sake. But the hardest thing \n     to do is to look back and see how you were. My personal life \n     was a mess. I drank too much. I liked to go to the bars and \n     hang out with the boys. I did everything to satisfy me. \n     Whatever felt good to me, I did it; I didn't give it a second \n     thought--that was my lifestyle, that's how I lived. Like I \n     told you, I didn't have any great friends. I didn't have any \n     close friends. Heck, I always figured if you wanted a friend, \n     get a dog. I have several dogs.\n       But my wife, my beautiful wife, my redheaded wife whom I \n     love dearly--we've been\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\n     married 45 years. [Applause] That in of itself is a miracle. \n     She was married to that guy I was telling you about. She \n     lived it. My wife once described me as this: that she had \n     lived with two different men with the same name. And that \n     might be a little confusing to you, and so obviously I must \n     explain. But that first guy that I told you about, that was \n     the guy she was married to originally. I knew God had his \n     hand on me when I met Stevie. I didn't acknowledge it. I \n     didn't necessarily follow through, but it's one of the few \n     times in the early years of my life that I felt like God \n     spoke to me. God said to me, ``I gave you this woman. I \n     brought you this woman. Don't let her get away.'' And so, I \n     tried to always be on my best behavior when I was around her, \n     and certainly when I was around her mother and father, \n     because they didn't think a whole lot about a race car \n     driver. When her father asked me, ``How are you going to \n     support Stevie?'' I said, ``I'm going to be a professional \n     race car driver.'' He was the president of Texas Gas, and he \n     didn't quite understand how a race car driver could make a \n     living and be able to support his daughter. He wasn't sold on \n     the idea at first but he became a big fan as time went by.\n       So, Stevie would always pray for me. She is a Godly woman, \n     and she loved the Lord way before I did. And she would always \n     pray that someday, somehow we would get involved in a Bible \n     study or that I would, that I would get involved in a Bible \n     study, or a church, or something. And I'd always kind of blow \n     her off, and I'd say, ``Look honey, I race on Sundays. I \n     don't have time to go to church. I'm busy all through the \n     week getting ready for the next race. I just don't have time \n     for this church stuff and this God stuff. I just don't have \n     time, okay.'' And you know what she said? ``Well, I'll just \n     keep on praying.'' And let me tell you, when somebody says \n     they're praying for you, you better pay attention and don't \n     take it lightly. People don't pray for you if they don't care \n     about you and if they don't love you. [Applause.] Amen, amen. \n     It used to happen to me at the track, and people would come \n     up and say, ``I'm praying for you.'' And I'd say, ``Oh, thank \n     you very much. I've got to go now.'' Don't ever do that. \n     Embrace that person, because it's not a waste of time. It's \n     them embracing you and caring about you, and that's the most \n     important thing in the world is that we all care about each \n     other.\n       I almost had us do this, and Stevie talked me out of it. At \n     home when we pray, we hold hands. And in Bible study when we \n     pray, we kind of lock arms or hold hands. I was going to ask \n     everybody in the room to hold hands while we pray, but then I \n     thought maybe you weren't that close just yet, so I kind of \n     let that one go.\n       I got a great opportunity in 1983. I got a chance to drive \n     for Junior Johnson. Junior Johnson was a childhood hero. He's \n     the last American hero. They made a film about him. They \n     wrote books about him. He was the last American hero. As a \n     kid growing up in Owensboro, I listened to my little \n     transistor radio, and Junior Johnson drove this white #3 \n     Chevrolet with a 427 mystery engine. Junior Johnson, a \n     moonshiner from Wilkesboro, North Carolina, car #3 with a \n     mystery engine. I mean, that's hero material right there for \n     a guy like me. So obviously, I thought maybe someday I'd get \n     to meet him, but never thought that someday I'd get to drive \n     for him. Those were the best years of my career--'81, '82 we \n     won 24 races, 18 pole positions, 2 championships. But Junior \n     was a no-nonsense kind of guy. He said, ``Let me tell you \n     something, boy: When you come to drive for me, you work your \n     hands and not your mouth.'' I said, ``Yes, sir.'' Because \n     when Junior spoke, I listened. We had great times together. \n     We won races together, but in 1983 I had a horrible wreck--\n     worse than that one you saw there. I had a concussion. I went \n     for a couple of weeks to the next couple of races, and I \n     didn't even remember being there. And when I finally came to, \n     or woke up, I realized that that wreck had knocked me \n     conscious. It scared the hell out of me, and I mean that \n     literally. I realized I could have been killed that day. What \n     if I would have lost my life right there that day at Daytona? \n     What would I have done? Would I have gone to heaven? Or would \n     I have gone to hell? I thought I was a pretty good guy. But \n     folks, let me tell you something: Good guys go to hell. If \n     you don't know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, if you \n     don't have a relationship, if He's not the master of your \n     life, if you've never gotten on your knees and asked him to \n     forgive you of your sins, you're just a pretty good guy or a \n     pretty good gal. You're going to go to hell. Think about \n     that. I did. And like I said, it was a wake-up call. It \n     literally knocked me conscious.\n       Stevie and I started going to church. We met Dr. Cortez \n     Cooper, one of the Godliest men--preached from the Bible, \n     loved sports, a lot like the President. He could play any \n     sport, he pretty much knew a little bit about every sport \n     there was, and he knew me personally. And because of him, and \n     him talking to me just like I'm talking to you this morning, \n     every time I went to hear him preach, I felt like he was \n     talking directly to me. And so, we met in a high school in \n     Hillsboro, just outside of Nashville there while they were \n     building a big sanctuary. It was July; it was hot, kind of \n     like being in a race car--no air conditioning. I got down off \n     my high horse, I got down on my knees, and Dr. Cortez Cooper \n     and Stevie and I prayed that the Lord would come into my life \n     and forgive me of my sins and be my Lord and Savior. And that \n     was the greatest day of my life. [Applause]\n       That changed everything. I'll never forget: We were going \n     home from that night, and I told Stevie, ``Man, I feel like \n     the weight of the world has been lifted off of my shoulders. \n     I feel like I've been born again. I feel like a new man.'' I \n     felt different, and I knew I was different. When the Lord \n     comes into your life, you're going to be different. You have \n     to be different. If he comes into your heart, into your life, \n     and you're not different, you better go back and try it \n     again, because the Lord changes you. And He changed me, and \n     it was for the better. And we left there that night, and did \n     it fix all? Listen, you don't make a deal with the Lord: \n     ``Hey Lord, if you do this, I'll do that.'' It don't work \n     that way, folks. He's there for you. He's there to walk with \n     you. But you've got to do your part, too. So did my life, my \n     personal life, change things on the race track? I still had \n     wrecks. I still had problems. Things still happened, but I \n     wasn't in it alone. Where I felt like I was always in it by \n     myself, now I had somebody to pray with, talk with, to guide \n     me, direct me--the wisdom of the Lord. I had it, and I needed \n     to use it.\n       Stevie and I wanted to have a family. We were having \n     trouble having kids. We had a couple of miscarriages, and we \n     were praying, ``God, can you give us a child?'' And we'd \n     gotten to the point where we thought we'd just adopt. We're \n     not going to be able to have kids on our own, so we'll adopt. \n     And then Stevie got pregnant, and we prayed, and the Lord \n     gave us peace about it. He said, ``Hang in there this time, \n     I've got something special for you.'' And sure enough: \n     Jessica Lee Waltrip. September the 17th, 1987, we had our \n     first child. I, folks, was on cloud nine. I was so excited. I \n     couldn't wait to get to the track. I left that weekend to go \n     to Martinsville. I get to the racetrack, I'm a proud papa, \n     and everybody's congratulating me because they knew how badly \n     we wanted kids. I go over to my race car on Sunday morning, \n     and in the seat of the car is a vase with one rose in it and \n     a note. I pulled the note out, I opened it up, and it said, \n     ``Win this one for me, Daddy.'' That was quite a moment. I'd \n     never been called Daddy before, and I'd never been a father \n     before, and I was so happy. And I have to tell you: This is a \n     fairy tale. I never led a lap of that race. I wanted so badly \n     to win that race for Jessica--never led a dadgum lap, until \n     the last one--and you won't believe what happened. People \n     say, ``Can you tell me a time when God showed up?'' I don't \n     think he was working against those other guys, but he sure \n     was working for me--I know that. We go off the last lap, the \n     white flag's in the air, and I thought, ``Oh man, I'm running \n     third.'' There's nothing I can do. Dale Earnhardt and Terry \n     Labonte, they're a little bit quicker than I am. They go down \n     the back straightaway into third turn at Martinsville, a \n     little paperclip racetrack, and Terry bumps into the back of \n     Dale. And when he does, both cars get a little loose, and \n     they slide up the racetrack, and DW goes driving by. \n     [Applause]\n       Daddy won that one. Same thing--1992, Sarah was born. Sarah \n     Kaitlin Kerns Waltrip. Same deal: Go to the racetrack. It had \n     been kind of a tough year. I dominated that race, Bristol \n     half-mile track, like being hung up in a salad bowl for 500 \n     laps. Spinning around--your head's hurting, your eyes are \n     burning. I get out of the car, and I can't remember my \n     daughter's name. So, I'm trying really hard. I'm saying \n     ``Sarah, Sarah, Kaitlin''--she had a lot of names--``Kerns \n     Waltrip.'' Because when I left the hospital, we really hadn't \n     decided on exactly what her name was going to be. So, it took \n     a little time, but it came to me, and certainly Sarah's never \n     let me forget that I couldn't remember her name.\n       One final story for you, and it's about Dale Earnhardt Sr. \n     And I don't know how many of you people knew the old \n     intimidator. He was one tough customer and my biggest \n     competitor. We were `frenemies.' We were friends off the \n     racetrack but not so much on the racetrack. And this \n     beautiful redhead down here--she loved Dale, and Dale loved \n     her. And she witnessed to him just as much as she witnessed \n     to me. In 1994, Neil Bonnett lost his life at Daytona in a \n     practice crash. Sunday morning, Stevie had always put \n     Scriptures in my race car on a note card. Not good luck \n     charms, just encouragement. Whatever happened that week, the \n     Scripture sort of fit the events of that week.\n       We're standing on pit road praying with some of the \n     chaplains from MRO, and Dale walks by. Now, Dale is one of \n     those guys that you know he's a tough guy, so for him to pray \n     or to acknowledge that he may have a relationship with the \n     Lord was pretty hard for him to do. But he walks by, Stevie \n     grabs him and says, ``Come and pray with us.'' We all huddled \n     up on pit road there, and when we finished praying, Stevie \n     hands me the note card with the Scripture on it, and Dale \n     grabs it, and he says, ``What's that?'' And he read it. And \n     he looked at Stevie, and he said, ``Where's mine?'' Oh my \n     gosh, she ran to the pit box, got a note card, wrote a \n     Scripture, put it on the note card, and ran back to Dale's \n     car, and Dale put it on his dash. And so from that day until \n     2001, when he lost his life at Daytona, he had a Scripture in \n     his car just like I had in my car. You have to know \n     something: Me and this guy, we were fierce competitors. He \n     didn't like me, and I didn't like him when we were on that \n     racetrack. That woman would make us pray together. Stevie \n     would grab him and grab me and say, ``I want you all to pray \n     together,'' and we'd ``[makes mumbling noises].'' And then, \n     and\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\n     then to make it worse, she'd say, ``Tell him you love him.'' \n     [Laughter, Applause] So, as he was walking away and I was \n     walking away: ``I love you.'' [stated in perfunctory tone]\n       As I said, the hardest thing about being here this morning \n     was, as I prepared--and I did prepare--was looking back and \n     remembering how I was. But the good news this morning is I'm \n     not that way anymore. I just share this: You don't have to \n     walk alone. You don't have to carry all those burdens like \n     it's you against the world. You have to do like I did. You've \n     got to get off your high horse and get on your knees and ask \n     for forgiveness. He's waiting for you. He was there all the \n     time. I just didn't know it or acknowledge it. I told you \n     when I got up here I wasn't running for anything, but I will \n     tell you this: I am running to something. The Lord is a \n     strong tower; the righteous will run to it and be safe. God \n     bless you. God bless America. God bless our President, and \n     thank you for letting me share with you this morning. \n     [Applause]\n       Senator Casey: Darrell, thank you for that great message. \n     Darrell, I want to ask your permission but I'll do this as \n     I'm pretending to ask your permission. Your birthday is \n     today?\n       Mr. Waltrip: Yes.\n       Senator Casey: It's also the same birthday as my mother-in-\n     law, Nancy Foppiano, so I've just scored big points, Darrell, \n     thank you very much. It's my honor now to introduce the \n     President. Mr. President, First Lady Michelle Obama, we're \n     honored you're with us, honored by your presence. And they've \n     been here every year. So we're grateful to have them back. \n     [Applause]\n       President Obama is a person of faith who has spoken often \n     about his faith journey. His life has been, and continues to \n     be, a life of service, public service, in the pursuit of \n     justice here, at home, and around the world. My mother, Ellen \n     Casey, (that way I've got my mother-in-law and my mother in \n     the same remarks) always told us when we were growing up \n     over, and over again, she would say, ``Count your \n     blessings.'' Count your blessings. And I've tried to do that; \n     probably don't do enough of it. But I know that the President \n     is one who follows my mother's advice, especially about the \n     blessings of his family. So today as we gather to pray and to \n     express gratitude for so much on a morning like today, I \n     count as one of our blessings, Mr. President, your good work \n     as our President and your abiding commitment to your family, \n     to your faith, and to our country. Ladies and gentlemen, the \n     44th President of the United States, Barack Obama. [Applause]\n       The President: Thank you. Well, good morning. Giving all \n     praise and honor to God. It is wonderful to be back with you \n     here. I want to thank our co-chairs, Bob and Roger. These two \n     don't always agree in the Senate, but in coming together and \n     uniting us all in prayer, they embody the spirit of our \n     gathering today.\n       I also want to thank everybody who helped organize this \n     breakfast. It's wonderful to see so many friends and faith \n     leaders and dignitaries. And Michelle and I are truly honored \n     to be joining you here today.\n       I want to offer a special welcome to a good friend, His \n     Holiness the Dalai Lama--who is a powerful example of what it \n     means to practice compassion, who inspires us to speak up for \n     the freedom and dignity of all human beings. I've been \n     pleased to welcome him to the White House on many occasions, \n     and we're grateful that he's able to join us here today. \n     [Applause]\n       There aren't that many occasions that bring His Holiness \n     under the same roof as NASCAR. This may be the first. But God \n     works in mysterious ways. [Laughter] And so I want to thank \n     Darrell for that wonderful presentation. Darrell knows that \n     when you're going 200 miles an hour, a little prayer cannot \n     hurt. I suspect that more than once, Darrell has had the same \n     thought as many of us have in our own lives--Jesus, take the \n     wheel. Although I hope that you kept your hands on the wheel \n     when you were thinking that. [Laughter]\n       He and I obviously share something in having married up. \n     And we are so grateful to Stevie for the incredible work that \n     they've done together to build a ministry where the fastest \n     drivers can slow down a little bit, and spend some time in \n     prayer and reflection and thanks. And we certainly want to \n     wish Darrell a happy birthday. [Applause] Happy birthday.\n       I will note, though, Darrell, when you were reading that \n     list of things folks were saying about you, I was thinking, \n     well, you're a piker. I mean, if you really want a list, come \n     talk to me, because that ain't nothing. That's the best they \n     can do in NASCAR? [Laughter.]\n       Slowing down and pausing for fellowship and prayer--that's \n     what this breakfast is about. I think it's fair to say that \n     Washington moves a lot slower than NASCAR. Certainly my \n     agenda does sometimes. [Laughter.] But still, it's easier to \n     get caught up in the rush of our lives, and in the political \n     back-and-forth that can take over this city. We get \n     sidetracked with distractions, large and small. We can't go \n     10 minutes without checking our smartphones--and for my \n     staff, that's every 10 seconds. And so for 63 years, this \n     prayer tradition has brought us together, giving us the \n     opportunity to come together in humility before the Almighty \n     and to be reminded of what it is that we share as children of \n     God.\n       And certainly for me, this is always a chance to reflect on \n     my own faith journey. Many times as President, I've been \n     reminded of a line of prayer that Eleanor Roosevelt was fond \n     of. She said, ``Keep us at tasks too hard for us that we may \n     be driven to Thee for strength. `` Keep us at tasks too hard \n     for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength. I've \n     wondered at times if maybe God was answering that prayer a \n     little too literally. But no matter the challenge, He has \n     been there for all of us. He's certainly strengthened me \n     ``with the power through His Spirit,'' as I've sought His \n     guidance not just in my own life but in the life of our \n     nation.\n       Now, over the last few months, we've seen a number of \n     challenges--certainly over the last six years. But part of \n     what I want to touch on today is the degree to which we've \n     seen professions of faith used both as an instrument of great \n     good, but also twisted and misused in the name of evil.\n       As we speak, around the world, we see faith inspiring \n     people to lift up one another--to feed the hungry and care \n     for the poor, and comfort the afflicted and make peace where \n     there is strife. We heard the good work that Sister has done \n     in Philadelphia, and the incredible work that Dr. Brantly and \n     his colleagues have done. We see faith driving us to do \n     right.\n       But we also see faith being twisted and distorted, used as \n     a wedge--or, worse, sometimes used as a weapon. From a school \n     in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence \n     and terror perpetrated by those who profess to stand up for \n     faith, their faith, professed to stand up for Islam, but, in \n     fact, are betraying it. We see ISIL, a brutal, vicious death \n     cult that, in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable \n     acts of barbarism--terrorizing religious minorities like the \n     Yazidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and \n     claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.\n       We see sectarian war in Syria, the murder of Muslims and \n     Christians in Nigeria, religious war in the Central African \n     Republic, a rising tide of anti-Semitism and hate crimes in \n     Europe, so often perpetrated in the name of religion.\n       So how do we, as people of faith, reconcile these \n     realities--the profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the \n     compassion and love that can flow from all of our faiths, \n     operating alongside those who seek to hijack religions for \n     their own murderous ends?\n       Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout \n     human history. And lest we get on our high horse and think \n     this is unique to some other place, remember that during the \n     Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds \n     in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim \n     Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ. \n     Michelle and I returned from India--an incredible, beautiful \n     country, full of magnificent diversity--but a place where, in \n     past years, religious faiths of all types on occasion have, \n     on occasion, been targeted by other peoples of faith, simply \n     due to their heritage and their beliefs--acts of intolerance \n     that would have shocked Ghandiji, the person who helped to \n     liberate that nation.\n       So, this is not unique to one group or one religion. There \n     is a tendency in us, a sinful tendency that can pervert and \n     distort our faith. In today's world, when hate groups have \n     their own Twitter accounts and bigotry can fester in hidden \n     places in cyberspace, it can be even harder to counteract \n     such intolerance. But God compels us to try. And in this \n     mission, I believe there are a few principles that can guide \n     us, particularly those of us who profess to believe.\n       And, first, we should start with some basic humility. I \n     believe that the starting point of faith is some doubt--not \n     being so full of yourself and so confident that you are right \n     and that God speaks only to us, and doesn't speak to others, \n     that God only cares about us and doesn't care about others, \n     that somehow we alone are in possession of the truth.\n       Our job is not to ask that God respond to our notion of \n     truth--our job is to be true to Him, His word and His \n     commandments. And we should assume humbly that we're confused \n     and don't always know what we're doing and we're staggering \n     and stumbling towards Him, and have some humility in that \n     process. And that means we have to speak up against those who \n     would misuse His name to justify oppression, or violence, or \n     hatred with that fierce certainty. No God condones terror. No \n     grievance justifies the taking of innocent lives, or the \n     oppression of those who are weaker or fewer in number.\n       And so, as people of faith, we are summoned to push back \n     against those who try to distort our religion--any religion--\n     for their own nihilistic ends. And here at home and around \n     the world, we will constantly reaffirm that fundamental \n     freedom--freedom of religion--the right to practice our faith \n     how we choose, to change our faith if we choose, to practice \n     no faith at all if we choose, and to do so free of \n     persecution and fear and discrimination.\n       There's wisdom in our founders writing in those documents \n     that helped found this nation, the notion of freedom of \n     religion, because they understood the need for humility. They \n     also understood the need to uphold freedom of speech, that \n     there is a connection between freedom of speech and freedom \n     of religion. For to infringe on one right under the pretext \n     of protecting another is a betrayal of both.\n       But part of humility is also recognizing in modern, \n     complicated, diverse societies, the functioning of these \n     rights, the concern for the protection of theses rights calls \n     for each of us to exercise civility and restraint and\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n     judgment. And if, in fact, we defend the legal right of a \n     person to insult another's religion, we're equally obligated \n     to use our free speech to condemn such insults--[Applause]--\n     and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with religious communities, \n     particularly religious minorities who are the targets of such \n     attacks. Just because you have the right to say something \n     doesn't mean the rest of us shouldn't question those who \n     would insult others in the name of free speech. Because we \n     know that our nations are stronger when people of all faiths \n     feel that they are welcome, that they, too, are full and \n     equal members of our countries.\n       So humility I think is needed. And the second thing we need \n     is to uphold the distinction between our faith and our \n     governments. Between church and between state. The United \n     States is one of the most religious countries in the world--\n     far more religious than most Western developed countries. And \n     one of the reasons is that our founders wisely embraced the \n     separation of church and state. Our government does not \n     sponsor a religion, nor does it pressure anyone to practice a \n     particular faith, or any faith at all. And the result is a \n     culture where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can \n     freely and proudly worship, without fear, or coercion--so \n     that when your listen to Darrell talk about his faith \n     journey, you know it's real. You know he's not saying it \n     because it helps him advance, or because somebody told him \n     to. It's from the heart.\n       That's not the case in theocracies that restrict people's \n     choice of faith. It's not the case in authoritarian \n     governments that elevate an individual leader or a political \n     party above the people, or in some cases, above the concept \n     of God Himself. So the freedom of religion is a value we will \n     continue to protect here at home and stand up for around the \n     world, and is one that we guard vigilantly here in the United \n     States.\n       Last year, we joined together to pray for the release of \n     Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, held in North Korea for two \n     years. And today, we give thanks that Kenneth is finally back \n     where he belongs--home with his family. [Applause]\n       Last year we prayed together for Pastor Saeed Abedini, \n     detained in Iran since 2012. And I was recently in Boise, \n     Idaho, and had the opportunity to meet with Pastor Abedini's \n     beautiful wife and wonderful children and to convey to them \n     that our country has not forgotten brother Saeed and that \n     we're doing everything that we can to bring him home. \n     [Applause] And then, I received an extraordinary letter from \n     Pastor Abedini. And in it, he describes his captivity, and \n     expressed his gratitude for my visit with his family, and \n     thanked us all for standing in solidarity with him during his \n     captivity.\n       And Pastor Abedini wrote, ``Nothing is more valuable to the \n     Body of Christ than to see how the Lord is in control, and \n     moves ahead of countries and leadership through united \n     prayer.'' And he closed his letter by describing himself as \n     ``prisoner for Christ, who is proud to be part of this great \n     nation, the United States of America that cares for religious \n     freedom around the world.'' [Applause]\n       We're going to keep up this work--for Pastor Abedini and \n     all those around the world who are unjustly held or \n     persecuted because of their faith. And we're grateful to our \n     new Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, \n     Rabbi David Saperstein--who has hit the ground running, and \n     is heading to Iraq in a few days to help religious \n     communities there address some of those challenges. Where's \n     David? I know he's here somewhere. Thank you David for the \n     great work you're doing. [Applause]\n       Humility; a suspicion of government getting between us and \n     our faith or trying to dictate our faiths, or elevate one \n     faith over another. And, finally, let's remember that if \n     there is one law that we can all be most certain of that \n     seems to bind people of all faiths and people who are still \n     finding their way towards faith but have a sense of ethics \n     and morality in them--that one law, that Golden Rule that we \n     should treat one another as we wish to be treated. The Torah \n     says ``Love thy neighbor as yourself.'' In Islam, there is a \n     Hadith that states: ``None of you truly believes until he \n     loves for his brother what he loves for himself.'' The Holy \n     Bible tells us to ``put on love, which binds everything \n     together in perfect harmony.'' Put on love.\n       Whatever our beliefs, whatever our traditions, we must seek \n     to be instruments of peace, and bringing light where there is \n     darkness, and sowing love where there is hatred. And this is \n     the loving message of His Holiness Pope Francis. And like so \n     many people around the world, I've been touched by his call \n     to relieve suffering, and to show justice and mercy and \n     compassion to the most vulnerable; to walk with the Lord and \n     ask ``Who am I to judge?'' He challenges us to press on in \n     what he calls our ``march of living hope.'' And like millions \n     of Americans, I am very much looking forward to welcoming \n     Pope Francis to the United States later this year. \n     [Applause.]\n       His Holiness expresses that basic law: Treat thy neighbor \n     as thyself. The Dalai Lama--anybody who's had an opportunity \n     to be with him senses that same spirit. Kent Brantly \n     expresses that same spirit. Kent was with Samaritan's Purse, \n     treating Ebola patients in Liberia, when he contracted the \n     virus himself. And with world-class medical care and a deep \n     reliance on faith--with God's help, Kent survived. \n     [Applause.]\n       And then by donating his plasma, he helped others survive \n     as well. And he continues to advocate for a global response \n     in West Africa, reminding us that ``our efforts need to be on \n     loving the people there.'' And I could not have been prouder \n     to welcome Kent and his wonderful wife Amber to the Oval \n     Office. We are blessed to have him here today--because he \n     reminds us of what it means to really ``love thy neighbor as \n     thyself.'' Not just words, but deeds.\n       Each of us has a role in fulfilling our common, greater \n     purpose--not merely to seek high position, but to plumb \n     greater depth so that we may find the strength to love more \n     fully. And this is perhaps our greatest challenge--to see our \n     own reflection in each other; to be our brother's keepers and \n     sister's keepers, and to keep faith with one another. As \n     children of God, let's make that our work, together.\n       As children of God, let's work to end injustice--injustice \n     of poverty and hunger. No one should ever suffer from such \n     want amid such plenty. As children of God, let's work to \n     eliminate the scourge of homelessness, because as Sister Mary \n     says, ``None of us are home until all of us are home.'' None \n     of us are home until all of us are home.\n       As children of God, let's stand up for the dignity and \n     value of every woman, and man, and child, because we are all \n     equal in His eyes, and work to end the scourge and the sin of \n     modern-day slavery and human trafficking, and ``set the \n     oppressed free.'' [Applause]\n       If we are properly humble, if we drop to our knees on \n     occasion, we will acknowledge that we never fully know God's \n     purpose. We can never fully fathom His amazing grace. ``We \n     see through a glass, darkly''--grappling with the expanse of \n     His awesome love. But even with our limits, we can heed that \n     which is required: To do justice, and love kindness, and walk \n     humbly with our God.\n       I pray that we will. And as we journey together on this \n     ``march of living hope,'' I pray that, in His name, we will \n     run and not be weary, and walk and not be faint, and we will \n     heed those words and ``put on love.''\n       May the Lord bless you and keep you, and may He bless this \n     precious country that we love.\n       Thank you all very much. [Applause]\n       Senator Casey: Mr. President, thank you for your message, \n     and we're honored by your presence here today. We close our \n     program with one song and one prayer. Our last song this \n     morning will be sung by a remarkable young man, and those \n     words don't do justice to who this person is. A young man \n     from Tennessee named Quintavious Johnson. If you're a fan of \n     the television show, America's Got Talent, you might \n     recognize him as one of last year's finalists. But today, \n     singing at the National Prayer Breakfast in front of more \n     than 3,500 at the age of 13. Just imagine that, that's going \n     to be hard to top. And now to sing the Lord's Prayer, please \n     welcome Quintavious Johnson. [Applause]\n       Quintavious Johnson [Singing]\n     Our Father, which art in heaven,\n     Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come and thy will be done\n     On earth as it is in heaven.\n     And give us this day our daily bread,\n     And forgive us our debt, as we forgive our debtors.\n     And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;\n     For thine is the kingdom, and the power,\n     And the glory, forever.\n     Amen.\n       [Applause]\n       Senator Casey: Wow! Quintavious, thank you for your great \n     performance, we're grateful you're with us this morning. And \n     finally this morning, our last prayer at this breakfast will \n     be offered by an extraordinary public servant who also \n     happens to be a minister. He's a former Member of Congress, \n     Ambassador to the United Nations, Mayor of Atlanta, and \n     recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a well-known \n     civil rights leader and friend of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \n     Our next speaker was instrumental in the civil rights \n     campaigns in Selma, and in Birmingham that ultimately led to \n     the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965. [Applause] But of all of his many titles \n     and accomplishments, he's most proud of his role as husband, \n     father, and grandfather. Ladies and gentlemen, the Honorable \n     Andrew Young. [Applause]\n       The Honorable Andrew J. Young: This morning I woke up to \n     the hearings of the Senate committee on your new appointment \n     as Secretary of Defense. And as they went around talking \n     about all of the dangers and problems that he must confront, \n     and that you must face every day, I realized that's why we \n     need prayer. And I wondered, has the world ever been in this \n     bad of shape? And I remember when I was about the age of \n     Quintavious, even a little earlier, the Japanese bombed Pearl \n     Harbor, and Germans were sinking ships, and America was far \n     weaker then. We still had the same conflicts in Congress. We \n     still had the same differences racially, and emotionally, and \n     religiously, but somehow we pulled together and we heard the \n     President say, ``The only thing we have to fear is fear \n     itself.'' And then a little while later, in fact quite a \n     while later, the people with whom we had gone to war became \n     our best friends and our trading partners. And this country \n     of ours helped unite the world, and in thanks for that, \n     President Eisenhower asked that we come together and form \n     this prayer breakfast, to thank God--for only the spirit of \n     Jesus can forgive as we forgave, can reconcile enemies to \n     each other, and that same Jesus that walked with President \n     Eisenhower and all the presidents since, therefore, with you \n     Mr. President. And when\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\n     I look at these young people from Mississippi, Senator, we \n     have overcome so much. [Applause] And we thank you, and we \n     thank all of you, and we thank God. May we pray:\n       Be with us dear Father, as we take on the challenges of \n     life, not just as government but as business, as private \n     sector and nonprofit sector, as religious leaders, as \n     community leaders, as volunteers, as fathers and mothers, as \n     brothers and sisters, as mothers and sons, and fathers and \n     daughters, bind us together, heal our wounds, calm our \n     spirits and make us always mindful that you came into the \n     world to say you would make all things new, but that you \n     would be with us always. So as we go through many dangers, \n     toils, and snares by your amazing grace, make us always \n     mindful that your presence is in the midst of us. That each \n     of us, because of you, know that we too are your children and \n     that our Father loves us, forgives us, saves us by the mercy \n     that we must share with each other and with the world in \n     which we live. In the name of Jesus we pray, Amen. [Applause]\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you, Ambassador Young. And as we \n     conclude this, the 63rd Annual National Prayer Breakfast--\n     depart with these words of God from the Book of Numbers: \n     ``The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face \n     shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up His \n     countenance upon you and give you peace.'' Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2521-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE FIFTH AMERICAN PRISONER OF WAR FRIENDSHIP DELEGATION TO \n                                 JAPAN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to honor veterans from America's \n``greatest generation'' who were held captive as prisoners of war, \nPOWs, by Japan during World War II and to recognize seven veterans--\nincluding three from California--who recently participated in a \nhistoric trip to Japan to promote reconciliation and remembrance.\n  At the invitation of the Japanese Government, the veterans were \njoined by their family members to become the 5th delegation of American \nPOWs to visit Japan as part of the official Japanese-American POW \nFriendship Program that began in 2010.\n  These brave men fought in the historic first battles of World War II \nand endured years of hardship as POWs. This year, as we commemorate the \n70th anniversary of the end of World War II, I want to recognize them \nand honor their service and sacrifice.\n  Anthony Costa, 95, from Concord, CA, was a private first class in the \nfamed 4th Marine Regiment, also known as the China Marines, which \narrived in the Philippines days before the Japanese invasion. He fought \nto defend the island of Corregidor in the Philippines from December \n1941 to May 1942 before he was captured by the Japanese. As a POW, \nPrivate Costa was force-marched through Manila and taken to the \nCabanatuan prison camp, where thousands of POWs died from starvation, \ndehydration and abuse. He was then moved to Japan to work as a slave \ndockworker in the freight yards in and around Osaka before being \nliberated in September 1945. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the \nPurple Heart.\n  William Sanchez, 96, from Monterey Park, CA, was an Army sergeant \nwith the 59th Coast Artillery assigned to the island of Corregidor in \nthe Philippines where he helped defend the harbor against the Japanese \ninvasion. In May 1942, Sergeant Sanchez and the rest of his division \nwere captured and paraded through the streets of Manila to Bilibid \nPrison. He was later transported to Japan in the hold of a Japanese \nhell ship, where he endured a 33-day oceanic journey plagued by \ndysentery, malaria and malnutrition before reaching Camp Omori. At the \nPOW camp, he was forced to work as a slave laborer and dockworker at \nthe railway yards in Tokyo prior to his liberation in August 1945.\n  Jack Schwartz, 100, from Hanford, CA, was a Navy lieutenant junior \ngrade serving on Guam when the Japanese Navy attacked the island on \nDecember 8, 1941. When Guam fell to the Japanese, Lieutenant Schwartz \nwas taken to a POW camp in Japan where he was repeatedly beaten, \nstarved and provided insufficient clothing to endure the harsh winters. \nHe was sent to several POW camps before being moved to Camp Rokuroshi, \nwhich was hidden in the Japanese Alps. After being liberated on \nSeptember 8, 1945, he remained in the Navy and retired after a \ndistinguished career in 1962.\n  My constituents were joined on their trip by Daniel Crowley, 92, of \nConnecticut, an Army Air Corps infantryman who participated in the \ndefense of Bataan and Corregidor; Oral Nichols, 93, of New Mexico, who \nserved as a civilian medic in the historic defense of Wake Island; \nWarren Jorgenson, 93, of Nebraska, a marine who defended Corregidor; \nand Darrell Stark, 91, of Connecticut, who served as an Army \ninfantryman on the Bataan Peninsula.\n  This trip was part of a reconciliation process that, while \nundoubtedly painful, is critical to help provide closure to POWs and \ntheir families and continue building stronger relations between the \nU.S. and Japan. It is important that this reconciliation program \ncontinue so that this history is remembered and the families can \ncontinue to heal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2521-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REMEMBERING PETTY OFFICER SECOND CLASS HEIDI FRIEDMAN\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I have the solemn duty of \nmemorializing U.S. Navy PO2 Heidi Jo Friedman, a New Hampshire native \nwho was tragically killed on April 12 at the age of 33. Petty Officer \nFriedman was serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush \nas an engineman, having transferred from Navy Operation Support Center \nManchester in January. She entered the Navy in 2002, and previously \nserved on the guided-missile destroyer USS Ross and in the Navy Reserve \nwith Amphibious Construction Battalion Two Detachment 101.\n  Heidi was born on June 28, 1981 to her father Robert, a retired Navy \nchief petty officer, and her mother Shari Murray. She graduated from \nLedyard High School, in Ledyard, CT, and enjoyed volunteering as a \nmentor to children and with the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots \nFoundation. Heidi was also a lifetime Girl Scout with a passion for \nrugby and traveling. To those who knew her, Heidi was a loving and \ncaring friend--someone who touched people in a positive way. I know \nthere are many who feel her absence deeply.\n  Petty Officer Friedman is survived by her mother Shari L. Murray, her \nfather and stepmother Robert B. and Laurie E. Friedman, her grandmother \nArlene Canin, her brother Michael L. and wife Erin Friedman, three \nstepsisters: Jaime and wife Rochelle, Kara and Maria and fiancee Chris; \nthree stepbrothers, Cito and fiancee Lyne, Quique and wife Amanda and \nNolan; two nephews, Alexander and Ashton; and many aunts, uncles and \ncousins.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in honoring the life and service of PO2 Heidi Jo \nFriedman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2521-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2521-S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CONGRATULATING SALLY WAGNER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, too often we forget or take for \ngranted just how important teachers are. I try not to do that because I \nmarried one. But the positive impact teachers have on our youth and on \nsociety is incalculable. Today, I would like to take a moment to \nacknowledge one outstanding teacher who is retiring after a \ndistinguished 40-year career--the last 34 years of which have been \nspent at Eleanor Roosevelt High School, ERHS, in Greenbelt, MD--Ms. \nSally S. Wagner. Ms. Wagner is the chair of the Instrumental Music \nDepartment at ERHS. In 2005, a Washington Post article took note of Ms. \nWagner's extraordinary achievements as an educator noting, ``The school \n[ERHS] has several legendary teachers, including band director Sally \nWagner . . . and a 750-student musical juggernaut with so many \nensembles and bands that one can barely keep count.''\n  For the past several years, we have been properly involved in an \neffort to improve so-called STEM education in this country. That \nacronym stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. \nBolstering STEM education is important for economic competitiveness, \nnational security, and keeping America at the forefront of the \ntechnological changes that will make life better for all of humanity. \nBut too many schools, grappling with budget cuts, have scaled back or \neven eliminated their arts and music curricula. Fortunately, there is \nburgeoning awareness of the importance of these courses, too. And now \npeople are talking about STEAM, where the ``A''\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nstands for arts and music. All of these subjects are interrelated and \ncomplementary. After all, it was Albert Einstein who said, ``The \ngreatest scientists are artists as well'' and who would play the violin \nor piano for intuition or inspiration when he became ``stuck'' on one \nof his formulas or equations.\n  Fortunately for the students at ERHS, which is an outstanding science \nand technology school, by the way, the music program has always been \nrobust, too, and Ms. Wagner has been in charge. Her career in music \nbegan when she was a child, with piano lessons. In the sixth grade, she \nstarted learning how to play the trombone. She ultimately earned her \ndegrees from Michigan State University and the University of Delaware. \nTeaching and bands are her passion. In 2001, Ms. Wagner was cited in \nSchool Band and Orchestra Magazine as one of ``50 Directors Who Make a \nDifference'' and she received the Maryland Music Educators Association \nOutstanding Music Teacher Award. In 2006, Ms. Wagner received the \nNational Honor Society Outstanding Teacher Award and the Claes Nobel \nEducator of Distinction Award. Claes Nobel--the grand-nephew of Alfred \nNobel--established the National Society of High School Scholars, which \nmade the award.\n  Ms. Wagner is a Music Educators National Conference, MENC--now known \nas the National Association for Music Education, or NAfME, Nationally \nRegistered Music Educator. She received the Prince George's County \nChamber of Commerce Outstanding Educator Award, Excellence in Teaching \nAwards from Prince George's County Public Schools, the County Council, \nthe Maryland House of Delegates and the Governor of Maryland, and was \nrecognized in 1994 by the University of Maryland Center for Teaching \nExcellence.\n  Ms. Wagner is a member of MENC/NAfME, the Women Band Directors \nInternational, the Maryland Music Educators Association, and the \nMaryland Band Directors Association. She is active as an adjudicator, \nclinician, and guest conductor, and she writes articles for The Woman \nConductor and BandWorld Magazine.\n  These are numerous accolades and tremendous accomplishments, to be \nsure. But what is most important is the love that Ms. Wagner has for \nher students--at least one of whom is a second generation ERHS band \nmusician--and the love and respect and admiration they have for her in \nreturn. She built the ERHS instrumental music program with incomparable \ncare for every one of her students. Her love of music, teaching, and \nperforming is evident in each and every interaction she has with her \nstudents, their parents, colleagues, and others in the community. She \nhas touched and inspired thousands of students over her career with her \ntalent, hard work, joy, dedication, sense of humor, intellect, \nleadership, kindness, and--above all--love. She has taught her students \nabout responsibility, dedication, teamwork, and the pursuit of \nexcellence. Of course, these lessons aren't just about music; they are \nimportant lessons about life.\n  Just a couple of comments posted by students on the ERHS Facebook \npage tell the story. One student wrote, ``She is totally awesome. I \nswear, she is the most amazing teacher ever. She makes my day, every \nday. I'm just crossing my fingers and praying that she won't retire \nbefore I graduate!'' Another student wrote, ``Ms. Wagner inspired me to \ndo my absolute best in music and helped me discover how important music \nis in my life. She is my hero.'' Another wrote, ``Instrument rentals: \n$25. Uniform fee: $20. Being in her class: priceless.'' Another student \nwrote, ``She always encouraged me to excel. She pushed me and believed \nin me. I learned more from her than anyone. She was the greatest \nteacher! Her love for music shines through.'' Finally, from an alumnus, \n``I had Ms. Wagner way back in 1985--she was great back then, and it is \ngreat to see that she is still well-loved.''\n  In 2004, the ERHS band community of students, parents, and alumni \ncommissioned the score ``Under the Magical Wing'' as a tribute to Ms. \nWagner in appreciation and recognition of her dedication to the ERHS \nmusic program. Now the ERHS community has established the ``Sally \nWagner Performing Arts Space,'' a new black box theatre at ERHS.\n  U2's Bono has said, ``Music can change the world because it can \nchange people.'' If that is true, and I believe it is, think of the \nworld-changing impact Ms. Wagner has had over the course of her career. \nThink of the joy she has brought to so many people. I would ask my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to join me in thanking Ms. Sally Wagner \nfor her extraordinary contributions and congratulate her on her \nretirement. Strike up the band.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2522-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING SANDRA WISECAVER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor the life and legacy of \nSandra Wisecaver, owner and operator of the Buhl Herald in Buhl, ID. \nSandra leaves an enduring legacy of dedication to her community and \ndeep personal strength.\n  Sandra is remembered as a remarkable journalist, who led the Buhl \nHerald as owner and operator since 2005 after working at the newspaper \nfor many years. She started working at the paper as a senior at Buhl \nHigh School and worked for the paper while attending the College of \nSouthern Idaho. After working in other fields, she became the \nCastleford correspondent for the paper in 1987, and returned to the \nHerald in 1992. She worked as reporter and editor before purchasing the \nnewspaper 10 years ago. Sandra's commitment to providing an outlet for \nstories about the achievements of area youth and a sound chronicle of \ncommunity events will not be forgotten. She worked hard to ensure that \nthe stories that mattered to her community reached her readership.\n  A native of Buhl, Sandra's roots were firmly planted in the community \nshe loved. She was born on August 30, 1949, to Jess and Vina Wilson of \nBuhl. In 1967, she graduated from Buhl High School and married Joe \nWisecaver in 1969. In addition to her work at the newspaper, she also \nworked in Green Giant's payroll department, worked at the Corner Merc \nin Castleford, and Sandra and Joe maintained the contract for the mail \ndelivery to Roseworth. She was a community leader also, dedicating \nconsiderable time as a 4-H leader, Cub Scout den mother, and baseball \nand softball cheer mom and driver.\n  Sandra's personal strength cannot be overstated. Beyond her role at \nthe newspaper and in the community, Sandra was an example of fortitude. \nShe overcame a stroke and persevered through stage IV kidney cancer to \ncontinue to publish the newspaper that had a central role in Buhl for \nmore than a century. Her grit and determination was inspiring. She is \nan exceptional example of staying power and commitment to her \ncommunity.\n  I extend my condolences to her husband Joe; her children, Angela and \nJoe Jr.; their families, including her three grandchildren; her many \nfriends and the Buhl community. Sandra Wisecaver was an amazing woman \nwho leaves behind a legacy of thoughtful and determined \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2522-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING TANNER ARCHULETA, JACOB JAVORSKY, AND AMANDA BUXTON\n\n Mr. DAINES.

But receiving a congressional nomination is no \nguarantee of acceptance. To be admitted, each applicant must meet--on \nhis or her own merits--the academies' rigorous standards.\n  I am proud to announce the names of 20 outstanding Utahns who have \nmet these standards and who will attend one of the academies in the \nsummer of 2015. This is more than twice as many accepted applicants \nthan I have ever seen in my 5 years in the Senate.\n  Each of these 20 students is of sound mind and body. This will serve \nthem well in Colorado Springs, West Point, and Annapolis. But to \nsucceed, they will need more than this.\n  The journey these young men and women are about to begin requires \nmore than intellectual and physical fitness. It also demands strong \nmoral character--leadership, courage, honesty, prudence, and self-\ndiscipline. And it calls for a commitment to service and a love of \ncountry.\n  Today, I would like to recognize and congratulate each of these \nimpressive students, all of whom embody, in their own unique way, the \nstandards of excellence on which America's service academies are built.\n  Cole Bennett Biedermann will be attending the U.S. Air Force Academy. \nCole will be graduating from Skyline High School, where he was a member \nof the National Honor Society, captain of the track team, and president \nof the physics club.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate John \nJay College of Criminal Justice on the occasion of their 50th \nanniversary.\n  Located in the cultural heart of New York City, John Jay College is \none of the Nation's leading liberal arts institutions of higher \neducation with a mission of ``educating for justice.'' For 50 years, \nJohn Jay College has produced leaders, scholars, and heroes in \npolicing, including forensic science, law, fire and emergency \nmanagement, social work, teaching, private security, forensic \npsychology, and corrections. As an international leader in educating \nfor justice, John Jay offers a rich liberal arts and professional \nstudies curriculum to upwards of 15,000 undergraduate and graduate \nstudents from more than 135 nations, including over 47 percent first-\ngeneration students and more than 500 veterans. John Jay College is \nranked No. 3 in the Nation as a ``Best for Vet'' institution by \nMilitary Times in their 2015 national college rankings of 600 \nuniversities and colleges.\n  In the 1960s, a small and dedicated group of academic visionaries \ncame together to develop a plan for a new college named the College of \nPolice Science within the City University of New York. Within a year, \nthe college was renamed the John Jay College of Criminal Justice to \nreflect broader aspirations and achievements in criminal justice, \nleadership, and public service. John Jay was the first Chief Justice of \nthe United States Supreme Court and served as Governor of our great \nState of New York. The college opened in 1965 with 1,000 students and \none major.\n  The challenges and hard work envisioned when John Jay College was \ncreated continue today. John Jay College is a critical part of New \nYork. The spirit of John Jay College of Criminal Justice can be found \nin its students, Pulitzer Prize-winning faculty, and enthusiastic \nadministrators who form a, civic-minded community of motivated and \nintellectually curious individuals committed to public service and \nglobal citizenship.\n  For example, earlier this year, the National Ethnic Coalition of \nOrganizations, NECO, established a scholarship at John Jay College in \nmemory of New York City Police Department Detectives Rafael Ramos and \nWenjian Liu, who lost their lives in December 2014 while serving the \ncitizens of New York. The scholarship was announced on March 11 during \nthe college's NYPD alumni reception held in celebration of the \nlongstanding partnership and collaboration with the NYPD. Of course, \nSeptember 11, 2001 had a profound impact on the campus and served as a \ncatalyst to honor the 67 students, faculty, and alumni who lost their \nlives that day. John Jay established a variety of initiatives, \nprograms, research centers, scholarships, including the creation of the \nCenter on Terrorism to study global terrorism and the Christian \nRegenhard Center for Emergency Response Studies, named after a \nprobationary firefighter killed at the World Trade Center. As one of \nthe leading institutions in the country in the field of criminal \njustice and public safety, John Jay College is one of the few \ninstitutions to offer M.A. students a certificate in the critical study \nof terrorism.\n  John Jay College's commitment to diversity is shown by the fact that \nit has the highest Hispanic enrollment of any 4-year college in the \nNortheastern United States, and it has ranked No. 1 in the Nation in \nawarding bachelor's degree in protective services, No. 3 in psychology \ndegrees, and No. 7 in public administration. John Jay's undergraduate, \ngraduate and doctoral forensic degree programs are top ranking. The \nCollege's Master of Public Administration programs recently received \nthe Diversity and Social Equity Awards by the Network of Schools of \nPublic Policy, Affairs and Administration. The nationally recognized \nProgram for Research Initiatives in Science and Math, PRISM, at John \nJay College engages underrepresented students in careers in science and \nmath by providing an opportunity for them to participate in faculty-\nmentored scientific research in areas like molecular biology, \ntoxicology, criminalistics and computer science, and partake in \nprofessional research conferences while completing their degree. Since \nits inception, graduation numbers from the College's science majors \nhave tripled, and the number of students, and especially \nunderrepresented minority students, moving on to doctoral and medical \ndegrees has grown five-fold.\n  John Jay's faculty personify excellence--they include Pulitzer Prize \nwinners, Presidential scholars, recipients of prestigious book awards, \npresidents of leading professional organizations, and editors of \nprominent scholarly journals. They have been recognized by their peers \nand even by the White House for their dedication to teaching, research, \nand mentoring. The college's students regularly win prestigious \nscholarships, including the Marshal Scholarship, internships, including \nthe White House Internship, and fellowships, including Fulbright, JK \nWatson and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research \nFellowship. They are also accepted to high-profile graduate and \nprofessional schools. Their alumni number more than 54,000, many\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nof whom hold leadership roles in public sector agencies, including the \nUnited States Marshals Service, the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection \nService, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National \nParks Service, the State Department, Peace Corps, the United Nations, \nand private companies in the United States and worldwide.\n  Affordability is an essential component of the college's core \nmission. At a time when over 37 million Americans are saddled with over \n$1 trillion in student debt, John Jay College was recently named one of \nthe top 10 colleges where students graduate with the least debt. Only \n20 percent of John Jay students were compelled to borrow money to \nfinance their college education, less than one-third of the national \naverage. And the vast majority of John Jay students graduate debt-\nfree--enabling them to become successful in service for others without \nhaving to spend years paying off their student loans. In fact John Jay \nCollege was recently ranked No. 4 in the ``Best Bang for the Buck'' in \nthe Northeast rankings in Washington Monthly's College guide.\n  John Jay develops fierce advocates for justice--each committed every \nday to building a better democracy. I am proud to represent John Jay \nCollege of Criminal Justice and the values that it stands for and works \nfor every day. Congratulations to John Jay College on this very \nimportant day and its 50-year record of fighting for justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2525-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 172.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe denial of deduction for certain excessive employee remuneration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Stop \nSubsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with my \ncolleague, Senator Blumenthal. This bill closes a loophole that allows \npublicly traded corporations to deduct an executive's pay that exceeds \n$1 million from their tax bill.\n  Under current tax law, when a public corporation calculates its \ntaxable income, it is generally permitted to deduct the cost of \ncompensation from its revenues, with limits up to $1 million for some \nof the firm's most senior executives. However, a loophole relating to \nperformance-based compensation has allowed many public corporations to \navoid such limits and freely deduct excessive executive compensation. \nTo illustrate how this loophole works, if a CEO receives $15 million in \nperformance-based compensation in a given year, the public \ncorporation's taxable income would decline by $15 million. With the \ncurrent corporate tax rate at 35 percent, the corporation in this case \nwould receive a tax cut of $5.25 million.\n  The Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act would \ninstead allow a public corporation to deduct all forms of compensation \nup to only $1 million per employee. Using the same example above, a \nprofitable public corporation, after deducting only $1 million from the \n$15 million in CEO compensation, would then pay $4.9 million in taxes. \nIn short, instead of costing the government $5.25 million, this public \ncorporation will be paying $4.9 million in taxes, reducing the burden \non middle-class families and our national debt.\n  Indeed, over a 10-year window, the Joint Committee on Taxation, in \ntheir most recent assessment, estimated that closing this loophole \nwould save U.S. taxpayers over $50 billion.\n  First, our legislation extends section 162(m) of the Tax Code to \napply to all employees of publicly traded corporations so that all \ncompensation is subject to a deductibility cap of $1 million. Publicly \ntraded corporations would still be permitted to pay their executives as \nmuch as they desire, but compensation above and beyond $1 million would \nno longer be subsidized through our Tax Code.\n  Second, our bill removes the exemption for performance-based \ncompensation, which currently permits compensation deductions above and \nbeyond $1 million when executives have met performance benchmarks set \nby the corporation's board of directors. As a result, publicly traded \ncorporations would still be able to incentivize their executives, but \nall such incentives would be subject to a corporate deductibility cap \nof $1 million.\n  Finally, our legislation makes a technical correction to ensure that \nall publicly traded corporations that are required to provide quarterly \nand annual reports to their investors under Securities and Exchange \nCommission rules and regulations are subject to section 162(m). \nCurrently, this section of the Tax Code only covers some publicly \ntraded corporations that are required to provide these periodic reports \nto their shareholders. Discouraging unrestrained compensation packages \nshouldn't hinge on whether a publicly traded corporation falls into one \nSEC reporting requirement or another, and our bill closes this \ntechnical loophole.\n  With this legislation, we aim to put an end to some of the \nextravagant tax breaks that exclusively benefit public corporations. \nThis is simply a matter of fairness, ensuring that corporations--and \nnot taxpayers who face their own challenges in this economy--are paying \nfor the multimillion dollar bonuses they have decided to dole out.\n  I want to thank Senator Blumenthal for working with me on this issue, \nand I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Lee, Mr. Hatch, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 1137. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, and the Leahy-\nSmith America Invents Act to make improvements and technical \ncorrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the U.S. is the world's leader in \ninnovation. Yet today, our patent system--which has allowed generations \nof inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs to thrive--is under attack \nfrom bad actors, also known as ``patent trolls''.\n  Abusive patent litigation is stifling the innovation and \nentrepreneurship that our patent system has been designed to protect. \nOver the last decade, there has been an explosion in the growth of this \ntype of harmful litigation as those who exploit abusive patent \nlitigation tactics for financial gain have taken aim at businesses \noperating in every sector of our economy.\n  From Main Street to Wall Street to Silicon Valley, from start-ups to \nneighborhood restaurants to major retailers--businesses and consumers \nacross the country are being harmed. Because of this abuse, innovative \ncompanies spend less time and resources on research and innovation, and \noften must have their talented workforce devote many man-hours to \ndefending against baseless claims. This comes at the expense of \ndiscovering that next medical breakthrough or rolling out new \ntechnologies that will create jobs.\n  Patent trolls prey on businesses by filing frivolous lawsuits and \nemploying an array of heavy-handed and deceptive tactics to scare \nplaintiffs into settlements. These bad actors send vague and overly \nbroad demand letters, exploit loose pleading standards that provide \nlittle substance of the alleged infringement claims, hide their \nidentity behind shell companies, and use the threat of high cost patent \nlitigation discovery as a weapon. This is a drag on our economy, \ncosting an estimated $80 billion annually in direct and indirect costs. \nThis means fewer jobs created, less innovation, and higher costs for \nconsumers.\n  To restore integrity to our patent system, today, along with \nJudiciary Committee Ranking Member Leahy, and Senators Cornyn, Schumer, \nLee, Hatch and Klobuchar, I am introducing the Protecting American \nTalent and Entrepreneurship Act, PATENT Act.\n  This builds upon the reforms made by the America Invents Act and will \npromote the intellectual property rights that our Founding Fathers \nrecognized are key to American innovation. The provisions of the PATENT \nAct will promote more transparency in patent ownership, establish a \nclear, uniform standard for pleading in patent cases, and deter abusive \nlitigation. I would like to note some of the key provisions in the \nbill.\n  The PATENT Act will require plaintiffs in a patent suit to identify \neach patent and each claim that is allegedly infringed, which products \nare infringing, and include a description of the alleged infringement. \nThe current requirements for pleading in a patent\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\nlitigation have been subject to scrutiny by the courts and amount to \nlittle more than notice pleading. By providing these congressionally \nenacted bright line rules across judicial jurisdictions, defendants \nwill be able to better respond to claims and courts will be able to \nresolve litigation more efficiently.\n  This legislation will place reasonable limitations on discovery by \nrequiring courts to stay discovery pending the resolution of specific \npreliminary motions, including motions to dismiss and transfer venue. \nIt also calls on the Judicial Conference to develop rules and \nprocedures to promote efficient and effective discovery, including \nexamining to what extent each party is entitled to ``core documentary \nevidence''.\n  While current law allows for fee shifting in patent cases, the \nreality is that bad actors are almost never subject to fee shifting, \nleading to an explosion in abusive litigation. The PATENT Act provides \nthat reasonable attorney fees will be awarded if the prevailing party \nin litigation makes a showing, and the court finds, that the non-\nprevailing party's conduct was not ``objectively reasonable,'' unless \nspecial circumstances make an award unjust. This measure will help to \ndeter the filing of frivolous claims. The bill also provides a process \nfor the recovery of fees from an abusive litigant.\n  Further, the bill will help stop the widespread sending of fraudulent \nor materially misleading demand letters by building on existing Federal \nTrade Commission authority to go after those who violate Section 5 of \nthe FTC Act in connection with patent assertion by engaging in \nwidespread demand letter abuse. This provision has been carefully \nconstructed so that it will not impinge upon legitimate licensing \nactivity or expand FTC authority. We worked on the language contained \nin this provision with Chairman Thune and his staff, as the Commerce \nCommittee also has jurisdiction over the FTC, and it was important to \nus to get their input.\n  The bill also will help to protect small businesses, who are being \ntargeted for doing nothing more than using products which they bought \noff-the-shelf, by allowing a suit against an end-user to be stayed \nwhile the manufacturer litigates the alleged infringement.\n  This bipartisan legislation is the result of a careful and \ndeliberative process in which we worked with many stakeholders \nrepresenting almost every area of the economy, the judiciary, and the \nadministration. Since the process started in the last Congress, we've \nlistened and tried to be responsive to all the concerns raised from the \ndifferent industries and constituencies. As a result, we have made \ngreat strides in addressing issues that have been raised along the way \nand getting stakeholders comfortable with the bill. So I believe the \nPATENT Act strikes a good balance. Our intent is to protect the rights \nof patent holders while addressing the problem of abusive litigation. \nThe PATENT Act does that.\n  As we move forward, we also intend to try to address other concerns \nthat have been raised more recently by patent holders about the Patent \nand Trademark Office's IPR process. We want to make sure that the PTO \nprocesses are not being abused, and instead are being utilized as \nenvisioned by the America Invents Act.\n  I would like to especially thank Ranking Member Leahy for being an \noutstanding partner on the Judiciary Committee on all things \nintellectual property, Senators Cornyn and Schumer for their sustained \nleadership on the patent troll issue, Senator Lee for his hard work on \nthe demand letter provision, Senator Hatch for his valuable work on the \nrecovery provision, and Senator Klobuchar for her constructive \ninvolvement in moving the bill forward. Because of these efforts, we \nhave a stronger bill and are closer to restoring the integrity of the \npatent system. I am hopeful that we can move in a deliberative and \nproductive way through Committee so we can get to the floor in a timely \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Not later than 30 days after the pretrial conference \n     under rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \n     parties shall jointly submit any proposed modifications of \n     the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and any \n     definition under paragraph (3), unless the parties do not \n     agree, in which case each party shall submit any proposed \n     modification of such party and a summary of the disagreement \n     over the modification.\n       (iv) Computer code.--A court, upon motion and for good \n     cause shown, may determine that computer code should be \n     included in the discovery of core documentary evidence. The \n     discovery of computer code shall occur after the parties have \n     exchanged initial disclosures and other core documentary \n     evidence.\n       (D) Discovery sequence and scope.--The manner and extent to \n     which the parties shall discuss and address in the written \n     report filed pursuant to rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure the views and proposals of each party on the \n     following:\n       (i) When the discovery of core documentary evidence should \n     be completed.\n       (ii) Whether additional document discovery will be sought \n     under subparagraph (C).\n       (iii) Any issues about infringement, invalidity, or damages \n     that, if resolved before the additional discovery described \n     in subparagraph (C) commences, might simplify or streamline \n     the case.\n       (3) Scope of documentary evidence.--In developing rules or \n     procedures under this section, the Judicial Conference should \n     consider which kinds of evidence constitute ``core \n     documentary evidence''.\n       (4) Definitions.--In this subsection the term ``electronic \n     communication'' means any form of electronic communication, \n     including email, text message, or instant message.\n       (b) Judicial Conference Patent Case Management.--The \n     Judicial Conference of the United States, using existing \n     resources, should develop case management procedures to be \n     implemented by the United States district courts and the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims for any civil action \n     arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, \n     including initial disclosure and early case management \n     conference practices that--\n       (1) will identify any potential dispositive issues of the \n     case; and\n       (2) focus on early summary judgment motions when resolution \n     of issues may lead to expedited disposition of the case.\n\n     SEC. 7. FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     in patent cases, reasonable attorney fees should be paid by a \n     non-prevailing party whose litigation position or conduct is \n     not objectively reasonable. As the Supreme Court wrote in \n     adopting this legal standard in the context of fee shifting \n     under section 1447 of title 28, United States Code, this \n     standard is intended to strike a balance; in patent cases, a \n     more appropriate balance between protecting the right of a \n     patent holder to enforce its patent on the one hand, and \n     deterring abuses in patent litigation and threats thereof on \n     the other.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 285 of title 35, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 285.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation with \nSenators Grassley, Cornyn, Schumer, Lee, Hatch and Klobuchar. As \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have been working for \nalmost 2 years to address abusive conduct in our patent system. Our \nlegislation will deter abusive practices while preserving the strength \nof America's patent system. After months of negotiations, we have \nachieved a strong and fair balance that I strongly support.\n  America's patent system has fueled our Nation's greatest \ntechnological advances, creating jobs and spurring innovation. By \npromoting investment in new products and designs, our patent system \ndrives developments that benefit us all. In recent years, however, bad \nactors have abused the patent system to extract money from unsuspecting \ncompanies through broad threats of patent litigation. Coffee shops have \nbeen threatened with patent suits simply for using a Wi-Fi router they \npurchased off the shelf, and website owners have faced costly \nlitigation for using basic software in e-commerce. Instead of using \npatents to drive new creations, some entities are holding up main \nstreet businesses and innovative companies simply to extort financial \nsettlements.\n  The PATENT Act addresses this behavior through several important \nreforms. It will promote transparency to hold bad actors accountable; \ncurb misleading demand letters; and empower customers who have been \nimproperly targeted for simply using a product when the product's \nmanufacturer should defend the suit instead. I have heard about the \nurgent need for these measures from businesses in Vermont and across \nthe country, which is why I included them in the bipartisan legislation \non patent abuses that Senator Lee and I introduced last Congress. This \nprovision has earned widespread support and I am glad it is part of the \nbill we introduce today.\n  The legislation also addresses imbalances in patent litigation that \nmake it unusually difficult and expensive to defend against frivolous \nlawsuits. These measures would require detailed allegations in legal \ncomplaints for patent infringement, establish reasonable parameters for \ndocument discovery to save costs, and ensure that litigants can be held \naccountable for the other side's attorneys' fees if their conduct or \nposition is found by a court to be objectively unreasonable.\n  Drafting legislation that involves the enforcement of patent rights \nis a complex problem that requires time and balance. Congress spent \nmultiple years developing what ultimately became the Leahy-Smith \nAmerica Invents Act of 2011, and we were able to come together to find \ncommon ground and enact that major piece of legislation into law. \nThroughout our negotiations on this bill, I have emphasized the need to \naddress concerns from major manufacturers, inventors, universities, and \npatent law practitioners who warned that, if taken too far, patent \nlitigation reform proposals would harm legitimate patent holders' \nability to protect their rights in court. The legislation we have \nintroduced today is greatly improved as a result of their input.\n  It is worth highlighting some of the changes that have been made to \nthe bill to respond to those concerns, changes which were personally \nimportant to me as we negotiated this legislation. The language in the \nPATENT Act provides for fee shifting only in cases where the court \nfinds that the losing party was not ``objectively reasonable.'' This is \nan important change from the approach of ``presumptive loser pays'' \ncontained in the House's patent reform bill, the Innovation Act. It \npromotes judicial discretion and ensures the burden is on the party \nseeking fees to show that fees should be awarded. An additional \nexception allows the court to refrain from awarding fees if such an \naward would be unjust--for example, because it would cause undue \nfinancial harm to an individual inventor or a public institution of \nhigher education.\n  The PATENT Act simplifies the pleading requirements that are \ncontained in the Innovation Act, and ensures that a plaintiff is not \nrequired to plead information if it is not accessible to them. I am \ngrateful that the other authors of this bill worked with me to ensure \nthat the standard of what a plaintiff is required to plead about \ninfringement of their patent claims tracks Rule 8 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, without creating a higher standard for plaintiffs \nto prove a plausible claim for relief.\n  I am also grateful for the significant work that was done to \nstreamline the discovery provisions of the bill, to protect litigants \nfrom costly discovery while ensuring that legitimate plaintiffs are not \nprejudiced by unreasonable limitations on their ability to access \ninformation. Under the PATENT Act, discovery is stayed while the court \nresolves early, pre-answer motions about whether the case has been \nbrought in the correct venue, against the correct defendants, and \nwhether the complaint states a plausible claim for relief. Discovery is \npermitted if necessary to resolve those motions, to resolve a motion \nfor preliminary relief, or if failure to allow discovery would cause \nspecific prejudice to a party.\n  Taken together, these provisions will help promote efficiency in \npatent suits while ensuring that patent holders can fairly protect \ntheir rights in court. While the provisions are not perfect, they \nstrike a meaningful balance that I am happy to support given the \nunusual complexities of patent litigation.\n  As this legislation proceeds to markup in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee next month, I look forward to considering additional \namendments that will improve this bill. For example, in recent months, \nsome companies and inventors have raised concerns about unfair \npractices that are taking place in the post-grant review proceedings \nthrough which patents can be challenged at the Patent and Trademark \nOffice. Those proceedings were created by the Leahy-Smith America \nInvents Act as an important tool to improve patent quality, but if they \nare being misused or creating inaccurate perceptions in the \nmarketplace, we should address those concerns. I look forward to \nworking with the stakeholders who have already contributed meaningfully \nto this bill.\n  Abusive practices by bad actors are a discredit to our strong patent \nsystem, and it is in no one's interest that they continue. Businesses, \ninnovators and customers that are victims of abusive conduct need us to \ncome together to enact reform.

Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Food \nand Drug Administration issued its proposed tobacco deeming \nregulations. These regulations would give the Agency the same \nregulatory authority it currently has over traditional tobacco \ncigarettes to other unrelated tobacco products such as e-cigarettes and \nhookahs.\n  These regulations are critical for public health, especially for \nchildren. Yet, they have languished within the administration for more \nthan a year. A year is too long to wait because we know what has been \nhappening.\n  According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control--the FDA's \nown Center for Tobacco Products--in the past year, e-cigarette use has \ntripled among teens. Absent any regulation, more and more of these \npotentially dangerous products have found a way into the hands of our \nchildren.\n  After just a few years on the market, children's use of e-cigarettes \nhas now surpassed the use of traditional cigarettes. Think back to the \nfirst time we heard about e-cigarettes. I didn't know what people were \ntalking about. Now we see there are more children using e-cigarettes \nthan traditional cigarettes. This is in large part because we have \nfailed to regulate these addictive products.\n  Until these regulations are finalized, e-cigarette companies will be \nable to freely advertise their products to our children in Juneau and \nto our children in Cleveland.\n  What many people fail to realize is that often e-cigarette companies \nand big tobacco companies are now one and the same. Marlboro-maker \nAltria Group, the Nation's largest tobacco company, is making up for \nits loss in revenue as cigarette smoking has declined--and it is doing \nso among children too--making up its loss of revenue from combustible \ntobacco products by marketing its MarkTen electronic cigarette. \nLorillard has acquired Blu e-cigarettes. Reynolds American, the maker \nof Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes, has a new e-cigarette called VUSE.\n  Much of Big Tobacco's behavior is driven by one giant and irrefutable \nfact: Tobacco in the United States kills 400,000 people a year. Think \nabout that--400,000 Americans die prematurely from tobacco use every \nyear. What does that mean? That means tobacco companies need to find \n400,000 new customers a year. They are not going to market to people \nsuch as the Presiding Officer or me or the people staffing the Senate \nfloor. They are going to people like the pages. They are going to \npeople 16 and 17 years old to addict them to cigarettes. People my age \nrarely start smoking; people their age so often do.\n  Big Tobacco has to find these new customers. It used to be that they \npreyed on children with highly paid, sophisticated tobacco executives \nwho spend their days figuring out how to entice teens to start smoking \nwith characters such as Joe Camel. We think of Camel No. 5, some of the \nthings they did. Now that they are no longer allowed to advertise \ntraditional tobacco products to kids--and parenthetically, that is one \nof the great public health victories in this country, what this body \ndid, what the House of Representatives did, what Presidents did to \nalert public health and to change young people's behavior so young \npeople did not start smoking in larger numbers. That was an effort by \ngovernment and consumer groups and children's groups.\n  These tobacco companies now, though, are taking advantage of the new, \nunregulated world of e-cigarettes to advertise their products directly \nto children because they can. Joe Camel has been replaced by \ncelebrities smoking e-cigarettes. These companies sponsor youth-\noriented events and air ads on TV and radio aimed at teenagers. They \nare using new advertising platforms on social media to get to kids \nwhere parents typically are not looking.\n  The shameful e-cigarette marketing tactics employed by tobacco \ncompanies are encouraging this next new generation to use tobacco, and, \nas the CDC's study shows, their tactics are working--triple the use, \ntriple the number of young people smoking these e-cigarettes.\n  Another recent study revealed that teens were able to purchase e-\ncigarettes online in 94 percent of the attempts they made. None of them \nwere required to show proof of their age when the cigarettes were \ndelivered.\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n  A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that \nexamined the use of candy flavors in tobacco products found that--no \nsurprise here--flavors drive increases in tobacco use among kids. E-\ncigarettes and their refill liquids come in thousands of different \nflavors, such as Gummi Bears, Sweet Tarts, and Fruit Loops. Just look \nat this photo of Gummi Bear-flavored e-liquid. The bottle is about this \nbig.\n  As the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. James \nPerrin, said, ``Because liquid nicotine comes in a variety of bright \ncolors and in flavors appealing to children such as cotton candy and \ngummy bear, it is no surprise that these products have found their way \ninto the hands of children.''\n  I don't think they are making gummy bears to encourage people the age \nof the Presiding Officer, to get them to start smoking, or my age; they \nare getting young children to start smoking. Gummi Bears, Fruit Loops, \nand Sweet Tarts--those are candies young children receive at Halloween. \nThey are also flavors of highly toxic products.\n  The bottle in this photo contains two teaspoons of liquid nicotine. A \nsingle teaspoon of this e-liquid, even if it is highly diluted, can \nkill a small child if ingested. It is totally legal. People will see \nthis sold at drugstores and at all kinds of places. Children are likely \nto pick it up if they see it around the house. There is a chance--there \nalways is in a country of 300 million people--that some child will--\nattracted by this, looking at this, the cute little bottle--will drink \nit, and that child could die.\n  It is past time for the FDA to regulate these dangerous products \nbefore more children and more teenagers get hooked on e-cigarettes.\n  My colleagues and I, led by Senator Merkley, Senator Blumenthal, \nSenator Durbin, and others, have called on the FDA over and over again \nto finalize these proposed rules and reject efforts to weaken these \nproposed regulations. Every day the FDA waits is thousands more \nchildren getting addicted to nicotine, thousands more children getting \nexposed potentially to drinking this very toxic liquid, and thousands \nmore children smoking these e-cigarettes.\n  Tobacco companies are pushing to allow more products to be \ngrandfathered out of the new rules. They want to exempt a huge range of \ne-cigarettes from any review to determine whether they are a threat to \npublic health. That would mean these products would never be subject to \nreview by the FDA. How stupid of a nation can we be? We have been so \nsuccessful in the last 40 years as public health officials, as Members \nof Congress, as responsible adults, as consumer groups and advocates \nfor children. We have been so successful in reducing the incidence of \nsmoking, especially among young people. It has changed the whole next \ngeneration. Yet, now we are letting this happen.\n  E-cigarettes are still tobacco products. They are used by the tobacco \nindustry--I haven't talked about this yet--as a gateway cigarette for \nkids, and that doesn't stop. They see this, and they start smoking \nthese e-cigarettes. Then a year or 2 years, 5 years, 10 years down the \nroad, they will be smoking traditional tobacco and they will be \naddicted, and we know what addiction to cigarettes is for so many of \nour fellow Americans.\n  My colleagues and I urge the Food and Drug Administration to \nstrengthen and finalize these regulations before any more of our \nchildren get hooked on potentially dangerous and addictive tobacco \nproducts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/29/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
