Mr. President, I regret that yesterday's procedural \nvote on the multiyear bipartisan highway bill was not successful. It \nwasn't a vote to approve the bill; it was just a vote to agree to talk \nabout it. We held that vote when we did because we wanted to give the \nHouse more space to work on it. But some Members said they wanted more \ntime to review it before agreeing to talk about it, so we will take \nthat procedural vote again later today. Because we are still determined \nto get this to the House in a timely manner, we expect to work through \nSaturday to ensure that we do.\n  Here are the key components of the legislation:\n  It is a bipartisan, long-term, multiyear measure that will fund our \nroads, highways, and bridges for longer than any transportation bill \nconsidered by Congress in a decade--and this highway proposal will do \nso without raising taxes or adding to the deficit.\n  It will give State and local governments the kind of stability and \ncertainty they need to better plan road and infrastructure projects \ninto the future, while also providing them with more flexibility in \npursuing those projects.\n  It will instill real transparency and accountability into the funding \nprocess, so Americans can actually see where infrastructure tax dollars \nare going and how they are being spent.\n  It will help break the habit of Washington always looking to hike up \nthe gas tax to fund its spending instead of looking for spending cuts \nand efficiencies first. Here is what we know about the gas tax: It hits \nhardest those who struggle just to get by, and too many Americans have \nbeen struggling the past few years. It is not fair to hit those \nAmericans again with yet another unfair policy from Washington.\n  Some people might be a little shocked to see the Senator from \nCalifornia and me working across the aisle to put this bill together. \nSome might have been shocked to see President Obama and Republicans \nworking together to pass important trade legislation for American \nworkers or a Republican Senator from Tennessee and a Democratic Senator \nfrom Washington helping the Senate come to agreement on replacing No \nChild Left Behind. But my view is that if you can agree on a policy \nthat is good for the American people, you should be willing to look \npast the ``D'' or ``R'' next to somebody's name in order to get it \nenacted.\n  Senators from both parties know that a long-term highway bill, which \nwe have all been talking about for literally years, is in the best \ninterest of our country, so we are working together to get a good one \npassed. Thanks to the dedication of both Republican and Democratic \nSenators and their staffs, I am hopeful we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5431-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5431-S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have said that the Senate intends to \nthoroughly review the White House's deal with Iran and then take a vote \non it under the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This is \na review process which allows us to determine whether the \nadministration complied with the law and delivered the complete \nagreement, and it is a review process which continues today.\n  We will have an all-Senators briefing later this afternoon to get a \nmore detailed analysis of the agreement. It will be a time for Senators \nto ask questions and get a stronger sense of whether this deal can be \nverified. I know many are eager to do so. Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle have questions for the Obama administration. Then, tomorrow, \nSecretaries Kerry, Lew, and Moniz will come to the Senate to testify \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee. I know they are expecting a lot \nof serious, thoughtful questions, including from Members of their own \nparty--and they should because the onus is on any administration to \nexplain why a deal such as this is a good one for our country.\n  It is always the administration, not Congress, that carries the \nburden of proof in a debate of this nature, and it seems the \nadministration today has a long way to go with Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. For instance, many\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nMembers in both parties--including Democratic leadership in Congress--\nwarned the administration not to have the U.N. vote on this agreement \nbefore the American people and the Congress they elected had a chance \nto weigh in first. There was no reason to seek U.N. approval first, but \nthe administration ignored Democrats, ignored Republicans, and did so \nanyway. Why? Why did they do that? They need to explain.\n  Is this deal really about keeping America, the region, and the world \nsafer, or is it simply a compendium of whatever Iran will allow--an \nagreement struck to take a difficult strategic threat off the table but \none that might actually empower the Iranian regime and make war more \nlikely? They need to explain this, too, because Iranian leaders, \nincluding the Foreign Minister, have hailed this deal as a victory over \nAmerica. The Iranian Foreign Minister says this is a great victory over \nAmerica. The Supreme Leader even boasted that ``our policies toward the \narrogant US government will not change.'' That is the Supreme Leader of \nIran--``Our policies toward the arrogant US government will not \nchange''--and he said that to chants of ``Death to America'' from the \ncrowd below. Even Secretary Kerry was taken aback by the response from \nIran.\n  We know this isn't about playing to some electorate in Iran because \nthe Islamic Republic isn't truly a republic, and the unelected Supreme \nLeader has no electorate to report to. So we need to move beyond the \nrhetoric--including that the choice here is between a bad deal and war, \nwhich no serious person truly believes--and get to real answers \ninstead. Our committees will be holding hearings that will begin to \nshine a light on this agreement, and they will aim toward getting the \nAmerican people more of the answers they deserve. Tomorrow's hearing \nwill be important, but it is not the end of the process, it is just the \nbeginning. We will have more hearings. We will interview more \nwitnesses. We will continue endeavoring to answer the question of \nwhether this deal will enhance or harm our national security. And then \nwe will take a vote on it on behalf of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5432-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Alexander Hamilton said, ``The first duty of \nsociety is justice.'' If that is true--and I certainly believe it is--\nthen the Republican Senate is failing miserably on its first duty. By \nneglecting to live up to their constitutional duty to provide ``advice \nand consent,'' it is clear the Republican leader and his party are \ndenying justice for the American people.\n  Federal courts depend on us--the United States Senate--to do our job \nso justice can be dispensed in courtrooms across the country. But \nRepublicans clearly have no interest in seeing these courtrooms and \njudicial chambers staffed adequately. So far this Congress, Republicans \nhave confirmed only five judges. By this same point in the last \nCongress of George W. Bush's Presidency, under my leadership, the \nSenate had confirmed 25 judges. Five to one seems unfair. There are \nreal repercussions when Republicans refuse to act. We didn't have \njudicial vacancies then. We did it because it was the right thing to \ndo.\n  If there aren't enough judges to hear the cases that are piling up, a \nvacant judgeship is declared an emergency. At the beginning of this \nyear, there were only 12 judicial emergencies that deserved priority \nattention. Yet, in the mere 7 months of this Republican-controlled \nSenate, the number has doubled and is on its way to tripling very soon. \nAs of today there are 28 judicial emergencies, including 4 judges \ncurrently pending on the floor. But that is really an unfair view \nbecause having them pending on the floor takes into consideration that \nthe Judiciary Committee is doing their job--holding hearings on these \nnominations--and they are not. This is something which was learned \nyears ago when the Judiciary Committee was operated by the present \nchair of the Finance Committee. How he got around having these judicial \nnominations stacked up on the calendar was he wouldn't do the hearings. \nThat is what has now been taking place in the Judiciary Committee.\n  There are real-life consequences to this obstruction. Each judge \nRepublicans block, each nomination they slow-walk results in delay of \njustice. As the maxim goes, justice delayed is justice denied. And that \ncertainly is true.\n  A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted U.S. district judge \nLawrence O'Neill from the Eastern District of California:\n\n       Over the years I've received several letters from people \n     indicating, ``Even if I win this case now, my business has \n     failed because of the delay. How is this justice?'' And the \n     simple answer, which I cannot give them, is this: ``It is not \n     justice. We know it.''\n\n  Judge O'Neill is 1 of 25 judges I worked to confirm in the first 6 \nmonths of the 110th Congress with President Bush. He is absolutely \nright. What is happening now with the judicial emergencies across the \ncountry is not justice. This is Republican politics as usual.\n  We saw it on display last week when the junior Senator from Delaware \ncame to the floor and asked consent to confirm 5 consensus judges to \nthe U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a really important block of judges \ndoing important work for this country. It was not an outlandish \nrequest. After all, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported these \nfive nominations twice--last year under Democrats and again this year \nunder Republicans--but the Presiding Officer, a Republican, objected to \nthat request. His reasoning? The Court of Federal Claims doesn't need \nthese judges. Perhaps the junior Senator from Arkansas should ask the \nchief judge of the Court of Federal Claims if his court does not need \nthose new judges. The chief judge has pleaded for the immediate filling \nof these five vacancies since they are creating a caseload problem for \nthe court. But the freshman Senator from Arkansas had his mind made up \nand blocked every attempt to confirm even a single judge to this \nimportant court.\n  One of his home State newspapers, the Arkansas Times, headlined its \nreport: ``Tom Cotton continues his obstructionist ways.''\n  Yesterday the Washington press took notice that the blocking of these \njudges coincidentally lined up with the interests of a powerful \nconservative law firm that is currently representing clients before \nthis court.\n  A Roll Call headline says: ``Cotton Blocks Judges on Court Familiar \nto His Former Law Firm.'' I don't mean to necessarily point fingers at \nanyone. After all, the junior Senator from Arkansas is only following, \nI assume, the Republican leader's example. There are currently five \ndistrict court judges awaiting votes on the Senate floor. All five were \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously, proving they are \nconsensus, noncontroversial candidates. So why hasn't the Republican \nleader scheduled their confirmation votes? Three of the district \nnominations are classified as judicial emergencies--including one judge \nin the Eastern District of California, and that is the court that Judge \nO'Neill serves. The Republican leader should bring them to the floor.\n  Again, the record is clear. Democrats confirmed all of these judges \nfor President Bush, and the Republicans are basically confirming no one \nfor President\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nObama. Any objective observer would tell you that it is not fair. Not \nonly is 5 to 1 not fair, but it is also the fact that hearings are \nsimply not being held.\n  Maybe it is time for a new strategy. Maybe it is time for the \nRepublican leader to live up to his constitutional duty, do his job, \nand start moving all of these backlogged nominations and directing the \nJudiciary Committee to hold hearings. The American people need these \njudges, and they need them now, working to ensure that everyone gets \nthe justice he or she deserves. To allow these qualified nominees to \nlinger longer is simply unjust and unfair. The American people expect \nmore from the Republican leadership and Congress and deserve better. We \nare going to do everything within our power to bring to the American \npeople's attention that the Republican leadership is not doing a very \ngood job on this and other matters before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, what is the schedule of the Senate today?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5433-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, ahead of tomorrow's hearing in the Foreign \nRelations Committee with Secretaries Kerry, Moniz, and Lew on the \nPresident's announced nuclear deal with Iran, I wanted to take a few \nminutes to address just how far the administration has moved its own \ngoalposts in terms of this purported deal.\n  Over the last few years the administration has made extensive public \nstatements about what would and would not be acceptable in a final deal \nwith Iran, and today it is clear that the final deal falls short not \nnecessarily of other people's expectations but of their own standards \nand their own stated expectations.\n  As Senators consider this proposed deal and whether it should be \napproved or disapproved, I think it is important to have a good \nunderstanding of where the President and his team did not meet their \nown expectations.\n  From the early stages of the negotiation, the Obama administration \nmade clear that a key part of any ``good deal'' would be dismantling \nIran's nuclear infrastructure.\n  Before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary Kerry said back \nin December of 2013 that ``the whole point'' of the sanctions regime \nwas to ``help Iran dismantle its nuclear program.'' However, President \nObama, in previewing the deal in April of this year, essentially \nadmitted that it would fall short of this standard by saying that \n``Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand \nit to do so.'' But weren't our negotiators actually demanding that Iran \ndismantle its nuclear program? That had been our stated policy as the \nU.S. Government. Wasn't that--in Secretary Kerry's own words--``the \nwhole point''?\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel pointed out, instead of \ndismantling the nuclear infrastructure of Iran, the No. 1 state sponsor \nof international terrorism and threat to the safety and stability of \nthe Middle East, this deal legitimatizes and paves the way for their \nnuclear program and its enrichment capability. In fact, by the time \nthis deal expires, the rogue regime in Tehran will have an industrial-\nsized nuclear program.\n  For the duration of the agreement, Iran will be able to conduct \nresearch and development on several types of advanced centrifuges. In \nyear 8, Iran can resume testing its most advanced centrifuges, and in \nyear 9 it can start manufacturing more of them. That is hardly \ndismantlement. That is the opposite of dismantlement.\n  I also want to address another important point that has been made \nconcerning inspections because, as we know, Iran will cheat. So \ninspections take on an especially important role in enforcing any \nagreement that is made. In particular, I want to address this issue of \nanytime, anywhere inspections.\n  In April, President Obama announced that a good deal had been struck \nbetween world powers and Iran and noted that the deal would ``prevent \nit from obtaining a nuclear weapon.'' This is, of course, now known as \nthe ``framework deal''--a precursor to what was announced last week.\n  A few weeks after this announcement, Secretary Ernest Moniz, the \nEnergy Secretary, who was at the table with Secretary Kerry in \nnegotiating this deal, said: ``We expect to have anywhere, anytime \naccess.'' He said that on April 20, 2015. This is a particularly clear \nstatement from someone intimately familiar with the negotiation \nprocess, and, of course, it was well received because this is, at a \nminimum, what needs to be done in order to keep Iran from cheating. But \nby the weekend, the administration was singing a different tune.\n  This is what Secretary Kerry said when he began to backtrack from \nwhat was said by Secretary Moniz on April 20. He said that ``anywhere, \nanytime'' inspections was ``a term that honestly I never heard in the \nfour years that we were negotiating. It was not on the table.'' I don't \nknow whether Secretary Moniz and Secretary Kerry actually talked to \neach other or not. They spent an awful lot of time together in Vienna \nand supposedly would be on the same page. But for Secretary Kerry to \nsay this really incredible statement, that he never heard of this idea, \nand that this was not on the table is simply incredible.\n  So, of course, my question is: Were anywhere, anytime inspections \never on the table? And if not, why did the administration tell us they \nwere--including the Secretary of Energy. And if they were not on the \ntable, why is this deal actually a good deal? Why can we have any sense \nof conviction or belief that Iran won't cheat, especially given this \nRube Goldberg sort of contraption involving notice and this \nbureaucratic process that will basically lead up to a 24-day delay \nbetween when inspections are requested and before inspections can \nactually be done? We know from our experience with Saddam Hussein in \nIraq that it is easy to move things around and avoid the inspectors of \nthe IAEA.\n  This deal today provides that inspectors will have ``managed \naccess''--whatever that means--to suspect sites, but, as I said, it \nallows up to 24 days for Iran to stall inspectors before it actually \ngrants them access, if they ever do. This is another way of saying that \nIran will be able to cheat with near impunity.\n  The administration has also led us astray on a third item, and that \nis Iran's ballistic missile capability. This is the vehicle by which \nIran could launch a nuclear weapon to hit people in the region or even \nfurther.\n  In February of last year, the chief U.S. negotiator, Wendy Sherman, \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that while Iran \nhad ``not shut down all of their production of any ballistic missile,'' \nthe issue was ``indeed, going to be part of something that has to be \naddressed as part of the comprehensive agreement.''\n  Ballistic missiles, as we know, can be used to deliver a nuclear \nweapon, and now under the current deal, the arms embargo in Iran will \nbe completely lifted in just 8 years' time, including on ballistic \nmissiles. I don't think the administration simply changed their minds \nand decided that this wasn't an important issue. I think they simply \ncaved on yet another important item to our national security and that \nof our allies.\n  Earlier this month, for example, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, Martin Dempsey, testified that ``under no circumstances should \n[the United States] relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic \nmissile capabilities and arms trafficking.'' So with this purported \ndeal, the administration has apparently caved once again on something \nthat the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is the No. 1 \nmilitary adviser to the President of the United States, said should be \noff the\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\ntable. Under this negotiation, apparently, it is on the table and part \nof the deal that we will have an opportunity to vote on in September.\n  I have one more example. The President has repeatedly said from the \nbeginning that no deal is better than a bad deal. I agree with that. \nYet right now he and the rest of the administration are telling Members \nof Congress and the American people that there is no other option on \nthe table, and it is either this deal or war.\n  There is a third choice. There are tougher sanctions that will bring \nIran to the table for a better deal and a good deal. It is simply \nunacceptable for the President to be misrepresenting what the options \nare to Congress and the American people by saying ``it is either this \ndeal or war.'' As bad as this deal is, obviously no one wants war.\n  We do know that Iran is an existential threat to our No. 1 ally in \nthe Middle East, the nation of Israel. Iran has been engaged in proxy \nwars against the United States and its allies since at least the early \n1980s--since the early days of the current regime.\n  Well, the President is supposed to be Commander in Chief of the Armed \nForces and the No. 1 person in the U.S. Government when it comes to \nnational security. He took office with the promise to restore America's \nrelationships with our allies around the world, and clearly his promise \nhas not come true. Instead, what the President has delivered during his \ntime in office has been that our allies increasingly do not trust us \nand our adversaries no longer fear us, as evidenced by the coercion and \nintimidation engaged in by Mr. Putin in Eastern Europe.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Even President Jimmy Carter in a recent interview \nadmitted that ``the United States' influence and prestige and respect \nin the world is probably lower now than it was 6 or 7 years ago.''\n  This isn't some Republican criticizing a Democratic President; this \nis Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States and a member of \nthe Democratic Party, who is saying the U.S. influence, prestige, and \nrespect in the world is probably lower now than it was 6 or 7 years \nago.\n  This is a difficult statement to take in, and President Carter has \nbeen wrong about an awful lot of national security issues, but I am \nafraid he is right on that one.\n  So now Congress has an important role to play, and I can't think of a \nsingle more important national security issue we will have an \nopportunity to act on than Iran's aspirations for a nuclear weapon. \nThis is a true game-changer in terms of stability and peace in the \nMiddle East and our own safety and security. I know that I and the rest \nof our colleagues will take full advantage of the opportunity of having \n60 days to review this agreement, to put it under a microscope, and we \nwill have no trouble voting it down if we conclude, as many of us are \nnow starting to do, that it jeopardizes America's security and paves \nthe way for a nuclear-armed Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to commend the \nmajority whip on his outstanding speech addressing the Iran nuclear \ndeal.\n  I rise in a number of capacities. One is as a member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, which will undertake a review of this act, \nand ultimately a vote, as well as the entire Senate. I rise as one who \nvoted for the New START treaty and went through those negotiations in \nthis administration. I rise as a grandfather of nine children with a \ncommitment that the rest of my life is about seeing to it that they \nlive in a world that is as safe, as free, and as productive as the \nUnited States is for us today.\n  I will go through all the due diligence provided for in the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act. I wish to at this point commend Senator \nCorker and Senator Cardin on the outstanding work they did to ensure \nthe American people would have oversight and the Congress would have a \nvote on this deal, but I want to be sure we have a vote on this deal \nthat is meaningful and not superficial.\n  The President decided, for reasons that are his own, to not call this \na treaty and to originally try to avoid any congressional input at all. \nI don't know what those reasons were, but they were his and his alone. \nYet this is the same President who agreed to a treaty with Russia to \nlimit nuclear weapons and bring a vote to the Senate floor. An \nagreement, I might add, which has inspection provisions which are \nrobust, has Russian inspectors in America, American inspectors in \nRussia, and has the type of trust and belief that we can have in any \nnuclear deal.\n  I am worried that the deal we are talking about making with the \nIranians has neither. I am extremely concerned that the President will \nsay, in answer to people who condemn the treaty: Well, if you don't \nlike it, what would you do differently or it is this treaty or this \nagreement or war. We need to live up to our responsibility. It is not a \nchoice of this agreement or war; it is a choice of doing this agreement \nor doing the right thing for the American people.\n  There are three concerns I want to mention. The first is that as a \nbusinessperson, I learned a long time ago that the best deals I ever \nmade were the ones I walked away from before I closed them. The worst \ndeals I ever made were the ones when my arm was behind my back and \nsomebody said: Oh just get it out of the way and do it. Every one of \nthose were bad. Every one of the ones I walked away from and then was \nasked back to the table were good. They were good for a very simple \nreason. If you can't play hard to get in a negotiation, you are going \nto be easy to get.\n  Teddy Roosevelt once said: ``Walk softly and carry a big stick,'' and \nhe was right. This administration walked loudly and carried no stick at \nall. In fact, at the last of the negotiations, all of a sudden there \nappeared new relief of the U.N. Arms Embargo by the Iranian regime at \nthe end of 5 years. This was a nuclear weapons treaty; this was not \nsome agreement about conventional weapons. We don't want to lift the \nsanctions against the Iranians for proliferating conventional weapons \nin the Middle East, but yet this agreement contained that. I think that \nwas a concession we made to them to keep them at the table.\n  We reversed roles. The largest superpower in the world lost its clout \nand the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Iranian Government gained theirs \njust because they were willing to walk away from the table.\n  And then there is the trigger of 8 to 8\\1/2\\ years where, as that \ntime passes, the Iranians will begin to resume fissile nuclear material \ndevelopment. They will do some of their planning for strategic \nmissiles, some of the restrictions of the agreement that will take \nplace in the beginning will go away. Working toward an end where, at \nthe end of 2 years, any agreement that would limit nuclear weapons \nbreakout by the Iranian regime.\n  This started out as a deal to keep the Iranians from getting a \nnuclear weapon, stop nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, and not \nallow the Middle East to become a nuclear arms camp. Unfortunately, I \nam afraid this will not happen if this agreement is adopted in the form \nI understand it to be.\n  So when the President says: What would you do, would you fight a war? \nI would say: No, I would go back to the table. I would say: The \nsanctions got you to the table to begin with; let's keep the sanctions \nto keep you at the table and let's review whether we should have let \nthe conventional arms embargo go away. Let's see if we should allow the \nreworking of fissionable nuclear material at the end of year 6. Let's \nsee if at the year end, the Fordow facility embedded in a mountain \nshould be reactivated to produce nuclear-grade plutonium.\n  All of those triggers along the way in the agreement are just steps \ntoward allowing Iran to become what we said we didn't want Iran to be. \nWe didn't want Iran to be a nuclear arms power in the Middle East to go \nthrough nuclear proliferation. I am afraid this is just a staged \nplatform from which that is exactly what will happen.\n  I will listen to every word by the administration. I will go to every \nbriefing. I will do my due diligence as a\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\nSenator of the United States and as a representative of the people of \nGeorgia.\n  When I cast that vote, it is going to be in the best interest of my \nchildren and grandchildren and yours. It is going to be making the best \ndeal we can make for the American people, doing everything we can to \nlimit the proliferation of nuclear weapons and doing everything we can \nto get those who say ``death to America'' before every speech \nunderstand that America is the greatest democracy on the face of this \nEarth.\n  We will walk softly, but we will carry a big stick, and we will \ninsist on negotiations that are good not just for the other side but \nfor the American people as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on Monday, the United Nations Security \nCouncil voted to accept the agreement that was negotiated over Iran's \nnuclear program.\n  I think it is very telling that President Obama decided to take his \nplan to the United Nations before bringing it to the Congress. I think \nthe President is hoping to force Congress--to bully Congress--to go \nalong with his plan without actually giving it serious debate. Well, we \nare going to have a serious debate. I believe President Obama and his \nnegotiators failed to get the strong deal they promised, and it remains \nto be seen whether this deal is good enough.\n  United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power called me after the deal had \nbeen agreed to by the President and by Iran and she told me the \ngreatest weakness of the deal was its complexity. So I have to ask: Why \nis the President in such a rush? The American people have every right \nin the world to have their voices heard on this important issue.\n  I was at home in Wyoming over the weekend and I got an earful about \nwhy this deal is so bad and about the risk it poses to our own U.S. \nnational security. Congress also has the right and the responsibility \nto provide oversight on this plan, and there has been bipartisan \nskepticism and concern on this floor about this specific deal.\n  So we need to take a very close look at the agreement over the next 2 \nmonths. We are going to listen to our constituents, and we will have \nhearings to make sure all the facts are clear, starting tomorrow in the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  While the Senate does its part in evaluating the deal, I think we \nhave to keep in mind two key questions. First, do we believe this is a \ngood deal that will protect the American people, protect our allies far \ninto the future and not just for a few years and, second, what evidence \nis there that the Iranian regime plans to change its illegitimate and \ndangerous behavior in any way?\n  This agreement accepts Iran as a nuclear threshold state on the \npremise that we can build a better relationship with the country's \nleaders. How realistic is that? Iran is still holding American \nhostages. Iran continues to support Bashar Assad in Syria. Iran \ncontinues to support Palestinian terrorist groups. Even President Obama \nadmits this behavior is likely to continue under the deal he \nnegotiated. Can we afford to allow this Iranian regime to have the \nnuclear program it will get at the end of this deal? President Obama \nwants to put off the answer to this question until after he has left \noffice. Congress needs the answer now.\n  People on both sides of the aisle have raised many appropriate \nconcerns about this deal. One issue is that before the agreement was \nannounced, Iran had more than 19,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium. \nAfter the deal is fully implemented, Iran will still have more than \n19,000 centrifuges. Not a single one will be dismantled under this \nagreement. Some of them may go into storage, some of them may be turned \noff, but eventually that could be brought back again and turned back \non. More than 5,000 of them will continue to spin and to enrich \nuranium.\n  Iran can continue to conduct research and development on more \nadvanced centrifuges. It says right in the deal that ``Iran will \ncontinue testing'' advanced centrifuges--and it can actually \nmanufacture them for specific purposes. Once the restrictions end, Iran \ncan produce as many of these advanced centrifuges as it wants. They \nwill have already done the work and they will know how to build them \nand how to use them. President Obama had the leverage--he had the \nleverage--to push for more on this point. Why didn't he use it?\n  This bill doesn't dismantle a single centrifuge; it does dismantle \nthe sanctions against Iran. That is another very real concern a lot of \npeople have.\n  While it will not happen overnight, Iran is likely going to gain \naccess to what will eventually amount to more than $100 billion. This \nmassive injection of resources is ultimately a direct deposit into \nIran's terrorism accounts. Why was there nothing in this agreement to \nstop Iran from using this money in ways that could harm America and our \nallies?\n  And there is the extremely important issue of whether this agreement \nallows us to inspect Iran's nuclear facilities anywhere and anytime. \nPresident Obama said that is how we would verify that Iran was living \nup to its promises. It turns out that the reality is very different \nfrom what the White House promised. Now the President says that \ninspectors will have access ``where necessary, when necessary.'' That \nis a big difference. Who gets to decide what is necessary?\n  Under the actual agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency \ncan request--can request--access to a location in Iran if it is \nworried. That is not anywhere, any time; that is anywhere, anytime Iran \nchooses.\n  Iran can refuse to give access to the site, and it gets 2 weeks to \nnegotiate what inspectors can do. If the two sides can't work it out \nwithin 14 days, then the issue gets turned over to a commission of \neight countries that are part of the agreement. Then the Commissioners \nhave another 17 days to resolve the issue by a majority vote. After \nthat, Iran gets another 3 days to comply. It is as much as 24 days in \ntotal. So we went from anywhere, anytime, 24/7, to 24 days.\n  A former Deputy Administrator at the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration recently wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about \nthis very subject. He said 24 days is ``ample time for Iran to hide or \ndestroy evidence.'' Twenty-four days, which is what the President \nagreed to, is ample time for Iran to hide or destroy evidence.\n  President Obama says we will be able to tell if Iran is violating the \nagreement. That is an important difference of opinion, and Congress is \ngoing to have to resolve that over the next 2 months.\n  It is very clear President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry were \ndesperate to get a deal with Iran, even if it was a very bad deal. Both \nthe President and the Secretary of State are lameducks, and they are \nlooking to build their legacy. Iran knew that, and Iran took advantage \nof that fact. At the last minute, to make sure they could actually get \na deal signed, the President and the Secretary of State agreed to let \nRussia sell Iran ballistic missile technology. This technology can be \nused to attack our allies and even to threaten the United States. Why \nwas this even a part of this agreement over Iran's nuclear program? The \nweek before the deal was announced, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff told the Senate Armed Services Committee: ``Under no \ncircumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic \nmissile capabilities and arms trafficking.'' So why did it end up as \npart of the deal? Why did the President, yet again, ignore the advice \nof his military commanders on this vital national security issue?\n\n  At the end of the day, this deal does not take away Iran's pathway to \na nuclear weapon. It merely gets Iran to promise that for the next few \nyears it will walk down the path very slowly. President Obama may think \nthis deal is good enough to help his legacy. There are still a lot of \nquestions about whether it is good enough to keep the American people \nsafe and the rest of the world as well.\n  Our goal all along should have been an agreement that was \naccountable, enforceable, and verifiable. At this point, I have serious \ndoubts about whether this deal is good enough.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, back home this weekend in Indiana I took\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nthe time very carefully to read through all 159 pages of the agreement \nmade with Iran, as well as a lot of supporting material written by the \nforeign policy experts who had an opportunity also to look at this. I \nread it carefully because words mean a lot. As concerned as I was when \nwe started this process, I became much more concerned after reading \nthrough the fine print that is now called the agreement with Iran.\n  Yesterday we returned to Washington to start the session this week. I \nhad the opportunity as a member of the Select Intelligence Committee to \nlook over the classified annexes of this. There is still one \noutstanding, which we will be looking at as soon as we receive it. The \nmore I read, the more concerned I am that we have struck not a good \ndeal, not a passable deal that we have to accept, but a bad deal--a bad \ndeal that is clearly worse than no deal.\n  Four Presidents--three previous Presidents and this current \nPresident--have declared over the years of their service that a \nnuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable. Each person, each President used \nthat very word ``unacceptable.'' But this deal intends simply to slow \ndown Iran's march to nuclear weapons capability. Even the White House \nhas conceded now that it will not permanently stop Iran's nuclear \nambitions. This, in and of itself, should raise major questions and \nconcerns about this agreement.\n  But perhaps more concerning is what the negotiations conceded in \norder to reach an agreement with a regime--a regime that calls America \nits enemy, brazenly violates U.N. resolutions, sponsors terrorism, \nthreatens Israel's existence, is led by individuals who proclaim \n``death to America,'' and is responsible for more than 1,000 military \ndeaths since September 11, 2001. This is the regime we are dealing \nwith.\n  Six of the major powers in the world, led by the United States--or at \nleast we thought they would be led by the United States--having all the \nleverage of their status in world affairs, were negotiating with a \ncountry that violates all that I have just listed, that cannot be \ntrusted, that simply is in a weak position given the sanctions, \nthankfully, that the Congress has imposed and other Presidents have \nimposed and is put in a situation where it should have the weak hand. \nIt turns out they had the strong hand against the weakness and the lack \nof will and resolve of the six nations--France, United Kingdom, \nGermany, the United States, China, and Russia. That group was on one \nside of the table with the leverage that group would have against Iran, \nwhich has not gained the trust of anyone except its loyal followers--a \nnation that is staggering because of the sanctions that have been \nimposed--and which ends up being the strong hand working against the \nweak. The will and resolve to stand tough to achieve an agreement that \nwas in the benefit of not just the United States but the world for a \nmore secure Middle East and prevention of nuclear weapon possession by \nIran has been negotiated away.\n  Clearly, in the coming weeks we will be talking about various aspects \nof this agreement. The time is limited today, so I will just go into a \ncouple of issues.\n  The period covered by the deal is way too short. There was the \npromise that Iran would not have the capability to develop nuclear \nweapons, and it is specifically now on a pathway to acquiring them.\n  President Obama has admitted that in these future circumstances, \nIran's breakout time to nuclear weapons will be essentially zero. That \nis what he said some time ago. But, of course, now the President, the \nSecretary of State, and the White House are making public statements \nsaying: Well, that is really not what we meant. And they said a number \nof things to reassure the American people: Trust us; everything is \ngoing to be OK.\n\n  What particularly grabbed my attention was the inspection regime. \nClearly, on any kind of agreement of this type, there has to be as \ntight a regime of inspections as possible. We know Iran has cheated in \nthe past. We know they are going to try to cheat in the future. They \nare going to try to interpret every nuance and every word in this \nagreement as something different than what we will describe. Therefore, \nverification of their ability to live by the word of the agreement, as \nbad as it is, has to be verified completely. When you look at the \nsections necessary to accomplish that, it raises real concerns. I will \nspend more time on this floor later, given the constraints here, to \ntalk about this inspections regime.\n  But let me address an issue that has just come to light. I was \nsitting and plowing through this agreement. When I came to section 78, \nit started listing the timeframe for how we would proceed if we found \nthat there was information to suspect Iran was cheating on the \nagreement. You have heard 24 days is the maximum, which, by the way, is \nlonger than just about any agreement we have entered into in an arms \nagreement. For many of these, it has been 9 hours. Everybody knows that \nwe have given up anywhere, anyplace. We now have to have Iran's \napproval before we move forward with a convoluted, byzantine process in \nterms of getting to a point where a resolution is made. We now know, \nreading through sections 78 to 82, I believe, that it doesn't add up to \n24 days. It adds up to 54 days. We are talking nearly 2 months or more.\n  I was interested to open up the Wall Street Journal this morning: \n``Iran Inspections in 24 Days? Not Even Close.''\n  As I was sitting there, it was being pounded into our heads by the \nSecretary of State saying: 24 days, that is all it is--24 days. We are \non top of this. We can get it resolved. Don't worry; they can't move \ntheir stuff somewhere else or cover their tracks or remove evidence of \nwhat we suspect is a violation of the agreement. Over and over and over \nthe Secretary of State and the President of the United States said 24 \ndays. First of all, 24 days is not a good deal, as I just mentioned. It \nought to be 24 hours or less--anytime, anywhere. What did we do to \nanytime, anywhere? We stretched it out to 54 days. Despite what the \nadministration has said about this, I cannot believe that the clear \nreading--read sections 78 to 82, I believe it is, and add it up. It is \n54 days of time if all time is used to come to an agreement.\n  What can you do in 54 days when you have been accused of cheating? \nYou remove the evidence. That is exactly what they will do. This is a \nhuge revelation here that is now in print. The administration keeps \ninsisting that this is not the case: Don't worry, folks; we have it \ncovered on inspections. That simply is false.\n  So let's say we find out they are cheating. When our negotiators \nabandoned their position on gradual sanctions relief, they opted \ninstead for this so-called snapback provision that would punish Iran \nfor noncompliance, for cheating. Read the agreement. There is a \nconvoluted, byzantine scheme for such a return to sanctions that would \nbe exceedingly time consuming and is not politically realistic. It is \nan illusion--and more on this later.\n  The arms embargo is lifted, and on and on it goes.\n  I listed just a couple of very deeply concerning issues here that \nneed to be discussed. Unfortunately, we have been put in a box by this \nadministration. They ran straight to the United Nations to get approval \nfor this without America's elected representatives and the American \npeople having an opportunity to have the deal presented to them and for \nthem to make the decision. So five of the six nations involved here--\neven if the United States comes to the point where we defeat this \neffort, if it is possible to do so--now have the full green light to go \nforward. Germany rushed over with contracts in hand with their Commerce \nMinister and heads of major corporations are signing off deals like you \nwouldn't believe. Those aren't going to be snapped back.\n  We now have an opportunity to review this pending deal, and I would \nurge every Member of the Senate to take the time to sit down and read \nthis agreement through carefully. Look at what the experts--the foreign \npolicy experts--have said about it. Look at where the flaws are, and \nlet's sit down and discuss it. Let's look at those top secret \nclassified annexes--every Member here has the opportunity to do that if \nthey so choose--and bring forward to the American people--that which we \nare allowed to bring forward that is not classified--the flaws of what \nhas turned out to be an agreement that simply is not in the interest of \nthe future of the American people.\n  My time has expired. Let me just wrap up by saying that the President\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\nhas defended this deal by challenging critics who put forward \nalternatives. How about this? How about exercising American leadership \nand making it clear that crippling sanctions will be maintained and \nstrengthened if Iran nuclear activity continues? Congress should reject \nthis bad deal. We then can enact more vigorous sanctions to persuade \nthe Iranian leaders to reconsider their position or persuade the \nIranian people to reconsider their leaders.\n  Mr. President, I apologize for going over my time. I yield the floor \nto my colleague from North Carolina, and I see my colleague from Maine \nis waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I have come to talk about what I think we \nhave reached here--a tipping point in terms of President Obama's \nlegacy.\n  Recently, Jimmy Carter emphatically charged that President Obama has \nweakened us and brought us less respect everywhere in the world. When \nPresident Carter makes a statement such as that, I don't think \nPresident Obama should be spiking the football in the Rose Garden.\n  Why do you think President Carter made those statements? Maybe he has \nlooked at the legacy over the last 6 years, as many of the American \npeople have. Ukraine is on fire. China is threatening its neighbors. Al \nQaeda is stronger than ever. ISIS is massacring Christians and Muslims \nwith genocidal savagery the likes of which we haven't seen since the \nSecond World War. The Jewish people are facing the greatest threat \nsince the Holocaust.\n  The President got this deal with the ayatollahs, no matter how \ndangerous and no matter how destabilizing the final accord is. He has \nclaimed a victory, and the media vanguards are right behind him, and he \nis going to late-night comedy cable shows to build his case.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is no laughing matter. You are going to \nhear a lot of speeches over the next few weeks--in the 60 days we have \nto review this deal. There are going to be a lot of technical terms, a \nlot of things that quite honesty some Members of Congress don't fully \nunderstand. But I hope that over the next 60 days we will be able to \ncommunicate to the American people in a way that they understand why \nthis is a very dangerous deal.\n  Here are some questions I hope you will look into and form your own \nopinion.\n  One question: Is there truly a dismantlement of Iran's nuclear \nprogram? I have looked at the summary of the agreement. I have not read \nthe full text yet. I will be doing that this week. But it is very clear \nthis is not a matter of whether Iran can have a nuclear weapon; it is a \nmatter of when they can have a nuclear weapon. That is not \ndismantlement; that is scheduling.\n  There is another one. I think my colleague from Indiana just spoke \nabout it. It has to do with inspections. We use terms like ``snapback'' \nand everything else, but let's put this in very simple terms. Imagine \nthat the police in your community suspected there was a criminal \nenterprise in some house. Imagine that instead of being able to get a \nwarrant and then quickly go and knock on the door and identify that \ncriminal activity, the police would send a letter to the criminal \nsaying: In the next 4 or 5 weeks, 3 or 4 weeks, we are going to do a \nsurprise inspection on your house. What is the likelihood that criminal \npresence or that criminal activity is going to be there? That is the \nnature of the inspections regime with the nation that still continues \nto chant ``Death to America.'' They are not a good player. They are not \na good actor. Giving them time to prepare for a so-called snap \ninspection makes no sense to me, but that is what is in this deal, and \nit is written out in plain English.\n  Another question is this: Why hasn't the President done something as \nbasic as have the Iranian people--or the Iranian leadership, I should \nsay; this is not about the people, it is about the leadership--show \ngood faith by releasing American prisoners in Iran?\n  As far as the ballistic missile program, ask the President, ask the \npeople who negotiated this agreement: Will Iran have a ballistic \nmissile program? The answer is yes. They actually have backorders for \nmissiles that could reach Europe. Over time, they will develop a \nprogram that will reach the United States. This agreement has no \ntreatment for this.\n  Ask them if they will dismantle the Iran terror network. The Iran \nterror network operates throughout the world. The Iran terror network \nis funded literally through the Government of Iran. Over $300 million \nhas been identified by Canadian intelligence agencies as having been \nfunneled to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and a \nnumber of others. Are they going to dismantle it? No. As a matter of \nfact, I believe that with the sanctions being removed, it is going to \nprovide them more money to fund those networks.\n  Why would the President release $140 billion in sanctions? Why would \nwe do that? Why would we provide money to a nation that says they need \nmoney but they can spend money on terror and a number of other things--\nnot education, not fixing roads, not better health care for Iranians, \nbut spreading terror throughout the world? Why on Earth would we give \nthem more money to do that?\n  The President has given birth to the Middle East nuclear arms race as \nwell. Ask yourself this question: Do you think it is likely that Saudi \nArabia, Turkey, Egypt, and other Gulf States are going to stand idly by \nwhen a hostile regime is going to have a nuclear capability over some \nperiod of time? Of course not. They are going to do what they need to \ndo to feel like they are protecting their citizens. It will give rise \nto an arms race. We will be taking about this if this deal goes through \nI think in my tenure as a Senator over the next 5 years.\n  President Obama has willfully ignored 40 years of hostility from \nTehran. The President may not recognize that we are at war, but the \nIranians certainly do. They say in public statements that they are \ngoing to continue their fight against America. They are a chief sponsor \nof global terror. They have never stepped back from their desire to \nobliterate the United States and our great friend and ally Israel.\n  This is the Obama doctrine. The President sees America as the \nproblem. He views Israel as an obstacle to peace and Iran as another \noppressed constituency with legitimate grievances against the West. In \nfact, so much so, when millions of Iranians took to the streets to \nprotest the mullahs--the leaders of Iran--the President was silent. The \nold American alliances are collapsing in confusion and fear, and the \nonly answer from the administration seems to be a clear path toward \nIran possessing a nuclear weapon.\n  In his 1987 State of the Union Address, President Ronald Reagan \nwarned:\n\n       Our approach is not to seek agreement for agreement's sake \n     but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our \n     national security and that of our allies. We will never put \n     our security at risk or that of our allies just to reach an \n     agreement. . . . No agreement is better than a bad agreement.\n\n  So there you have it. Our allies--Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf \nStates, Jordan, Egypt--are worried. Tehran is on the march and moving \ncloser to a nuclear weapon. Charles Krauthammer noted, ``The one great \nhope for Middle East peace, the strategic anchor for 40 years [the \nUnited States] is giving the green light to terror.'' Ladies and \ngentlemen, I don't think that is a legacy anyone should be proud of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Mr. President, I am on the floor today to discuss the \npath forward on my bill, the Women Veterans and Families Health \nServices Act of 2015. This is legislation which would end VA's decades-\nold ban on fertility services, and it would take critical steps toward \nensuring that we are doing everything we can to support veterans who \nhave sacrificed so much for our country and have suffered injuries on \nthe battlefield that prevent them from having children on their own.\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\n  I introduced this legislation because I believe strongly that our \ncommitment to servicemembers doesn't stop at the end of their tours. I \nbelieve that commitment doesn't stop at all, ever. And a critical part \nof this commitment--of what our country should do to make sure those \nwho sacrificed so much for us can live the lives they hoped for--is \nhelping seriously wounded veterans start families so that those who put \ntheir lives on hold and on the line have the opportunity to achieve \nthat important goal.\n  Caring for our veterans should never be a partisan issue, and helping \nour wounded warriors start families should rise above the petty \npolitical fights we see too often in Washington, DC. So I was very \nproud to work with Republicans on the Veterans' Affairs Committee on a \nbipartisan compromise, one that should have allowed my veterans health \ncare act to pass through the committee today with strong bipartisan \nsupport, as it has in the past. And until yesterday, that was exactly \nwhat I thought was going to happen. My bill was on the agenda. It was \ngoing to come up for a vote, and I thought it was going to pass. That \nis why I am so disappointed and truly angry that Republicans on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee decided yesterday to leap at the \nopportunity to pander to their base, to poison the well with the \npolitical cable news battle of the day and turn their backs on these \nwounded veterans.\n  Just a few Republicans with just a few poison-pill amendments have \nturned our bipartisan effort to help wounded veterans into a partisan \neffort to attack women's health care. I find that shameful. That is \nwhy, after it became clear that there was not a path to getting those \npolitical amendments withdrawn today, I spoke with Chairman Isakson and \nI asked him to pull the bill from the markup rather than see it become \na vehicle for partisan, political attacks.\n  I know some Republicans are trying to use this latest issue as just \none more opportunity to roll back the clock and take away women's \nhealth care options. We can have that fight. We have had it many times \nbefore. But we should not be putting veterans in the middle of it. \nDon't take something that should be above politics--our sacred duty to \nour veterans--and pull it down into the muck of petty politics. It is \nnot fair to these veterans and it is not fair to their families, who \nhave been hoping and praying for the opportunity to have children. It \nis not fair to the veterans and servicemembers, who don't want to see \ntheir health care become just one more political football. And it is \ncertainly not fair to our constituents, who send us to Congress \nexpecting us to stand together and support those who sacrificed so much \nfor all of us.\n  I am going to keep fighting for them and for this effort. I am not \ngoing to let those who put politics ahead of veterans and \nservicemembers get their way.\n  I truly do hope Republicans reconsider this absolutely shameful \napproach today and work with us to get this bill done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I join my extraordinarily dedicated \nand distinguished colleague from Washington State in expressing my \nregret that this bill will not be on our agenda today, and I thank her \nfor championing a cause that matters so vitally to our military men and \nwomen, which is the cause of fairness to our veterans and putting our \nveterans above politics.\n  The bill she has advocated steadfastly and so eloquently provides \nservices to wounded women warriors who want to have children and cannot \ndo so because of those wounds of war. It makes available to them modern \nmedicine, just as we are trying to do in other areas where the \nsignature wounds of war inflict such damage on our wounded warriors. \nThey deserve the right to treatment that enables them to have families, \nenables them to overcome those wounds of war that interfere with their \nability to have children.\n  That is important not only to them but to their families, to their \nhusbands. Many of their husbands are themselves veterans. This issue \nhas ramifications way beyond the individuals involved. It is a matter \nof putting our veterans above politics, which traditionally has been \nour practice on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  I am very proud to serve as the ranking member of that committee, to \nhave worked with Senator Murray in her tireless efforts on this bill \ngoing back years. She has been rightly recognized for those efforts. \nToday I very much regret the tradition of our committee--putting \nveterans above politics--has succumbed to this threat; that the bill \noffered by Senator Murray will become mired down in issues that have \nnothing to do with providing IVF services to our wounded women \nwarriors.\n  The amendments that have been offered are completely irrelevant and \nextraneous to the objectives of the bill. Make no mistake, they have \nnothing to do with protecting women, they have nothing to do with \nenabling our women veterans to have children and overcome those wounds \nof war. They are completely irrelevant, indeed contrary to the \nobjectives of that bill. Yet they will now cause this bill to be \nremoved from the agenda.\n  I just want to say to my colleague and fellow member of that \ncommittee that I am absolutely determined to find a path forward for \nthis bill. It will be a priority of mine personally. I know it is a \npriority of the Senator from Washington, and I will join her in \nensuring that our colleagues know we are determined to move forward, to \nfind a path to pass this measure, and to make sure our women veterans \nare recognized for the heroes they are.\n  These amendments are a disservice to them. Very simply, they are \ndisrespectful to the women who sacrificed so much, who have suffered \nthe same wounds as our men, and who receive less respect by virtue of \nthis bill being withdrawn. I am hopeful we can work with Senator \nIsakson, chairman of the committee, to find that path forward. He has \nbeen very bipartisan in his approach, and I thank him for his efforts \nin that respect.\n  I will redouble my efforts to make sure we keep faith with our women \nveterans, enabling them to overcome those injuries that prevent them \nfrom having children and giving up the benefit of their being such \ngreat parents and giving our Nation great children, which is our \nobligation on this committee, in this body, and in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5438-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5438-S5441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DRIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to be going over \nand concentrating on some of the things that are in this bill, just \nconcentrating on bridges, something people are not as aware of as they \nshould be. Now what I am talking about is that sometime today we are \ngoing to be repeating the vote that we had yesterday, except this time \nwe should be able to get it adopted.\n  I don't criticize any of the Democrats who voted against the motion \nto proceed to the highway bill yesterday because they did not get \ninformation in a timely fashion. It was our fault that they did not get \nthe information until about 30 minutes before the vote. I understand \nthat. Now they have had 24 hours to look it over. I think they will be \npleased to support the long-term highway bill. So I was not one who \ncomplained about that.\n  That vote will take place today. That is to get us to the bill, so we \ncan start on amendments. I am going to ask as many of our Members to \nbring down amendments, if they have amendments, so we can get them in \nthe queue to discuss. There are three committees involved. The very \nlargest piece of the bill is the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, which is the committee that I chair.\n  When I say the vast majority of that, what I am talking about is 80 \npercent of the bill. So that has been available for inspection by the \npublic, by the Democrats, the Republicans, by all of the Members ever \nsince June 24. June\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\n24 is when we passed this bill out of the committee by a unanimous \nvote. Every Democrat, every Republican on the committee voted for it.\n  Now, there are some people, I suppose, who are going to be playing \npolitics with this bill on this vote. They have to realize this is an \nissue that needs to be addressed. I would say this, there are two \nthings that were voiced as objections. Some voted no because they did \nnot get everything they wanted in the bill. Some of them thought they \nwould be able to get a better deal.\n  Let me just address that. The bill is too important to play politics \nwith. If we wait until we have more time, then we are going to be in \ntrouble and miss the construction season. The problem with this is, \nparticularly those Northern States will miss an entire construction \nseason if we do the alternative. What is the alternative? The \nalternative is to go back; instead of a 6-year-funded reauthorization \nbill, go back to short-term extensions. Short-term extensions are an \nineffective use of highway dollars. Short-term extensions are not the \nconservative position but they also would miss an entire construction \nseason. I understand that the House is talking about trying to do an \nextension to the end of the year. If they do that, then States like \nPennsylvania--that is where Congressman Shuster is from--will miss an \nentire construction season. So I think that is critical.\n  If you talk to any Governor, any mayor, and any State department of \ntransportation about the urgency of the timing of this bill, they will \ntell you that if we miss this opportunity to authorize a 6-year bill, \nwith 3 years of identified funding this summer, we will miss the 2016 \nconstruction season. So the strongest supporters of this bill are the \nofficials closer to the people at home--the mayors, the Governors, the \nState departments of transportation. So that is what we are going to be \nfaced with.\n  To address the second point and objection, I have been approached by \nmany Members on both sides of the aisle who have said they are planning \nto vote no today because their program did not get enough funding for \nAmtrak or bike trails or sidewalks or something else in this bill. We \ndid not go far enough toward their project.\n  Well, look, I am in the same situation. This will be my sixth highway \nbill that I have actually authorized. Three of those I was the primary \nsponsor. I can tell you these bills are about compromise. Not everybody \ngets exactly what they want. I assure you I did not get everything I \nwanted in our unanimous EPW markup with Senator Boxer. Now, keep in \nmind, Senator Boxer is a very proud liberal, I am a very proud \nconservative. Yet we agreed wholeheartedly on this. We led the fight to \ncome out with a unanimous bill.\n  The House is watching us very closely. They are even discussing \ntaking our good work, doing it, taking it up in the House. I think that \nis what would happen. There are a lot of them over there saying, no, \nthey don't want to do that. They want to have a part-time, short-term \nextension to the end of the year because I think they can get that into \nsome kind of tax reform.\n  Again, you miss a construction season, and you are wasting valuable \ntime and money. So we do not want to do that, but I want to get into \nsome of these tales, talking about our bridges. There are over 60,000 \nstructurally deficient bridges in this country. The first chart shows--\nthe diagram there--the darker color, that is where the heaviest, the \nmore serious problems are right now.\n  Look at my State of Oklahoma. For a Western State, we have greater \nproblems than many of the States have. In fact, one out of every four \nbridges is structurally deficient. The American Society of Civil \nEngineers gives our bridges a grade of C+.\n  Now, how did we get here? President Eisenhower's legacy system was \nbuilt with a 50-year lifespan. In many parts of this country we have \nexceeded that lifespan. We are out of warranty, I say to the Chair. \nThat is why we need to get it done. MAP-21 was the right step for \nbringing us into the 21st century, but a long-term solution has been \nneeded to fix the $112 billion in backlog of rehabilitation for our \nNation's bridges.\n  So 430 of the 435 congressional districts have structurally deficient \nbridges. This means that all but five Members of the House of \nRepresentatives have bridges back home in need of major repair in their \ndistricts. This is everybody's problem.\n  In my State of Oklahoma we have two of the top 10 worst districts by \nnumber of deficient bridges. One of our districts is ranked second in \nthe Nation. Congressman Frank Lucas's district is a rural district that \ncovers about half of the State, but there aren't many people in there. \nHe said there are over 2,000 deficient bridges just in one \ncongressional district. In Congressman Markwayne Mullin's district, \nthere are 1,205 deficient bridges.\n  I know firsthand that the Oklahoma Department of Transportation has \nworked tirelessly to address the needs for bridge safety, but they need \nlonger term certainty in a Federal partnership to make this happen. \nThis is what this bill is all about. In light of the Nation's bridges, \nwe have to do more to prioritize safety and stability. We can't wait \naround for another collapse to fix the crumbling bridges. A bridge \ncollapse or closure brings significant and sudden economic impacts to \nthe impacted region.\n  The economic cost of the I-35 West bridge collapse in Minnesota--and \nwe all remember that; that was all over the news in 2007--averaged \n$400,000 a day of economic loss. The Minnesota Department of \nTransportation found that the State's economy lost $60 million as a \ndirect result of the collapse.\n  This is that bridge, as shown in this picture I have in the Chamber. \nYou remember that it had a lot of publicity at the time. Then all of a \nsudden it is kind of a wake-up call. People realize this is for real. \nWe need to do something about it.\n  In 2013, the Skagit River Bridge collapse on Interstate 5 in \nWashington State had similar effects on the local economy, with an \nestimated impact of $8.3 million during the 26-day closure and repair \nof this bridge.\n  The Brent Spence Bridge is a bridge in need of repair. It connects \nCincinnati, OH, to Kentucky. This is an old bridge, which you can see \njust by looking at it. That is one that would have to be replaced.\n  It would be impossible to do that in anything except a long-term \nbill. You cannot do that with short-term fixes. Nobody argues that \npoint. That is a fact.\n  Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Sherrod Brown of Ohio are very much \nconcerned about this bridge. They are on one side of this bridge, and \nin Kentucky we have Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul. This \nbridge is functionally obsolete. It was built in 1963. The bridge is \nmore than 50 years old and is designed to carry more than 85,000 cars a \nday, but by 2025 it is expected to carry 200,000 cars a day.\n  According to the American Transportation Research Institute, the \nBrent Spence Bridge is the fourth most congested truck point in the \nU.S. infrastructure grid. The cost in congestion is staggering when you \nconsider that $420 billion in freight crosses the bridge every year.\n  Freight haulers bear the brunt in congestion costs and delays \nassociated with just traveling across the bridge, which cost the \ntrucker almost $40 during rush hour. What we are talking about there is \nthat when cars and trucks are going over this bridge, they are stopped. \nIt is a choke point. So they are sitting there, their engines are \nidling, and there is a tremendous cost. So in the aggregate, the delays \non the bridge cost travelers over $750 million each year in wasted time \nand fuel. Each year, 1.6 million gallons of fuel are wasted due to \ncongestion on this bridge.\n  Senators Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby are very concerned about \nthe I-10 Mobile River Bridge in Alabama. Currently, traffic is carried \nthrough the George C. Wallace Tunnel, the I-10 crossing under the \nMobile River in Alabama.\n  Constructed in the 1970s, the tunnel was designed with an anticipated \ndaily traffic count--this is the tunnel--of 36,000 vehicles. Currently, \nthe tunnel averages approximately 80,000 vehicles a day and can reach \nas many as 100,000 vehicles in peak season. The traffic volume causes \nheavy congestion. This is as it is today. There is a proposed project \nto relieve the congestion and increase mobility, but it is not going to \nhappen unless we have this bill pass.\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\n  Arlington Memorial Bridge connects Virginia to DC. Probably, most \npeople who are here today have been across this bridge. They see what \ncondition it is in. It was built in 1932. The Arlington Memorial Bridge \nis well beyond its design life.\n  It is structurally deficient. We know what the traffic is like on \nthat bridge. The bridge serves as a significant part of the National \nHighway System, a major evacuation route, and carries more than 68,000 \nvehicles each day, including commuters, residents, dignitaries, and \nofficial ceremonies. My staff tells me this bridge is on the news on a \nregular basis due to progressive deterioration. The government has had \nto conduct emergency-lane closures and enforce a load limit. Repair \nwork will take 6 months to 9 months.\n  The I-264 bridge over Lynnhaven Parkway carries traffic to Virginia \nBeach. It is a popular vacation spot. A lot of people here go there \nwith regularity, and they know what this bridge is about. I have \ncrossed this bridge many times. It is one of the 10 most heavily \ntraveled deficient bridges in the State of Virginia. It carries just \nunder 135,000 cars a day.\n  The Magnolia Bridge is in Seattle, WA. I always wondered why they \ncalled that the Magnolia Bridge. There aren't any magnolia trees in \nthat part of the north that I know of. But nonetheless that is what it \nis. But it was built in 1929. Just imagine that. It is from 1929, and \neveryone recognizes the dangers that are involved. The bridge carries \n18,000 cars a day and is structurally deficient. While the bridge is in \na residential area and on the community's radar, it hasn't received \nnecessary funding to reconstruct the 86-year-old bridge.\n  Greenfield Bridge in Pittsburgh is in the area of the chairman of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee of the House of \nRepresentatives. Pennsylvania has the most structurally deficient \nbridges in the country, and this is just one of them. It was built in \n1921 and now carries 7,782 cars a day. A 10-inch chunk of concrete went \nthrough a car windshield in 2003, injuring the driver. Later that year, \nthe city spent some $652,000 to build a temporary bridge to catch \nwhatever came through the nets. In other words, there is a bridge under \nthis bridge.\n  This same thing happened in my State of Oklahoma with a bridge in \nOklahoma City. It wasn't long ago. By the way, that bridge was taken \ncare of in the 2005 bill. It was the last long-term bill that we have \nhad. I recall vividly a mother with three children driving under it. A \nchunk of concrete fell off and killed the mother instantly. Of course, \nthat got everyone's attention, and then we passed the last \nreauthorization bill, which was 2005. Greenfield Bridge deals with the \nsimilar hazardous issue. They have to build a bridge under the bridge \nto catch falling debris.\n\n  This is the Pittsburgh Greenfield Bridge. Repairing bridges like \nthese cannot be done with short-term fixes.\n  There is the Court Avenue Bridge in Des Moines, IA. That happens to \nbe where I was born. It is represented now by Senator Chuck Grassley \nand Senator Joni Ernst. Iowa has the second most number of structurally \ndeficient bridges in the country. It was built in 1918, and it now \ncarries 3,920 cars per day. While the State recently increased the \nState gas tax, it will still require Federal partnership to ensure \nprogress on fixing this bridge. It is not going to be done without \nlong-term certainty.\n  There is the Brandywine Bridge on I-95 in Wilmington, DE, which is \nnot far from here. Senator Coons and Senator Carper should be very much \nconcerned about that. That is a 50-year-old bridge. The bridge deck is \ndeteriorating. The viaduct, which carries travelers on I-95, is a major \nroad. If you go from here to New York City, you are talking about I-95, \none of the most traveled interstates. It goes through Wilmington and \nhas experienced serious concrete corrosion. In this structure, the \nsubstructure has cracks and spalls and is in need of repair. This is \nanother dangerous site. It is not going to be done in the absence of \nthe passage of this bill.\n  As to the Chef Menteur Pass in New Orleans, I am sure Senator Bill \nCassidy and Senator Vitter are concerned. It was built in 1930. It \ncarries 1,800 cars a day across Highway 90.\n  Then there is Cesar Chavez Boulevard in San Francisco. That was built \nin 1951 and carries 234,000 cars per day. It is one of the older \nbridges on the west coast that needs to be repaired.\n  In Little Rock, AR, getting very close to my area, Senator Tom Cotton \nand Senator John Boozman are very much concerned about this. They \nshould be. I am sure they are. It is structurally deficient. It was \nbuilt in 1961 and carries traffic over railroad tracks--116,000 cars a \nday. Arkansas is delaying projects because of uncertainty at the \nFederal level. That is what this bill is all about.\n  The Storrow Drive Bridge is in Boston, MA, and Senator Warner and \nSenator Markey will be concerned. It was built in 1951. This \nstructurally deficient bridge carries 57,770 cars per day. The Storrow \nDrive Bridge earned its structurally deficient rating because of the \ncorroding support beams that support one of the many highly trafficked \nbridges in the Nation. I have crossed that one several times.\n  We have the U.S. 1-9 over the Passaic River in Newark, NJ. Senator \nBooker and Senator Menendez are concerned about that. Herbert Hoover \nwas President when the bridge was built in 1932 with an estimated \ndesign volume of 5,500 vehicles a day. It is now up to 62,700 vehicles \nper day.\n  The Calcasieu River Bridge in Lake Charles, LA, was built in 1952 and \nis a structurally deficient bridge that now carries 70,100 cars per \nday. Its steep grades have been cited as a traffic concern, especially \ngiven the high volume of trucks that bridge carries along the major \neast-west corridor.\n  The Brooklyn Bridge--everyone knows about the Brooklyn Bridge. The \npages are too young to remember this, but that was back when Johnny \nWeissmuller was Tarzan. Did you see any of the old movies? He dove off \nthe Brooklyn Bridge. I remember that from when I was your age. Do you \nknow when that was built? That was built in 1883. This structurally \ndeficient bridge now carries 135,000 cars a day. That is one of the \noldest ones around. I remember so well when Johnny Weissmuller was \nchased by the police and dove down. I always wondered what happened to \nhim.\n  The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge--San Francisco to Oakland, CA--\nwas built in 1936. This bridge is now functionally obsolete, yet it \ncarries 204,900 cars per day, and there are many fears that the bridge \nmight collapse.\n  That is what happened in Minnesota. You cannot wait until that \nhappens to avoid the disasters. You can almost imagine if this bridge \ncollapsed. People are concerned about it because that is right in the \nmiddle of earthquake country. And if you take something that is already \nstructurally deficient and you give it a little bit of tremor, it could \ngo.\n  In Missouri, Senator Blunt and Senator McCaskill ought to be \nconcerned. It is one State that would significantly benefit from the \nDRIVE Act and the long-term certainty it provides. Missouri has the \nfourth most structurally deficient bridges in the country, with 3,310 \nof them. Furthermore, Missouri has three districts ranked in the top 20 \nfor worst bridges. The district of House Representative Graves has \n1,345 deficient bridges, Representative Smith has 615 deficient \nbridges, and Representative Hartzler has 600 deficient bridges. Dennis \nHeckman, Missouri's DOT State bridge engineer, agrees that the State \nneeds to seriously address its aging bridges. It is clear when he says \nthat ``they're in bad condition, they're worn out.''\n\n  Broadway Bridge in Kansas City is a prime example of a structurally \ndeficient bridge desperately in need of reconstruction. Built in 1955, \nthis bridge is beyond its design life and has to support over 45,000 \ncars a day.\n  The Interstate 70 bridge over Havana Street and the Union Pacific \nRailroad is in Denver. Cory Gardner is very familiar with this, as is \nSenator Bennet. This is the most traveled structurally deficient bridge \nin the State of Colorado. Built in 1964, it has 183,000 daily \ncrossings. Every day 3.7 million Coloradans cross this structurally \ndeficient bridge.\n  The DRIVE Act will work to make these bridges safer for all \ntravelers.\n  Getting toward the end here--and there are a lot more--the Russell \nStreet Bridge is in Missoula, MT. I was\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\nactually on that when I was up there during Steve Daines' election \nrecently. Transportation For America graded the deck of the Russell \nStreet Bridge a 4 in a soundness scale of 1 through 10. The Russell \nStreet Bridge was built in 1957 and carries 22,650 cars per day.\n  In light of these decaying bridges, the DRIVE Act will provide \nadequate infrastructure investment for our Nation's bridges. Senator \nBarbara Boxer and I made that a top priority in the DRIVE Act, and I \nthink it is something we need to keep in mind.\n  We have an opportunity to move to this bill this afternoon. The vote \nhasn't been scheduled yet. It needs to happen today. It will be a \nmotion to proceed to the highway reauthorization bill, and it is one \nthat will get us so that we can start working on amendments. We have a \nlot of amendments. A lot of people are using this. They know the bill \nhas to pass. This falls into the category of a must-pass bill. \nEverybody knows, for the reasons I have been talking about for several \ndays, it is going to have to pass. So there are a lot of people who \nhave amendments that have nothing to do with bridges and nothing to do \nwith the roads. That is OK. This is a vehicle they can use to try to \nget other programs through. In fact, I myself may be guilty of that. \nBut nonetheless we can't do any of that until we get to the bill, so \nthe motion to proceed has to be agreed to.\n  As soon as the motion to proceed is adopted, I would encourage all \nMembers to come forth with their amendments so they can be heard before \nany deadlines pass.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5441-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5441-S5442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMENDMENTS TO VA BILL\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, we were sworn in--you and I both--in \nJanuary, and I know we have both gone to our States and traveled across \nour States to get an idea of the pressing problems our States and our \nNation face. One of the areas I have focused most of my attention on is \nveterans affairs, particularly the hospitals and the services we are \nproviding veterans across the State.\n  I am concerned that we have a problem with priorities. I am concerned \nthat maybe the focus isn't where it needs to be to make sure we take \ncare of the most pressing problems for our veterans. Whether it is the \nChoice Act, whether it is just providing ambulatory care, PTSD, mental \nhealth, or a number of other things, we have shortages, and we need to \nget the Veterans' Administration focused on solving the most pressing \nproblems.\n  I decided we needed to produce some amendments that would have been \nheard today in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for a bill that would \naffect the VA. Why would I want to do that? Because when out of the \nblue a proposal for some $500 million in unanticipated costs could \npotentially be considered today, I get worried. And I will talk later \nabout the various things that make me worry about what would be lost if \nwe were to reprioritize half a billion dollars, with all the things we \nalready have on our plate that deal with the VA.\n  But the amendments some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle were talking about earlier today were my responsibility. They \nreferred--I guess in deference--to Republicans. The reality is that \nthey were amendments that came out of my office, and I want to talk a \nlittle about what these amendments were. They were referred to as \npolitical games, but three of them were very focused on good \ngovernment. One of them was to make sure we do not implement policy \nthat moves a priority or moves something ahead of the line of the other \ncritical priorities we have for our veterans. All it said was that we \nwould not fund this project until we had certification that the most \npressing priorities--which I will talk about in a few minutes--had \nactually been addressed.\n  Another amendment was just about reporting--how does this project \nwork? All too often we pass policies here and we never measure the \nresults. That is what is wrong with Washington. We don't think through \nthe full consequences of a lot of the policies we implement. So it was \nsimply to provide a reporting mechanism so we could follow up on this \npolicy and see what it costs and the real benefits over time.\n  The last amendment is something I know the Presiding Officer has \nproblems with because he is a very successful businessman. In business, \nwe would never think about balancing the books for this year and next \nyear based on what the business is going to do 10 years from now, but \nthat is exactly what nearly half of the $500 million that was to be \nused for this bill would have done. It is reaching all the way out to \n2025 to assume that some savings achieved there could be used to pay \nfor something today. That is not the way we need to be budgeting in \nWashington. We have an $18 trillion deficit--or I should say debt--and \na lot of that is this kind of thinking that has been going on in \nWashington for too long--and I might add, under Democratic and \nRepublican leadership. We have to change.\n  The other amendments were fairly straightforward too. So three \namendments on good government and accountability and responsible \nbudgeting. The other three were things I think most Americans would \nagree with.\n  One would simply prevent taxpayer funds from being used--the whole \nbill, I should have mentioned, has to do with providing in vitro \nfertilization coverage for veterans. One of the amendments simply said: \nYou cannot use taxpayer funds to do any form of sex selection with \nrespect to determining which embryo may be able to come to life versus \nthe other ones that couldn't. Another amendment has to do with \nsomething as simple as not having the VA work with organizations that \ntake the organs of human aborted babies and sell them. Those are the \nsorts of amendments we were talking about. It wasn't to kill in vitro \nfertilization. I know of many friends and others who have actually \nbenefited and brought babies into the world through in vitro \nfertilization. This was about making sure we did it in a responsible \nmanner.\n  But the heart of my problem goes back to the long list of broken \npromises that sooner or later this Congress has to fulfill for our \nveterans. Let's talk a little about those. We are talking about taking \nhalf a billion dollars and spending it on some priority that is not \neven on the books today.\n  What about these priorities? I worry about the 120,000 claims \ncurrently in the VA backlog. These are people who served our country \nwho are looking for medical help and who are in the backlog waiting for \ntreatment. What about that priority?\n  What about the 22 veterans on average a day committing suicide, most \nof them related to PTSD? We passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act \nas a first step toward trying to address this chronic problem. At the \ntime we passed it, we all acknowledged that the funding we gave it \nwasn't enough, but it was a start.\n  What about additional funding for men and women who are suffering \nfrom various traumas they experience in service to our Nation? That is \na priority we need to be absolutely certain is provided for.\n  I also worry about the unemployment problems. I think 75 percent of \nthe Iran and Afghanistan veterans are dealing with unemployment once \nthey transition from military service into the private sector. What \nabout initiatives to get them back to work, take care of them and their \nfamilies?\n  I could go on and on.\n  At Camp Lejeune in my great State of North Carolina, we have \nidentified something that occurred over many years--exposure to toxic \nsubstances which have been linked to cancer. I had a meeting just last \nweek with the Secretary of the VA. Only 13 percent of the requests for \ncoverage are being fulfilled. We think it should be closer to 50 or 60. \nWhat about the funding for those folks who contracted cancer as a \nresult of toxic substances at Camp Lejeune? Don't they deserve to be \nsomewhere higher in the priority list?\n  I could go on and on.\n  There are the wait times, the critical medical services they need.\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n  Today, the promises we made to veterans should be our top priority. \nAt some point in time, it may make sense to add another half a billion \ndollars for this medical treatment that has been proposed by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle but not until we are \nabsolutely certain that the promises we have already made are going to \nbe fulfilled. That is all we attempted to do today.\n  In some respects, I regret that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle considered it political. I don't consider it political. I \ndon't think it is political when you are trying to live within your \nmeans or making sure the policies you are implementing actually work \nthe way you intended or when you are actually spending money over the \nnext year or two versus 10 years from now. I think that is responsible \ngovernment.\n  The gimmicks and the old rhetoric in this Chamber need to stop. We \nneed to start focusing on fulfilling promises first and foremost to the \nmen and women who have served our country bravely and defended our \nfreedom. That is what my proposed amendments were about, and that is \nwhat they will be about if this measure ever comes up again because if \nI can fulfill no other promise, my promise to the men and women who \nhave served this Nation will be paramount in all the things I do in my \nservice here over the next 5\\1/2\\ years in the U.S. Senate. This was a \nthreat to my being able to fulfill that promise, and I am glad we are \ngoing to be able to move on.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5442-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5442-S5444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DODD-FRANK REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I come to the floor with a happy \nbirthday message today. I come with wishes for a happy birthday for the \nfifth birthday of the Dodd-Frank regulations.\n  Where are we as a nation with this wonderful 5-year-old running \naround our Nation right now, pushing out birthday cake across every \nbank and financial institution across the country? Exactly how is that \ngoing?\n  Let me share a couple of things. Everyone in this Nation remembers \nextremely well 2008 and the financial collapse that happened. We \nremember Lehman Brothers closing down and causing panic. We remember \nFannie and Freddie rules finally reaping the consequences of what the \nNation assumed would happen at some point from all of these very low \nrates and from encouraging people to buy who can't afford to pay back a \nloan. We knew what would occur. The rise of a conversation, something \ncalled too big to fail that we had never heard before, suddenly grows \nup, and we move as a nation in 2009 from trying to regulate financial \ninstitutions to actually running financial institutions. The \nregulations were considered too small, and for institutions that were \nbig, it was determined that Big Business means Big Government needs to \nrun it.\n  I would have to say there is not a lot about the efficiency of \nWashington, DC, that we would look across the fruited plain and say \nthis is working so well in Washington, DC, we should run every big \ncompany as well. In the days of government shutdowns and $18 trillion \nof debt and slow decisionmaking, there is a great need for private \nbusinesses to be pushed to be able to do things efficiently, to be able \nto manage our economy effectively. Clearly, there is a need for \nregulations, but I would also say that, clearly, the U.S. Government \nshould not step into businesses and run them instead of just regulating \nthe boundaries.\n  This is a free market, but sadly, in 2009, the U.S. Government went \nto running General Motors. We started running individual banks and \ninsurance companies. We have to be able to shift out of that and we \nhave to be able to find a way in the days ahead for that never to occur \nagain.\n  I would say multiple things about this. Now, 5 years into Dodd-Frank, \n400 new rules in the process of being promulgated, literally 12,500 \npages of regulations that have now been spun out--12,500 pages of \nregulations--just dealing with 271 rulemakings.\n  So here is what we are up against: 271 rulemaking deadlines have \npassed. Of those, 192 of them have been met with finalized rules, and \nrules have been proposed that would meet 46 more. Rules have not yet \nbeen proposed to meet 33 passed rulemaking requirements. Of the 390 \ntotal rulemaking requirements, 247 of them have been met with finalized \nrules, and rules have been proposed that would meet 60 more. What am I \ntrying to say with all of that? There is a lot coming out of this, and \nthere is a lot more still to come.\n  I would challenge any person in this Chamber and any person across \nAmerica that if you are having to run your business, and if as you \nstarted to run your business and a government regulator walked in with \n12,500 pages and said, I need someone in your company to know all of \nthese regulations, you would not respond with a smile and wish them a \nhappy birthday. You would respond with great frustration and say: Why \nare you walking into my company with 12,500 pages of new regulations? \nNow, there are previous regulations this is stacked on top of. They say \nhere is an additional stack of 12,500 pages that you need to know and \nfollow.\n  This is the fruit of the Dodd-Frank regulations. I would say there \nare a lot of things we need to discuss with this bill, but let me just \nhighlight a few of those. First, let's get some common agreement. Can \nwe all agree the community banks, the smallest banks across America--\nmost of them in rural communities--did not cause the financial collapse \nin 2008? In fact, they didn't even contribute to the financial collapse \nin 2008. The smallest community banks across the country are vital \naccesses to capital for farmers, small businesses, Main Street folks, \nand folks who just do deposits to their savings and checking accounts. \nThese are small community banks. For more than 1,200 U.S. counties, \nwith a combined population of 16 million Americans, without those \ncommunity banks, they would be severely limited to any kind of access \nto banking. Big banks tend to focus on the biggest loans and in big \ntowns. Small community and traditional banks focus on smaller \ncommunities. In my State of Oklahoma, a person can go to every small \ntown and find a school, a gas station, a church, and a bank, and often \nthat bank is a very small community bank. They know everybody in town \nand everybody knows them. But the rules changed for them after Dodd-\nFrank, and it wasn't because that bank caused anything.\n  Regardless of the law's merit in any area--and we can have a great \nconversation about a lot of issues with Dodd-Frank--financial reform \nwas to contain the systemic risk in the financial sector of very large \ncompanies, which were called the too big to fail, which I refer to \noften as the ``too big to be free now,'' because the Federal Government \nis stepping in to try to run all of these companies and say: You can't \nhave a free market in that area; we are going to have to run you \ninstead.\n  But these small bank failures are not a threat to the economy. They \nweren't supposed to be a target of Dodd-Frank, but they most certainly \nare. All of these banks now suffer the consequences. A study by the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that for banks that have less \nthan $50 million in assets, hiring two additional personnel reduces \ntheir profitability by 45 basis points, resulting in one-third of these \nbanks becoming unprofitable. Why would I raise that? Because there are \na whole host of regulators who say just hire one or two additional \ncompliance people, and you can keep up with the 12,500 additional pages \nthat have been rolled out. These small community banks can't keep up \nwith that. The Mercatus Center surveyed 200 banks with less than $10 \nbillion in assets, and 83 percent found that their regulatory \ncompliance costs increased by more than 5 percent, and the median \nnumber of compliance staff increased from one to two. They all had to \nadd additional folks--not additional folks to make more loans, not \nadditional folks to greet more customers as they walk in the door, \nadditional folks in the back office simply filling out forms and \nturning them in.\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\n  Government figures indicate that the country is losing, on average, \none community bank or credit union a day now. Alternatively, in the \nlast 5 years, regulators have only approved 1 new bank, as opposed to \nan average of 170 banks per year before 2010. Let me run that past my \ncolleagues again. We have approved one new bank in the last 5 years \nsince Dodd-Frank. People don't want to go into banking. This is having \nthe effect we all said it would have; that is, when Dodd-Frank passed, \nthe focus on too big to fail would really mean that you are too small \nto succeed; that the smallest banks and communities all across the \ncountry now cannot keep up with the compliance costs and they will sell \nout to larger and larger banks. Do my colleagues know what Dodd-Frank \nhas created? Dodd-Frank has created more megabanks and it is pushing \nmore and more smaller banks to sell out.\n\n  Since the end of the first quarter in 2010, Oklahoma--my State--has \nseen 33 community banks disappear through acquisition or merger--33 of \nthem. Twenty-nine of those thirty-three community banks that \ndisappeared were under $100 million in total assets. When asked, the \nmost frequent reason they were selling, they said it was the increasing \ncost of compliance. They could not keep up because they had to have so \nmany compliance people.\n  In Oklahoma, 24 percent of the State's commercial banks no longer \noffer real estate mortgage loans to their customers because of the \nlitigation and regulatory risks they face under the new ability to \nrepay and qualified mortgage rules. Let me run that past my colleagues \nagain because a lot of people don't realize what is happening. The \nsmallest community banks are selling out. They are disappearing. At the \nsame time, 24 percent of the banks in my State no longer offer home \nloans. That means in these small towns across America, you can't walk \ninto the bank and get a home loan. People have to drive to some other \ntown or go to some other place to try to get a home loan now. It is not \nbecause that bank can't do a home loan--they are a bank, that is what \nthey do--it is because of new Dodd-Frank regulations that make them so \nscared to function and operate through the 12,500 pages they have just \ndecided they don't have enough staff and enough people. The banker says \nto himself: I sold my neighbor a home, his dad a home, and maybe his \ngrandfather a home in this community. I can no longer do a mortgage for \nthem. That is absurd.\n  I hope no one would say that was the purpose of Dodd-Frank, but I \nwill tell you this 5-year-old who is running around, these are the \nconsequences. This is happening all across our Nation. These new rules \ncontinue to push out the possibility of just doing normal, traditional \nbanking, including savings accounts, checking accounts, home loans, car \nloans.\n  Dodd-Frank, ironically, favors the largest banks over community \nbanks. I find that the ultimate irony, based on the way it was sold, \nnot to mention the fact that as a banker now, if you have a problem \nwith one of the regulators and you want to appeal and say: How are we \ngoing to actually get through this problem--do my colleagues know whom \nthey appeal to now? Literally, a person in the next cubicle from the \nprevious person who gave the instructions. There is no place they can \ngo. There is no judicial review. There is no opportunity to say this \nregulation that you have given me is onerous or the decision you have \nmade based on this regulation is onerous. If you want to disagree, you \ndisagree with the person in the next cubicle, and then that same group \nof people will come and inspect your bank next year. And what do my \ncolleagues think happens?\n  I have to say we are in a bad spot. This is not about big city \nbankers. This is about small towns. This is about small town loans. \nThis is about home loans for individuals in rural areas, and these are \nreal consequences to a lot of families. So how do we solve this now? \nThis is what we have--and we have had for 5 years--and it still \ncontinues to grow; it still continues to get worse.\n  What happens now? Let me just talk about some solutions. No. 1, I \nwould say this. We have to deal with one of the big animals in the \nmiddle of the creation of Dodd-Frank; that is, the Consumer Federal \nProtection Bureau. The CFPB was created to be like a fourth branch of \ngovernment. It is completely autonomous. Its funding comes from the \nFederal Reserve. It does not have to report to Congress, none of the \nstaff have to report to Congress or turn anything over. There is no \nrequirement for transparency. They only, in a cursory manner, come by \nand visit Congress every quarter or so and do a report, but they are \nnot required to turn over everything.\n  They have access to every piece of every bit of consumer finance. \nThey are reaching in to do car loans, they are reaching into credit \ncards, they are reaching into home loans. They can reach in, in effect, \nand create regulations in any area they choose to with no \naccountability. We have to be able to resolve this--not to mention the \nfact that CFPB is completely redundant to other agencies that already \nexisted in this oversight, and this adds yet another layer on every \nbank and on every consumer financial institution. But they are \nunaccountable.\n\n  So let's do a couple basic things. One of the proposals that came out \nfrom the Appropriations Committee today is to move from there being one \nDirector to a five-member board. This Senator would say that is pretty \nreasonable, so that we don't have one person managing all consumer \nfinance for the entire country--one person who is completely \nunaccountable.\n  Separating them from their appropriations rather than getting their \nappropriations from the Federal Reserve, getting their appropriations \ndirectly from the normal appropriations process like every other \nagency, including independent agencies--there is no reason to have them \nbe isolated and separate.\n  Quite frankly, the CFPB is completely redundant to all other areas. \nThere is no reason for them to have redundant activities and \nauthorities. Those should be cleared as well to make sure that every \nbank, when it is making a decision, can make a decision based on \nknowing whom its regulator is, not thinking ``This regulator is going \nto say one thing, but what is the CFPB going to say when they come in \nnext?'' and not having a regulator come in and say ``Well, this is not \nour regulation, but the CFPB has put this regulation down, and so we \nare going to follow their regulations as well.'' That is absurd. Clear \nlines of authorities and responsibilities should be delineated. We can \ndo that. It shouldn't be hard, and it shouldn't even be controversial.\n  Secondly, we need to reform Fannie and Freddie. Community banks did \nnot cause the problems in 2008; quite frankly, Fannie and Freddie did. \nCommunity banks have had this major pushdown of 12,500 pages of \nregulations. Guess how much reform has happened at Fannie and Freddie? \nZero. So the organizations that actually were the problem have gotten \noff scot-free because now they are making money again and everyone is \nlooking the other way and saying ``Well, they are doing OK; we will \nleave them alone,'' while the organizations that didn't cause the \nproblems face tons of regulations. There are major reforms that need to \nhappen with Fannie and Freddie. It is about time this Congress actually \nengaged and stopped saying: You know what, they are in the black. Let's \nleave them alone.\n  Do you realize that the government funds 71 percent of new mortgages \nnow through the GSEs and the Federal Housing Administration compared to \n32 percent just 10 years ago? Let me repeat that. Ten years ago, the \nFederal taxpayer backed 32 percent of the loans, and now it is 71 \npercent.\n  Dodd-Frank was supposed to be about trying to get the too-big-to-fail \nissue out of the way and to get the Federal taxpayer out of having to \nback up every loan and every business across America. Instead, it is \nincreasing the size of banks and it is increasing the exposure of every \nmortgage in America to the Federal taxpayer. We have to turn that \naround.\n  No. 3, Congress has to provide the authority for Federal banking \nregulators to differentiate the applicability of rules and regulations \nto various banks based on the bank's operating model and risk profile. \nIf it is a traditional bank, leave it alone; it is a traditional \ncommunity bank.\n  In fact, FDIC Commissioner Tom Hoenig had a great plan and a great \nset\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\nof ideas that I would bring to this body and say we should seriously \nconsider; that is, separate banks not based on their size but on their \nactivity. If it is a traditional bank doing traditional banking, that \nwould mean a couple of things--first, that it has at least 10 percent \ncapitalization, and second would be that it is not involved in \ncomplicated derivatives. If it is involved in complicated derivatives, \nit is going to have very heavy oversight. If it is not, it is a \ntraditional bank and it is well-capitalized. Banking regulations have \nalways been about safety and soundness. If this bank is well-\ncapitalized and not involved in complicated derivatives, why are we \nthere every day trying to manage every aspect of it? Allow it to be a \ntraditional bank. I don't care how big it grows if it is in traditional \nbanking models.\n  We literally have banks around the country now that are right at \nabout $10 billion in size that are worried they can't get any bigger. \nWe literally have businesses saying: I can't grow because if I grow, I \nwill spring into a whole new set of regulations, and I can't afford \nmore staff to actually do that. This is silly. If it is a traditional \nbank and it is in good safety and soundness, let it do loans. Let the \nbank actually engage with its customers in its community and not have \nto look over its shoulders all the time.\n  Chairman Shelby has actually laid out a proposal in the Federal \nFinancial Regulatory Improvement Act. It is a great place to start, \nwith a lot of small aspects and a lot of commonsense ideas and \nbipartisan ideas that he has been able to stack all together and put \ninto one piece. It is a good idea to provide some regulatory relief in \nthese areas.\n  I think a fair question to ask is, Are we better off financially as a \nnation now than we were 5 years ago? Now that this 5-year-old toddler \nthat we call Dodd-Frank is walking around, what has happened? Well, \nthere are some banks that are better capitalized. That is a good thing, \nbut quite frankly we can increase capital requirements without having \nto go through 12,500 pages of regulations.\n  We have made it harder to get a loan unless it is a government loan, \nsuch as a Small Business Administration loan. We have also literally \npushed the loan profile out of private institutions and into Fannie and \nFreddie, the FHA, and into the Small Business Administration. Now we \nhave record exposure to the Federal taxpayer. We have also made fees to \nthe banks higher, as they have been more challenged as to what to do, \nand we have half as many banks now offering free checking as we had \njust 5 years ago. That is a consequence the consumer understands, and \nit is a consequence of Dodd-Frank. We have fewer banks, we have bigger \nbanks, and we have a lot more complication. In a day when America needs \nmore capital access, we have one bank in 5 years that says: I want to \njoin that market.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could say ``happy birthday'' to Dodd-Frank, \nbut I am not sure this set of financial regulations is making a lot of \nAmericans happy right now. It is time we come back and revisit this \nbill.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5444-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5444-S5447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DRIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think at any time--hopefully soon--it \nappears that we are going to be bringing up the vote to proceed as we \ndid yesterday.\n  Let me just repeat what I did just a couple of hours ago on the \nfloor. I am not critical at all of the Democrats who voted against the \nmotion to proceed yesterday based on the fact that we dropped the ball \nover here. We were supposed to give them the necessary information on \nsome of the funding mechanisms and things on the offsets. We didn't \ngive them enough time before the vote took place. You can't go over \nseveral hundred pages in a few minutes. Now it has been 24 hours.\n  Well, even my counterpart on the Democratic side, Senator Boxer, \nvoted against it for the same reason. And they have a right. So, \nanyway, I feel optimistic that when we have this vote we can proceed to \nthe bill.\n  Let's keep in mind that this is a bill I perceive as a must-pass \nbill. The alternative to this would be very, very expensive. It would \ngo back to what we had to suffer through between 2009 and this moment \nthat we are in right now; that is, a list of 33 short-term extensions. \nShort-term extensions, as we all know, are waste and irresponsible use \nof highway dollars. Consequently, we need to be spending that money on \nroads and bridges, not short-term extensions.\n  So I will look forward to getting that motion to proceed adopted. As \nsoon as that happens, that is when we are going to pull the trigger to \nget as many people down on the floor with amendments. I keep hearing \nabout all of the amendments that are out there that different Members \nwant to come forth with. The criticism we had with the Democrats when \nthey were in charge was that we were not able to get amendments.\n  Well, we changed that. Since we have been in control, we have allowed \namendments. I know we have a lot of them--some germane and some not \ngermane--but it is going to be an open-amendment process.\n  We need to get this thing moved forward and pass the next vote or we \nare not going to be in a position to really go over the amendments, to \nsee which amendments we can agree to--and there will be a lot of them \nthat we can.\n  This is a 6-year bill. We are authorizing for 6 years with 3 years of \nidentified funding.\n  Our bill authorizes for 6 years something that we call contract \nauthority, which is a mechanism unique to the highway bill in which the \nFederal Government makes funding commitments of future funding over \nmultiple years. The use of contract authority was created way back in \nEisenhower's 1956 Highway Act for a reason, and it exists still today. \nIt has been the cornerstone of highway bills ever since then, giving \nStates and cities long-term certainty to plan their investments over \nmultiple years.\n  The reason that is important--I used to be in that business many \nyears ago as a contractor for several years--is that you can't have \nshort-term ideas without going back and making years of planning so \nthat you can organize your labor supply, you can organize all of your \nrentals and everything that would go into a project.\n  As States begin to break the ground on projects, they match this \ncontract authority with actual cash and are reimbursed from the highway \ntrust fund. So it comes from the highway trust fund, converts to cash, \nand it goes into contract authority. Unfortunately, up until 2009, the \nend of SAFETEA-LU--that is when it went in, 2005, and it was a 5-year \nbill; so it is the end of 2009--this contract authority was always \nguaranteed by the receipts in the highway trust fund, but we now find \nourselves in a situation where the highway trust fund can no longer \nsupport current levels of spending as a result of more efficient and \nelectric vehicles.\n  I have included a mechanism in this bill that will allow Congress to \nauthorize a 6-year transportation bill consistent with how States and \nlocals plan and deliver the projects and then find the necessary \noffsets to pay the bill.\n  Currently, Senator Hatch has identified at least 3 years of cuts to \nthe general fund to redirect to the highway trust fund and shore up the \ndifferences between what the highway trust fund can support and the \nDRIVE Act levels of investment.\n  So in the first 3 years, the States would have a guarantee of at \nleast 3 years of funding so that they could be confident they would be \nreimbursed on their contract authority.\n  In the fourth fiscal year of the act, the Secretary will conduct a \nsolvency test to determine the ability to make payments out of the \nhighway trust fund for the remaining 3 years. Keep in mind that this is \na 6-year bill. So the remaining 3 years of contract authority would be \ngiven to the States.\n  If the Secretary determines that the balance of either account will \ndip below $4 billion in a fiscal year for highway account or $1 billion \nfor the mass transit account, then no new projects can be funded from \nthe highway trust fund during that year.\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\n  Now, if Congress finds funds to supplement the trust fund during that \nfiscal year--the fourth year--new projects may begin and be funded, as \nin the DRIVE Act.\n  However, it is important to point out that even if the Secretary \nfinds that the trust fund is not able to fund new projects in a fiscal \nyear, during that year the Department can continue to reimburse States \nfor projects that were already under way prior to the end of year \n3. This will ensure that there is not a huge cliff at the end of 3 \nyears, which the DOT, Governors, mayors, and the rest of them tell us \nwill prevent a chilling effect on their willingness to use the first 3 \nyears of funding to engage in large, multiyear bridge and interstate \nreconstruction projects.\n\n  That is another reason, by the way, we want to do a 6-year bill. It \nallows us to get into all of these bridges and these very large. This \nchart behind me shows the deficient bridges in America. I talked about \n25 or so of these this morning and gave a lot of details, which I will \ndo again because we need to get the attention of the Members of the \nSenate. They will be very familiar with the problems they have. As the \nPresiding Officer would be familiar with the problems in South \nCarolina, each Member is familiar with the bridges and geography in his \nor her own district.\n  So it means Congress has 3 years to identify about $50 billion to $60 \nbillion worth of additional receipts into the trust fund to honor years \n4, 5, and 6 of contract authority. Under this mechanism, the trust fund \nwill continue to receive user fee revenues for all 6 years of the act, \nplus 2 years after the act, which has been historically done in these \nbig highway bills.\n  The mechanism is nothing new, as it is similar to the Army Corps of \nEngineers Chief's reports on WRDA bills. WRDA is the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, where they authorize 5 to 10 years of project \nauthorizations and then Congress finds the money on an annual basis to \nmatch the authority, the same as the highway bill. So if they can't \nfind the money, construction doesn't start.\n  Allowing for multiyear planning is a conservative position because it \nallows States to engage in long-term contracts and negotiate bigger \nprojects at significantly lower cost. Buying materials in bulk, \ncontractors charge less and finish earlier.\n  Now, what I would like to do at some point is talk about the \ntransparency and also the Tribal Transportation Program. This is a big \nbill. There is a lot to talk about.\n  In fact, I think I will go to the transparency first because we hear \na lot about transparency. We hear a lot about the need to be aware, \nabout the need for people to be aware. You have to keep in mind this \nand the Defense authorization bill are the two largest and most \nsignificant bills that are out there. In fact, if you read that old \ncontract that nobody reads anymore--called the Constitution--it says \nwhat we are supposed to be doing. It tickles me sometimes when I see \nliberals standing here wanting to get government into more and more \nprograms, when the Constitution says we are only supposed to be doing \ntwo things here: defending America and funding our roads and bridges. \nThat is in article I, section 8 of the Constitution.\n  Anyway, I just wanted to mention that increasing the accountability \nand improving transparency of the Federal-Aid Highway Program is a key \ncomponent to the DRIVE Act. I am talking about the act we will be \nmoving to proceed on very shortly, hopefully.\n  The DRIVE Act includes several provisions to include the transparency \nof how and where transportation projects are selected and funded, to \nensure that stakeholders and the public have faith in the integrity of \nhighway programs and the use of Federal tax dollars.\n  So they are going to know, if they care--and a lot don't, but the \nones who do care, the ones who are watching from a fiscal perspective \nare going to have that information they can share. The media can have \nit. You will see articles. I often criticize this administration for \ntheir lack of transparency, but you are not going to find any lack of \ntransparency in the DRIVE Act.\n  The DRIVE Act requires the Transportation Secretary to establish an \nonline platform to report project-level status of the reviews, the \napprovals, the permits required for compliance with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act--that is NEPA--and other Federal laws. This \nwill allow the public to see the status of an ongoing project or to see \nwhat is holding up the project.\n  That is very significant. By the way, it is important to note that on \nthe NEPA requirements there are some waivers. I applaud some of the \nmore liberal members of the committee I chair, including Senator \nBarbara Boxer, who didn't want to go along with a lot of the provisions \nthat streamline this bill but was willing to do it. So I applaud her \nfor doing that. But this will let the public also have access to that \nto make sure we are doing what we should be doing. In the NEPA \nrequirements, we can see if we are deviating from that or from any of \nthe other requirement that makes the DRIVE Act something that is going \nto be one of the most valuable pieces of legislation passed this year.\n  The DRIVE Act also increases transparency regarding the way in which \nthe Federal Highway Administration utilizes Federal-aid highway funding \nfor administrative expenses. This is accomplished by requiring the \nFederal Highway Administration to report elemental project-level data \neach fiscal year. So each year they can have access to that.\n  The DRIVE Act requires that the Transportation Secretary publish all \nreports submitted to Congress by the Department in order to increase \ntransparency and oversight by Congress and by the public.\n  Now, these improved transparency provisions will provide to the \npublic better accountability of how the Federal Highway Administration \nis utilizing its funds. It will also demonstrate how the agency is \nmaking progress toward achieving national goals and improving Federal \nreviews of the highway projects. So we have the transparency built in, \nbut that was one of the requirements we on the conservative side \ndemanded when we put this bill together.\n  Since we have these charts--and I apologize to those who had to sit \nthrough this a couple hours ago, but we have a whole different crowd \nout there now, and we have our Members, many of them are paying \nattention to what we are doing since they are going to be called upon \nto vote in just a matter of a few minutes. On this chart, it shows the \ndark colors being the ones that have the majority of the structurally \ndeficient bridges. It is on there by county.\n  I would call attention to my State of Oklahoma because one-quarter of \nour State is in that high category of deficiencies. If you look at \nother States--I was talking a few minutes ago to Senator Blunt from \nMissouri and he was talking about their deficient bridges. I commented \nthat we actually have more deficient bridges but only by a few. So we \nare kind of in a comparable situation, but this gives an idea of how \nwidespread this is.\n  Let's go over some of these bridges. In my home State of Oklahoma, we \nhave 2 of the top 10 worst districts by number of deficient bridges.\n  Frank Lucas is a Congressman from Oklahoma. He just came out from \nbeing the chairman of the Agriculture Committee over in the House of \nRepresentatives. In his district alone, there are over 2,000 deficient \nbridges. He has a lot of small bridges because he has the rural areas \nof Oklahoma, where there aren't many people, but there is a lot of \nland. So certainly we have a problem. In Congressman Markwayne Mullin's \ndistrict there are over 1,000 deficient bridges. Our Oklahoma \nDepartment of Transportation is working tirelessly to address bridge \nsafety, but they need the long-term provisions in here to take care of \nthat particular problem.\n  A bridge collapse or closure brings significant and sudden economic \nimpact. I think we all remember in Minnesota in 2007 the bridge that \ncame down. It was very graphic. It was on all the TV channels, with the \nambulances, the people, the injuries, and the deaths. People were \nrightly concerned about that tragic collapse. That was in Minnesota. It \nis called the I-35W bridge collapse from 2007. Look at that. You can \nsee that is a death trap, and that is exactly what happened.\n  The Skagit River Bridge collapse. That is I-5 in Washington State. It \nhad similar effects on the local economy,\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\nwith an estimated impact of $8.3 million during the 26-day closure.\n  The Brent Spence Bridge. This is a big one. This is the one that goes \nbetween Ohio and Kentucky. It is one that carries a huge amount of \ntraffic. You can see just by looking at how old this bridge is how \nstructurally deficient the bridge is. You can visibly see that.\n  Our Members in Ohio, Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman, and in Kentucky, \nRand Paul and Mitch McConnell, are very familiar with this. I think \nthis really brings it home, to show these bridges to the public, \nbecause they have to live with them on a daily basis. This bridge is \nfunctionally obsolete. Built in 1963, the bridge is more than 50 years \nold and was designed to carry 85,000 cars a day, but by 2025 it is \nexpected to carry 200,000 cars a day.\n  According to the American Transportation Research Institute, the \nBrent Spence Bridge is the fourth most congested truck point on the \nU.S. infrastructure grid. The cost in congestion is staggering when you \nconsider the $420 billion of freight to cross the bridge every year.\n  Freight haulers bear the brunt of the congestion costs. Delays \nassociated with just traveling across the bridge costs a trucker almost \n$40 during a rush hour.\n  In the aggregate, the delays on the bridge cost travelers over $750 \nmillion a year in wasted time and fuel.\n  Keep in mind, if you have congestion on bridges, cars stop, trucks \nstop, and they pollute the air. Their exhaust continues to go, their \nengines are still running, the efficiency of their vehicles goes down, \nand it is very expensive. Each year, 1.6 million gallons of fuel are \nwasted due to congestion on this one bridge. There are 3.6 million \nhours spent in traffic on the bridge each year.\n  This is just one bridge we are talking about. In 2011, chunks of \nconcrete fell from the upper deck down to the lower deck of the bridge. \nWhat is most alarming is that motorists who use this bridge are five \ntimes more likely to get into an accident on this segment of the \ninterstate than any other part of the interstate in Kentucky.\n  You will see some bridges where they have actually built another \nbridge under the bridge to catch the falling debris, the falling \nconcrete.\n  This is the Mobile River Bridge in Alabama. Certainly, Senator \nSessions and Senator Shelby are very sensitive to this. It is a bridge \nthat has been a problem for quite some time. It was constructed in the \n1970s. The tunnel was to offer some relief from the bridge.\n  Traffic currently is carried through the George C. Wallace Tunnel, \nthe I-10 crossing under this bridge we are looking at in Alabama. That \ntunnel was designed with an anticipated daily traffic count of 36,000. \nCurrently, the tunnel averages approximately 80,000 vehicles a day. It \ncan reach as much as 100,000 vehicles in peak season. The traffic \nvolume causes heavy congestion and longer travel times for commercial \nand noncommercial drivers throughout the region and the rest of the \nNation. This right here, incidentally, is what it will look like after \nthe improvements are made. This is what it is today.\n  (Mr. Toomey assumed the Chair.)\n  I was hoping we had the Pennsylvania chart because the new occupier \nof the chair would certainly be interested in that, I would think.\n  The Arlington Memorial Bridge. We are all familiar with that. That \nconnects Washington, DC, and Virginia. Senator Warner and Senator Kaine \ntravel this bridge on probably a daily basis. This was built in 1932. \nThe Arlington Memorial Bridge is well beyond its design life and is \nstructurally deficient. The bridge serves as a significant part of the \nNational Highway System, a major evacuation route, and carries more \nthan 68,000 vehicles each day. It is crowded and congested almost all \nthe time--at least it is every day I go across.\n\n  My staff tells me this bridge is on the local news on a regular basis \ndue to the progressive deterioration that has taken place. The \ngovernment has had to conduct emergency lane closures and enforce a \nload limit. Repair work would take 6 to 9 months.\n  Then we have the I-264 bridge over Lynnhaven Parkway that carries \ntraffic to Virginia Beach, which is down south of where we are right \nnow. It is structurally deficient. We see the chart--it is one of the \n10 most heavily traveled deficient bridges in the State of Virginia, \nand it carries just under 134,000 cars a day.\n  The next one is in the State of Washington. I always comment when I \nsee this. It is called the Magnolia Bridge; it is too far north for \nmagnolia trees. Anyway, it was built in about 1929. The bridge carries \nover 18,000 cars a day and is structurally deficient. While the bridge \nis in a residential area and on the community's radar, it hasn't \nreceived the necessary funding to reconstruct the 86-year-old bridge.\n  Greenfield Bridge, Pittsburgh, PA--I imagine the Chair is familiar \nwith this.\n  Pennsylvania has the most structurally deficient bridges in the \ncountry, and this is one of them. Let me repeat that. The State of \nPennsylvania has the most structurally deficient bridges in the entire \nNation.\n  This was built in 1921. It now carries 7,700 cars a day. A 10-inch \nchunk of concrete went through a car windshield in 2003, injuring the \ndriver. Later that year, the city spent $652,000 to build a temporary \nbridge to catch whatever came through the nets. So they have a bridge \nunder a bridge. They had to build another bridge to catch whatever \nfalls off of this bridge. This structurally deficient bridge has been \ncrumbling for decades. In order to protect drivers on the busy highway \nbelow, nets and platforms were constructed to catch falling debris.\n  On a similar note, we had a tragic incident in Oklahoma involving \nfalling debris from a bridge. A lady and her children in a car were \ndriving below it, and a chunk of concrete fell off and killed the \nmother.\n  Again, I will repeat what I said: Pennsylvania has the most \nstructurally deficient bridges in the entire Nation, and that is just \none of them.\n  The Court Avenue Bridge in Des Moines, where I was born--talk about \nan old bridge. This was actually built before I was born, in 1918. It \nnow carries 3,900 cars a day.\n  Iowa has the second most structurally deficient bridges in the \ncountry, second only to Pennsylvania. While the State recently \nincreased the gas tax, it will still require Federal partnership to do \nsomething about this famous bridge.\n  I-95. Going from Washington to New York or anyplace up north, you go \non I-95. It is a very heavily traveled highway.\n  This is the Brandywine Bridge in Wilmington. You go right over this \nbridge on I-95. It is 50 years old. The bridge deck is deteriorating. \nThe viaduct, which carries travelers from I-95 through Wilmington, has \nexperienced serious concrete corrosion. The problem is this bridge was \ndesigned for a fraction of the travel that it now has because this is \nthe main artery going up the east coast of the United States. It has \ncracks and swells. I have actually personally seen this bridge.\n  The Chef Menteur Pass Bridge in New Orleans, LA, was built in 1930 \nand carries 1,800 cars a day across Highway 90.\n  The Cesar Chavez Boulevard Bridge in San Francisco was built in 1951. \nIt carries 234,000 cars a day. It is one of the oldest bridges on the \nwest coast.\n  The I-30 in Little Rock--getting close to my State of Oklahoma. Tom \nCotton and John Boozman are most interested in this bridge. It is \nstructurally deficient. It was built in 1961 to carry traffic over \nrailroad tracks, 116,000 cars a day. And Arkansas is delaying projects \nbecause of uncertainty at the Federal level, so they are currently \ndiscussing gap financing for the I-30 project.\n  The Storrow Drive Bridge in Boston--I know Senators Warner and Markey \nare very concerned about this. Built in 1951, this structurally \ndeficient bridge carries 57,770 cars per day. The Storrow Drive Bridge \nearned its structurally deficient rating because of the corroding \nsupport beams that support one of many highly trafficked bridges in the \nNation. Numerous costly interim repairs over the years have kept the \nartery open, but they are merely stopgaps until a longer term solution \ncan be reached.\n  New Jersey, U.S. Highway 1 over the Passaic River. Herbert Hoover was \nPresident when this bridge was built in 1932, with an estimated design \nvolume of 5,500 vehicles a day.\n  I am going to skip down to the Brooklyn Bridge. This bridge was \nactually built in 1883. It is structurally deficient. Of course we know \nthe number\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nof cars that go over that. That was built in 1883. That is one that I \ndare say arguably everyone here has driven over, and every time you do, \nyou wonder if you are going to get to the other side.\n  The other comparable bridge is the San Francisco Bay Bridge, which \nwas built in 1936. The bridge is now functionally obsolete. Here is the \nconcern about the bridge. A lot of smart people are saying this bridge, \nbecause of all the earthquakes out there, could collapse. Anyone who \ndrives over is thinking: Is this going to be the time it takes place?\n  I talked to Roy Blunt a few minutes ago. He was talking about the \nbridges in Missouri. The next chart I will show is from there. For some \nreason, Missouri and Oklahoma are two of the worst States in terms of \nthe conditions of bridges, and we are both concerned about that. That \nis something people have to keep in mind.\n  I know others want to come down and get some time, but we are going \nto be talking about these, about the major projects.\n  What is unique about the bridges is we can't ensure the stability and \nsafety of our bridges on short-term extensions. That is why we have \ngone since 2009 with 33 short-term extensions and many of these bridges \nhave had no attention. The only way we are going to correct that \nproblem is to do it with this DRIVE Act. Hopefully we will have the \nvote to advance that bill, and hopefully we will be able to get it \nthrough.\n  I want to repeat what I started off with. I don't criticize the \nDemocrats who voted against the motion to proceed yesterday because \nthey requested information and didn't get the information until 30 \nminutes before the vote took place. Even my counterpart on the left, \nBarbara Boxer, voted against it at that time. I think most of those \nindividuals should be supportive of this, certainly after seeing the \nbridges and construction that is necessary in their States. I am \nconfident they will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, throughout the history of the Republic, \ncertain decisive moments have fundamentally altered the national \nsecurity of the United States. For good or for ill, these moments have \ndefined eras of time and changed the course of history. These landmarks \ninclude President Roosevelt's decision to turn the United States into \nan arsenal of democracy to defeat fascism; President Truman's adoption \nof a strategy to confront communism and rebuild Europe; President \nNixon's initiative to open up relations with China; and President \nReagan's policies that led to the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  Other such moments reflect serious errors in judgment, mistakes that \ncontinue to echo today. One recent example is President Obama's \ndecision to remove U.S. forces from Iraq prematurely. This shortsighted \nmove squandered the gains of the surge and plunged Iraq into chaos, \nleading to the rise of the Islamic State. Another especially \ninstructive example is in the Clinton administration's fumbled attempt \nto block North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. Back then, I \ncame out strongly against the Agreed Framework with North Korea. Sure \nenough, that naive diplomatic effort created barely a speed bump, as \nthe fanatical North Korean regime raced ahead in building a nuclear \narsenal.\n\n  President Obama's nuclear deal was clearly one such landmark moment \nin American foreign policy, but the question remains: Is it a crowning \nachievement of American diplomacy or is it a grave mistake that we will \nall come to regret dearly? I think we have to find out.\n  Since the President's announcement of the agreement, I have \nendeavored to examine it carefully and thoroughly, and I look forward \nto the review process led by the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, who has promised a full and fair scrutiny of this particular \ndeal.\n  Nevertheless, my initial review has raised serious questions about \nwhether this agreement forecloses Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. If \nleft unanswered, these concerns lead me to believe that this agreement \ncould end up being a catastrophic mistake.\n  Time and again, the Obama administration has promised that this \nagreement will add stability to the region. However, the details lead \nme to believe that the deal will, in fact, seriously destabilize the \nregion.\n  If the deal is implemented, $150 billion in Iranian assets that are \ncurrently frozen in the world's financial institutions will be once \nagain made available to the regime, which is a prime benefactor of \nterrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. These terrorist groups \ncontinually threaten one of our closest allies, and of course that is \nIsrael.\n  The fact that much of this money will be used to promote \ninternational terrorism is not even disputed by the Obama \nadministration. Just this past weekend, President Obama's National \nSecurity Advisor, Susan Rice, stated: ``We should expect that some \nportion of that money would go to the Iranian military and could be \npotentially used for the kinds of bad behavior that we've seen in the \nregion up until now.''\n  While I am troubled that the administration now uses a term such as \n``bad behavior'' to describe international terrorism, Ms. Rice is \nundoubtedly right about where this money will go.\n  Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute points out what \nhappened when the European Union previously opened trade with Iran as \nan incentive for Tehran to moderate its behavior. Iran's response was \nto take ``that hard currency windfall and put it disproportionately \ninto its covert nuclear and ballistic missile program.''\n  As such, by implementing this agreement, the United States will \npermit the financing of international terrorism not only against \nAmericans but also against our closest allies, including Israel. But \nfunding terrorism is just for starters. This agreement also removes the \nconventional arms embargo against Iran after 5 years. Reportedly, the \nRussians were particularly intent upon this clause. They stand to \nbenefit if the Iranians spend some of their $150 billion windfall to \nbuy Russian arms. In fact, Russia has already committed to sell them \nits highly sophisticated S-300 surface-to-air missile system. This \nhighly capable weapon system could protect Iran's nuclear sites if the \nregime violates the agreement. Moreover, this agreement also lifts the \nballistic missile embargo against Iran after 8 years. This is an \nincredibly troubling development.\n  My examination of the deal also brings into question whether the \nadministration achieved our primary objective: preventing Iran from \nproducing enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon. For years \nIranians have stockpiled advanced centrifuges to produce this material. \nYet this deal does not force them to part with this critical equipment. \nIn fact, after 8 years under this agreement, the Iranians will be able \nto begin building and stockpiling more than 200 advanced centrifuges a \nyear.\n  Moreover, the means to deploy a nuclear device were not fully \naddressed by this deal. The agreement mentions that Iran will not \npursue activities that could contribute to the design and development \nof a nuclear explosive device, but it fails to detail most of the \nspecific tools, equipment, materials, and components that are necessary \nto manufacture and fabricate a nuclear explosive device.\n  This is not a done deal. Eleven weeks ago, 98 Senators voted for the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. While far from perfect, this \nbipartisan legislation gave Congress a vital say in whether this Iran \ndeal goes forward. Let us not waste this opportunity. Those who served \nbefore us did not shirk their responsibility to weigh in on the serious \nforeign policy decisions of their day.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in this great body to stand with me in \nexamining this agreement with great caution about its implications for \nthe security of the United States and our allies in the region.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the financial crisis, $13 trillion \nin household wealth was erased. Nine million jobs were lost, and 5 \nmillion Americans, 5 million families and individuals lost their homes. \nThe financial services industry has bounced back, and far too many \nAmerican families have not.\n  While many in Washington may have forgotten the financial crisis, \nmillions of Americans haven't forgotten how predatory lending practices \ncontributed to the housing bubble and helped spark this crisis. For \nthem, this was the crisis.\n  Unscrupulous lenders offered loans that required no documentation, \nloans with teaser interest rates that later spiked and undermined a \nborrower's ability to repay, and loans where borrowers never paid down \ntheir principal. Borrowers with these higher cost loans were foreclosed \nupon at almost triple the rate of borrowers with conforming 30-year \nfixed-rate mortgages.\n  The crisis revealed a host of other harmful practices, such as \nsteering borrowers to affiliated companies, kickbacks for business \nreferrals, inflated appraisals, and loan officer compensation based on \nthe loan product that they peddled. These practices offered little \nbenefit to the borrower. They were not about helping those families \npurchase a home they could afford. It is no coincidence that as \nborrowers' costs increased, so did loan officers' compensation.\n  These abuses didn't start in 2007 and in 2008. In many communities, \npredatory lenders began moving in a decade or more before the crisis.\n  In Ohio, the housing crisis was a slow burn rather than the boom and \nbust cycle that happened in States such as California and Arizona. From \n1995 to 2009--think about this--my State of Ohio had 14 consecutive \nyears where there were more foreclosures than the years before. For 14 \nyears in a row, the number of foreclosures went up and up and up--14 \nyears in a row.\n  My wife and I live just south of Slavic Village in Cleveland, ZIP \nCode 44105. I mention that ZIP Code because in 2007, that ZIP Code had \nthe highest foreclosure rate of any ZIP Code in the United States of \nAmerica. This wasn't because of speculation. This was a declining \nindustrial base, and this was the kind of predatory lending that tended \nto settle and sink its talons into communities like Slavic Village. \nGovernment policies favoring finance over manufacturing caused steel \nmills across Northeast Ohio and the rest of the country to shut down \nand force people to look elsewhere for work. Between 2000 and 2010, the \npopulation of Slavic Village dropped 27 percent, down to 20,000 people, \nand then the subprime lending industry moved in. By 2006 more than 900 \nof Slavic Village's 3,000 properties--900 out of 3,000--were in \nforeclosure. If the home next door to you is foreclosed on and \nabandoned, you can bet the value of your home begins to decline 2 \npercent, 3 percent, 4 percent, and then the one across the street and \nthen one down the street. One can see what happens to this \nneighborhood. One in three Ohioans in the height of the crisis--one in \nthree Ohioans' mortgages were underwater. One in every seven \nmortgageholders was 30 days delinquent or in foreclosure.\n\n  Behind every foreclosure is a painful conversation. We don't think \nmuch about that here. We think of numbers, policies, and statistics. \nBut imagine if you are a mother or father, and you have a 12-year-old \nor 13-year-old son and daughter. First, the mother loses her job. \nThings change around the house. You begin to cut back on things. You \nbegin to take money out of the college fund to send your kid to \nCuyahoga Community College. Then the husband loses his job. Then you \nhave to have that discussion. There were 5 million discussions like \nthese that went on in these homes where there were foreclosures. You \nhave to explain to your son or daughter: We aren't going to be living \nhere. We can't afford this house. We are leaving the neighborhood. You \nare probably going to a different school. We don't know where we are \nmoving. We are going to have to find a new place to live. Maybe we are \ngoing to have to give away the family pet. There is a shelter in Parma, \nOH, that went from 200 to 2,000 dogs and cats that they were housing \nbecause so many people gave up their pets because of the foreclosures \nthat so many families endured.\n  We came together as a result to pass Wall Street reform so families \nwould no longer be forced to upend their lives because a mortgage \ncompany preyed upon them. Dodd-Frank established a commonsense rule \nthat requires lenders to ensure that borrowers have the ability to \nrepay their home loans. We created a consumer protection bureau to make \nsure that never again would consumers be an afterthought.\n  Much of the CFPB's important work has centered around mortgage \nregulation. Their rule to streamline forms will help inform consumers \nto understand what is happening at the closing table.\n  The ability to pay. A qualified mortgage rule balances the need for \nmortgage credit with the need of documentation of income and other \nborrower protections.\n  We know there is more to be done. We must ensure that small lenders \nand community institutions can remain competitive. We know how bank \nconcentrations become more and more of a problem. We must provide \nhomeowners with protections from a broken servicing model that has \nharmed so many of our communities. We must ensure broad access to \naffordable housing--the right thing to do for families and communities. \nWe must move forward. We know there will be a clear choice.\n  As we move forward, we know there are two paths to follow. We can \naccept the false narrative that inaccurately blames low-income \nborrowers in the Federal programs, FHA, VA, to maintain their \nunderwriting standards during the boom. In other words, we can blame \nthe victim. We can say: Oh, it was the homeowners who caused this. It \nwas the people who got the mortgages. It was all their fault. They \nweren't smart enough and they were so irresponsible. And we can blame \nthe government because it is always the government's fault or we can \nrecognize there were flawed incentives encouraged by a lack of \nregulatory oversight at the heart of our Nation's financial system--\nflawed incentives that made risk-taking more profitable, flawed \nincentives that increased loan officers' compensation when they made \nloans they should not have been making.\n  We can maintain the 30-year fixed mortgage that has made \nhomeownership more affordable and given so many families an asset upon \nretirement. We can preserve a strong government role in the mortgage \nmarket, but instead too many in this body want to undermine the reforms \nthat we put in place 5 years ago. Republicans and their allies in the \nfinancial industry fought Wall Street reform every step of the way. \nThey have been attacking these consumer protections since the day they \nbegan.\n  We have to remember what a top financial services lobbyist said. The \nday the President signed Dodd-Frank, the top lobbyists in the financial \nindustry said: Well, folks, today is half-time. Today is half-time, \nmeaning, OK, we lost in Congress, but we are going to keep pushing \nthese agencies. We are going to keep lobbying Congress. We are going to \ntry to roll back these rules. We are going to stop these rules. We are \ngoing to dilute these rules and make them ineffective.\n  The bill my Republican colleagues today on the Appropriations \nCommittee brought in--Senator Coons will talk about that. The bill the \nRepublicans brought into Senator Merkley's and my banking committee \nisn't a narrower targeted effort at reform for\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\nsmall banks. It is a sweeping overhaul that rolls back Wall Street \nreform. Once again, they want to undermine consumer protection. They \nwant to use small Main Street institutions as cover, but in the end \nthey want to allow special interests and their allies to undermine \nreform and leave the American people exposed to the problems that \nhappened less than a decade ago. It is unconscionable that this abuse \nwas ever allowed in the first place.\n  Senator Merkley, a leader on this issue, especially in the Volcker \nrule, will speak about his efforts and what he has seen in the past and \nparticularly looking forward to the future about what we do about \npredatory loans and people and banks preying on consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of my \ncolleague from Ohio, who has brought such a focus on ending predatory \nactivities, helping our financial system work for working Americans. \nIndeed, that is certainly what all of our effort is about on the fifth \nanniversary of the Wall Street reform bill, the Dodd-Frank bill. My \ncolleague was talking about the Humble Home mortgage, which was turned \ninto a predatory instrument that instead of building the wealth of the \nmiddle class of America was designed to strip that wealth. There was \nthe two-year teaser rates in which interest rates would go from 4 \npercent to 9 percent, more than doubling. Liar loan underwritings, in \nwhich the loan is way too large for a family, were given to a family \njust to reap the immediate benefits on behalf of the mortgage broker: \nthe immediate commissions, steering payments and kickbacks that were \npaid to mortgage originators to steer their clients from the prime loan \nthey qualified for into the subprime loan.\n  Now, thankfully, as the Senator from Ohio outlined, we have ended \nthose predatory practices and we must not let those practices return.\n  Homeownership has been the foundation for middle-class wealth--\nhomeownership, education, and good-paying jobs. We cannot take away \nhomeownership as a significant part of the American dream, the dream to \ncontrol your own space, the king or queen of your own castle, and \ncertainly to build the equity that puts your family on a strong \nfinancial foundation.\n  Wall Street added to this particular story because they took these \npredatory teaser rate loans and put them into securities. One can think \nabout securities as a box full of mortgages. Those mortgages generate a \ncertain cashflow, and you sell the cashflow. That is what a security \nis. So these securities were only as strong as the mortgages that were \nin the security box, and those mortgages were deeply flawed. When the \ninterest rate went from 4 percent to 9 percent, a family's payments \ndoubled. They weren't able to make their payments because the \nunderwriting had been inappropriate from the beginning, and they \nweren't able to get out of the loan because there was a prepayment \npenalty if they tried to get out of the loan. That was a steel trap \nthat locked families into these inflated interest rates and eventually \ndestroyed their finances. So we ended all that.\n  Think about what Wall Street did. They took these mortgages and set \nup a securities waterfall--AAA, AA, and so forth. They got ratings on \nthese securities as if these home loans were the same sound, good home \nloans of the past, not these new steering payment, prepayment penalty \nteaser-rate loans that had started to become so common and such a \ndifferent instrument. Wall Street said we will make a lot of money \nselling these securities.\n  Indeed, there were a couple other factors that came into play. Not \nonly did credit agencies give them great ratings despite the underlying \nflaws, but there was also insurance that could be bought to protect the \nsecurity in case it would fail. It was called a credit default swap or \nCDS. For a few cents you could buy insurance to make sure the security \nwas good. Of course, insurance is only as strong as the insurance \ncompany behind it, and the purchasers didn't know the details of that \nbecause it went through the middlemen in Wall Street. It turned out \nthat AIG, the American Insurance Group, was issuing this insurance in \nvast quantities, not doing what an insurance group normally does, which \nis set aside reserves to cover potential losses. Indeed, they were just \non a short-term upward--hey, we can sell these insurance policies \ncalled CDS or credit default swaps for a ton of money for short-term \nprofits and long-term irresponsibility.\n  So let's fast-forward from 2003, when the predatory loans came into \npopularity, and now we are in 2008 and mortgages are starting to fail, \nthe securities are starting to fail, and then of course the insurance \non those securities failed. Meanwhile, you have investment houses. For \nexample, Lehman Brothers in 1998 had $28 billion in proprietary \nholdings, and by 2006 that had expanded to $313 billion against a \ncapital base of just $18 billion in common equity. Think of that \nleverage--$313 billion in holdings and a base of $18 billion. That \nenormous leverage meant that if there was just a slight decline in the \nvalue of the products they were holding, then the whole firm was going \nto come tumbling down. Because these securities started to fail, they \ndidn't have just a slight decline, they had a big decline. Suddenly, \nyou have a major investment house, Lehman Brothers, out of business.\n  That sent shock waves through our entire financial enterprise because \na lot of the financing--short-term financing--was done through 24-hour \nfinancial transactions called repurchase agreements or repo agreements. \nRepurchase agreements--you sell an asset for 24 hours, you get the \nmoney, you buy it back 24 hours later, and then you resell it. That \nmeans every 24 hours you have to come up with the cash to buy back this \nrepo financing. When the underlying value started to go down, the \ncompany couldn't come up with the funds to execute the repurchase \nagreements, so they had to do a fire sale of their assets. Well, if \nthey do a fire sale of their assets, that means for every other company \nthat has similar products, the value of their products now goes down \nthe tube overnight, and then they have problems. So you have a domino \neffect--a contagion that spreads through the financial industry.\n  Let's trace this back in simple circumstances. You had healthy \nhomeowner loans, fully amortizing fair loans replaced by predatory \nteaser-rate loans leading to securities based on these faulty predatory \nmortgages. These securities became a major financial instrument. That \nfinancial instrument collapsed when the mortgages collapsed. There was \na domino effect, a contagion that brought down our entire financial \nhouse.\n  The American worker was on the losing end of this house of cards. \nAmerican workers lost their jobs. American workers lost their \nretirement savings. These American workers often lost their homes \nbecause after losing their jobs, they couldn't pay for their home or \nbecause the teaser-rate mortgage doubled in monthly payments, they \ncouldn't make those monthly payments.\n  That type of destruction in which Wall Street casinos fared so well \nand American workers were so destroyed must not happen again. That is \nwhat the Wall Street reform bill is all about. On the fifth \nanniversary, we have ended through the Volcker rule the proprietary \ntrading that was basically large hedge funds embodied within banks \nbeing essentially done on the backs of Federal deposit insurance; that \nis, the government was insuring the banks that were engaging in these \nhighly leveraged hedge fund operations. That is just wrong.\n  If you want to operate a hedge fund, absolutely, get your investors, \nplace your bets, and if you go down, the investors go down, but the \nbanking system doesn't go down. We must not allow these highly \nleveraged hedge funds to be operating inside of our core banking \nsystem.\n  The phrase that was often used as we were working on this 5 years ago \nwas ``Let's make banking boring again.'' Take deposits, make loans, and \nthrough those loans fuel the success of our families and our \nbusinesses. But if you want to be a high-risk investor, do it somewhere \nelse.\n  That is the core story about shutting down the Wall Street casino. \nThis is the Wall Street casino before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform \nbill: Sorry, we are closed; afterwards: Well, I am not sorry they are \nclosed because we\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\nhave rebuilt a financial system designed to work for working Americans, \nand that is a good thing.\n  I look forward to turning this over to my colleague from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues from \nOhio and Oregon, as we come to the floor today to talk about the 5 \nyears since the passage of the Wall Street reform bill--better known as \nDodd-Frank--and what it has meant for our States and for our country.\n  It is no secret that Delaware, my home State, is also home to a very \nlarge financial services industry. The whole range of financial \ninstitutions--from small community banks and credit unions, to larger \nregional banks, to literally some of the largest banks in the world--\nhas a home in my State and employs tens of thousands of my \nconstituents.\n  So I understand it might be surprising to some to see me come to the \nfloor and join my colleagues in defense of the broad and sweeping Wall \nStreet reform bill that was enacted 5 years ago, but as a Democrat \nrepresenting these workers in a State that benefits from a robust \nfinancial services industry, I also know how important strong, stable, \nsecure, predictable capital markets and well-functioning and well-\nregulated financial services are to a healthy economy from which we can \nall benefit. If we don't have a bank we can trust, we can't get a loan \nor buy a home or finance an education--investments that can serve as \nfoundations to a brighter future for our families. If we don't have \nrobust capital markets, companies cannot get money they need to invest \nin people and products and services, in growth and in jobs.\n  If you think of a world without functioning or reliable financial \nservices, you can picture money sitting useless, unaccessible under a \nmattress. Without the roadways--the banks and financial services--to \nconnect it, this money cannot move and an economy cannot grow. Quite \nliterally, everything grinds to a halt.\n  We don't have to look far to see an example of this sort of seizing \nup of a modern economy. Greece has recently experienced a devastating \nfinancial crisis where money stopped flowing into and out of their \neconomy, banks limited the amount of cash people could take out, and \nthe government prohibited people from sending money abroad. The result \nwas widespread panic, disruption of day-to-day lives, and a deep \ndistrust of banks and banking that will take a long time to heal.\n  Capital markets and financial services that are well regulated and \nwell run are important to us all. That is why we have to do everything \nwe can to protect them. They make up a critical part of our Nation's \neconomic infrastructure and lay the foundation for economic recovery. \nBut just as streets need traffic lights and sharp turns need speed \nlimits and bridges need guardrails, so, too, financial systems need \nfair and enforceable regulations. The alternative is what we saw just 5 \nyears ago--the near collapse of our economy.\n  When the 2008 financial crisis unfolded, I was a local elected \nofficial in Delaware, not a Senator. As our mortgage system, our \nbanking system, and our markets collapsed, I saw the real wreckage in \nmy own home community. I saw thousands of folks who lost their jobs, \nwho lost their life savings, who lost their homes, and the painful and \nlasting impact on them and on our whole community.\n  The 2008 crisis proved that a poorly regulated market left everyone \nexposed to risk, from consumers to financial services workers. Worst of \nall, it sparked a widespread distrust in our economy and our banks both \nhere at home and abroad that we are still working to recover from \ntoday. The devastation caused by the great recession proved our \nfinancial system needed stronger regulations to protect consumers, \nfamilies, businesses, and to make sure our capital markets are liquid, \ntrustworthy, and reliable globally to instill faith back into our \neconomy and system.\n  So I believe it was in our national best interest for there to be \nadopted fair, predicable rules to make sure we could all drive on the \nroad safely, metaphorically, regardless of what size car we drove or \nwhat side of the road we were driving on. That is why, 5 years ago, in \nthe wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, \nCongress's groundbreaking Wall Street reforms needed to become law. \nThose reforms took important steps to strengthen the rules of the road \nand prevent another significant crisis for our economy.\n  Congress created an agency, the CFPB, or Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, with a simple important mission: to protect \nconsumers from abusive financial products. By helping to ensure that \nconsumers have accurate financial information about the risks and \nbenefits of financial products, CFPB works to prevent risky lending \npractices. An essential feature of CFPB is that it is an independent \nagency with only one responsibility; that is, protecting consumers.\n  Second, Wall Street reform limited risky and unsafe investment \npractices at the highest levels of finance. It set strong capital \nstandards so banks have a sturdy backstop in times of need and ensured \nthat regulators have the tools to scrutinize banking practices that are \nfar more complicated than ever before--in fact, at the very limits of \nwhat is capable of regulatory oversight.\n\n  Congress required banks to perform risk testing, to improve oversight \nand make sure they can withstand turbulence in the same way first \nresponders are required to perform regular safety drills to make sure \neverything works properly in the case of a crisis or a fire. Banks are \nnow required to make sure they have the protocols and the policies and \nthe resources in place to respond effectively to a renewed financial \ncrisis.\n  Last, the financial crisis made it clear that although there is much \nwe can do to limit risk and protect consumers, banks--particularly big \nbanks--can still fail. When they do, it is critical they are wound \ndown, they are resolved, they are closed in a way that is responsible, \ndoes not spread contagion and harm the larger economy, and does not \nrequire an expensive taxpayer bailout. That is why Wall Street reform \ngave the government new abilities to responsibly wind down banks so \nthey do not cause a financial earthquake, much in the way the \ngovernment has done with smaller banks through the FDIC for more than \n80 years.\n  While I believe these reforms took much needed steps toward making \nsure our financial system is strong and healthy, I also believe we can \nbuild upon these reforms.\n  One of its key authors, Senator Dodd, said just yesterday--former \nSenator and Chairman Dodd said just yesterday at a public event: It \nwasn't the Ten Commandments that was crafted; it was a law, and a law \nthat needs to be improved.\n  I know it might be difficult to believe Democrats and Republicans can \nfind common ground on Wall Street reform, but there are, in fact, \nchanges we can agree on that will make sure these reforms protect \nconsumers and financial services. For example, we ought to lighten the \nregulatory burden on community banks so smaller banks can provide \nlending that their neighborhoods really need to grow and thrive. That \nis why Senator Merkley and I have cosponsored Senator Brown's important \nbill, the Community Lender Regulatory Relief and Protection Act, which \nwould help smaller banks by streamlining exams, by helping credit \nunions develop more diverse sources of capital, and by reducing onerous \nprivacy notification rules.\n  Many of the proposals in this bill have bipartisan support. I am \neager to work with my colleagues to implement those and other \nimprovements. But unfortunately, rather than looking for ways to \nstrengthen and sustain the broad architecture of Wall Street reform, \ntoo many of our Republican colleagues have continued to try to roll \nback the clock. We have seen how Republicans in the House have \ncontinued efforts to dismantle these bills, in particular in recent \nappropriations legislation. They have supported significant, harmful \ncuts to the regulatory agencies that are charged with rulemaking and \nwith oversight--the most important entities in the financial services \nrealm. They have also tried to undermine and undercut the CFPB's \nindependence.\n  Just today, Senate Republicans have proposed similarly misguided \nlegislation. I plan to do everything I can to\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\nprotect those agencies and stop efforts to fundamentally undo important \nWall Street reform.\n  It is time for my colleagues to stop proposing spending bills on a \nwide range of the subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee that \nhave no chance of passing and that continue to push us closer to an \ninevitable government shutdown that would devastate our economy and I \nthink cause real harm to our working families. I have heard those very \nsame colleagues argue that by doing so, they are on the side of banks \nand they are on the side of increasing the forward growth of our \neconomy and that is why they want to dismantle regulations. But what I \nhear from business leaders and bank leaders in my home State is that \nthe biggest threat they face are more manufactured crises here in \nCongress that chip away at the confidence in the American economy that \nserves as a bedrock of our prosperity.\n  As the leading Democrat on the committee charged with overseeing the \nfinancial services funding bills here in the Senate, I think it is \ncritical that we work together to improve Wall Street reforms where we \ncan rather than reverse what progress we have made. Whether you are a \nRepublican or a Democrat, a consumer or a banker, a CEO or a small \nbusiness owner, a family member or a financial services worker, we can \nall agree that we do not want another financial crisis. Nobody wants \nanother bailout to banks.\n  I strongly believe you can be pro-business, pro-financial services, \nand still believe in smart, strong, sensible regulation to keep \neveryone in our financial services system healthy and our overall \nsystem and economy safe. I believe a well-regulated financial system is \ncritical to sustaining this sector into the future and ensuring that it \nis a trusted place for businesses and consumers to invest in from at \nhome or abroad. A strong, secure, stable economy has long been the \nhallmark of America's global leadership, so I think we must work \ntogether to make sure it remains that way for decades to come.\n  Wall Street reform was the result of a lot of hard work and \ncompromise just 5 years ago. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to continue strengthening the financial rules of the road as \nwe go further into the future together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, School of \nNursing.\n  The UNLV School of Nursing has been an important part of Nevada's\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nhealth care system since it admitted its first class in 1965. The \nprogram was established in part because of a nursing shortage in the \nState of Nevada in the early 1960s. The nursing shortage, coupled with \nthe State's sudden population growth, threatened to create an untenable \nsituation for all Nevadans. Recognizing this, various stakeholders, \nincluding the Nevada Public Health Association, Nevada Nurses \nAssociation, and Nevada State Board of Nursing, worked to create the \nnursing school to fill vacant nursing positions throughout the State \nand provide quality nursing education to Nevada residents. The first \ngraduating class included 19 students; and to date, more than 4,300 \nstudents have graduated from the UNLV School of Nursing.\n  In fulfilling its mission of providing an exceptional education to \nnursing students and meeting Nevada's health care needs, the UNLV \nSchool of Nursing has established a tradition of progress, innovation, \nand leadership. For instance, when the school first began, it only \noffered an associate degree program. Today, the school offers eleven \nacademic programs. Additionally, the school began offering an online \nmaster's degree program in 2004. This program ranks among the top ten \nbest online graduate nursing programs in the Nation. I am confident \nthat the UNLV School of Nursing will continue to play a critical role \nin Nevada's health care system as it begins its next chapter.\n  I commend the UNLV School of Nursing on their 50th anniversary and \napplaud their exceptional service to the State of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5452-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5452-S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of my remarks at the American Enterprise Institute be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Reauthorizing the Higher Education Act\n\n       Thank you, Andrew. It's great to be here. It's great to be \n     at AEI, an organization for which I have lots of respect. I \n     also have great respect for our institutions for higher \n     education. As Dr. Kelly said, I was once president of the \n     University of Tennessee. That's harder than it looks. I \n     remember on my first day on campus a faculty member came up \n     to me, I was very enthusiastic that day, and she said, ``You \n     have so much enthusiasm, you're reminding me of Clark Kerr.'' \n     And I said, ``Well, thank you very much,'' because Clark Kerr \n     was a distinguished president of the University of \n     California. And I said, ``How is that?'' She said, ``You \n     know, he arrived and left in the same way--fired with \n     enthusiasm.'' It's a precarious existence, most college \n     presidents will tell you.\n       I wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last week in \n     which I urged fellow politicians and some pundits to stop \n     telling students they cannot afford a college education. I \n     noted that two years of community college are free or nearly \n     free for low-income students, given that tuition and fees \n     across the country average $3,300 and that the average Pell \n     grant is about the same. Public 4-year colleges average about \n     $9,000 in tuition and fees. I wrote that at the University of \n     Tennessee, Knoxville, which is closer to $12,000, nearly \n     every in-state freshman has a state Hope Scholarship, a third \n     have Pell grants, and many have access to state aid. About 75 \n     percent of all college students attend those public \n     institutions.\n       Even many of the private elite colleges have programs to \n     help families figure out what they can afford to borrow and \n     then those institutions such as Georgetown University make up \n     the difference. Many students borrow money for college, but \n     the average 4-year graduate's debt is about $27,000--or \n     roughly the same as the average new car loan. And for that \n     investment, you get a college degree that the College Board \n     still says will earn you $1 million dollars more over your \n     lifetime than if you hadn't earned that degree. The problem, \n     I explained in my op-ed, is that we need to grow the \n     percentage of Americans with college degrees over the next 5 \n     years--otherwise we're on track to fall short by 5 million \n     workers with degrees. So politicians, in my view, should stop \n     discouraging students from attending college--especially the \n     low-income students who are likely to benefit most from \n     federal aid, and may also be the most easily discouraged.\n       Well, on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal ran letters to \n     the editor in response to my op-ed. Here's a sampling from \n     one: ``Lamar Alexander has been a politician so long that he \n     no longer understands that money comes from working people \n     who understand what is expensive, and four years of college \n     plus living expenses is expensive.'' From another, ``The \n     traditional system is unsustainable.'' From another \n     ``Politicians should stop talking about a college 'premium' \n     because the costs, even with all the subsidies, exceed the \n     benefits for many.'' And another: ``It is counterintuitive to \n     many politicians, but the more affordable they try to make \n     higher education, the less affordable it will become.''\n       In other words--I hit a nerve.\n       But buried at the bottom of these letters published by the \n     Wall Street Journal was this brief line from a woman in San \n     Diego: ``Years ago'' she said, ``there was a bumper sticker: \n     `Think education is expensive? Try life without it!' '' Still \n     holds true and always will.\n       I've always said that it is never easy to pay for college. \n     It's just easier than most people think. And as we approach \n     the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in the Senate \n     education Committee, I don't pretend that our system is not \n     in need of reforms. But let's begin with the shared \n     recognition that life without education is more expensive--\n     and that the cost to our country will be great if we don't \n     increase the number of Americans with post-secondary \n     education and degrees.\n       So let's look at measures we can take as a federal \n     government to encourage colleges to control their costs, \n     operate more efficiently, help students graduate more quickly \n     with less debt--and let's be sure that all these measures do \n     nothing to challenge the autonomy and independence that is at \n     the heart of our education system--the autonomy and \n     independence that have driven our colleges and universities \n     to create the best system of higher education in the world.\n       So I'd like to focus today on four goals for the \n     reauthorization that we're working on: first: ending the \n     overregulation of colleges and universities; second: ending \n     the federal collection and dissemination of useless data; \n     third: improving our accreditation system; and fourth: \n     ensuring that institutions begin sharing in the risk of \n     lending to students.\n       So let's take the first one--ending the overregulation of \n     colleges. Now I'm here today as a Republican speaking to a \n     generally conservative audience about reducing regulations--\n     not a new idea for most of us. But there's an important \n     distinction in this--we already have bipartisan support in \n     the committee for reducing these regulations. Senator \n     Mikulski, Senator Bennet, Senator Burr and I commissioned a \n     report two years ago on higher education regulation by a task \n     force of educators, and we asked for specific recommendations \n     on how to reduce these regulations. We said, ``We don't want \n     another sermon. Tell us exactly what we could do to reduce \n     the regulatory burden.'' And we got back 59 recommendations, \n     with 10 listed as priorities. A dozen of them are things that \n     the U.S. Secretary of Education himself could do and the rest \n     would require some sort of congressional action. We are \n     currently working on legislation that adopts and implements \n     many of the report's recommendations.\n       The report told us that the higher education system is \n     entangled in, the report's words, a ``jungle of red tape'' \n     and that every workday, each one of our 6,000 higher \n     education institutions gets a letter or a guidance or a new \n     rule from the U.S. Department of Education, on average. Every \n     workday, every one of our institutions, 6,000 of them, get a \n     letter or a guidance or a new rule from the US Department of \n     Education that presumably changes their procedures.\n       Here are three examples of how that plays out in our \n     colleges:\n       First, Vanderbilt University--because the chancellor of \n     Vanderbilt was one of the co-chairs of our group making these \n     recommendations and the other was the chancellor of the \n     University of Maryland. So Vanderbilt hired the Boston \n     Consulting Group to tell the university just how much it cost \n     Vanderbilt to comply with Federal rules and regulations in \n     one year, 2014, and the startling answer was $150 million--\n     $11,000 per student. $11,000 is more than the average tuition \n     in fees at public universities in the United States.\n       Second, here's the FAFSA form that 20 million Americans \n     fill out every year. Some of you have seen it. This is the \n     form 20 million Americans fill out every year in order to get \n     a grant or loan to attend college. Now most people fill it \n     out online, some financial aid officers disparage my doing \n     this because they say it's not that hard to fill out. Maybe \n     not for them, I mean they've been working on it for years. \n     But I've talked to students who have literally burst into \n     tears over the complexity of this thing. The president of a \n     community college in Memphis told me he thinks he loses 1,500 \n     students a semester because this is simply such an \n     intimidating list of questions. We have testimony in our \n     education committee that said those 108 questions could be \n     reduced to two. One would be: what's the size of your family, \n     and two would be: what's the size of your family income. That \n     would answer 95 percent of the questions that the U.S. \n     Department of Education needs to award federal student aid.\n       Third, the government hands out $24 billion in research \n     dollars to colleges and universities through the National \n     Institutes of Health. The National Academy of Sciences has a \n     study group that's twice done a survey and both times found \n     that 42 percent of a principal investigator's time with \n     federally funded research is spent on administrative tasks. \n     If we could reduce that 42 percent to 40 percent or 35 \n     percent or 30 percent or 25\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\n     percent, we could free up hundreds of millions of dollars, \n     maybe billions, for additional research. In other words, we \n     can save time, energy, money, and encourage more college \n     degrees if we reduce higher education regulations.\n       My second goal is ending the federal collection and \n     dissemination of useless data.\n       We've had five hearings on higher education this year. Our \n     third hearing was on consumer data. The federal government \n     collects a lot of data from 6,000 institutions. At the \n     hearing, I held up the data survey that each of our almost \n     1,000 public community colleges must fill out. It's similar \n     to the surveys that the other 5,000 colleges fill out. This \n     one was 426 pages of data requirements and reporting \n     instructions, with 3,300 different necessary responses or \n     inputs.\n       Then there are the federally mandated college consumer \n     disclosures. Those require a 900-page binder to show what one \n     university with two campuses is required to disclose to \n     consumers. The law and regulations prescribe a dizzying \n     variety of ways the different disclosures must be sent to \n     current students and, upon request, the public items range \n     from the useful and necessary--such as providing the terms \n     and conditions of federal student aid to such things as \n     informing students when Constitution Day is. Not only do I \n     question what is really necessary--but more important, how \n     much of this is useful to students making a college choice? \n     Then, how might consumer information actually become useful \n     for prospective students, and what better information may be \n     needed? What requirements can we eliminate? And on a separate \n     issue--once we've collected the right data, how good are we \n     disseminating the data, at least in a way that you can \n     understand it? The government has created tools--from the \n     College Navigator to the College Scorecard--but the \n     government is really not very good at doing this, and \n     students aren't really actually using those tools very much \n     to choose among colleges.\n       My third goal is to improve our accreditation system. We \n     held a hearing on accreditation in the committee last month. \n     I learned a lot, but our accreditation system has to improve \n     because there is really no decent alternative. Congress can't \n     monitor 6,000 colleges and universities. The Department of \n     Education sure can't. Accreditation has to work.\n       Here are a few of the areas that I think could see \n     improvement, and there seems to be some consensus about \n     these:\n       Getting accreditors back to focusing on quality and not on \n     all the other things Congress has asked accreditors to do \n     over the years, such as reviewing fire codes and looking over \n     an institution's finances.\n       Changing the geographic nature of today's accreditation \n     system: There seems to be less validity today for having \n     regional accreditation agencies exclusively. When I was \n     president of the University of Tennessee I would look at the \n     University of Illinois or the University of Michigan--the \n     universities outside our region as peers.\n       Allowing accreditors to use more discretion in their \n     oversight--in other words, using a lighter touch for some \n     institutions. So accreditors can get more of their time and \n     resources to institutions clearly in need of greater \n     oversight and have a lighter touch on those that don't.\n       My last goal is ensuring that institutions begin sharing in \n     the risk of lending to students. We know that some students \n     today are borrowing more than they should. According to the \n     Department of Education, of the more than 41 million \n     borrowers with outstanding student debt, about 7 million, or \n     17 percent, are currently in default--meaning they haven't \n     made a payment on their loans in at least 9 months. The total \n     amount of loans currently in default is $108 billion or about \n     10 percent of the total outstanding balance of federal \n     student loans. Although the Department says it eventually \n     collects most of it.\n       One way to address over-borrowing is to ensure that \n     colleges have some responsibility to, or vested interest in, \n     encouraging students to borrow wisely, graduate on time, and \n     be able to repay what they've been loaned. If colleges and \n     universities have this incentive, it may not only help \n     students make wiser decisions about how much to borrow, it \n     could help reduce the cost of college--thereby reducing debt. \n     For example, colleges might encourage students to complete \n     their education more quickly.\n       Today nearly half of college students take longer than 6 \n     years to complete any degree or certificate or never finish \n     one at all. Completion is important--nearly 70 percent of \n     those borrowers who default on their federal student loan \n     never finished their education.\n       At The University of Tennessee Knoxville they're now saying \n     to students, ``You can take less than 15 hours if you want \n     to, but you're going to pay for 15 hours every semester \n     whether you take it or not.'' That's three more than federal \n     student aid requirements insist on. The chancellor told me \n     not long ago that most students are taking 15 hours since \n     they're paying for it anyway, and the graduation rate is \n     edging up.\n       I have also encouraged colleges and universities to explore \n     a three year degree. The more rapidly you move through the \n     system, the less expense you have, and the quicker you get \n     into an earning capacity.\n       I recently spoke at a graduation ceremony at Walters State \n     Community College in Tennessee where one of the graduates was \n     also graduating from high school that week. Getting both \n     degrees, and also entering Purdue University as a second \n     semester sophomore, saving that student an estimated $65,000. \n     At another community college in Tennessee, 30 percent of the \n     students at that community college are also in high school. \n     There's a growing practice of what we call ``dual \n     enrollment,'' and that permits students to spend less time \n     and spend less money on college.\n       The President of George Washington University once told me, \n     ``You could run two complete colleges here [at his campus] \n     with two complete faculties, in the facilities now used half \n     the year for one. That's without cutting the length of \n     students' vacations, increasing class sizes or requiring \n     faculty to teach more.'' One of the biggest wastes in higher \n     education is the waste in the use of facilities. Dartmouth, \n     for example, saves $10 to $15 million per year, it estimates, \n     by requiring one mandatory summer session for its students. \n     Southern New Hampshire University's College for America just \n     began offering a $10,000 bachelor's degree.\n       So we are working on a way to give colleges some skin in \n     the game. Senator Reed of Rhode Island has a proposal. He \n     wants to make colleges and universities responsible for a \n     portion of defaulted loans of students. That's a framework \n     worth considering. Others may have different ideas.\n       For me, what is clear is that as a matter of principle and \n     fairness, all institutions--whether public, private or for-\n     profit--should participate in this. I don't believe any \n     institution should be exempt from those requirements that we \n     may add to discourage over-borrowing and reduce college \n     costs. But it might be appropriate to consider establishing \n     multiple models of risk-sharing so that institutions with \n     differing missions and student populations have different \n     ways of complying. And we have to be very careful with risk-\n     sharing. We're talking about lots of money. We're talking \n     about loaning more than $100 billion a year. We're talking \n     about $33 or $34 billion dollars a year to Pell Grants that \n     you don't have to pay back. So if we, on the loaning of $100 \n     billion dollars a year, take some step, it will have a big \n     effect on the thousands institutions and millions of students \n     across the country. We want to be sure that we think about \n     what the unintended consequences might be.\n       Today, when I'm done, I'm going back to the floor of the \n     Senate, where we are to complete work on our bill to fix No \n     Child Left Behind, which I've worked on with Senator Patty \n     Murray from Washington state, who is the senior Democrat on \n     the committee. That bill expired 7 years ago. Congress has \n     failed to fix it since then. I believe we're going to be \n     successful this year. The House has passed its version. We \n     will either pass our version today or early next week, and \n     then we'll put it together with the House and send it to the \n     president in a form that hopefully he can sign. This year \n     we're going to fix it. Then we're going to turn our attention \n     to a bipartisan Higher Education Act.\n       I'm going to work on it with Senator Murray the same way we \n     worked on No Child Left Behind, which is that she and I will \n     first write a proposal and submit it to our very diverse \n     committee, which has 22 senators--Bernie Sanders and \n     Elizabeth Warren on one end, Rand Paul and Tim Scott on the \n     other end--so it's an interesting discussion we have every \n     time we get together. Every single one voted to report our No \n     Child Left Behind bill out of committee, which is a huge \n     success.\n       But we've already got a bipartisan head start on the Higher \n     Education Act in two or three ways. Senator Michael Bennett \n     and I, and several senators of both parties have introduced \n     what we call the FAST Act to make a number of changes to make \n     it easier and simpler to apply for student aid. One of those \n     ``common sense'' ideas in addition to simplifying the number \n     of questions is to allow students to fill the form out in \n     their junior year of high school. This form requires you to \n     tell what your tax returns are before you file your tax \n     returns, so it throws 20 million families into confusion. If \n     you let people fill that out in their junior year of high \n     school, then they can use tax forms from a prior year, and \n     then they can have a full year to look at colleges and \n     universities, knowing in advance how much in grants or loans \n     they're eligible for.\n       So that FAST Act has been introduced and examined \n     carefully. It has bipartisan support. We're planning to \n     introduce legislation with as many of the recommendations of \n     the Zeppos-Kirwan report on higher education on how to \n     simplify regulations. That would be a bipartisan start.\n       Senator Burr, Senator Angus King, and a group of bipartisan \n     senators have introduced legislation on simplifying the \n     repayment form of student loans. There are 9 different ways \n     of repaying your student loans. Actually, it's a very \n     generous system. You can pay it off over ten years or by \n     paying no more than 10 percent of your disposable income, and \n     if that doesn't pay it off over twenty years, it's forgiven. \n     But the process is so complicated that most students don't \n     take advantage of it.\n       So there are three steps already that we've taken. And we \n     have taken maybe the most important step of all, as we've \n     worked together this year in the great bipartisan way on our \n     committee to work on elementary and secondary education. \n     There's no reason we can't continue with higher education.\n       I hope that Senator Murray and I can present our bill to \n     the full committee in September. As we've done with No Child \n     Left Behind, it will be a suggestion of how the\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n     committee can work. And shortly thereafter, I hope that we \n     will report it to the floor. Senator McConnell is very \n     pleased with the debate on the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act--the fact that we're working on something so \n     important in a bipartisan way and want to get a result that's \n     good for the country. He told me last night that he's very \n     interested in our Higher Education Act and that he'll work to \n     find floor time for it. So I'm very optimistic about that and \n     look forward to it.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING PRATT & WHITNEY 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Pratt & Whitney as it celebrates the 90th anniversary of \nits incorporation.\n  In 1925 Frederick Rentschler arrived at the old Pope-Hartford auto \nplant on Capitol Avenue in Hartford, CT with a simple, yet \ngroundbreaking idea: build a new and better aircraft engine. In the \nbeginning, such a lofty goal seemed out of reach. Rentschler had just \n24 employees, barely any equipment and a modest amount of money. But \nRentschler was able to create a name for Pratt & Whitney by placing a \ngreat value on integrity, customer service, and product quality.\n  From its humble beginnings in that old auto plant in Hartford, Pratt \n& Whitney has grown to be a world leader in the design and manufacture \nof military and commercial aircraft engines. For over 90 years, Pratt & \nWhitney has stayed true to this pioneering spirit and passion for \nexcellence, continually working to revolutionize the aviation industry \nand build a better engine for tomorrow.\n  Throughout its storied history, Pratt & Whitney has always answered \nits country's call. During World War II, the company reduced its prices \nfor the U.S. Navy to contribute to the war effort. Today Pratt is still \noperating a culture of cost reduction and producing the power for some \nof the most formidable aircraft in American history with versatile \nproducts like the F-135 engine. And now Pratt is answering President \nObama's call to combat the threat of climate change and keep future \ngenerations safe. With its breakthrough technologies like the Geared \nTurbofan engine, Pratt is raising the industry standard for emissions \nefficiency.\n  Pratt & Whitney has continued to stay true to its roots as a \nConnecticut company. For generations now, Pratt & Whitney has provided \nsecure career opportunities to workers in my State. Pratt & Whitney's \nlegacy of dependability and leadership in innovation have helped to \nmake Connecticut's defense manufacturing industry second to none. I am \nproud and thankful for Pratt's investments in the State of Connecticut \nand its contributions to our country's national security, and I remain \ncommitted to supporting the jobs created by Pratt & Whitney. As I \ncontinue to serve in the Senate, I will continue to work to protect our \nnational defense programs.\n  While other aircraft companies have come and gone, Pratt & Whitney \nhas proven that it can stand the test of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5454-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT JOSEPH FONTENOT\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor SSG Joseph \nFontenot of Larose, LA, who is winner of the 2015 Army Times Soldier of \nthe Year. Fontenot is currently stationed in Fort Campbell, KY, as a \nfield artilleryman assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery \nRegiment, part of the 101st Airborne Division 3rd Brigade Combat Team.\n  Joseph Fontenot's experience with the military began while he was on \ntour with his rock band, Jacknife. At 31, following a conversation with \na National Guard soldier, Fontenot decided to put away his bass guitar \nand to begin serving his country as a soldier in the Army. After \njoining the Army in January 2006, Fontenot made the decision to develop \nhis leadership abilities. Through help from his mentor, he challenged \nhimself to push his limits both mentally and physically.\n  In 2008, Fontenot deployed to Baghdad, Iraq for a year-long tour. In \n2010, he was redeployed to the Arghandab River Valley, and bravely \nserved in one of the most dangerous stations in southern Afghanistan. \nThe experiences there along with the loss of fallen compatriots and \nfriends strengthened Fontenot's commitment to the Army and bolstered \nhis resolve to continue onward. Since 2012, he has served as drill \nsergeant where his outstanding commitment led him to be chosen to serve \nat the U.S. Army Drill Sergeant Academy.\n  Fontenot's accomplishments, however, extend far beyond his military \naptitude. Not only is he a frequent volunteer at the local veterans' \nhospital and homeless children's center, he also participates in Camp \nKemo, a program for children battling cancer.\n  Fontenot's continued dedication and leadership were noticed by his \npeers, who nominated him for the 15th Annual Army Times Soldier of the \nYear Award for his exemplary leadership. In February 2015, Fontenot \nrescued a young man in need whose car had crashed into a canal. Despite \nthe freezing temperatures, Fontenot jumped into the water and pulled \nthe man from his car.\n  SSG Joseph Fontenot is a man of true courage. I am honored and \nhumbled to share his heroism, and I thank him for his services to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/22/senate-section/article/S5454-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Hatch) reported that on today, July \n22, 2015, he had signed the following enrolled bills, which were \npreviously signed by the Speaker of the House:\n\n       S. 971.

A bill to strengthen the ability of the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to detect and prevent intrusions against, and to use \ncountermeasures to protect, government agency information systems and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nInformation Security Management Act of 2015. I am very pleased that \nSenator Warner, Senator Mikulski, Senator Coats, Senator Ayotte, and \nSenator McCaskill are joining me in this bipartisan effort to \nstrengthen cyber security in Federal agencies. I very much appreciate \ntheir input into this bill and their support.\n  The cyber attack that stole sensitive personal data from millions of \ncurrent, former, and retired Federal employees from the poorly secured \ndatabases at the Office of Personnel Management\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\nunderscores the extraordinary vulnerability of our Federal computer \nnetworks, but for the more than 21 million Americans affected and \nindeed for our country, the threat from this theft continues. Whether \nit is the risk to the individual of identity theft or the impact on our \nNation of the compromise of the identity of those dealing with \nclassified information or the potential for espionage or blackmail, the \nthreat remains extremely serious.\n  Worst of all, better security of computer networks at OPM might well \nhave prevented this terrible breach. The negligence of OPM officials \nwho ignored repeated warnings over years from the inspector general \nthat its networks were vulnerable is inexcusable. As the FBI Director \ntestified before the Intelligence Committee during an open session \nearlier this month, this breach is a huge deal and represents a \ntreasure trove of information for potential adversaries.\n  But this cyber attack also points to a broader problem, and that is \nthe glaring gap in the process for protecting sensitive information in \nFederal civilian agencies. Thus, we join together today to introduce \nthis bipartisan bill.\n  Our bill would strengthen the security of the networks of Federal \ncivilian agencies by taking five important steps:\n  First, our bill would allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to \noperate intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on all Federal \nagencies on the dot-gov domain without waiting for a request from every \nsingle agency.\n  Today, if an agency is uncooperative with DHS or simply does not want \nto make cyber security a priority, there is little that can be done to \nstrengthen that agency's vulnerable network. I have visited the center \nat DHS that monitors some of the civilian networks. You could see the \nattempted intrusions in real time. Yet, I was told by some of the \nofficials there that when they call the chief information official of \nthat agency, sometimes the answer is very lackadaisical, almost \nindifferent. That cannot be allowed to continue.\n  Second, our bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nconduct risk assessments of any network within the dot-gov domain. This \nprovision would ensure that no Federal agency can be unaware if it is \noperating an insufficiently secured network and thus jeopardizing \nsensitive data.\n  Third, our bill would allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to \noperate defensive countermeasures on these networks once a cyber threat \nhas been detected. Currently, DHS can deploy technical assistance to \nagencies to diagnose and mitigate cyber threats only at that agency's \ndiscretion, and sometimes there are legal impediments for doing so.\n  Fourth, our bill would strengthen and streamline the authorities that \nCongress gave to DHS last year to issue binding operational directives \nto Federal agencies, especially to respond to substantial cyber \nsecurity threats or in an emergency where an intrusion is underway.\n  Finally, while DHS oversees the protection of Federal civilian \nnetworks, the Office of Management and Budget has the ultimate \nresponsibility to enforce governmentwide cyber security standards for \ncivilian agencies. Our bill would require OMB to report to Congress \nannually on the extent to which OMB has exercised its existing \nauthority to enforce governmentwide cyber security standards.\n  Congress has already given the OMB the authority, for example, to \nrecommend increases or decreases in an agency's funding or to exercise \nadministrative control over information resources if such actions could \nincrease the degree of compliance with cyber security standards. But I \nregret to say that the evidence that OMB has actually exercised this \nauthority is pretty slim.\n  The primary problem our bill would solve is that DHS has the mandate \nto protect the civilian Federal networks, but it has only limited \nauthority to do so. Now, as the Presiding Officer is well aware, this \napproach stands in stark contrast to how the National Security Agency \ndefends the dot-mil domain.\n  By the way, our legislation does not affect the dot-mil domain--which \ncovers the Department of Defense and our intelligence agencies--in any \nway. The Director of the NSA has the responsibility to protect the dot-\nmil domain, but he also has the authority from the Secretary of Defense \nto monitor all DOD networks and to deploy countermeasures when \nnecessary. If the Director deems that an agency's network is insecure, \nhe can shut it down. Contrast that to the inspector general at OPM, who \nlast fall issued a report saying that OPM ought to shut down parts of \nits network because it was so insecure, and nothing happened. OPM \ndidn't take any action and DHS lacked the authority to do so. That \nstands in sharp contrast to how we protect our defense and intelligence \nagencies' networks. As a result, our military and intelligence networks \nare better protected from foreign adversaries than our civilian \nagencies' networks.\n  Although the Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with a similar \nresponsibility to protect Federal civilian networks, he has far less \nauthority to accomplish that task. Yet--think about it--Federal \ncivilian agencies such as OPM, the IRS, the Social Security \nAdministration, Medicare, and the Patent Office are the repositories of \nvast quantities of sensitive, personal, and economic data belonging to \nthe American people. We have to do a better job of protecting that data \nas well.\n  When the Intelligence Committee on which I served asked the current \nDirector of NSA how we might improve the protection of the dot-gov \ndomain, he emphasized the importance of providing the authority \ncommensurate with the responsibility for protecting civilian agency \nnetworks.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, similarly said that \nobtaining clear, congressional authorization for DHS to deploy \nprotective capabilities to secure civilian agencies' networks is one of \nhis priorities.\n  I heard the same message from his predecessor, Secretary Janet \nNapolitano, when I was the ranking member of the homeland security \ncommittee in 2012.\n  By the way, that year former Senator Joe Lieberman and I urged our \ncolleagues to pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, which we drafted and \nwhich included, among other provisions, major reforms to improve the \nprotection of Federal networks. We will never know if the OPM breach \nthat compromised the security clearance background information of more \nthan 21 million people could have been prevented if the Senate had \npassed our bill at that time. Of course, no bill, no law can protect \nagainst every cyber breach, but I believe we would have been far better \npositioned had we acted then.\n  What we do know is that once a malware signature is identified, it \nwas DHS's intrusion detection system--known as EINSTEIN--and other DHS-\nrecommended tools that played key roles in identifying the massive \ncompromise of the OPM data. Without these tools, OPM might still be \nblissfully unaware that it had been subjected to a major hack.\n  The government's response to the breach demonstrates the urgent need \nfor our legislation. The five agency networks that were monitored by \nEINSTEIN 3 were protected and capable of blocking the malware the \nmoment the dangerous signatures used in the OPM breach were loaded into \ntheir systems. For every other civilian agency, however, that was not \nthe case. DHS had to call the chief information officer responsible for \nevery one of those networks that were not covered yet by the EINSTEIN 3 \nsystem. Then the bad indicators had to be passed on to each CIO, and \neach CIO had to search their agency networks for the harmful malware. \nCyber threats move at the speed of light. No organization that takes \ncyber security seriously would rely upon a game of telephone tag to \nguard the security of its information.\n  I also note that at the time the OPM breach actually occurred, the \nlatest version of EINSTEIN had been deployed on less than 25 percent of \nthe dot-gov network. So even if the government had detected the malware \nimmediately, the government's ability to protect all of the networks \nwould have taken that much longer because DHS's best intrusion system \nwas not deployed widely enough. And, inexplicably, to this day, it is \nstill not installed at OPM despite the information it stores as the \nchief employment office for millions of Federal employees and retirees.\n  If we fail to give these much needed authorities to DHS, the \nunacceptable\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nstatus quo will prevail. Under the status quo, each agency--however \ncompetently or incompetently--monitors its own networks and only asks \nDHS for assistance if it sees fit to do so. Let me describe just how \npoorly that approach has worked so far.\n  We know that information security incidents in the Federal Government \nhave increased more than twelvefold--from 5,500 in fiscal year 2006 to \nmore than 67,000 in fiscal year 2014 according to the Government \nAccountability Office. That undoubtedly understates the real number \nsince these are just the incidents of which we are aware. Nineteen of \ntwenty-four major agencies have declared cyber security as a \nsignificant deficiency or material weakness for financial reporting \npurposes. At the same time, Federal agencies have failed to implement \nhundreds of recommendations from the GAO and inspectors general that \ncould enhance the security of their networks.\n  I could go on and on, citing the breach at IRS, at the Postal \nService, at FAA, at NOAA, not to mention the OPM breach. It is \nunacceptable that we are putting important data belonging to the \nAmerican people as well as our economic edge at risk. We simply have to \ntake action now.\n  It is incredible that OPM implausibly asserted earlier this month \nthat ``there is no information at this time to suggest any misuse or \nfurther dissemination of the information that was stolen from OPM's \nsystems.'' That incredible statement, which implied that the \nperpetrators of this lengthy and extensive attack have no intention of \never using the stolen data, suggests that OPM still has yet to \nrecognize the gravity of this cyber attack.\n  But Congress also has the responsibility to make the job for those \nsecuring our Federal civilian networks easier to do in light of the \nextraordinary threat that foreign adversaries, international criminal \ngangs, and other hackers pose to government systems and the privacy and \nsafety of our citizens. This bill is the first of many steps to \nstrengthen our Nation's cyber security, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan measure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Federal \nInformation Security Management Reform Act, FISMA Reform, of 2015, \nwhich I introduced today with Senator Collins, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Coats, Senator Ayotte, and Senator McCaskill. This legislation \nwill give the Department of Homeland Security the power to make sure \nthat civilian government agencies--like OPM--have adequate cyber \ndefenses against these kinds of attacks.\n  Cyberattacks present one of the most critical national and economic \nthreats that this Nation faces. As the FBI Director recently stated, \nthere are two types of companies in the U.S.--those that have been \nhacked by China, and those that do not yet know they have been hacked.\n  Estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies \nindicate that cyberattacks and cybercrime account for between $24 and \nas much as $120 billion in economic and intellectual property loss per \nyear in the U.S. That is the equivalent of .2 to .8 percent of our GDP. \nThe same CSIS study suggests that $100 billion in losses due to \ncyberattacks is the equivalent of over half a million lost U.S. jobs.\n  As we have seen with the OPM cyberattack, more than 22 million \nFederal employees, retirees and applicants had their personal data \nstolen, including--most troublingly--information on their security \nclearance background investigations. The scope of this breach was \nunprecedented. As the FBI Director told the Intelligence Committee \nrecently, this is a ``huge deal'' and represents a treasure trove of \ninformation for potential adversaries.\n  But this is a serious problem that isn't limited to government, as we \nhave already seen with recent breaches involving Anthem, CareFirst, \nTarget, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot, and banks like J.P. Morgan, just to \nname a few. Both the private and public sector need to be better \nprepared for an increasing number of these cyberattacks.\n  To figure out how to protect consumers' financial data, last year I \nheld the first hearing in Congress into data breaches in the aftermath \nof the Target breach.\n  One takeaway was how much more serious private sector and government \nentities need to be in investing in infrastructure and talent to secure \ntheir systems from cyberattack and breach. While there is always a risk \nof breaches, we can significantly mitigate those risks by increasing \nour ability to detect and respond to attacks.\n  I also believe we must get serious about passing cybersecurity \nlegislation. This is also why I supported the Cyber Information Sharing \nAct (CISA) that passed in the Senate Intelligence Committee 14-1 in \nMarch.\n  A couple years ago, Senators Lieberman and Collins had a \ncomprehensive cybersecurity bill which was unable to pass in the \nSenate. Unfortunately, when the bill did not pass, so did many of the \ngood-government provisions such as strengthening the ability of the \ngovernment to protect the ``Dot-gov'' infrastructure. While some of the \nlanguage in the Lieberman-Collins bill regarding the DHS's role in \ncybersecurity did make it into law in December 2014, these changes did \nnot go far enough.\n  That is why today I have introduced with Senator Collins, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Coats, Senator Ayotte and Senator McCaskill the \nFederal Information Security Management Reform Act, FISMRA, of 2015. \nThis legislation would give the DHS strengthened authorities to enforce \nstandards, employ cyber threat detection technology and defensive \ncountermeasures, and to conduct threat and vulnerability analyses \nacross all civilian U.S. Government agencies. Our bill would affect \nfederal agencies only, except defense and intelligence agencies, not \nthe private sector.\n  The basic problem with protecting U.S. Government information systems \nis that while DHS has the responsibility to protect the ``Dot-gov'' \ndomain, right now it does not have the ``teeth'' to actually enforce \nsecurity standards or fix vulnerabilities. It is likely that if the DHS \nhad the additional authorities we are proposing this could have helped \nto discover the OPM breach sooner. In fact, OPM only discovered the \nbreach after implementing a cybersecurity tool that was recommended by \nthe DHS.\n  Our bill would give the DHS secretary the authority to direct--not \nrequest--that agencies undertake needed corrective actions to protect \ntheir cyber and information systems. Now, some government agencies \nsystems may already be pretty good--so the DHS may not need to issue \nthem directives. But I also know that we are not where we want to be.\n  While the breach at OPM was and continues to be devastating to those \nfederal employees who are affected, we need to remember that \ncybersecurity is not just an issue at OPM. A recent article in the New \nYork Times quoted the President's cyber advisor, Michael Daniels, as \nsaying ``it's safe to say that federal agencies are not where we want \nthem to be across the board,'' that the bureaucracy needed a ``mind-set \nshift,'' that would put cybersecurity at the top of their list of \npriorities, and that ``we clearly need to be moving faster.''\n  Likewise, a recent audit of the Federal Aviation Administration's \nnetwork in January cited ``significant security control weaknesses . . \n. placing the safe and uninterrupted operation of the nation's air \ntraffic control system at increased and unnecessary risk.'' The FAA's \nformer chief information security officer told the press that he had \nbeen frustrated by the failure to address obvious security holes in its \nmost important networks.\n  Similarly, at the Department of Energy's network that contains \nsensitive information on critical infrastructure and nuclear \npropulsion, investigators found ``numerous holes,'' according to the \nNew York Times.\n  At the IRS network, auditors found 69 vulnerabilities.\n  I believe it is not a matter of if, but of when government systems \nwill again be hit by a major cyberattack. And that is why I believe we \ncannot wait to give one primary entity the authority--especially when \nit already has the responsibility--to ensure that all ``Dot-gov'' \ngovernment agencies meet robust cybersecurity standards, and that they \nare able to deploy tools and technology across the government to detect \nand prevent cyberattacks like the ones we saw at OPM. The Department of \nHomeland Security is such an entity.\n  I know that some of my colleagues have argued that the NSA is the \nbest in\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\ngovernment at countering the cyber threat. I think that the NSA's \ncapabilities are impressive. They do an excellent job protecting our \ndefense and intelligence information systems. However, it would be \nunfeasible to put the NSA in charge of the United States' civilian \ncybersecurity.\n  DHS cyber capabilities have been steadily improving. It is deploying \ninnovative tools like EINSTEIN 3A. It has an extremely capable National \nCybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, NCCIC, located in \nVirginia, that already detects threats and promotes information sharing \nwith industries through the so-called ISACs, Information Sharing and \nAnalysis Centers, that cover a range of industries from Aviation, \nDefense Industries, the Financial and Banking sectors, Electricity, IT, \nCommunications and others.\n  As DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson recently stated: ``Legally, each agency \nand department head has the responsibility for their own system--\nlegally, and I stress that to my colleagues. We have the responsibility \nfor the overall protection of the Federal civilian dot-gov world [. . \n.] [W]here we need help in protecting Federal cybersecurity is legal--\nmaking express our legal authority to receive information from other \ndepartments and governments. [. . .] [W]e want the express legal \nauthority to make it plain that when we utilize things like EINSTEIN, \nEINSTEIN 3A, those other agencies are authorized to share information \nwith us, to give us access to our network.''\n  In short, this bill would allow DHS--which already has the \nresponsibility to protect ``Dot-gov'' networks--the authority and the \nability to deploy tools and technology across the government to \nproactively detect and prevent cyberattacks like the ones we saw at \nOPM. The alternative is continuing the status quo, where each agency--\nno matter how poorly--monitors its own networks and only asks for \noutside assistance when it feels like it. That doesn't work. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this bipartisan bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Udall):\n  S. 1838.

Mr. President, although we are still a year and a half \nfrom the next presidential election, our perpetual campaign cycle \nalready seems to be in full swing. Among the many troubling trends we \nare seeing is the rise of ``independent'' super PACs that support \ncandidates. These super PACs are supposed to operate completely \nindependent from the candidates' campaigns, but no one believes this to \nbe true. It is the worst kept secret in America.\n  A July 6, 2015, article in the Washington Post entitled ``It's bold, \nbut legal: How campaigns and their super PAC backers work together'' \ndocuments just how easily these super PACs and campaigns coordinate \ntheir messages and skirt the rules. As the author notes:\n\n       For the first time, nearly every top presidential hopeful \n     has a personalized super PAC that can raise unlimited sums \n     and is run by close associates or former aides. Many also are \n     being boosted by nonprofits, which do not have to disclose \n     their donors.\n       The boldness of the candidates has elevated the importance \n     of wealthy donors to even greater heights than in the last \n     White House contest, when super PACs and nonprofits reported \n     spending more than $1 billion on federal races. Although they \n     are not supposed to coordinate directly with their \n     independent allies, candidates are finding creative ways to \n     work in concert with them.\n\n  Five years ago, in Citizens United v. FEC, five justices on the \nSupreme Court departed from principles of judicial restraint and \ndecided to overturn an act of Congress under the broadest grounds \npossible. In so doing, they overruled a century of practice and decades \nof doctrine. The Court declared that corporations have a First \nAmendment right to spend endlessly to finance and influence our \nelections. This precedent then led to another court decision--\nSpeechNow.org v. FEC--in the D.C. Circuit that resulted in the creation \nof the super PAC. Super PACs are supposed to be independent \nexpenditure-only committees, and may raise unlimited sums of money from \ncorporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend \nunlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates. But \nnobody believes that they truly act independently.\n  That is why I am introducing the Stop Super PAC-Candidate \nCoordination Act today. This bill would end the sham practice of \npresidential candidates boldly and shamelessly exploiting our campaign \nfinance laws by coordinating with allegedly independent super PACs.\n  First, the bill codifies a definition of what constitutes \n``coordination'' based on Supreme Court case law to make it more \ndifficult for coordination to occur. Second, it prohibits outside \ngroups from skirting the coordination provisions by stating that they \ncannot simply create a ``firewall'' and claim that the there is an \nindependent division that is making independent expenditures. Third, it \nprevents single-candidate super PACs from acting as an arm of the \ncandidates' campaign. It does this by including factors of when a super \nPAC should be deemed a ``coordinated spender.'' Once the super PAC \nfalls into this category, the super PACs expenditures are then \nconsidered to be ``coordinated expenditures'' and the super PAC is \nsubject to Federal contribution limits and prohibitions. Under existing \nlaw, coordinated expenditures are defined as also being in-kind \ncontributions and are subject to the PAC contribution limit of $5,000 \nper year.\n  The penalty for any person who knowingly violates the coordination \nprovisions of this act is a civil fine that is three times the amount \nof the coordinated expenditures involved in excess of the applicable \ncontribution limit. The act also imposes joint and several liability on \nany director, manager, or officer of an outside spending group for any \nunpaid penalties by the group violating the coordination rules.\n  Lastly, the bill prohibits candidates and their agents from raising \nmoney for super PACs by prohibiting the raising of funds for any super \nPAC or political committee that is not subject to Federal contribution \nlimits and reporting requirements. This bill would provide real rules \nand put into place some regulations that would make it more difficult \nfor these super PACs to coordinate with candidates.\n  The issue of how our politics are paid for is an issue that is \nimportant to the American people, and it is also important to \nVermonters. We have always remained steadfast in our belief that our \ndemocracy should not be for sale, and that the size of your bank \naccount should not determine whether or not the government responds to \nyour views or needs.\n  This bill I introduce today is an incremental measure that would help \neliminate the sham of single-candidate super PACs and provide some real \nrules to a process in which the American public is becoming more \ncynical about every day. I hope that my fellow Senators from both sides \nof the aisle will support this modest measure.\n  I understand why Vermonters are outraged by the devastating effects \nof Citizens United and its progeny. In recent years I have held several \nhearings to highlight the damage that Citizens United has done to our \npolitical process. Last summer, I led the charge in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to consider a constitutional amendment to restore \nthe ability of lawmakers at both the Federal and State levels to rein \nin the influence that billionaires and corporations now have on our \nelections. The amendment would also have made clear that corporations \nare not people. Although Senate Democrats were able to vote the \nconstitutional amendment out of the Judiciary Committee, Senate \nRepublicans filibustered the amendment on the floor and refused to \nallow it an up-or-down vote. I will continue to do all I can to reverse \nthe devastating effects of Citizens United and its subsequent \ndecisions. This bill is one step towards addressing one of the problems \nthat has resulted from those decisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle referenced above be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 6, 2015]\n\n It's Bold, But Legal: How Campaigns and Their Super PAC Backers Work \n                                Together\n\n                            (By Matea Gold)\n\n       The 2016 presidential contenders are stretching the \n     latitude they have to work with their independent allies more \n     than candidates in recent elections ever dared, taking \n     advantage of a narrowly drawn rule that separates campaigns \n     from outside groups.\n       For the first time, nearly every top presidential hopeful \n     has a personalized super PAC that can raise unlimited sums \n     and is run by close associates or former aides. Many also are \n     being boosted by non-profits, which do not have to disclose \n     their donors.\n       The boldness of the candidates has elevated the importance \n     of wealthy donors to even greater heights than in the last \n     White House contest, when super PACs and nonprofits reported \n     spending more than $1 billion on federal races. Although they \n     are not supposed to coordinate directly with their \n     independent allies, candidates are finding creative ways to \n     work in concert with them.\n       Before former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) announced his \n     bid in mid-June, the Right to Rise super PAC filmed footage \n     of him that the group plans to use in ads. Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton's campaign is collaborating directly with Correct the \n     Record, a super PAC providing the Democratic hopeful's team \n     with opposition research.\n       Top advisers to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) have been \n     positioned at two big-money groups as they await his \n     presidential announcement next week. GOP candidate Carly \n     Fiorina has gone even further, outsourcing core functions \n     such as rapid response and event preparation to her allied \n     super PAC, the aptly named--CARLY for America.\n       The 2016 contenders and their big-money backers VIEW \n     GRAPHIC. The widespread cooperation--which many campaign \n     finance-experts say stretches the legal boundaries--indicates \n     that candidates and their advisers have little fear that they \n     will face serious scrutiny from law enforcement, despite the \n     Justice Department's successful prosecution this year of a \n     Virginia campaign operative for illegal coordination.\n       One main reason: Under Federal Election Commission rules, \n     there is no wall dividing candidates and independent groups. \n     In practice, it's more like a one-way mirror--with a \n     telephone on each side for occasional calls.\n       ``The rules of affiliation are just about as porous as they \n     can be, and it amounts to a joke that there's no coordination \n     between these individual super PACs and the candidates,'' \n     said Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.), who has sponsored \n     legislation that would put stricter limits in place.\n       A close reading of FEC regulations reveals that campaigns \n     can do more than just publicly signal their needs to \n     independent groups, a practice that flourished in the 2014 \n     midterms.\n       Operatives on both sides can talk to one another directly, \n     as long as they do not discuss candidate strategy. According \n     to an FEC rule, an independent group also can confer with a \n     campaign until this fall about ``issue ads'' featuring a \n     candidate. Some election-law lawyers think that a super PAC \n     could share its entire paid media plan, as long as the \n     candidate's team does not respond.\n       But those who defend the current system say that broader \n     rules could infringe on rights to free speech.\n       Right to Rise, a super PAC run by Mike Murphy, filmed \n     footage with then-undeclared candidate Jeb Bush to be used in \n     later commercials. (NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) ``Every \n     discussion you have cannot trigger illegal coordination,'' \n     said Lee E. Goodman, a Republican appointee to the FEC.\n       ``I understand some people look at relationships between \n     candidates and independent spenders and sense that those \n     relationships are too cozy,'' he added. ``Yet the courts have \n     said that you cannot prohibit friendships and knowledge of \n     each other.''\n       But many experts say that the limited-coordination rules \n     are emblematic of an outdated, incoherent and often \n     contradictory campaign finance framework.\n       ``We're at this transitional point where the way money is \n     raised and spent and the costs of campaigns have changed so \n     dramatically,'' said Bob Bauer, a prominent campaign finance \n     lawyer who served as White House counsel for President Obama. \n     ``The problem isn't that the law isn't being enforced--the \n     problem is that we need to rethink the whole thing from the \n     ground up.''\n       Political strategists on both sides of the aisle agree, \n     saying that navigating the complex legal thickets is \n     increasingly difficult.\n       ``If you talk to three lawyers, you are likely to get three \n     different answers,'' said Phil Cox, executive director of \n     America Leads, a super PAC supporting Chris Christie, the \n     Republican governor of New Jersey. ``The system makes no \n     sense. It's crying out for reform. We need to put the power \n     back in the hands of the candidates and their campaigns, not \n     the outside groups.''\n       At the moment, though, an overhaul of campaign finance has \n     little bipartisan support in Congress. And members of the \n     long-polarized FEC appear more divided than ever. A \n     discussion at a recent public meeting about stricter \n     regulations devolved into hostile barbs.\n       The public is left with the sense that no one is following \n     the rules, said Ellen L. Weintraub, one of the Democrats on \n     the FEC.\n       ``There is this basic notion that super PACs are supposed \n     to be separate from the candidates,'' she said. ``They look \n     at what's going on, and they say: `This doesn't look \n     separate. Where are the lines?' ''\n       A sweeping boundary was drawn by the Supreme Court in its \n     seminal 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision, which said that \n     political activity by outside groups must be done ``totally \n     independently'' of candidates and parties. A similar standard \n     was set in the 2002--McCain-Feingold Act, which said that \n     independent expenditures cannot be made ``in cooperation, \n     consultation, or concert'' with a candidate.\n       But in practice, defining coordination has not been easy. \n     The FEC wrestled mightily with where to draw the lines, \n     issuing regulations that were challenged repeatedly in the \n     courts.\n       A set of FEC rules approved in 2010 prohibits a campaign \n     from coordinating with an independent group on a paid \n     communication. The agency laid out specific tests to \n     determine whether a campaign has illegally shared internal \n     strategy used to guide an independent group's advertising.\n       But the rules do not ban coordination in general--much less \n     conversations between each side.\n       Bobby Burchfield, a Republican campaign finance lawyer, \n     said that the clarity of current regulation helps avoid the \n     kind of intrusive investigations into groups, such as the \n     Christian Coalition, that the FEC once pursued. ``That had \n     the effect of suppressing and chilling political activity,'' \n     he said.\n       Now, there's plenty of room to maneuver. Although a \n     campaign cannot share private strategy with a super PAC, it \n     can give a campaign information about its plans, as long the \n     group is not sharing something of value that could be \n     considered a contribution.\n       The FEC also has given candidates its blessing to appear at \n     super PAC fundraisers, as long as they do not solicit more \n     than $5,000--a decision that came in response to a query from \n     two Democratic super PACs in 2011.\n       Taken together, critics say, the narrow rules offer far too \n     many opportunities for candidates and their well-funded \n     outside allies to work in agreement.\n       The FEC ``couldn't imagine how bold people would be,'' said \n     Larry Noble, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, \n     which supports tougher restrictions.\n       Right to Rise, the super PAC run by longtime Bush adviser \n     Mike Murphy, is set to serve as a massive external ad \n     operation bolstering the former governor's campaign. Murphy \n     told donors in a recent conference call that before Bush \n     announced his candidacy, the super PAC filmed footage of him \n     that the group plans to use in digital and TV spots, \n     according to an account in BuzzFeed.\n       ``One of the new ideas that, you know, the governor had--\n     he's such an innovator--is we're going to be the first super \n     PAC to really be able to do just positive advertising,'' \n     Murphy said.\n       Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for Right to Rise, said that \n     Murphy was referring to ``Governor Bush's historical \n     preference for positive advertising, which was consistent in \n     his previous elections and is no secret.''\n       Clinton's campaign is working closely with Correct the \n     Record, a liberal rapid-response group that refashioned \n     itself as a super PAC this year. The group says it can \n     coordinate directly with the campaign under a 2006 FEC rule \n     that made content posted free online off-limits to \n     regulation.\n       Correct the Record has more than 20 staffers and plans to \n     disseminate much of its research on its Web site and through \n     social media.\n       Any nonpublic information of value that it shares with the \n     Clinton staff will be purchased, according to a campaign \n     official.\n       Already, partisan critics have pounced, filing complaints \n     with the FEC alleging that the pro-Bush and pro-Clinton super \n     PACs are engaged in illegal coordination.\n       But if the agency launches an investigation, it would be a \n     first. Since 2010, the FEC has yet to open an investigation \n     into alleged illegal super PAC coordination, closing 29 such \n     complaints. In 28 of those cases, the agency's general \n     counsel did not recommend pursuing the matters, according to \n     Goodman of the FEC.\n       ``We could capture all of this stuff if we had real \n     rules,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of \n     reducing the influence of big money on politics. ``For all \n     practical purposes, there are no prohibitions against \n     coordination.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Lee):\n  S. 1840.

Mr. President, I applaud the Senate is passing bipartisan \nlegislation that will protect employees who blow the whistle on \ncriminal antitrust violations. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation \nAct is legislation that I have worked on with Senator Grassley for \nthree Congresses now. This is the second Congress in a row that the \nSenate has passed it unanimously. The bill is an extension of my \nlongstanding partnership with Senator Grassley on whistleblower issues.\n  Our bipartisan bill provides meaningful protections to employees who \nblow the whistle on the worst forms of anticompetitive behavior such as \nprice fixing. Whistleblowers play an important role in alerting the \npublic, Congress, and law enforcement agencies to wrongdoing in a \nnumber of areas. They often take significant risks in making these \ndisclosures and can be the target of retaliation. The Criminal \nAntitrust Anti-Retaliation Act prohibits employers from retaliating \nagainst employees who alert the company, Congress, or law enforcement \nof criminal activity.\n  Senator Grassley and I modeled this legislation on the whistleblower \nprotections we authored as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The \nprotections are narrowly tailored and do not provide whistleblowers \nwith an economic incentive to bring forth false claims. Last Congress, \nwe made modest changes to the bill in the Judiciary Committee to \nimprove the definition of a covered individual and to clarify that \nprotections only apply to employees reporting criminal violations. This \nCongress, we made additional refinements in the Judiciary Committee to \nfurther clarify the scope of the bill. The protections in this bill \nbuild on recommendations from key stakeholders in a 2011 Government \nAccountability Office report to Congress.\n  Consumers benefit from competitive markets and the antitrust laws \nserve to safeguard competition. By protecting those who would blow the \nwhistle on criminal antitrust behavior, our bill will help facilitate \nthe reporting of these kinds of violations. I urge the House to pass \nthis bipartisan legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of the bill from the \nNational Whistleblowers Center be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\n                                National Whistleblower Center,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2015.\n     Re Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2015.\n\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators, I am writing to you in support of the \n     Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2015. This \n     legislation will extend whistleblower protection for \n     employees who provide information to the Department of \n     Justice related to criminal antitrust violations. This Bill \n     will create, for the first time, whistleblower protections \n     for employees who report antitrust violations.\n       The protections in this bill were recommend by the \n     Government Accountability Office in a 2011 report and will \n     plug a loophole in the patchwork of whistleblower protection \n     that currently exists. Current laws in place do not provide \n     any protections for innocent third parties who blow the \n     whistle on criminal antitrust activity. The proposed Bill \n     will allow employees to file an action with the Department of \n     Labor in the event that they are retaliated against for \n     reporting criminal violations of the antitrust laws.\n       Numerous studies have shown that employees are the first \n     defense to prevent fraud and white-collar crime. Such crimes \n     harm businesses, consumers, and our economy. Investigators \n     rely heavily on information from insiders to protect the \n     public interest and prevent illegal competitive practices. \n     The brave individuals that report antitrust violations should \n     be protected.\n       This is a narrow but important bill that will help to \n     improve enforcement of the antitrust laws.\n                                                  Stephen M.
