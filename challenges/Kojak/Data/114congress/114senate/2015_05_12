Mr. President, the Senate will have the opportunity \nthis afternoon to open the legislative process for a broad 21st century \nAmerican trade agenda.\n  Let me remind Senators that the vote we are taking today is not a \nvote to approve or disapprove of trade promotion authority. In fact, \nthe bill we will be voting to proceed to is simply a placeholder that \nwill allow us to open a broad debate on trade that our country very \nmuch needs. Voting yes to open debate on a 21st century American trade \nagenda offers every Member of this body the chance to stand up for \nAmerican workers, American farmers, American entrepreneurs, and \nAmerican manufacturers. It is a chance to stand with Americans for \neconomic growth, opportunity, and good jobs.\n  Selling products stamped ``Made in America'' to the many customers \nwho live beyond our borders is key. That is true across our entire \ncountry. It is true in my home State of Kentucky. We know that Kentucky \nalready boasts more than half a million jobs related to trade. We know \nthat nearly a quarter of Kentucky's manufacturing workers depend on \nexports for their jobs. And we know that manufacturing jobs tied to \nexports pay about 18 percent more than non-export related jobs.\n  So there is every reason to knock down more unfair international \ntrade barriers and bring more benefits back to Americans, right here at \nhome. According to one estimate, Kentucky alone could see thousands \nmore jobs and millions more in economic investment if we enact smart \nagreements with countries in Europe and the Pacific.\n  We also know how important these types of agreements are to our \nnational security--especially in the Pacific region. Just last week, \nseven former Defense Secretaries from both political parties wrote to \nexpress their ``strongest possible support'' for the bill before us \ntoday. ``The stakes are clear,'' they wrote. ``There are tremendous \nstrategic benefits. . . . [and] America's prestige, influence, and \nleadership are on the line.''\n  If we care about preserving and extending American leadership in the \n21st century, then we cannot cede the most dynamic region in the world \nto China. It is true from a national security perspective, and it is \ntrue from an economic perspective.\n  But first, we need fair and enforceable trade legislation that \nexpands congressional oversight over the administration and sets clear \nrules and procedures for our trade negotiators. We have all those \nthings in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act, a bill that passed out of the Finance Committee 20 \nto 6 with strong support from both parties.\n  We should start the process of building on that bipartisan momentum \nright now. I know the opportunity to consider complex legislation via \nregular order became too uncommon in recent years, but that is changing \nnow. The Senate may still be a little rusty, though, so I want to be \nclear about what today's vote is. This is a vote to begin a process. \nThis is a vote to begin a debate on a broad trade agenda. Yes, TPA will \nbe part of that debate. But trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, will \nbe also.\n  Now, there are many Members on my side of the aisle who have real \nreservations about TAA. I do as well. But I expect that at the end of \nthis process, after the Senate works its will, TAA--trade adjustment \nassistance--will be part of the package the Senate sends to the House.\n  The top Democrat on the Finance Committee made it clear at the markup \nof these trade bills that TAA needed to run alongside TPA. I know that \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, has also been working \ntoward that end.\n  Now, the Finance Committee didn't just mark up TPA and TAA. It also \nmarked up the African Growth and Opportunity Act and passed the \ngeneralized system of preferences bill by voice vote. It reported a \ncustoms and enforcement bill by voice vote, too.\n  So while TPA is clearly the centerpiece of the trade agenda before \nus,\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nthere is also bipartisan support for other bills reported by the \nFinance Committee.\n  Now, I know we have heard some concern that these bills might get \nleft behind. I don't think that was anybody's intent. I expect to have \na robust amendment process that will allow trade-related amendments to \nbe offered and considered, including on the subject matters that the \ncommittee dealt with. The underlying substitute will be a compromise \nbetween the two parties, marrying TAA and TPA.\n  But let me repeat so there is no misunderstanding: The measure before \nus will be open for amendment, and I expect that other trade policies \nconsidered by the committee--and possibly even more--will be debated on \nthe floor. I also expect that Chairman Hatch and Senator Wyden will be \nworking hard to get as much done as they can on all of these proposals.\n  I know that Chairman Hatch wants to find a path forward on all of \nthese bills. I know that Senator Wyden and Chairman Ryan spent a lot of \ntime working through TAA, and, despite the objections of many on our \nside, it is likely to be included in any trade bill that passes the \nSenate.\n  I am confident that an enduring agreement can be found if the Senate \nis allowed to work its will and debate openly. That is what we intend \nto have happen on this bill. So I repeat: All we are voting on today is \nwhether to have that debate at all.\n  If there are Senators with concerns about particular details of the \ntrade agenda before us, that is all the more reason to vote to debate \nit. Let's have these conversations in an open and transparent way. \nLet's give the American people a full-throated debate on an important \nissue.\n  But we can't debate any of the provisions Senators want to consider \nif they vote to filibuster even getting on the bill. So I am calling on \ncolleagues to prove they are serious--prove they are serious about \nwanting to pass this legislation--rather than simply looking for new \nand creative ways to defeat it. Voting to proceed is the way we have an \nopportunity to prove we want to pass trade promotion authority.\n  All the good committee work I mentioned demonstrates a real hunger to \nprocess bipartisan trade legislation. So let's vote to build on that \ntoday. Let's vote to open debate on a 21st century American trade \nagenda. Let's not slam the door on even the opportunity of having that \ndebate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2768-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we know that later today the Senate will \nvote on whether to move forward with consideration of trade \nlegislation. What we do not know, other than what the leader just said, \nis what is going to be in the matter before us. It seems to me he said \nthat there will be TPA and TAA in the bill, and that dealing with \nAfrica and these other provisions dealing with customs won't be in the \nbill. That is unfortunate.\n  In April, the Senate Finance Committee reported four bills out of the \ncommittee. Each of these four bills addressed different trade issues. \nSeveral of these bills contain amendments that the Senate spent months \nand years working to pass.\n  As I stand here today, Senate Democrats still don't know for sure the \nprocedure of the Republican leader. And I would say to my friend the \nRepublican leader, and to everyone who hears me say this, that using \nthe logic of the Republican leader, he should move to these four bills. \nIf he wants a robust amendment process, which he talks about all the \ntime, why doesn't he put this legislation before this body and we will \nhave a robust amendment process.\n  The ranking member of the Finance Committee is here. He is an \nexperienced legislator and he knows--he was here before the Republicans \nput skids on doing any legislation for 4 years. He knows what the \nprocess was before then. He knows what the process is today, and he \nknows that the reason a few things are being accomplished this work \nperiod--and I mean a few--is because we have cooperated with \nRepublicans. We still want to do that.\n  But if the Republican leader is concerned about a robust amendment \nprocess, then, put everything the committee reported out. That is why \nwe have been led by the good senior Senator from Oregon the way we have \nbeen.\n  I have been very clear. I am not a fan of fast track. But it is \nimportant to remember that the Senate's ongoing debate about trade is \nnot limited to legislation granting President Obama fast-track trade \nauthority.\n  One of the bills reported out of the committee provides worker \nassistance for American workers who lose their jobs because of trade--\nimportant. Trade adjustment helps American workers to be trained, to \nlook for new jobs, and to reenter the workplace. It is a program that \nhas worked well.\n  The second bill helps developing countries export their products to \nthe United States.\n  The third bill started out as a customs bill and now includes \nbipartisan provisions fighting currency manipulation and includes \nprovisions on the importation of goods made with forced labor. It also \nensures that American manufacturers can enforce trade laws against \nforeign companies that refuse to play by the rules.\n  Simply put, these three other bills include many provisions to make \nsure that trade is fair for American workers and the American economy.\n  My views on trade--I repeat--are well known. I don't support these \ntrade provisions. But if the Senate is going to talk about trade, we \nmust consider its impact on the American workers and the middle class, \nand that is what the customs provision does. That is why I support \ncombining these four bills into one piece of legislation--so no \nAmerican will be left behind by the Senate Republicans.\n  It is essential that if we move to fast-track, we consider these \nother bills as part of the process. In past years, Democrats and \nRepublicans joined together to pass other important trade legislation \nwith fast-track. For example, in 2002, when that passed, Congress \nadopted in that trade adjustment assistance, customs and trade \nenforcement and an extension of our preference programs. If we did it \nin 2002, why can't we do it today?\n  My friend the majority leader talks about the motion to proceed as a \nway to move forward. There is also a way to move forward that would be \nless disruptive, and it would work a lot better; that is, have the \nmajority leader put all these four bills together and then begin--his \nwords--a ``robust amendment process.''\n  The absence of assurance that these four bills are together is a \nsignal that some will be left behind, and the people left behind, of \ncourse, are the American middle class. I urge the majority leader to \ntake the necessary steps to merge these four bills reported out of the \nFinance Committee into one piece of legislation; otherwise, we risk \nhurting every American whom we talk about protecting so much here; \nnamely, the middle class.\n  Again, logically, if you use the statements of the Republican leader, \nwe should put all four of them together. We would move forward on this \nlegislation. We could have a process--again, using his words, a \n``robust amendment process.'' Last time those words came out--``robust \namendment process''--we had two amendments. That was the Iran bill, two \namendments. That is robust? That is not very robust, in my estimation.\n  I wish my friend the ranking member of the Finance Committee the very \nbest in this legislation. It is a huge responsibility for his caucus. \nWe, at this\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nstage, support these four bills being moved forward at the same time \nand then the process can begin of legislating. If we do not--if he does \nnot do that, then it is going to be very difficult to get to the guts \nof the bills that are reported out of committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2769-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In the Senate \nFinance Committee, we passed the Bipartisan Congressional Trade \nPriorities and Accountability Act of 2015 by a 20-to-6 vote and the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2015 by a 17-to-9 vote. We passed a \nrobust trade enforcement measure and package of trade preferences by \nvoice vote.\n  Respectfully, I hope that the majority leader would take this morning \nto work with those on my side of the aisle who are supportive of trade \nto find a similar bipartisan approach to ensure that all four of the \nmeasures I have described are actually enacted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of Senator \nWyden on this, because if you leave out certain bills that help \nworkers, then what you are left with, essentially, is a package that \nignores their needs.\n  I do want to say that I hope we will not proceed to this debate on \nthis free-trade agreement. I stand here as someone who comes from \nCalifornia, where I had voted for half of the trade agreements and I \nvoted against half. I think I am a fair voice for what we should be \ndoing.\n  If there is one unifying principle about the economics of today, it \nis this: the middle class is having a very hard time in America today, \nperhaps the worst time in modern history.\n  A new University of California study released last week makes it \nclear how our middle class is being hollowed out. In my State, we have \na dynamic workforce. We have dynamic entrepreneurs. We are doing very \nwell. But this study found that the lowest paid 20 percent of \nCalifornia workers have seen their real wages decline by 12 percent \nsince 1979.\n  Think about that. This is a great country. We always say we have to \nbe optimistic about tomorrow. You do everything right, you play by the \nrules, and your income for your family, in real terms, goes down by 12 \npercent. There is something wrong with this. I think everyone will say \nthey want to do more for the middle class, and there is a \nstraightforward agenda we could turn to, to do just that. But instead \nwhat do we turn to: a trade agreement that threatens the middle class--\nthat threatens the middle class. What should we be doing here? Not \nconfabbing in a corner over there about how to push a trade bill on \nthis floor that doesn't help working America, we should pass a highway \nbill. The highway bill is critical--good-paying jobs, businesses that \nthrive in all of our communities. More than 60,000 of our bridges are \nstructurally deficient, more than 50 percent of our roads are not in \ngood condition. But, oh, no, even though the highway bill expires--we \nhave no more authority to expend money out of that fund come the end of \nMay--they are bringing forward a trade bill that is a threat to the \nmiddle class.\n  Why don't we increase the minimum wage? The minimum wage needs to be \nraised. Oh, no, they do not want to do that. They have not done it in \nyears. The States are doing it. Oh, no, let's keep people working full \ntime in poverty. So instead of confabbing over there on how to push a \ntrade bill onto this floor, we ought to be raising the minimum wage.\n  What else should we be doing? We should make college more affordable. \nWe have people here on Social Security in this country who are still \npaying off their student loans. That is a shame upon America. They \ncannot even refinance their student loans.\n  Instead of confabbing in the corner about how to bring a trade bill \nto this floor, why don't we fix the student loan problem? Why don't we \nraise the minimum wage? Why don't we pass a highway bill that is funded \nto help middle-class people?\n  It is all a matter of perspective, my friends. We still have not done \nequal pay for equal work, so women are not making what they should. \nThat hurts our women when they retire. They have lost more than \n$400,000 in income.\n  Instead of standing in the corner and figuring out how to bring a \ntrade bill to the floor, they ought to be fixing equal pay for equal \nwork. They ought to be fixing student loans for our students. They \nought to be passing a highway bill. They ought to be increasing the \nminimum wage. They ought to deal with currency fairness because our \ntrading partners play with their currency in order to push forward \ntheir products. But oh, no, that is not on the agenda.\n  We could have an agenda for a vibrant middle class. But instead of \nthat, we are moving toward a trade bill.\n  I know there are some who disagree with me and who come down to this \nfloor and say: We are going to create jobs with this trade bill; it is \ngoing to be great. Let them explain how we are not going to see some of \nthe 12 million jobs that are manufacturing jobs in America not move to \ncountries that pay 56 cents an hour; another country, $1.19 an hour.\n  I know they will disagree with me. They are making all of these \npromises. The more I hear it, the more I hear the echoes of the NAFTA \ndebate. That was a long time ago, and I was here then. In 1988, I voted \nfor fast-track authority to allow the administration to negotiate the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. Then, 5 years later, I saw the \ndeal. It was a bad deal, and I voted no, but it was too late--because \nwhen I saw the deal, I knew I could not fix it because that is what \nfast-track is.\n  What this majority today is saying to us is vote for fast-track and \ngive up your right, Senator Boxer, to amend this trade agreement. They \nsay: Well, it is very transparent. Go down and look at it.\n  Let me tell you what you have to do to read this agreement. Follow \nthis: You can only take a few of your staffers who have to have a \nsecurity clearance--because, God knows why, this is secure, this is \nclassified. It has nothing to do with defense. It has nothing to do \nwith going after ISIS. It has nothing to do with any of that, but it is \nclassified.\n  I go down with my staff whom I can get to go with me, and as soon as \nI get there, the guard says to me: Hand over your electronics.\n  OK. I give over my electronics.\n  Then the guard says: You cannot take notes.\n  I said: I cannot take notes?\n  Well, you can take notes, but you have to give them back to me, and I \nwill put them in a file.\n  I said: Wait a minute. I am going to take notes, then you are going \nto take my notes away from me, then you are going to have them in a \nfile and you can read my notes--not on your life.\n  So instead of standing in a corner trying to figure out a way to \nbring a trade bill to the floor that does not do anything for the \nmiddle class, that is held so secretively that you need to go down \nthere and hand over your electronics and give up your right to take \nnotes and bring them back to your office, they ought to come over here \nand figure out how to help the middle class, how to extend the highway \nbill, how to raise the minimum wage, how to move toward clean energy, \nhow to fix our currency manipulation that we see abroad.\n  Anyway, I take you back to 1988. I voted for fast-track for NAFTA. \nInstead of the millions of new jobs that were promised, by 2010 the \nUnited States had lost 700,000 jobs.\n  Instead of standing in a corner figuring out how we are going to lose \nmore jobs, we ought to do something that works for the middle class.\n  Let me tell you what happened with NAFTA. Instead of improved pay for\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\nour workers, which was promised, NAFTA pushed down American wages. It \nempowered employers to say to their workers: Either accept lower wages \nand benefits or we are moving to Mexico. Instead of strengthening our \neconomy, it increased our trade deficit to Mexico, which now this year \nhit $50 billion. Before NAFTA we had a trade surplus with Mexico. Now \nwe have a trade deficit.\n  So instead of standing in the corner and figuring out how to have \nmore trade deficits with countries, we ought to do something to help \nthe middle class.\n  I want to talk about something that happened in California--in Santa \nAna--right after NAFTA. The city had worked hard to keep a Mitsubishi \nplant that assembled big-screen TVs, securing tax credits to help the \nplant stay competitive. Even after NAFTA passed, company officials \npromised they would keep the plant in Santa Ana. But guess what, folks. \nThree years later, Mitsubishi closed the plant. Company officials said \nthey had to cut costs, especially labor costs, so they were moving \ntheir operations to Mexico.\n  We lost 400 good-paying, middle-class jobs, even though everyone \npromised NAFTA would never do that. This is going to be wonderful. I \ngot suckered into voting yes on fast-track. I fear we see this pattern \nagain.\n  The definition of ``insanity'' is doing the same thing over and over \nand expecting a different outcome. We have 12.3 million manufacturing \njobs in this country. We are looking at a transpacific partnership \ndeal, the largest trade deal in history, covering 40 percent of the \nworld's economy. Tell me, what chance do our people who work in \nmanufacturing have against countries that pay less than $1 an hour? In \none case, I think it is 70 cents an hour.\n  Of the 12 countries in the TPP, 3 have minimum wages that are higher \nthan ours, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, but most of the \ncountries have far lower wages, including Chile, with a minimum wage of \n$2.14; Peru, with a minimum wage of $1.38; and Vietnam, with a minimum \nwage of 70 cents. Brunei and Singapore don't even have a minimum wage.\n  I think I have laid out the argument as to why all of these promises \nabout better wages and more jobs fall flat on their face when we look \nat that last free trade deal--and this one involves more countries.\n  Then there is the investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, which \nwill allow polluters to sue for unlimited money damages. For example, \nthey could use it to try to undo the incredible work in California on \nclimate change by claiming that they were put at a disadvantage by \nhaving to live with California's laws.\n  Polluters could seek to undermine the President's Clean Power Plan or \nthe toxic mercury pollution under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards \nor they could sue because they had to spend a little money to make sure \nthey didn't dump toxins into our waterways--drinking water.\n  We have seen this happen before. SD Myers, Lone Pine Resources, and \nthe Renco Group sued. They notified Peru in 2010 and intended to launch \nan $800 million investor-state claim against the government because \nthey said the fair-trade agreement was violated because it said they \ndid not really have to install all of these antipollution devices. Yet \nPeru forced them to do it, and what happened was that ``polluters pay'' \nturned into ``polluters get paid.''\n  So we have a trade agreement that threatens 12 million manufacturing \njobs. We have a trade agreement that is pushing all of the things we \nneed to do for our middle class off the floor. We have a trade \nagreement that sets up this extrajudicial board that can overcome \nAmerica's laws.\n  As former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has warned, the consequences \ncould be disastrous. He calls the TPP ``a Trojan horse in a global race \nto the bottom, giving big corporations and Wall Street a way to \neliminate any and all laws and regulations that get in the way of their \nprofits.''\n  We should set this aside and not go to this today. Let's work \ntogether as Democrats and Republicans for a true middle-class agenda, \nfor a robust investment in our roads, bridges, and highways, and to fix \nour immigration system.\n  I see Senator Leahy is on the floor. He put together a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill that was amazing, but it was stopped and never \nhappened. We have workers in the dark who are afraid to come out into \nthe sunlight, and that puts a downward pressure on wages. Let's pass \nthat. Let's make college more affordable, ensure equal pay for equal \nwork, and fight for currency fairness. We can do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2770-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2770-S2771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TOXIC REFORM\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take about 3 minutes to talk about \nmy last issue today, and that is the toxic reform bill that passed out \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. President, I have some great news about the toxic bill. The \noriginal Vitter-Udall bill was slain and is gone and in its place is a \nbetter bill. That is the great news. The bad news is it is still not a \nreally good bill. We have to do better, and we can do better.\n  What we did in this bill is to understand that we had to negotiate \ncertain items out of it, and one of the items we had to negotiate was \nhow far the original bill went in preempting State laws, which we have \nnow addressed. Credit goes to 450 organizations that--although they \nstill oppose this bill--pushed hard for those changes. Credit also goes \nto Senators Whitehouse, Merkley, and Booker, who told me they wanted to \ntry to negotiate some changes. I blessed them, and they went and did \nit. For that I have to thank a Senator who is no longer with us, Ted \nKennedy. He taught me that, as a chairman, you need to understand that \nsometimes you have to turn to your colleagues and let them move \nforward. And I was happy to do that.\n  The changes that came back included a part-way fix on preemption, a \nfull fix on preempting air and water laws when it comes to toxics. And \ncoenforcement has been fixed. So we are very, very pleased.\n  What is not really fixed, however, is that we want to make sure \nStates have even more latitude to move if they see a danger. If there \nis a cancer cluster among kids or adults around this country, we want \nto make sure that the Federal Government will move to help them. We \nwant to make sure that asbestos is addressed directly in this bill \nbecause 10,000 people a year die from asbestos exposure. If there is a \nchemical stored near a drinking water supply, we want to make sure that \nit, in fact, will receive priority attention.\n  What chemical is in there? We saw it happen in West Virginia. Senator \nManchin wrote a really good bill with me. We should address that, and I \nwas happy to see that we had some bipartisan votes on those last two \nfixes.\n  We have to fix this bill, and I just don't agree with anyone who \ncomes to the floor and says it is perfect. But what I think is not \nimportant. What is important is what 450 groups think, and they think \nthe bill has to be fixed.\n  Let's be clear. The people who say we have to fix the bill with \nperfecting amendments include the American Public Health Association \nand its Public Health Nursing Section, the Asbestos Disease Awareness \nOrganization, the Consumers Union, the Institute for Agriculture and \nTrade Policy, the National Disease Clusters Alliance, the National \nHispanic Medical Association, the Birth Defect Research for Children, \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, the Maryland Nurses Association, \nthe Massachusetts Nurses Association, the National Association of \nHispanic Nurses, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \nNeonatal Nurses, the Breast Cancer Action, the Breast Cancer Fund, \nHuntington Breast Cancer Coalition, Kids v Cancer, and the Lung Cancer \nAlliance. It goes on and on. A full list of the organizations can be \nfound at saferchemicals.org/coalition.\n  I say to my colleagues that the Vitter-Udall bill is much better now \nthan when it was introduced, and these 450 groups did everything in \ntheir power to help us fix the bill. We are halfway there. I hope we \ncan negotiate some more fixes--and maybe we can do that.\n  If we can pass four or five of these amendments, we are on our way. \nBut if we cannot fix the bill and it does come here, there will be a \nlot of talking about how to fix it. There will be a lot of talking, a \nlot of standing on our feet, and a lot of rallies with 450 groups. That \nis the choice the Senate\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nfaces, and in the end, we will deal with this.\n  I took to the floor today to thank my colleagues who helped negotiate \nthis from a bill that was a disaster to a better bill, and I also want \nto make sure that these 450 organizations, including NRDC--what they \ndid by standing up and calling for Safer Chemicals Healthy Families--\nwas so fantastic. They never allowed people to talk them down or bully \nthem out of the room. I stand with them 100 percent. The Asbestos \nDisease Awareness Organization was incredible.\n  We have some hope here. All we have to do is keep on fixing this \nbill, and it could come to a good place.\n  I so appreciate the patience of my colleagues. I talked long about \ntwo bills which are very important. I hope we will not get on this \ntrade bill. I hope we will move to an agenda for the middle class.\n  As I said, the original toxic chemicals bill, S. 697, that according \nto a prize-winning reporter was written on the computer of the American \nChemistry Council, was deeply flawed. That bill is gone. Thanks to the \npublic health organizations, environmental organizations such as the \nEnvironmental Working Group, Safer Chemicals, the Breast Cancer Fund, \nAsbestos Disease Awareness Organization, NRDC, nurses, physicians, the \nmedia, and individuals such as Deirdre Imus, Linda Reinstein, and \nTrevor Schaefer. Those individuals and organizations put S. 697, the \noriginal bill, front and center and, despite its beautiful name, saw it \nfor what it was.\n  The amended version that was reported out of the EPW Committee last \nmonth included fixes to preemption of State air and water laws, co-\nenforcement of chemical restrictions by States, and removal of a \nharmful provision that would have undermined EPA's ability to restrict \nthe import of dangerous chemicals from foreign countries.\n  However, there are still critical changes that must be made in order \nfor this bill to do what has been advertised and protect public health.\n  Leading public health, labor, and environmental groups, including the \nSafer Chemicals, Healthy Families Coalition, which represents 450 \nenvironmental, labor, and public health groups; the Asbestos Disease \nAwareness Organization; AFL-CIO; Environmental Working Group, the \nBreast Cancer Fund, and the Center for Environmental Health, and others \nhave made clear that they do not support the bill reported from the EPW \nCommittee because key improvements are needed if we are to achieve real \nTSCA reform.\n  Our common goal is real TSCA reform. We should fix the dangerous \nloopholes that could undo the good intentions of so many who have \nworked on this effort.\n  As Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center \nand former senior EPA official pointed out in a recent blog titled, \n``Toxic Ambiguity: the Dangerous Mixed Messages of the Udall-Vitter \nBill to Reform TSCA,'' these are serious loopholes that must be \naddressed.\n  I believe the needed fixes are achievable. Some of these changes, \nwhich I offered in the EPW Committee, received bipartisan support. As \nwe move forward, I ask my colleagues to join me to keep making this \nbill better.\n  We need to address clusters of cancer, birth defects and other \ndiseases, especially when children are affected. Communities should \nhave the tools they need to determine whether there is a connection \nbetween these clusters and contaminants in the surrounding environment. \nSenator Crapo was a cosponsor of this common-sense provision and voted \nfor it in the EPW Committee.\n  We must ensure the chemicals that could contaminate drinking water \nsupplies, such as the spill that occurred in West Virginia last year, \nare prioritized. Senator Capito from West Virginia supported this \namendment in the EPW Committee.\n  We must ensure States can continue to act. The bill reported from the \nEPW Committee could still shut the States out for years from the \nability to protect their citizens from toxic hazards. The process for \nState action is complicated and confusing and likely to end up in the \ncourthouse. If the intention is to allow the States to act if the \nFederal Government has not done so, the bill needs to be amended to \nmake that clear.\n  Asbestos has been a poster child for this bill and it is one of the \nmost dangerous substances known to humankind--it takes 10,000 lives a \nyear. We need to ensure that EPA can expeditiously review and take \naction to ban asbestos within 3 or less years.\n  The legal standard of review in this bill is the same as the original \nTSCA. We must ensure that there are no opportunities for the fatal \nflaws of current TSCA to be retained in the new law.\n  These are the kind of fixes I believe we can accomplish.\n  I think my colleagues and I can agree that there are safeguards that \nstill need to be put in place. Now it is time to ensure that these \nsafeguards become a reality.\n  We need to get it right this time. The stakes are high.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues to make this chemical \nsafety bill do the job that our families and children deserve.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2771-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2771-S2772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TRADE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to harken back about 6 months, if I \ncould, to the election of last November. For me there were at least \nthree takeaways from that election. No. 1, the voters of this country \nwant us to work together and across party lines. No. 2, they want us to \nget things done. Among the things they want us to get done is to find a \nway to strengthen the economic recovery that has been underway now for \nseveral years.\n  Senator Boxer has referred to a couple of things that would be on \nthat to-do list--a robust 6-year transportation bill that rebuilds our \nroads, highways, bridges, transit systems and will put a lot of people \nto work and helps to strengthen our economic recovery by making a more \nefficient and effective transportation network to move products and \ngoods all over this country and outside of this country.\n  We need to strengthen our cyber security. We need to address data \nbreach and all of the attacks that are going on throughout this country \nto businesses, colleges, and universities--you name it.\n  We need tax reform that actually provides some predictability in the \ntax system and makes our Tax Code on the business side more competitive \nwith the rest of the world.\n  We also need to acknowledge, as the President has done, that 95 \npercent of the world's market lies outside of our borders--95 percent. \nThe fastest growing part of that market around the world is Asia. The \nPresident has suggested and strongly supported a trade agreement that \nwould involve 12 nations, including about a half dozen here in this \nhemisphere and the other half over in Asia. All together it encompasses \nabout 40 percent of the world trade market.\n  The President is not suggesting that we just open up our markets so \nthat other countries can sell more of their stuff here. They already do \nthat for the most part. The goal of this trade agreement is to open up \nthese other markets in other countries so we can sell our goods, our \nproducts, and our services there. This is a top priority for this \nadministration and this should be a top priority for Democrats and \nRepublicans. This is a priority that should be hammered out and worked \non in a way that will be fair to workers and middle-class families.\n  The majority leader has come here today to suggest a path forward. I \nhope we will not reject it. What he suggested is we allow, through a \nvote on the cloture, to move to the floor and begin debate on four \ndifferent pieces of legislation that are part of the transportation \nagreement. We have seen this movie before. In fact, we have seen it any \nnumber of times before because I believe we have given trade promotion \nauthority to every President since World War II except Richard Nixon. \nThe reason why is because it is almost impossible for 535 of us in the \nCongress to negotiate a trade deal. Whether it is 3 nations or 11 other \nnations, it is pretty much impossible, and that is why we have trade \npromotion authority.\n  The majority leader suggested that we move to these four goals and \nlet's\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nbegin the debate. We should realize, as Democrats, that we already \nrealized a great victory here. In the past, the Republicans have \nrejected our efforts almost every time to include trade assistance \nadjustment, so that when folks are displaced from their jobs, they can \nactually get help on their health care, job training, and have an \nopportunity to put their lives back together.\n  This legislation today, the trade promotion authority, actually \nexpresses what our views and our priorities are as a Congress through \nthe trade negotiator and to our negotiating partners overseas, and I \nthink that is in our interest. The other thing that we get out of \nmoving TPA with TAA together is that we get the assurance upfront that \nwe are going to look after workers who are displaced. It is the best \ntrade adjustment assistance we have ever had, at least in terms of the \nway it treats workers and displaced workers. It even helps those who \nare maybe not even affected by this agreement but are affected by other \ncalamities in our economy--not just in the manufacturing sector but \nalso in the service sector as well.\n  I suggest this to my colleagues: Let's spend the time between now and \n2:30 p.m. trying to figure out how we can establish some confidence, \nfaith, and trust here, so that if we move to this bill, it will not be \njust to consider trade promotion authority and trade adjustment \nassistance, we will have an opportunity to consider the other two \npieces of legislation as well.\n\n  There is a lot riding on this. The economic recovery of our country \ndoes not rise and fall simply on the passage of this legislation and \nthe conclusion of these negotiations, but it sure would help. It would \nsure help bolster a stronger economic recovery, just as would the \npassage of a 6-year transportation bill, just as would cyber security \nlegislation, data breach legislation, and on and on.\n  I will close with this thought about the debate we have had in recent \nmonths with respect to the negotiations between the five permanent \nmembers of the Security Council, the Germans, and the Iranians in our \nefforts to make sure the Iranians don't develop a nuclear weapon. We \nhave said again and again--we reworked the old Reagan slogan ``trust \nbut verify,'' except with the Iranians, we have not said ``trust but \nverify, we have said ``mistrust but verify.''\n  I would suggest to my colleagues, especially on this side of the \naisle, let's take that approach here. Maybe we don't trust the \nRepublicans that they are going to do what they say they are going to \ndo, but we have an opportunity to verify. The verifying comes with a \nvote later on. We go to the bill; we actually move to the bill, debate \nthe amendments, and so forth.\n  If at the end of the day we are not happy with what has happened, if \nwe feel as though we have been given a raw deal, that workers in this \ncountry have been given a raw deal, middle-class families have been \ngiven a raw deal, we have a chance to verify and we vote not to move \nthe bill off the floor. We would not provide cloture to end debate. \nThat is where we have our final vote. I hope we keep that in mind.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here to speak in support of the USA \nFREEDOM Act, a bill that would restrain the power of government to \ncollect data on phone calls made by average, everyday, ordinary, law-\nabiding American citizens--300 million-plus Americans--without any \nsuspicion that any one of them is engaged in any kind of criminal \nactivity, any kind of activity involving the collection of foreign \nintelligence.\n  I appreciate the support I have received for this bill, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to work with my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Vermont. Senator Leahy and I feel passionate about \nthis issue. Although Senator Leahy and I come from different ends of \nwhat some would perceive as the political spectrum and although we \ndon't agree on every issue, there are many issues on which we do agree. \nThere are many issues, such as this one, on which we can say that these \nissues are neither Republican nor Democratic, they are neither liberal \nnor conservative, they are simply American issues, constitutional \nissues. They are issues that relate to the proper order of government. \nThey are issues that relate to the rule of law itself.\n  The Constitution of the United States protects the American people \nagainst unreasonable searches. It does so against a long historical \nbackdrop of government abuse. Over time, our Founding Fathers came to \nan understanding that the immense power of government needs to be \nconstrained because those in power will tend to accumulate more power \nand, in time, they will tend to abuse that power unless that power is \ncarefully constrained.\n  America's Founding Fathers were informed in many respects by what \nthey learned from our previous national government, our London-based \nnational government. They were informed, in part, by the story of John \nWilkes.\n  John Wilkes--not to be confused with John Wilkes Booth, the assassin \nof Abraham Lincoln--John Wilkes was a member of the English Parliament. \nHe was a member of Parliament who in 1763 found himself at the \nreceiving end of King George III's justice.\n  In 1763, John Wilkes had published a document known as the North \nBriton No. 45. The North Briton was a weekly circular, a type of news \nmagazine in England--one that, unlike most of the other weeklies in \nEngland at the time, was not dedicated to fawning praise of King George \nIII and his ministers. No. This weekly would from time to time \ncriticize the actions of King George III and his ministers.\n  At the time John Wilkes published the North Briton No. 45, he became \nthe enemy of the King because he had criticized certain remarks \ndelivered by the King in his address to Parliament. While not openly \ndirectly critical of the King himself, he criticized the King's \nminister who had prepared the remarks.\n  For King George III, this was simply too much; this simply could not \nstand. So, before long, on Easter Sunday 1763, John Wilkes found \nhimself arrested, and he found himself subject to an invasive search--a \nsearch performed pursuant to a general warrant and one that didn't \nspecify the names of the individuals to be searched, the particular \nplaces to be searched, or the particular items subject to that invasive \nsearch. It said, basically, in essence: Go and find the people \nresponsible for this horrendous publication, the North Briton No. 45, \nand go after them. Search through their papers and get everything you \nwant, everything you need.\n  John Wilkes decided that his rights as an Englishman prevented this \ntype of action--or should have, under the law, prevented this type of \naction--so he chose to fight this action in court. It took time. John \nWilkes spent some time in jail, but he eventually won his freedom. He \nwas subsequently reelected to multiple terms in Parliament. Because he \nfought this battle against the administration of King George III, he \nbecame something of a folk hero across England.\n  In fact, the number 45, with its association with the North Briton \nNo. 45--the publication that had gotten him in trouble in the first \nplace--the number 45 became synonymous not only with John Wilkes but \nalso with the cause of freedom itself. The number 45 was a symbol of \nliberty not only in England but also in America. People would celebrate \nby ordering 45 drinks for their 45 closest friends. People would \nrecognize this symbol by writing the number 45 on the walls of taverns \nand saloons. The number 45 came to represent the triumph of the common \ncitizen against the all-powerful force of an overbearing national \ngovernment.\n  With the example of John Wilkes in mind, the Founding Fathers were \nrightly wary of allowing government access to private activities and \nthe communications of citizens. They feared not only that the \ngovernment could seize their property but that it could gain access to \ndetails about their private lives. It was exactly for this reason that \nwhen James Madison began writing what would become the Fourth\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nAmendment in 1789, he used language to make sure that general warrants \nwould not be the norm and, in fact, would not be acceptable in our new \nRepublic.\n  Ultimately, Congress proposed and the States ratified the Fourth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides in pertinent part \nthat any search warrants would have to be warrants ``particularly \ndescribing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be \nseized.''\n  General warrants are not the norm in America. General warrants are \nnot acceptable in America. They are not compatible with our \nconstitutional system. Yet, today, we see a disturbing trend, one that \nbears some eerie similarities to general warrants in the sense that we \nhave the NSA collecting information--data--on every phone call that is \nmade in America. If a person owns a telephone, if a person uses a \ntelephone, the NSA has records going back 5 years of every number a \nperson has called and every number from which a person has received a \ncall. It knows when the call was placed. It knows how long the call \nlasted.\n  While any one of these data points might themselves not inform the \ngovernment too much about a person, researchers using similar data have \nproven that the government could, if it wanted to, use that same data \nset, that same database to discern an awful lot of private information \nabout a person. The government could discern private information, \nincluding a person's religious affiliation; political affiliation; \nlevel of activity politically, religiously, and otherwise; the \ncondition of a person's health; a person's hobbies and interests. These \nmetadata points, while themselves perhaps not revealing much in the \naggregate, when put into a large database, can reveal a lot about the \nAmerican people.\n  This database is collected for the purpose of allowing the NSA to \ncheck against possible abuses by those who would do us harm, by agents, \nforeign intelligence agents, spies. But the problem here is that the \nNSA isn't collecting data solely on numbers that are involved in \nforeign intelligence activity, nor is it collecting data solely on \nphone numbers contacted by those numbers suspected to be involved in \nsome type of foreign intelligence activity. They are just collecting \nall of the data from all of the phone providers. They are putting it in \none database and then allowing that database to be searched.\n  This issue was recently challenged in court. It was challenged and \nwas recently the subject of a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit based in New York. Just a few days ago, \nthis last Thursday, the Second Circuit concluded that Congress, in \nenacting the PATRIOT Act, in enacting section 215 of the PATRIOT Act--\nthe provision in the PATRIOT Act that claims to justify this bulk data \ncollection program--the Second Circuit concluded that section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act does not authorize bulk collection. It does not \nauthorize the NSA to simply issue orders to telephone service providers \nsaying: Send us all of your data. The language in the PATRIOT Act \npermitted the government to access the records that were ``relevant to \nan authorized investigation.'' That is the language from section 215 \nthat is at issue.\n  The government argued in that case that the term ``relevant'' in the \ncontext of the NSA's work meant and necessarily included every record \nregarding every telephone number used by every American. By \ninterpreting it this way, they tried to basically strip all meaning \nfrom the word ``relevant.'' If Congress had meant every record, \nCongress could have said every record. It did not. That is not to say \nit would have been appropriate for Congress to do so, and had Congress \nlegislated in such broad terms, I suspect there would have been \nsignificant concern raised, if not in court then at least within this \nChamber and within the House of Representatives. But, importantly, \nCongress did not adopt that statutory language. Congress instead \nauthorized NSA to collect records that are ``relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation.''\n  The Second Circuit agreed that this is a problem, holding last week \nthat the bulk collection program exceeded the language of the statute--\nspecifically, the word ``relevant.'' While ``relevant'' is a broad \nstandard, it is intended to be a limiting term whose bounds were read \nout of the statute by a government willing to overreach its bounds.\n  The proper American response to government overreach involves setting \nclear limits--limits that will allow the people to hold the government \naccountable. We must not permit this type of collection to continue.\n  While it is true that a single call record reveals relatively little \ninformation about a person, again, the important thing to remember is \nthat when we aggregate all of this data together, the government can \ntell a lot about a person. I have every confidence that and I am \nwilling to assume for purposes of this discussion that the hard-\nworking, brave men and women who work at the NSA have our best \ninterests at heart. I am willing to assume for purposes of this \ndiscussion that they are not abusing this database as it stands right \nnow.\n  Some would disagree with me in that assumption, but let's proceed \nunder that assumption, that they are law-abiding individuals who are \nnot abusing their access to this database. Who is to say the NSA will \nalways be inhabited only by such people? Who is to say what the state \nof affairs might be 1 year from now or 2 years or 5 years or 10 or 15 \nyears? We know that in time people tend to abuse these types of \ngovernment programs.\n  We know from the Church report back in the 1970s that every \nadministration from FDR through Nixon used our Nation's intelligence-\ngathering activities to engage in espionage. It is not a question of if \nsuch tools will be abused; it is a question of when they will be \nabused. It is our job as Senators to help protect the American people \nagainst excessive risk of this type of abuse. That is why Senator Leahy \nand I have introduced the USA FREEDOM Act. It directly addresses the \nbulk data collection issue while preserving essential intelligence \ncommunity capabilities.\n  Rather than relying on the government's interpretation of the word \n``relevant,'' our bill requires that the NSA include a specific \nselection term--a term meant to identify a specific target--and that \nthe NSA then use the term to limit to the greatest extent reasonably \npracticable the scope of its request.\n  We give the government the tools to make targeted requests in a \nmanner that parallels the current practice at the NSA--in many \nrespects, a practice that is currently limited only by Presidential \npreferences.\n  This bill would enable the court to invite precleared privacy experts \nto help decide how to address novel questions of law, if the court \nwanted input.\n  The bill also would increase our security in several ways, including \nby providing emergency authority when a target of surveillance enters \nthe United States to cause serious bodily harm or death and instituting \nthe changes necessary to come in line with the Bush era nuclear \ntreaties.\n  This bill was negotiated in consultation with the House Judiciary \nCommittee, the House Intelligence Committee, and the intelligence \ncommunity at large. It is supported by the chairman and ranking members \nof the House Judiciary Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, and \nthe Director of National Intelligence. It enjoys broad support from \nindustry and from privacy groups.\n  This is a compromise--an important compromise that will enable us to \nprotect Americans' privacy while giving the government the tools it \nneeds to keep us safe. This is a compromise that is expected to pass \nthe House overwhelmingly, and it is a bill I think we should take up \nand pass as soon as they have voted.\n  So I would ask my friend, my colleague, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Vermont, about his insights. My friend from Vermont has \nserved his country well, having served a significant amount of time in \nthe U.S. Senate. Prior to that time, he served as a prosecutor--a \nprosecutor who had to follow and was subject to the Fourth Amendment.\n  I would ask Senator Leahy, in his experience as a prosecutor and as a \nSenator, what he sees as the major benefits to this legislation and the \nmajor pitfalls to the NSA's current practice of bulk data collection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Utah has laid out \nvery well the reasons for the changes proposed in the House and \nproposed by his and my bill. He also said something we should all think \nabout. A couple of minutes ago, he said: Assuming everybody is \nfollowing the rules today, are they going to follow the rules tomorrow \nor next year or the year after?\n  When he mentioned that, he also mentioned my years as a prosecutor. \nLet me tell a short story. I became one of the officers of the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association and eventually vice president. A number \nof us had occasion to meet the then-Director of the FBI, J. Edgar \nHoover. I thought back to some of the frightening things he said about \ninvestigating people because of their political beliefs. You could tell \nCommunists because they were all ``hippies driving Volkswagens'' was \none of the things he said; secondly, that the New York Times was \ngetting too leftist in some of its editorials and was coming very close \nto being a Communist paper, and he was making plans to investigate it \nas such. Think about that for a moment. The New York Times had \ncriticized him editorially, and he was thinking he should investigate \nit as a Communist paper.\n  Not long thereafter, he died. We found out more and more about the \nsecret files he had on everybody, from Presidents to Members of \nCongress. What if a J. Edgar Hoover had the kinds of tools that are \navailable today? That would be my response to the Senator from Utah, \nand that is why I totally agree with him that we have to think about \nnot just today but what might happen in the future.\n  For years, Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has been used by the \nNSA to justify the bulk collection of innocent Americans' phone \nrecords. Americans were appropriately outraged when they learned about \nthis massive intrusion into their privacy.\n  Look at what happened last week. The highly respected Federal Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals confirmed what we have known for some time: \nThe NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records is unlawful, it \nis not essential, and it must end. That basically says it all. It is \nunlawful, it is not essential, and it should end.\n  Under the government's interpretation of Section 215, the NSA or FBI \ncan obtain any tangible thing so long as it is ``relevant'' to an \nauthorized investigation. Think for a moment back to J. Edgar Hoover--\nand I do not by any means equate the current Director of the FBI or his \npredecessors with what happened back then, but if you have somebody \nwith that mindset.\n  In the name of fighting terrorism, the government convinced a secret \ncourt that it needed to collect billions of phone records of innocent \nAmericans--not because those phone records were relevant to any \nspecific counterterrorism investigation but, rather, because the NSA \nwanted to sift through them in the future. This is an extraordinarily \nbroad reading of the statute--one that I can say, as someone who was \nhere at the time, that Congress never intended--and the Second Circuit \nrightfully held that such an expansive concept of ``relevance'' is \n``unprecedented and unwarranted.'' Such an interpretation of \n``relevance'' has no logical limits.\n  This debate is not just about phone records. If we accept that the \ngovernment can collect all of our phone records because it may want to \nsift through them someday to look for some possible connection to \nterrorists, where will it end?\n  We know that for years the NSA collected metadata about billions of \nemails sent by innocent Americans using the same justification. Should \nwe allow the government to sweep up all of our credit card records, all \nof our banking or medical records, our firearms or ammunition \npurchases? Or how about anything we have ever posted on Facebook or \nanything we have ever searched for on Google or any other search \nengine? Who wants to tell their constituents that they support putting \nall this information into government databases?\n  I say enough is enough. I do not accept that the government will be \ncareful in safeguarding this secret data--so careful that they allowed \na private contractor named Edward Snowden to walk away with all this \nmaterial. What is to stop anybody else from doing exactly the same \nthing?\n  During one of the six Judiciary Committee hearings that I convened on \nthese issues last Congress, I asked the then-Deputy Attorney General \nwhether there was any limit to this interpretation of Section 215. I \ndid not get a satisfactory answer--that is, until the Second Circuit \nruled last week and correctly laid out the implication of this theory. \nThey said that if the government's interpretation of Section 215 is \ncorrect, the government could use Section 215 to collect and store in \nbulk ``any other existing metadata available anywhere in the private \nsector, including metadata associated with financial records, medical \nrecords, and electronic communications (including e-mail and social \nmedia information) relating to all Americans.'' I don't think you are \ngoing to find many Americans anywhere in the political spectrum who \nwant to give this government or any other government that kind of power \nbecause nothing under the government's interpretation would stop it \nfrom collecting and storing in bulk any of this information.\n  The potential significance of this interpretation is staggering. It \nis no wonder that groups as disparate as the ACLU and the National \nRifle Association have joined together to file a lawsuit in the Second \nCircuit to stop this bulk collection program.\n  Congress finally has the opportunity to make real reforms not only to \nSection 215 but to other parts of FISA that can be used to conduct bulk \ncollection. Tomorrow, the House will consider the bipartisan USA \nFREEDOM Act of 2015. Senator Lee and I have introduced an identical \nbill in the Senate. If enacted, our bill will be the most significant \nreform to government surveillance authorities since the USA PATRIOT Act \nwas passed nearly 14 years ago. Our bill will end the NSA's bulk \ncollection program under Section 215. It also guarantees unprecedented \ntransparency about government surveillance programs, allows the FISA \nCourt to appoint an amicus to assist it in significant cases, and \nstrengthens judicial review of the gag orders imposed on recipients of \nnational security letters.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act is actually a very commonsense bill. That is why \nSenator Lee and I were able to join together on it. He is right--we \ncome from different political philosophies, different parts of the \ncountry, and obviously we don't agree on all things, but we agreed on \nthis because it makes common sense and it is something that should \nbring together Republicans and Democrats. It was crafted with \nsignificant input from privacy and civil liberties groups, the \nintelligence community, and the technology industry. It has support \nfrom Members of Congress and groups from across the political spectrum.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \neditorials from the Washington Times, the Washington Post, USA TODAY, \nand the Los Angeles Times in support of the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Times, May 7, 2015]\n\n                        Big Brother Takes a Hit\n\n\n The courts give an assist to repealing intrusions into the privacy of \n                                everyone\n\n       Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has \n     made it clear to his colleagues that he wants the USA Patriot \n     Act, including the controversial parts of the legislation \n     scheduled to expire at the end of June, fully extended. He's \n     seems ready to do whatever he can to get his way.\n       The USA Patriot Act was enacted in the days following Sept. \n     11, when the nation trembled on the verge of panic, with \n     little debate and little opposition in Congress. The Patriot \n     Act has been recognized since on both left and right as \n     unfortunate legislation that granted too much power to the \n     government to snoop into the lives, calls and emails of \n     everyone in the name of national security.\n       Mr. McConnell thought he could force the Senate to either \n     let the law lapse, to panic everyone again, or get an \n     extension without modification until the year 2020. Even as \n     Mr. McConnell praised the National Security Agency's reliance \n     on the act to justify the collection of telephonic \n     ``metadata'' from millions of Americans, the 2nd U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals was writing the decision, released Thursday, \n     declaring the government program, first revealed by Edward \n     Snowden, illegal because the language of the act cannot be \n     read to justify such sweeping government action.\n       The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties \n     Union and joined by groups,\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\n     including the National Rifle Association, and welcomed by \n     civil libertarians across the land. To continue the program, \n     the Obama administration would presumably have to persuade \n     Congress to adopt language specifically authorizing the NSA \n     to collect and hold such data. That attempt might be \n     forthcoming.\n       The court's decision gives a boost to the advocates for the \n     USA Freedom Act, which would modify the Patriot Act. The \n     Freedom Act is expected to pass in the House and Mr. \n     McConnell's strategy to kill it in the Senate may not work \n     now, given the appeals court's decision.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, read the 97-page opinion and said, \n     ``Congress should take up and pass the bipartisan USA Freedom \n     Act, which would ban bulk collection under Section 215 and \n     enact other meaningful surveillance reforms.''\n       The opinion of the liberal senator from Vermont is shared \n     by the conservative Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, an \n     author of the Patriot Act who has since regretted its excess. \n     He joined the ACLU lawsuit as ``a friend of the court,'' and \n     said Thursday that ``it's time for Congress to pass the USA \n     Freedom Act in order to protect both civil liberties and \n     national security with legally authorized surveillance.''\n       When the chips are down, blind partisanship, with genuine \n     cooperation, can still be put aside.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2015]\n\n               New Rules for the National Security Agency\n\n       For months, Congress has debated the National Security \n     Agency's telephone metadata collection program, without \n     legislative result. Now two factors have combined to make \n     that frustrating situation even less sustainable. The \n     legislative authority that first the George W. Bush \n     administration and then the Obama administration cited for \n     the program, Section 215 of the Patriot Act, is expiring on \n     June 1. And, on Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     2nd Circuit ruled that their interpretation of Section 215 \n     was wrong anyway.\n       Congress needs to respond, and the sooner the better. To be \n     sure, the court's ruling has no immediate practical impact, \n     since the three-judge panel considered it superfluous to stop \n     the program less than a month before Section 215 expires. The \n     court's reasoning, though, could, and should, influence the \n     debate. Judge Gerard E. Lynch's opinion noted that the NSA's \n     mass storage of data, basically just in case it should be \n     needed for a subsequent inquiry, stretched the statute's \n     permission of information-gathering ``relevant to an \n     authorized investigation'' beyond ``any accepted \n     understanding of the term.''\n       Intelligence and law enforcement must be able to gather and \n     analyze telephone metadata, but that requirement of national \n     security can, and must, be balanced by robust protections of \n     privacy and civil liberties. Under the current system, those \n     protections consist of the NSA's own internal limitations on \n     access to the database, subject to supervision by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)--which operates in \n     secret and considers arguments only from the government. A \n     democratic society requires more explicit, transparent \n     protections.\n       There is, fortunately, a promising reform proposal readily \n     available: the USA Freedom bill, which enjoys bipartisan \n     support in both chambers as well as broad endorsement from \n     President Obama--and the affected private industries as well. \n     In a nutshell, it would abandon the bulk collection of the \n     NSA's metadata, and warrantless searches of it, in favor of a \n     system under which telecommunications firms retained the \n     information, subject to specific requests from the \n     government. Those queries, in turn, would have to be approved \n     by the FISC. Along with the bill's provisions mandating \n     greater disclosure about the FISC's proceedings, the \n     legislation would go a long way toward enhancing public \n     confidence in the NSA's operations, at only modest cost, if \n     any, to public safety.\n       The measure has passed the House Judiciary Committee by a \n     vote of 25 to 2. In the Senate, it failed to muster 60 votes \n     last year when Democrats were in the majority, and its \n     prospects appear even dimmer now that the Republicans are in \n     control; their leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) favors \n     reauthorizing Section 215 as-is.\n       Mr. McConnell's view--that the statute does, indeed, \n     authorize bulk metadata collection--was legally tenable, \n     barely, before the 2nd Circuit's opinion. Now he should \n     revise it. If the Senate renews Section 215 at all, it should \n     only be a short-term extension to buy time for intensive \n     legislating after June 1--with a view toward enacting reform \n     promptly. If the anti-terrorism effort is to be sustainable, \n     Congress must give the intelligence agencies, and the public, \n     a fresh, clear and, above all, sustainable set of \n     instructions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From USA Today, May 10, 2015]\n\n              Patriot Act Calls for Compromise in Congress\n\n\n     proposal on nsa and phone records would go a long way toward \n                    rebalancing security and liberty\n\n       In the years since the USA Patriot Act was approved in the \n     frantic days following 9/11, it has become steadily more \n     apparent that the law and the way it was applied were an \n     overreaction to those horrific events.\n       The most flagrant abuse is the government's collection of \n     staggering amounts of phone ``metadata'' on virtually every \n     American. That program--which collects the number you call, \n     when you call and how long you talk--was secret until Edward \n     Snowden's leaks confirmed it in 2013.\n       Last Thursday, a federal appeals court--the highest to rule \n     on the issue--found that the program is illegal. You'd think \n     the unambiguous ruling from a unanimous three-judge panel \n     would finally force changes to the bulk collection program.\n       But that's not necessarily going to happen, even though a \n     compromise has emerged in Congress that would go a long way \n     toward rebalancing security and liberty.\n       Under the compromise, the data would remain with the phone \n     companies instead of the government. Requests to access the \n     database would have to be far more limited, and each would \n     require approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court.\n       The new procedure would eliminate some of the phone \n     collection program's most intrusive features, while keeping \n     the security it offers at a time when the terrorist group \n     Islamic State brings new threats. The measure has support \n     from Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, \n     and a long list of civil liberties and privacy groups.\n       It would also satisfy the court, which didn't dispute \n     Congress' right to create such a program, just the executive \n     branch's right to do so without Congress' assent.\n       Yet instead of embracing the compromise, Senate Majority \n     Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican presidential hopeful Sen. \n     Marco Rubio of Florida, and others are working to sabotage \n     it. They want the Senate to ensure that the program will \n     continue just as it is after parts of the Patriot Act expire \n     at the end of this month.\n       While the phone program's benefits are dubious, its costs \n     are clear. Several major tech companies have said that \n     privacy intrusions have hurt U.S. companies. Meanwhile, \n     innocent Americans suffer an assault to their privacy each \n     day the government collects data on their calls. And if this \n     sort of collection goes on, history demonstrates the \n     government is likely to abuse it.\n       As the appeals court ruling warned, if the government's \n     interpretation were correct in stretching the law to collect \n     phone data, it could use the same interpretation to ``collect \n     and store in bulk any other existing metadata available \n     anywhere,'' including financial records, medical records, \n     email and social media.\n       Choosing between privacy and security in these dangerous \n     times is difficult. But, despite what supporters of bulk \n     collection insist, lawmakers don't have to choose.\n       A carefully built compromise allows access to phone \n     records, but with genuine privacy safeguards. The nation \n     would be no less secure. And the civil liberties on which the \n     nation was built would be better protected.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 6, 2015]\n\n               The USA Freedom Act: A Smaller Big Brother\n\n       Last fall, Congress was on the verge of doing away with the \n     most troubling invasion of privacy revealed by Edward \n     Snowden: the National Security Agency's indiscriminate \n     collection of the telephone records of millions of Americans. \n     But then opponents cited the emergence of Islamic State as a \n     reason for preserving the status quo. The Senate failed to \n     muster the 60 votes needed to proceed with the so-called USA \n     Freedom Act.\n       But the legislation has staged a comeback. Last week the \n     House Judiciary Committee approved a bill of the same name \n     that would end bulk collection--leaving phone records in the \n     possession of telecommunications providers. The government \n     could search telephone records only by convincing a court \n     that there was ``reasonable, articulable suspicion'' that a \n     specific search term--such as a telephone number--was \n     associated with international terrorism. And rules would be \n     tightened so that investigators couldn't search records from, \n     say, an entire state, city or ZIP Code.\n       Americans were understandably alarmed in 2013 when Snowden \n     revealed that information about the sources, destination and \n     duration of their phone calls was being vacuumed up by the \n     NSA and stored by the government, which could then ``query'' \n     the database without court approval for numbers connected to \n     suspected terrorists. After initially defending the program, \n     President Obama modified it a bit, but he left it to Congress \n     to make the fundamental change of ending bulk collection.\n       We had hoped that Congress would take a fresh look at \n     whether this program is necessary at all, given a \n     presidential task force's conclusion that it was ``not \n     essential to preventing attacks.'' But if Congress is \n     determined to continue the program, it must establish \n     safeguards. The bill does this, though there is room for \n     improvement. For example, unlike last year's Senate bill, \n     this measure doesn't require the government to destroy \n     information it obtains about individuals who aren't the \n     target of an investigation or suspected agents of a foreign \n     government or terrorist organization.\n       Approval is likely in the House, but prospects in the \n     Senate are more doubtful. Senate Majority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell (R-Ky.) has said that ending bulk collection of \n     phone records would amount to ``tying our hands behind our \n     backs.''\n       That was, and is, a specious objection. Under this \n     legislation, the government can\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n     continue to search telephone records when there is a \n     reasonable suspicion of a connection to terrorism. But it \n     will no longer be able to warehouse those records, and it \n     will have to satisfy a court that it isn't on a fishing \n     expedition. Those are eminently reasonable restrictions--\n     unless you believe that the war against Islamic State and \n     similar groups means that Americans must sacrifice their \n     right to privacy in perpetuity.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, additionally, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter from the major technology industry \ncompanies and trade associations in support of the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 11, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Democratic Leader Pelosi: We, the \n     undersigned technology associations and groups, write to \n     express our strong support for H.R 2048, the USA Freedom Act, \n     as reported by the House Judiciary Committee on April 30th by \n     a vote of 25 to two.\n       Public trust in the technology sector is critical, and that \n     trust has declined measurably among both U.S. citizens and \n     citizens of our foreign allies since the revelations \n     regarding the U.S. surveillance programs began 2 years ago. \n     As a result of increasing concern about the level of access \n     the U.S. government has to user-generated data held by \n     technology companies, many domestic and foreign users have \n     turned to foreign technology providers while, simultaneously, \n     foreign jurisdictions have implemented reactionary policies \n     that threaten the fabric of the borderless internet.\n       The USA Freedom Act as introduced in the House and Senate \n     on April 28th offers an effective balance that both protects \n     privacy and provides the necessary tools for national \n     security, and we congratulate those who participated in the \n     bipartisan, bicameral effort that produced the legislative \n     text. Critically, the bill ends the indiscriminate collection \n     of bulk data, avoids data retention mandates, and creates a \n     strong transparency framework for both government and private \n     companies to report national security requests.\n       Meaningful surveillance reform is vital to rebuilding the \n     essential element of trust not only in the technology sector \n     but also in the U.S. government. With 21 days remaining until \n     the sunset of certain national security authorities, we urge \n     you to swiftly move to consider and pass the USA Freedom Act \n     without harmful amendments.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Some would argue that no reforms are needed. \nUnfortunately, they do not go into the facts, as the Second Circuit \ndid; they invoke fearmongering and dubious claims about the utility of \nthe bulk collection programs to defend the status quo. These are the \nsame arguments we heard last November when we were not even allowed to \ndebate an earlier version of the USA FREEDOM Act because of a \nfilibuster.\n  Last week, some Senators came to the floor to argue that the NSA's \nbulk collection of phone records might have prevented 9/11. Now, this \nspecter is always raised, that it might have prevented 9/11 and is \nvital to national security. We also heard that if we enact the USA \nFREEDOM Act, that will somehow return the intelligence community to a \npre-9/11 posture. None of these claims can withstand the light of day.\n  I will go back to some of the facts--not just hypotheses. Richard \nClarke was working in the Bush administration on September 11, 2001. I \nasked him whether the NSA program would have prevented those attacks. \nHe testified that the government already had the information that could \nhave prevented the attacks, but failed to properly share that \ninformation among Federal agencies. Likewise, Senator Bob Graham, who \ninvestigated the September 11 attacks as part of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, also debunked the notion that this bulk \ncollection program would somehow have prevented the 9/11 attacks.\n  The NSA's bulk collection of phone records simply has not been vital \nto thwarting terrorist attacks. When the NSA was embarrassed by the \ntheft of all of their information and the news about the NSA's phone \nmetadata program first broke, they defended the program by saying it \nhad helped thwart 54 terrorist attacks. Well, I convened public \nhearings on this and under public scrutiny, that figure of 54 initially \nshrunk to: Well, maybe a dozen. We scrutinized that further. They said: \nWell, maybe it was two. Everybody realized that the government had to \ntell the truth in these open hearings. And then they said: Maybe it was \none. That sole example was not a ``terrorist attack'' that was \nthwarted. It was a material support conviction involving $8,000 not a \nterrorist plot.\n  Numerous independent experts also have concluded that the NSA's bulk \ncollection program is not essential to national security. I mention \nthese things, because as soon as you come down and say: We are all \ngoing to face another 9/11, we are all going to face ISIS, we are all \ngoing to face these terrible attacks if we do not have this program--\nyet we can show that it has not stopped any attacks.\n  The President's Review Group, which included former national security \nofficials, stated: The bulk collection of American's phone records was \nnot essential to preventing attacks, and could readily have been \nobtained in a timely manner using conventional Section 215 orders.\n  So we can go with hysteria and overstatements or we can go with \nfacts. In my State of Vermont, we like facts. We should not be swayed \nby fearmongering. Congress cannot simply reauthorize the expiring \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act without enacting real reforms.\n  When the House passes the USA FREEDOM Act tomorrow and sends it to \nthe Senate, we should take it up immediately, pass that bill. The \nAmerican people are counting on us to take action. They did not elect \nus to just kick the can down the road or blindly rubber stamp \nintelligence activities that now have been found by the court to be \nillegal. Congress should pass the USA FREEDOM Act this week.\n  I thank my good friend from Utah for yielding to me. I totally agree \nwith his position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend the \ncolloquy for a period of an additional 15 minutes to allow a couple of \nother Members to participate in the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. I would like to now hear from my friend and colleague, the \njunior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Heller, and hear his thoughts on how \npeople in his State--how people he knows across the country feel about \nthis program and what we ought to do about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I rise to join this bipartisan \ngroup calling for support of the USA FREEDOM Act. I want to begin by \nthanking my friend and colleague from Utah for his hard work and effort \non behalf of the American people on this, my friend from Vermont for \nhis actions also, and other Members of this Chamber.\n  Together, what we are trying to do is bring transparency, \naccountability, and, most importantly, freedom to the American people--\nfreedom from an unnecessary and what has now been declared an illegal \ninvasion of American's privacy. I am talking specifically about section \n215 under the PATRIOT Act. Just last week, a Federal appeals court \nruled that this National Security Agency program that collects \nAmericans' calls--these records are now illegal.\n  Our national security and protection of our freedom as Americans are \nnot mutually exclusive. Allowing the Federal Government to conduct vast \ndomestic surveillance operations under section 215 provides the \ngovernment with too much authority. This court's ruling only reaffirms \nthat the NSA is out of control.\n  Under section 215, the FBI can seek a court order directing a \nbusiness to turn over certain records when they have reasonable grounds \nto believe the information asked for is ``relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation of international terrorism.'' However, the NSA has \nwrongly interpreted this to mean that all--all--telephone records are \nrelevant.\n  So they are collecting and storing large amounts of data in an \nattempt to find a small amount of information that might be relevant. \nIf we reauthorize these laws without significant reforms, we are \nallowing millions of law-abiding U.S. citizens' call records to be held \nby the Federal Government. I see this as nothing but an egregious \nintrusion of Americans' privacy.\n  So what does the NSA know? They know someone from my State in Elko, \nNV, got a call from the NRA and then\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\ncalled their Senator. So what does the NSA know? They know someone from \nLas Vegas called the suicide hotline for 20 minutes and then called a \nhospital right after. So what does the NSA know? They know you called \nyour church or received a phone call from political action committees.\n  So does the previous administration, does this administration or \nperhaps the next administration care about your party affiliation? Do \nthey care about your religious beliefs? Do they care about your health \nconcerns? How about your activities in nonprofit tax-exempt entities? \nMaybe not today, as the Senator from Utah said, but what about 5 years \nfrom now, what about 10 years from now and even 15 years from now?\n  That is why I have been working with my colleagues since the last \nCongress to pass the USA FREEDOM Act, and I am proud to join as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill in this new Congress. Those reforms are \nnot just a pipeline dream that will die in the Senate. This is a \nsubstantive bill that carefully balances the privacy rights of \nAmericans and the needs of the intelligence community as they work to \nkeep us safe.\n  That is why the House Judiciary Committee has passed this bill on a \nbipartisan basis and the full House of Representatives is expected to \npass it later this week. Let me be clear. We are not here to strip the \nintelligence community of the tools needed to fight terrorism. To my \ncolleagues who feel that the USA FREEDOM Act will do this, I would ask \nthem to read this letter from our intelligence community.\n  In my hand, I have a letter signed by the Attorney General and the \nDirector of National Intelligence that was sent to Senator Leahy last \nyear. I would like to read a portion of this. ``The intelligence \ncommunity believes that your bill preserves essential intelligence \ncommunity capabilities; and the Department of Justice and the Office of \nthe Director of National Intelligence support your bill and believe \nthat it is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil \nliberties and increases transparency.''\n  We are not here to harm the operational capabilities of the \nintelligence community who safeguard us every day. What we are here to \ndo is provide the American people the certainty that the Federal \nGovernment is working without violating their constitutional rights. \nThat is why I have also consistently opposed and voted against the \nPATRIOT Act during my time in Congress.\n  I will do everything I can to end the PATRIOT Act, but if I cannot do \nthat, I will work to gut the PATRIOT Act of the most egregious sections \nthat infringe upon American citizens' privacy and their civil \nliberties. That is what the reforms of the USA FREEDOM Act begin to \nachieve. This legislation, among other things, will rein in the dragnet \ncollection of data by the National Security Agency. It will stop the \nbulk collection of American communication records by ending the \nspecific authorization under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.\n  We are reaching a critical deadline as several Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act provisions expire at the end of May. I want to be \nclear that I expect reforms to our surveillance programs, and I will \nnot consent to a straight reauthorization of the illegal activities \nthat occur under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.\n  It is time for our Nation to right this wrong, make significant \nchanges necessary to restore America's faith in the Federal Government, \nand restore the civil liberties that make our Nation worth protecting. \nI want to again thank the Senator from Utah and my colleague from the \nState of Vermont for their hard work and effort on behalf of all \nAmericans in protecting their privacies and their civil liberties. I \nwill turn my time back over to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we would like to hear next from my friend and \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Montana, on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Utah, my \ngood friend, for his leadership on the USA FREEDOM Act. I recently \nreturned from an official trip to the Middle East with leader McConnell \nand several of my fellow first-term Senators. We met with leaders in \nIsrael, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan to discuss the political \nand security issues facing Middle Eastern nations.\n  We also met with a number of American servicemembers who are bravely \nsecuring our country in these crisis-stricken regions and working every \nday to keep our Nation safe from the extreme forces that wish to \ndestroy us. These meetings painted a very clear picture; that terror \nimposed by extreme forces such as ISIS and the threats facing our \nallies in the Middle East are real and they are growing every single \nday.\n  But the growing presence of ISIS in the Middle East is not just \naffecting the long-term security of nations such as Iraq and Syria, it \nis no longer a risk isolated geographically to the Middle East.\n  These extreme Islamic forces are working every day to harm the \nAmerican people within our borders and on our soil. It is critical our \nlaw enforcement officials and our intelligence agencies have the tools \nthey need to find terrorists in the United States and abroad, identify \npotential terror attacks, and eradicate these risks. ISIS is not just \nworking to inflict physical damage upon our country and our people, \nthis extreme group and other like-minded terrorists are intent on \ndestroying our very way of life, our Nation's foundation of freedom and \njustice for all.\n  But as we strengthen our intelligence capabilities, we must, with \nequal vigor and determination, protect our Constitution, our civil \nliberties, the very foundation of this country. If the forces of evil \nsuccessfully propel leaders in Washington to erode our core \nconstitutional values, we will grant these terrorists a satisfying \nvictory. We must never allow this. We must uphold the Constitution. We \nmust work to protect the balance between protecting our Nation's \nsecurity while also maintaining our civil liberties and our \nconstitutional rights.\n  That is why I, similar to so many Montanans, am deeply concerned \nabout the NSA's bulk metadata collection program and its impact on our \nconstitutional rights. This program allows the NSA to have uninhibited \naccess to America's phone records. I firmly believe this is a violation \nof America's constitutional rights and it must come to an end. \nMontanans have also long been concerned that the NSA has overreached \nits legal authority when implementing its bulk data collection program.\n  The recent ruling from the New York-based Second Circuit U.S. Court \nof Appeals confirmed it. The court ruled unanimously that section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act does not authorize the NSA's bulk collection of \nAmericans' phone metadata, but this is not the first time the legality \nof NSA's bulk data practices have been questioned.\n  A 2015 report from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, \nwhich is a nonpartisan, independent privacy board, found that section \n215 does not provide authority for the NSA's collection program. The \nreport raised serious concerns that the NSA's program violated the \nrights guaranteed under the First and Fourth Amendments. The report \nstates:\n\n       Under the section 215 bulk records program, the NSA \n     acquires a massive number of calling records from telephone \n     companies every day, potentially including the records of \n     every call made across the Nation. Yet Section 215 does not \n     authorize the NSA to acquire anything at all.\n\n  The report concludes:\n\n       The program lacks a viable legal foundation under section \n     215. It implicates Constitutional concerns of the first and \n     fourth amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and \n     civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only \n     limited value. For these reasons the government should end \n     the program.\n\n  I strongly agree. In addition, the independent Commission found that \nthe bulk collection program contributed only minimal value in \ncombatting terrorism beyond what the government already achieves \nthrough other alternative means. So claims that this program provides \nunique value to our security were not validated, and, in fact, were \nrefused by the Commission.\n  As Montana's Senator, I took an oath to protect and defend the \nConstitution. It is a responsibility and a promise I take very \nseriously. That is why I have joined Senators Lee, Leahy, and others to \nintroduce the USA FREEDOM Act\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nof 2015. This bipartisan legislation will end the NSA's bulk data \ncollection program, while also implementing greater oversight, \ntransparency, and accountability in the government's surveillance \nactivities.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act strikes the right balance between protecting our \nsecurity and protecting our privacy. It still allows necessary access \nto information specific to an investigation, with an appropriate court \norder, and provides the flexibility to be able to move quickly in \nresponse to emergencies, but it stops the indiscriminate government \ncollection of data on innocent Americans once and for all.\n  I have long fought to defend Montanans' civil liberties, protecting \nprivacy and constitutional rights from Big Government overreach. After \nspending 12 years in the technology sector, I know firsthand the power \nthat data holds and the threats to American civil liberties that come \nwith mass collection.\n  As Montana's loan representative in the U.S. House, I cosponsored the \noriginal USA FREEDOM ACT that would have ended the NSA's abuses and \noverreach. I also supported efforts led by Congressman Justin Amash to \namend the 2014 Defense appropriations bill and end the NSA's blanket \ncollection of Americans' telephone records.\n  We made significant ground last year in raising awareness of this \noverreach, but the fight to protect America's civil liberties and \nconstitutional freedoms is far from over. That is why I am proud to \nstand today as a cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 and a strong \nadvocate and defender of America's right to privacy. As risks facing \nour homeland and our interests overseas remain ever present, it is \ncritical that our law enforcement has the tools they need to protect \nour national security from extremists who would destroy our Nation and \nour very way of life.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act provides these tools, but we must also remain \nvigilant to ensure that American civil liberties aren't needlessly \nabandoned in the process. We need to protect and defend the homeland. \nWe need to protect and defend the Constitution.\n  I stand today with the full confidence that the USA FREEDOM Act \nachieves both, and I urge the Senate to pass it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend the \ncolloquy by an additional 5 minutes so we can hear from my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah, my \nfriend and very distinguished colleague, as well as our friend from the \nState of Vermont for their leadership this morning and throughout the \ndrafting and formulating of this very well-balanced compromise--a \nbalance between security, which we must be able to preserve and defend, \nand our privacy and other essential constitutional rights, which we \nneed to protect just as zealously, because the reason for fighting to \npreserve our security is so we maintain and preserve our great \nconstitutional rights.\n  That balance can be struck. It is feasible, achievable, and this \nmeasure of the USA FREEDOM Act is a strong step in the right direction.\n  I wish to talk today about one of its great virtues, which is an \nAmerican virtue, the virtue of due process having an effective \nadversarial process, one that is transparent and provides for effective \nappellate view. The lack of an adversarial process, as well as \ntransparency and effective appellate review, is one of the reasons the \nUSA FREEDOM Act is absolutely necessary.\n  We know bulk collection of megadata is unnecessary. The President's \nown review group made that fact clear. We also know bulk metadata \ncollection is, essentially, un-American. This country was founded by \npeople who, rightly, abhorred the so-called general warrant that \npermitted the King's officials to rummage through their homes and \ndocuments. No general warrant in our history has swept up as much \ninformation about innocent Americans as orders allowing bulk \ncollection.\n  Last week, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals told us something \nmore; that we now know bulk collection is unauthorized. It is illegal. \nIt is unauthorized by statute and has been so for the last 9 years that \nthe government has collected bulk data of this kind.\n  The question is, How did it happen? How did we arrive at a point \nwhere the Government of the United States has been collecting data \nillegally for 9 years? We know that in May of 2006, the FISA Court--the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court--first was asked whether the \nFederal Government could collect the phone records of potentially every \nsingle American, and it said yes.\n  It failed the most crucial test of any court, which is to uphold our \nliberties against any legal onslaught. It got it wrong because the \ngovernment's argument hinged on a single word, the word ``relevance.'' \nThe court ruled that relevance means all information. In other words, \nthe court had to decide whether relevant information means all \ninformation, and it said yes.\n  That judgment was just plain wrong, and it did not strike the Second \nCircuit as a difficult question. It doesn't strike us--now in \nretrospect--as a difficult question. The Second Circuit held that the \nFederal Government's interpretation is ``unprecedented and \nunwarranted.'' Never before, in the history of the Nation, has this \nkind of bizarre overreaching been successfully entertained.\n  Now, the court--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--didn't \neven issue an opinion. There was no way for anyone to know that this \nbulk metadata collection had been authorized because the court never \ntold anyone, never explained itself. One can hope the Court knew what \nit was thinking at the time, but we don't know what it was thinking.\n  Now, I don't mean any disrespect to the FISA Court, which is composed \nof judges who have been confirmed by this body, article 3 judges who \nserve because they have been appointed by the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States.\n  The reason the court got this issue so fundamentally wrong, I think, \nis because it heard only one side of the argument. It heard only the \ngovernment's side. It heard only the advocates seeking to collect in \nthis sweeping way that was contrary to statute and, in my view, also \ncontrary to fundamental rights and principles.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act corrects that systemic problem. It not only \nenables, but it requires the court to hear both sides.\n  We know from our life's experience that people make better decisions \nwhen they hear both sides of an argument. Judges on the courts know \nthey want to hear both sides of the argument before they make a \ndecision. Often they will appoint someone to make the other side of the \nargument, if there isn't anyone to do so effectively. They want \neffective representation in the courtroom.\n  That is why I have advocated from the very start and proposed--and \nthe President affirmed--that there needs to be advocacy for our \nconstitutional rights before the court. The other side of the \ngovernment's argument needs to be represented.\n  We need a FISA Court we can trust to get it right because this \nproposal for an adversarial proceeding in no way contemplates an \nabridgement of secrecy or unnecessary delay. Warrants could proceed \nwithout delay. They could proceed without violation of confidentiality \nand secrecy, but the systemic problem would be fixed so the FISA Court \nwould hear from both sides.\n  This act also is important because it would bring more transparency \nto FISA Court decisions, requiring opinions to be released, unless \nthere is good reason not to do so. It would require some form of \neffective appellate review so mistakes could be corrected.\n  These kinds of changes in the law are, in fact, basic due process. \nThey are the rule of law throughout the United States in article 3 \ncourts, and these changes will make the FISA Court look like the courts \nAmericans are accustomed to seeing in their everyday experience. When \nthey walk into a courtroom in any town in the State of Connecticut or \nthe State of Utah or the State of Montana, what they are accustomed to \nseeing is two sides arguing before a judge, and that is what the FISA \nCourt would look like--rather than one side making one argument,\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nwhether it is for bulk collection of metadata or any other intrusion on \ncivil rights and civil liberties, there would be an advocate on the \nother side to make the case that it is overreaching, that it is \nunnecessary, that it is unauthorized. In fact, that is what the Second \nCircuit said the government was doing by this incredibly overextended \noverreach in bulk collection of metadata.\n  Unless and until this essential reform is enacted, along with other \ncritical reforms that are contained in the USA FREEDOM Act, I will \noppose reauthorization of section 215, and I urge my colleagues to do \nso as well.\n  I thank my colleagues from Utah and Vermont for their leadership and \nall who have joined in this morning's discussion. The colloquy today, I \nthink, illustrates some important points of why the USA FREEDOM Act is \nimportant at this point in our Nation's history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of Senator Hatch \nand his willingness to wait while we finished this exercise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2779-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2779-S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TRADE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on \nwhether to begin debate on the future of the U.S. trade policy. It is a \ndebate that has been a long time coming. In fact, we haven't had a real \ntrade debate in this Chamber since at least 2002. That was 13 years \nago.\n  Think about that. Let's keep in mind that 95 percent of the world's \nconsumers live outside of the United States and that if we want our \nfarmers, our ranchers, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs to be able to \ncompete in the world marketplace, we need to be actively working to \nbreak down barriers for American exports. This is how we can grow our \neconomy and create good, high-paying jobs for American workers.\n  While the chatter in the media and behind the scenes surrounding \ntoday's vote has been nearly deafening, no one should make today's vote \nmore than it is. It is, once again, quite simply, a vote to begin \ndebate on these important issues.\n  Now, I know some around here are unwilling to even consider having a \ndebate if they can't dictate the terms in advance, but that is not how \nthe Senate works and, thankfully, that is not the path we are going to \ntake.\n  I have been in Congress for a long time, so I think I can speak with \nsome authority about how this Chamber is--under normal conditions and \nregular order--supposed to operate. Of course, before this year, it had \nbeen a while before this body had worked the way it was supposed to. \nHopefully, today's vote can serve as a reminder, and we can go to \nregular order on these bills and do it in a way that brings dignity to \nthis Chamber again.\n  Once again, today's vote will decide only whether we will begin a \ndebate on trade policy. It will not in any way decide the outcome of \nthat debate. Indeed, the question for today is not how this debate will \nproceed but whether it will proceed at all.\n  Right now, everyone's focus seems to be on whether we will renew \ntrade promotion authority--or TPA--and that will, of course, be part of \nthe trade debate. TPA is a vital element of U.S. trade policy. Indeed, \nit is the best way to ensure that Congress sets the objectives for our \ntrade negotiators and provides assurances to our trading partners that \nif a trade agreement is signed, the United States can deliver on the \ndeal.\n  As you know, the Finance Committee reported a strong bipartisan TPA \nbill on April 22. The committee vote was 20 to 6 in favor of the bill. \nIt was a bipartisan vote. That was a historic day. Before that day, the \nlast time the Finance Committee reported a TPA bill was in 1988, almost \nthree decades ago.\n\n  But that is not all we did on that day. In addition to our TPA bill, \nwe reported a bill to reauthorize trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, \na bill to reauthorize expired trade preference programs, and a customs \nand trade enforcement bill.\n  These are all important bills--each one of them. They all have \nbipartisan support. I was a principal author of three of these four \nbills, and I don't intend to see any of them left by the wayside. \nHowever, that looks like it is becoming increasingly what might really \nhappen here if we don't get together.\n  Everyone here knows that I am anxious to get TPA across the finish \nline. And though it pains me a little to say it, TAA is part of that \neffort. We know our colleagues on the left have to have that. While I \noppose TAA, I have recognized--and I have from the beginning--that the \nprogram is important to many of my colleagues, some of whom are on this \nside of the aisle as well, and it is a necessary component to win their \nsupport for TPA.\n  On a number of occasions, including at the Finance Committee markup, \nI have committed to helping make sure that TPA and TAA move on parallel \ntracks, and I intend to honor that commitment. Toward that end, if we \nget cloture on the motion to proceed later today, I plan to combine TPA \nand TAA into basically a single package that can be split by the House, \nand move them as a substitute amendment to the trade vehicle. And, I \nhave to say, Congressman Ryan, the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, understands that TAA has to pass over there as well.\n  In other words, no one should be concerned about a path forward for \nTPA and TAA. That was the big debate throughout the whole procedural \nprocess. And even though it raises concerns for a number of \nRepublicans, including myself, these two bills will move together.\n  The question ultimately becomes this: What about the preferences and \ncustoms bills? There are two other bills here. I have committed in the \npast to work on getting all four of these bills across the finish line \nor at least to a vote on the floor, and I will reaffirm that commitment \nhere on the floor today. I will work in good faith with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle and in both the House and Senate to get this \ndone.\n  Regarding preferences, the House and Senate have introduced very \nsimilar bills, and, in the past, these preference programs--programs \nsuch as the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the generalized \nsystem of preferences--have enjoyed broad bipartisan support. My guess \nis that support will continue and that there is a path forward on \nmoving that legislation in short order.\n  Admittedly, the customs bill is a bit more complicated. However, I am \na principal author of most of the provisions in the customs bill. \nIndeed, many of my own enforcement positions and priorities are in that \nbill. Put simply, I have a vested interest in seeing the customs bill \nbecome law, and I will do all I can to make sure that happens. I will \nwork with Senator Wyden and the rest of my colleagues to find a path \nforward on these bills. I don't want any of them to be left behind.\n  But we all know that the customs bill has language in there that \ncannot be passed in the House. I don't know what to do about that. All \nI can say is that we can provide a vote here in this body, and who \nknows what that vote will be. I am quite certain that if we are allowed \nto proceed today, these bills--not to mention any others--will be \noffered as amendments. But in the end, we can't do any of that--we \ncan't pass a single one of these bills--if we don't even begin the \ntrade debate.\n  If Senators are concerned about the substance of the legislation we \nare debating, the best way to address these problems is to come to the \nfloor, offer some amendments, and take some votes. That is how the \nSenate is supposed to operate, and we are prepared to operate it that \nway.\n  I might add, though, we have to get the bill up. And if there is a \ncloture vote and cloture fails, Katy bar the door.\n  I know there are some deeply held convictions on all sides of these \nissues and that not everyone in the Senate agrees with me. That is all \nthe more reason to let this debate move forward and let's see where it \ngoes. Let's talk about our positions. Let's make all of our voices \nheard. I am ready and willing to defend my support for free trade and \nTPA here on the Senate floor. I will happily stand here and make the \ncase for open markets and expanded access for U.S. exporters and refute \nany arguments made to the contrary. And I\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nam quite certain there are a number of my colleagues who would relish \nthe opportunity to tell me why they think I am wrong. They should have \nthat right. None of that happens if people vote today to prevent the \ndebate from even taking place.\n  We need to keep in mind that we are talking about bipartisan \nlegislation here. All of these bills are supported by Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. This isn't some partisan gambit to force a \nRepublican bill through the Senate. And, of course, let's not forget \nthat, with TPA, we are talking about President Obama's top legislative \npriority and one of the most important bills in this President's \nservice as President of the United States of America.\n  This is a debate we need to have. I am prepared to have it. The \nAmerican people deserve to see us talk about these issues on the floor \ninstead of hiding behind procedural excuses.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, regardless of where they stand \nsubstantively on these issues, to vote to begin this important and, \nhopefully, historic debate on U.S. trade policy.\n  Let me say, I am basically shocked that after all we have done--the \nlarge vote in the committee, the importance of these two bills in \nparticular but all four of them, and the importance of trade promotion \nauthority and trade adjustment assistance to the President--that we now \nhave a bunch of procedural mechanisms that could make this all \nimpossible. It is hard for me to believe that this could take place. We \nhad an agreement--the two sides--and I am concerned about that \nagreement being broken at this late date, when we were so happy to get \nthese bills out of the committee and get them the opportunity of being \non the floor.\n  I have to say, as a Republican and as a conservative, I have been \nwilling to carry the water for the President on this because he is \nabsolutely right that TPA and TAA should pass, especially TPA. On TAA, \nI have questions on it and I wish we didn't have to pass it, but I have \nagreed to see that it is on the Senate floor as part of passing TPA.\n  The bill deserves to pass. However, we know that the President does \nnot like the language that was put into the customs bill and neither do \nI, at this point, because I think it could foul up the whole process, \nthe way I am hearing from the other side. We understood we were going \nto have votes on TPA and TAA, without getting into the currency problem \nthat will still be alive on the customs bill. I am very concerned about \nthis because we have come this far, and we should follow through and \nget this done. The President will be better off, the country will be \nbetter off, and all of us will be better off. And we can walk away from \nthis, I believe, in the end feeling that we have done the right thing. \nThis is the best thing that could be done for our country. We have to \nbe part of the free-trade movement in this country and in this world. \nThere are 400 trade agreements out there. We have only agreed to 20 of \nthem.\n  These trade agreements generally bring jobs that are much better paid \nthan other jobs in our society, between 13 and 18 percent more. For the \nlife of me, I will never understand why the unions are so opposed to it \nand, thus, so many Democrats are opposed to it. I can't understand it, \nbecause this will create jobs, and generally the better jobs--the jobs \nthat unions can then fight to unionize if they want to, which they have \na right to do under our laws. Yet every time these matters come up, \nthey are a principal impediment to getting free-trade agreements \npassed.\n  Look, I think Ambassador Froman has done a very good job up to now, \nbut his hands are tied. If we don't pass TPA, he is going to have a \nvery difficult time, ever, bringing about the TPP, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, or TTIP, which is 28 European countries plus ours. TPP is \n11 countries plus ours, mainly in Asia--not the least of which is \nJapan, which our Trade Representative believes he can get to sign a \ntrade agreement with us. I believe he can. But I don't believe he can \ndo it without TPA. We have already been told by the Ambassador from New \nZealand that they are not going to sign without TPA.\n  So to hamper the passage of TPA because of some desire to do \notherwise is not only a mistake, but it flies in the face of the \nsupport this President needs and should have on this particular bill.\n  Now, I understand there are folks on the other side who just aren't \nfor free trade and they are not for trade bills. And they have a right \nto feel that way. I don't have a problem with that. What I have a \nproblem with is making it impossible to pass these bills and get them \nthrough the Senate, which is the path we are on right now. If the votes \nare against cloture, I suspect our path to getting this done--to \nimproving our trade throughout the world, to allowing us to compete \nworldwide the way we should--is going to be severely hampered, if not \ncompletely hurt.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat side has 12\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, most people who are following this debate \nmay be a little bit put off by some of the initials that we use around \nhere--TPP, TPA, TAA. What is it all about?\n  It is about a trade agreement. It involves a dozen countries, \nincluding the United States. Most of them are in Asia. We are preparing \nto discuss and debate it, and that trade agreement is known as the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. I think that is what that stands \nfor. I will correct the record if I am wrong on that.\n  But before we get to the trade agreement, we have to decide how we \nare going to consider it, and that is known as TPA, trade promotion \nauthority, or fast track. The question is whether the Senate will agree \nthat we cannot amend the trade agreement--no amendments--and that it is \na simple majority vote. That is what is known as fast track. Virtually \nevery President in modern time has had that authority. It has expired, \nand now it has to be recreated by a vote on the floor.\n  What we are anticipating this afternoon is whether we go to the \narguments about these various issues, and the uncertainty is what leads \nmy friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, to come to the floor.\n  The uncertainty from our side is this: How are we going to consider \nthis? Four bills came out of the Finance Committee related to trade. \nHow are they going to be brought to the floor? Are they going to be \npart of one package? Are they separate votes? Which one will come out \nof the Senate? Will more than one come out of the Senate? These are \nunanswered questions, and because these questions are unanswered, the \nvote at 2:30 or so is in doubt.\n  Senator Hatch is upset. He believed that there was an agreement. I \nwasn't a party to it. I don't know. But this much I do know: Trade is a \ncontroversial issue. It is important to America's economy. But when you \ntake it home and meet with the people you represent, there are strong \nmixed feelings about trade.\n  Some who work for the Caterpillar tractor company in Illinois want to \npromote trade, sell more of those big yellow tractors, and put more \nAmericans to work to build them.\n  But many look at trade and say: I could be a casualty. I could be a \nvictim. They could ship my job overseas, Senator. So what are you going \nto do to make sure I am protected in this?\n  That is why trade isn't an easy issue. It is a controversial issue.\n  TAA, which Senator Hatch referred to, is trade adjustment assistance. \nWhat it says is that if you lost your job because of a trade agreement, \nwe will help pay for your training for a new job. Senator Hatch said he \nopposed that. I fully support it.\n  I just visited a high school in downstate Illinois. There was a man \nthere teaching high school students--good, gifted high school \nstudents--how to repair computers. I said: How did you get into this \nbusiness? He said: It is a funny thing. I lost my job in a factory \nyears ago because of a trade agreement. But because of trade adjustment \nassistance, I was able to go back to college, got a degree, and now I \nam a teacher.\n  Do I support trade adjustment assistance? You bet I do--for that \nteacher and for many others who want to transition into a new job if \nthey lose their job because of trade. So including trade adjustment \nassistance in any part of a\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\ntrade agreement is important to many of us. We want to make sure it is \nincluded on the floor of the Senate.\n  Equally so, we want to make sure that trade agreements are \nenforceable. It wasn't that long ago that we had thriving steel \nproduction companies in America that were victimized by many foreign \ncountries that started dumping steel in the United States.\n  What does it mean to dump steel? These countries--Brazil, Japan, and \nRussia--were selling steel in the United States at prices lower than \nthe cost of production. Why? They knew they could run the Americans out \nof business--and they did. By the time we filed an unfair trade \ngrievance, went through the hearings and won our case, the American \ncompanies disappeared. Enforcement is an important part of any \nconversation about trade. We want to know from Senator Hatch and the \nRepublicans who bring this to the floor, if we are going to enforce the \ntrade agreements so Americans are treated fairly.\n\n  I think that is a pretty legitimate question. Until it is answered, \nthere is uncertainty. Maybe the vote at 2:30 will reflect it. I hope we \ncan get an answer before 2:30, but if not, then soon after, on how \nSenator McConnell wants to bring this issue to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2781-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, May 31--today is May 12. On May 31, the \nFederal highway trust fund authorization expires. What it means is at \nthat point in time, the Federal Government will stop sending Federal \ndollars back to our States to build highways and bridges and support \nbuses and mass transit--May 31.\n  What are we going to do about it? We have 19 days to do something \nabout it. Sadly, we know what we are going to do about it. The \nRepublicans who control the House and the Senate have failed to come up \nwith any means of extending the highway trust fund. What they are going \nto do probably is ask us for a short-term extension--1 month, 2 months.\n  The reason we think this will happen is that in the past 6 years, \nthere have been 32 extensions of the highway trust fund. We used to \npass highway trust fund bills to last 6 years, for obvious reasons. You \ncannot build highways a month at a time. You have to know you have \nmoney that is going to be there for years to build a highway, to repair \na bridge, to make certain you have new mass transit modernization. But \nthe Republicans have been unable to reauthorize the highway trust fund \nfor any period of time. They want to extend it 30 days at a time, 60 \ndays at a time.\n  There are some realities that we need to accept. We cannot patch our \nway to prosperity in America. You cannot fill enough potholes to build \na highway. If we are going to accept our responsibility to be a great \nnation and a great leader in the world economy, we need an \ninfrastructure to support it.\n  The Republican failure to extend the highway trust fund for 5 or 6 \nyears, sadly, is going to cost us jobs in America--not just good-paying \nconstruction jobs but jobs in businesses that count on infrastructure. \nI have them all over Illinois. There are thousands of workers in \nIllinois who depend on them. But because the Republicans have failed to \ncome up with an extension of the highway trust fund, we are going to \nlimp along here and, sadly, not meet our national obligation to create \nan infrastructure to support our economy.\n  I am hoping that cooler heads will prevail and leadership will \nprevail, and that the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate--they are in the majority in both Chambers--will step forward \nwith a plan to create a highway trust fund for 6 years. The President \nhas; he put it on the table. Republicans rejected it. They have no \nalternative--none.\n  Let's get down to business. Let's put America back to work. Let's \ncreate the infrastructure we need to build our economy.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to make a statement on Syria and \nhumanitarian concerns in Syria, but it will take longer than that. I \nknow my colleague from Vermont is here, and I would like to yield the \nremaining 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me say this, if I might. If I can get unanimous \nconsent to speak after Senator Thune, that would be fine, and I would \nyield back to the Senator.\n  How is that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator wants to make that unanimous consent \nrequest----\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 15 minutes after Senator Thune speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe the previous Presiding Officer \nsuggested I had 5 minutes remaining of Democratic time at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2781-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2781-S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN SYRIA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to say, very briefly, a word \nabout the situation in Syria. On May 13, 1994, a Senator from Illinois \nnamed Paul Simon was then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on Africa. His ranking Republican was Senator Jim Jeffords \nof Vermont. Senators Jim Jeffords and Paul Simon had been told that \nthere was a looming genocide about to occur in Rwanda. They went on the \nphone together and spoke to U.N. General Romeo Dallaire in Kigali, \nRwanda, in May of 1994. They asked: What can we do to stop the killing \nin Rwanda? General Dallaire said: If you would send 5,000 uniformed \ntroops, I could stop this genocide.\n  Senators Simon and Jeffords wrote to the Clinton White House \nimmediately at that time and asked for the administration to call on \nthe United Nations to act.\n  Their letter said in part: ``Obviously there are risks involved but \nwe cannot continue to sit idly by while this tragedy continues to \nunfold.''\n  The Senators received no reply from the White House. In less than 8 \nweeks, 800,000 Rwandans were massacred. Today, President William \nClinton acknowledges that he should have done more--we should have done \nmore. What happened in Rwanda was a classic genocide. Today, what is \nhappening in Syria may not meet the classic definition of a genocide, \nbut it certainly meets every standard and every definition as the \nlooming humanitarian crisis of our time. The question before us and the \nUnited States is this: What will we do?\n  I think it has reached the point where we must act. That is why I \nhave joined three of my colleagues--fellow Democrat Tim Kaine of \nVirginia and Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John \nMcCain of Arizona--and we have written to President Obama, urging him \nto call together world leaders and to establish a humanitarian zone--a \nsafe zone, a no-fly zone--in Syria, where modern medical treatment can \nbe provided and displaced persons can escape. We think it should be \ndone under the auspices--I do--of the United Nations and that the \nUnited States can join other countries in providing a defensive \nsecurity force.\n  We need to turn to our NATO allies, such as Turkey. We need to reach \nout to Saudi Arabia, even Iran, and try to find an international \nconsensus to spare the suffering and death which has been occurring now \nfor years. We do not know the exact number of casualties. We estimate \nthat some 400,000 may have died in Syria. Millions have been displaced.\n  This is a picture of just one of the refugee camps to which the \npeople of Syria have fled. I have visited camps such as this in Turkey. \nThey are in Lebanon and Jordan. They cannot accommodate all of the \npeople who are evacuating that country.\n  Once every few months a friend of mine comes to visit in Chicago. He \nis an extraordinary man. His name is Dr. Sahloul. He heads up a group \nof Syrian Americans who travel to Syria on a regular basis. They have \nto sneak into the country--this war-torn country. As doctors, they are \nproviding basic medical care to the victims of the violence that is \ntaking place in Syria.\n  Dr. Sahloul brings heartbreaking photographs to show me. The last \nphotographs were of children who had been victims of barrel bombs, \nwhich Bashar al-Assad, the leader of Syria, drops on\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nhis own people. These are literally garbage cans filled with munitions \nand explosives that explode, killing civilian populations. The photos \nshowed children who had been maimed, lost their limbs, and some had \nbeen killed by these barrel bombs that continue. Now Assad has decided \nto up the ante. He is including chlorine gas in the barrel bombs as \nwell.\n  These doctors try to save these children and save these victims. Many \ntimes they are operating on tables in abandoned schools. They are \nbegging for medicines, which are at a high premium. Many times they are \nnot successful. What will we do? What can the United States do?\n  I hope that we can be part of an effort--an international effort--to \nprovide safe zones for medical treatment and for the displaced persons \nin Syria. I hope to join with others on a bipartisan basis in urging \nthat alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2782-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2782-S2783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on whether \nto proceed to a bill that was reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, on which I serve, the trade promotion authority legislation. \nWhat is so remarkable about this is that we are on the cusp here in the \nSenate of passing a major piece of legislation--bipartisan legislation \non which a Republican majority in the Senate is working with a \nDemocratic President to give him trade promotion authority--something \nthat would be very good for our economy. If the Democrats in the Senate \ndo not blow it, this could be a major hallmark achievement of this \nCongress. But my understanding is there is an effort on the other side \nnow to prevent us from even getting on the bill to debate it. I hope \nthat as Democrats contemplate that move, they will think long and hard \nabout what they will be doing. Not only will they be undermining their \nown President, who is very much for this, but they will be hurting the \nAmerican economy. Almost every President, literally back to FDR, has \nhad trade promotion authority in which he has the ability to negotiate \ntrade agreements with our trading partners in a way that Congress \nultimately has to approve but in a way that expedites and gives the \nmaximum amount of leverage to get the best trade agreement possible.\n  We are taking up that legislation, hopefully, later today. But it is \nall going to depend on Senate Democrats and whether they want to \nproceed to this bill or not. I certainly hope, as I said, that they \nwill come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of our \ncountry, of our economy, and certainly, I think, in the best interests \nof creating a bipartisan achievement here in which they are working \nwith their own President and with Republicans here in the Senate.\n  With 96 percent of the world's consumers outside the borders of the \nUnited States, trade is essential to growing our economy and opening \nnew markets for products marked ``Made in the USA.''\n  Over the past few years, exports have been a bright spot in our \neconomy, supporting an increasing number of American jobs each and \nevery year. In fact, in 2014 exports supported 11.7 million U.S. jobs \nand made up 13 percent of our Nation's economy.\n  In my home State of South Dakota alone, exports support more than \n15,000 jobs in industries that range from farming and ranching to \nmachinery and electronics. We need to continue to open markets around \nthe globe to American goods and services. The best way to do that is \nthrough new trade agreements. Countries with which we have free and \nfair trade agreements purchase substantially more from us than other \ncountries.\n  In fact, in 2013, free-trade agreement countries purchased 12 times \nmore goods and services per capita from the United States than non-\nfree-trade agreement countries. Let me restate that. In 2013, those \ncountries with which we have a free-trade agreement purchased 12 times \nmore goods per capita from the United States than those countries with \nwhich we do not have a free-trade agreement.\n  It is not just American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers who \nbenefit from trade agreements. American consumers benefit as well. \nTrade agreements give American families access to a greater variety of \ngoods at lower prices.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that trade increases American \nfamilies' purchasing power by $10,000 annually. For American workers, \nincreased trade means more opportunity and increased access to high-\npaying jobs. Manufacturing jobs tied to exports pay on average 13 to 18 \npercent more than wages in other areas of our economy.\n  Unfortunately, while trade agreements were proliferated around the \nglobe over the past several years, the United States has not signed a \nnew trade agreement in 5 years. Altogether, the United States has just \n14 trade agreements currently in effect. That is a lot of lost \nopportunity for American workers and businesses, since trade agreements \nhave proved to be the best way to increase demand for American products \nand services.\n  A big reason for the lack of trade agreements in recent years is the \nfact that trade promotion authority expired in 2007. As I said earlier, \nsince 1934--you have to go back to the administration of FDR--almost \nall of the United States' free-trade agreements have been negotiated \nusing trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined process. Trade \npromotion authority is designed to put the United States in the \nstrongest possible position when it comes to negotiating trade \nagreements.\n  Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and \noutlines the priorities the administration has to follow. In return, \nCongress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade \nagreement, instead of a long amendment process that could leave the \nfinal deal looking nothing like what was negotiated. That simple up-or-\ndown vote is the key. It lets our negotiating partners know that \nCongress and trade negotiators are on the same page, which gives other \ncountries the confidence they need to put their best offers on the \ntable, and that in turn allows for a successful and timely conclusion \nto negotiations.\n\n  Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade \nagreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for \nAmerican goods and services in the European Union and in the Pacific.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of \nAsia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, \nSingapore, and Vietnam.\n  If this agreement is done right, there could be huge benefits for \nAmerican agriculture, among other industries. Currently, American \nagricultural products face heavy tariffs in many Trans-Pacific \nPartnership countries. Poultry tariffs in TPP countries, for example, \ncan reach a staggering 240 percent. Reducing the barriers to American \nagricultural products in these countries would have enormous benefits \nfor American farmers and ranchers.\n  Agricultural producers in my State of South Dakota have contacted me \nto tell me how trade benefits their industries and to urge support for \ntrade promotion authority as the most effective way to secure trade \nagreements that will benefit South Dakota farmers and ranchers.\n  The leader of the South Dakota Dairy Producers Association wrote to \nme about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which could have \nsignificant benefits for South Dakota dairy farmers, and urged me to \nvote in favor of trade promotion authority. He said the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership talks ``have the potential to be positive for our dairy \nindustry, but only if the U.S. insists on settling for nothing less \nthan a balanced deal that delivers net trade benefits for the dairy \nindustry. Passing TPA is a key part of getting there.'' That is from a \ndairy producer in my State of South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, passing TPA is a key part of getting there. Neither \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership nor the United States-European Union \ntrade agreement is likely to be completed in a timely fashion without \ntrade promotion authority. If we want to make sure that trade \nnegotiations achieve the goals of American farmers and manufacturers, \ntrade promotion authority is essential.\n  The bipartisan bill we are considering on the Senate floor this week \nreauthorizes trade promotion authority,\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nand it includes a number of important updates, such as provisions to \nstrengthen the transparency of the negotiating process and ensure that \nthe American people stay informed.\n  It also contains provisions that I pushed for to require negotiators \nto ensure that trade agreements promote digital trade as well as trade \nin physical goods and services. Given the increasing importance of \ndigitally enabled commerce in the 21st-century economy, it is essential \nthat our trade agreements include new rules that keep digital trade \nfree from unnecessary government interference.\n  This trade promotion authority bill will help ensure that any trade \ndeals the United States enters into will be favorable to American \nfarmers, ranchers, and manufacturers, and it will hold other countries \naccountable for their unfair practices. Passing this bill is essential \nto prevent American workers and businesses from being left behind in \nthe global economy.\n  Since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, Democrats \nand Republicans have come together on a number of issues to pass \nlegislation to address challenges that are facing our country. I hope \nthis bill will be our next bipartisan achievement.\n  The President has made it clear that he supports this bill, and key \nDemocratic Senators are working to make sure it passes. I hope the rest \nof the Democratic Party here in the Senate will come together with the \nPresident and Republicans to get this done.\n  As President Obama said the other day, ``We have to make sure that \nAmerica writes the rules of the global economy. . . . Because if we \ndon't write the rules for trade around the world--guess what--China \nwill. And they'll write those rules in a way that gives Chinese workers \nand Chinese businesses the upper hand, and locks American-made goods \nout.'' Again, that is a quote from President Obama.\n  To put it another way, if America fails to lead on trade, other \nnations will step in to fill the void, and those nations will not have \nthe best interests of American workers and American families in mind.\n  It is time to pass trade promotion authority so we can secure \nfavorable new trade deals and ensure that American goods and services \ncan compete on a level playing field around the globe and that American \nworkers and American consumers receive the benefits that come along \nwith that. I hope that will be the outcome of the vote today, and I \nhope it will be a major achievement for this Senate--a bipartisan \nachievement where both sides work together for the good of our economy, \nfor the good of jobs, for the good of higher wage levels for American \nworkers, and for the good of a more competitive economy in which our \nconsumers benefit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at 2:30 this afternoon, the Senate will \nvote on a motion to proceed to the fast-track bill which was recently \napproved by the Finance Committee. I will be strongly opposing that \nlegislation.\n  In a nutshell, here is the reality of the American economy today: \nWhile we are certainly better off than we were 6\\1/2\\ years ago, the \ntruth is that for the last 40 years the American middle class has been \ndisappearing. The truth is that today we have some 45 million Americans \nliving in poverty, and that is almost at the highest rate in the modern \nhistory of America.\n  While the middle class continues to shrink, we are seeing more income \nand wealth inequality than at any time in our country since 1929, and \nit is worse in America than any other major country on Earth. Today, 99 \npercent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. Today, the top \none-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 \npercent. In the last 2 years, the 14 wealthiest people in this country \nhave seen an increase in their wealth of $157 billion, and that $157 \nbillion is more wealth than is owned by the bottom 130 million \nAmericans.\n  How is that happening? Why is it happening? We have seen a huge \nincrease in technology, productivity is way up, and the reality is that \nmost working people should be seeing an increase in their income. Yet, \nmedian family income has gone down by almost $5,000 since 1999. How \ndoes that happen? Why is it that the richest country in the history of \nthe world has almost all of its new wealth in the hands of the few, \nwhile the vast majority of the American people are working longer hours \nfor lower wages? How does that happen? Well, there are a lot of \nfactors, but I will tell everyone that our disastrous trade agreements, \nsuch as NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations with China, \nare certainly one of the major reasons why the middle class is in \ndecline and why more and more income and wealth goes to a handful of \npeople on the top.\n  The sad truth is that many of the new jobs created in this country \ntoday are part-time and low-paying jobs. Thirty or forty years ago, \npeople who maybe had a high school degree could go out and get a job in \na factory. They never got rich and it wasn't a glamorous job, but they \nhad enough wages and benefits to make it into the middle class.\n  Since 2001, we have lost almost 60,000 factories in America. When \nyoung people graduate from high school today, they don't have the \nopportunity to work in a factory and have a union job and make middle-\nclass wages; their options are Walmart and McDonald's, where there are \nlow wages and minimal benefits. Those are companies which are \nvehemently anti-union.\n  The sad truth is that we are in a race to the bottom. Not only have \nour trade agreements cost us millions of decent-paying jobs, they have \ndepressed wages in this country because companies--virtually every \nmajor multinational corporation in this country has outsourced jobs and \nshed millions of American jobs. What they say to workers is: If you \ndon't like the cuts in health care and wages, we will go to China. We \ncan hire people there for $1 an hour.\n  Sadly, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement follows in the \nfootsteps of the other disastrous free-trade agreements that have \nforced American workers to compete against desperate and low-wage \nworkers around the world.\n  Over and over again--and I have heard this so many times, including \non the floor this morning--supporters of fast-track have told us that \nunfettered free trade will increase American jobs and wages and will be \njust wonderful for the American economy. Sadly, however, these folks \nhave been proven wrong and wrong and wrong time after time after time. \nI hear the same language, and what they say proves not to be true every \ntime.\n  I will mention some quotes from the supporters of NAFTA. These are \npeople who were telling us how great the NAFTA free-trade agreement \nwould be.\n  President Bill Clinton was pushing NAFTA in the same way that \nPresident Obama is pushing TPP today. On September 19, 1993, President \nClinton said:\n\n       I believe NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the \n     first two years of its effect. . . . I believe that NAFTA \n     will create a million jobs in the first five years of its \n     impact.\n\n  It wasn't just liberals, such as Bill Clinton, who supported NAFTA. I \nhave a quote from the very conservative Heritage Foundation in 1993: \n``Virtually all economists agree that NAFTA will produce a net increase \nof U.S. jobs over the next decade.''\n  In 1993, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, our majority leader \nMitch McConnell, said: ``American firms will not move to Mexico just \nfor lower wages.''\n  Were President Clinton, the Heritage Foundation, and Mitch McConnell \ncorrect? Well, of course they were not. In fact, what happened was \nexactly the opposite of what they said.\n  According to the well-respected economists at the Economic Policy \nInstitute, NAFTA has led to the loss of more than 680,000 jobs. In \n1993, the year before NAFTA was implemented, the United States had a \ntrade surplus with Mexico of more than $1.6 billion. Last year, the \ntrade deficit with Mexico was $53 billion. So all of the verbiage we \nheard about NAFTA being so good for American workers turned out to be \ndead wrong.\n  What about China? We were told: Oh my God, China will open up the \nChinese market, and there are billions of people. What an opportunity \nto create good-paying jobs in America.\n  Here is what President Clinton, one of the proponents of permanent \nnormal trade relations with China, had to say in 1999:\n\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n\n       In opening the economy of China, the agreement will create \n     unprecedented opportunities for American farmers, workers and \n     companies to compete successfully in China's market . . . \n     This is a hundred-to-nothing deal for America when it comes \n     to the economic consequences.\n\n  In 1999, conservative economists at the Cato Institute said:\n\n       The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports \n     would overwhelm U.S. industry. In fact, American workers are \n     far more productive than their Chinese counterparts . . . \n     PNTR would create far more export opportunities for America \n     than the Chinese.\n\n  Wow, were they wrong.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that PNTR with China has \nled to the net loss of over 2.7 million Americans jobs.\n  Go to any department store in America and walk in the door. Where are \nthe products made? China, China, China. They are made in Vietnam and in \nother low-wage countries. In fact, it is harder and harder to buy a \nproduct not made in China.\n\n  So all of those people who told us what a great deal PNTR with China \nwould be turned out to be dead wrong. In fact, our trade agreement with \nChina has cost us almost 3 million jobs.\n  In 2001, the trade deficit with China was $83 billion. Today, it is \n$342 billion. In 2011, on another trade agreement, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--a big proponent of unfettered free trade--strongly supported \nTPP. The Chamber of Commerce told us we had to pass a free-trade \nagreement with South Korea because it would create some 280,000 jobs in \nAmerica. That is a lot of jobs. It turns out they were wrong again. In \nreality, the Economic Policy Institute recently found that the Korea \nFree Trade Agreement has led to the loss of some 75,000 jobs.\n  Now, the Obama administration says, trust us. Forget what they said \nabout NAFTA. Forget what they said about Korea. Forget what they said \nabout China. This one is different. Really, really, cross our fingers, \nhope to die, this one is really, really different. Yes, it may be true \nthat every corporation in America--corporations that have shut down \nfactories in this country and moved to China--they are supporting this \nagreement. Yes, it is true Wall Street, whose greed and recklessness \nhave almost destroyed the American economy, is supporting this \nagreement. Yes, it is true the pharmaceutical industry, which charges \nus the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, is \nsupporting this agreement--but not to worry, we should trust these \nguys. They really are thinking of the American middle class and working \nfamilies. Trust us when they tell us a trade agreement will be good for \nworking people. Yes, we should really trust them. Meanwhile, every \ntrade union in America and the vast majority of environmental groups in \nthis country are saying be careful about TPP; vote no on fast-track.\n  Here is the reality of the American economy. Since 2001, we have lost \n60,000 factories in this country and we have lost over 4.7 million \nmanufacturing jobs. In 1970, 25 percent of all the jobs in this country \nwere in manufacturing. Today, that figure is down to 9 percent.\n  The point is that, by and large, especially if there were unions, \nthose manufacturing jobs paid working people a living wage, not a \nWalmart wage, not a McDonald's wage.\n  Our demand must be to corporate America--which tells us every night \non TV to buy this product, to buy this pair of sneakers, to buy this \ntelevision, to buy whatever it is--that maybe, just maybe, they might \nwant to start manufacturing those products here in the United States of \nAmerica and pay our workers a decent wage, rather than looking all over \nthe world for the lowest possible wages in which they can exploit \nworkers who are desperate.\n  I was very disappointed that President Obama chose the headquarters \nof Nike to tout the so-called benefits of the TPP. Nike epitomizes why \ndisastrous, unfettered free-trade policies during the past four decades \nhave failed American workers. Nike does not employ a single \nmanufacturing worker who makes shoes in the United States of America--\nnot one worker. One hundred percent of the shoes sold by Nike are made \noverseas in low-wage countries. That is the transformation of the \nAmerican economy, and it is not just Nike.\n  When Nike was founded in 1964, just 4 percent of U.S. footwear was \nimported. In other words, we manufactured the vast majority of the \nshoes and the sneakers we wore. Today, nearly all of the shoes that are \nbought in the United States are manufactured overseas. Today, over \n330,000 workers manufacture Nike's products in Vietnam, where the \nminimum wage is 56 cents an hour.\n  I hear President Obama and other proponents of TPP talking about a \nlevel playing field. We have to compete on a level playing field. Does \nanybody think competing against desperate people who make 56 cents an \nhour is a level playing field, is fair to American workers? Of course, \nwe want the poor people all over the world to see an increase in their \nstandard of living, and we have to play an important role in that, but \nwe don't have to destroy the American middle class to help low-income \nworkers around the world.\n  In Vietnam, not only is the minimum wage 56 cents an hour, \nindependent labor unions are banned, and people are thrown in jail for \nexpressing their political beliefs. Is that the level playing field \nPresident Obama and other proponents of unfettered free trade are \ntalking about?\n  Back in 1988, Phil Knight--Phil Knight is the founder and the owner \nof Nike--said Nike had ``become synonymous with slave wages, forced \novertime, and arbitrary abuse.'' Phil Knight was right. In fact, \nfactories in Vietnam where Nike shoes are manufactured have been cited \nby the Worker Rights Consortium for excessive overtime, wage theft, and \nphysical mistreatment of workers. Today, Mr. Knight is one of the \nwealthiest people on this planet, worth more than $22 billion. While \nMr. Knight's net worth has more than tripled since 1999, the average \nVietnamese worker who makes Nike shoes earns pennies an hour. That is \npretty much synonymous with what unfettered free trade is about. A \nhandful of people such as Phil Knight become multi-multi-\nmultibillionaires and poor people all over the world are exploited and \npaid pennies an hour.\n  It is not just Nike and it is not just Vietnam. Another country that \nis part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is Malaysia. Today, there are \nnearly 200 electronics factories in Malaysia where high-tech products \nfrom Apple, Dell, Intel, Motorola, and Texas Instruments are \nmanufactured and brought back to the United States. If the TPP is \napproved, that number will go up substantially. What is wrong with \nthat? It turns out that many of the workers at the electronics plants \nin Malaysia are being forced to work there under horrible working \nconditions. According to Verite, which conducted a 2-year investigation \ninto labor abuses in Malaysia--an investigation which was commissioned \nby the U.S. Department of Labor--32 percent of the industry's nearly \n200,000 migrant workers in Malaysia were employed in forced situations \nbecause their passports had been taken away or because they were \nstraining to pay back illegally high recruitment fees. In other words, \nAmerican workers are going to be forced to compete against people in \nMalaysia--immigrant workers there whose passports have been taken away \nand who can't leave the country and who are working under forced labor \nsituations.\n  So let me conclude by saying this: All of us understand trade is \ngood. It is a good thing. But I think most of us now have caught on to \nthe fact that the trade agreements pushed by corporate America, pushed \nby Wall Street, pushed by the pharmaceutical industry are very, very \ngood if you are the CEO of a major corporation, but they are a disaster \nif you are an American worker.\n  It is my view that we have to rebuild manufacturing in America. It is \nmy view that we have to create millions of decent-paying jobs in \nAmerica. It is my view that we need to fundamentally rewrite our trade \nagreements so our largest export does not become decent-paying American \njobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the fast-track agreement. Let us \nsit down and work on trade agreements that work for the American middle \nclass, that work for our working people and not just for the CEOs of \nthe largest corporations in this country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In just a few minutes, we will be holding a vote on whether to invoke \ncloture to cut off debate and move to the trade promotion authority \nbill, granting trade promotion authority to the President--a very \nimportant conversation this country needs to have in terms of what we \nare going to do to expand our opportunities in a region of the world \nthat represents 50 percent of the population of this world and that \nrepresents 40 percent of our trade opportunities. It is a great \nopportunity for this Congress, this Senate, to show how serious we are \nabout truly rebalancing our efforts with Asian nations.\n  In Colorado alone, we exported nearly $8.4 billion in goods in 2014. \nIn Colorado, 48 percent of all goods were exported in 2014.\n  Over 260,000 jobs are derived from trade with nations represented by \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiating group. The TPP represents an \nopportunity for Colorado to create nearly 4,000 new jobs, and that is \njust a start.\n  So today's conversation is not just a vote on whether we will have \nmore delay on an important bill; this is about something that \nrepresents far greater opportunity than that. The fact is, over the \npast several years we have focused our time on the Middle East, and \nrightfully so, but as our day-to-day attention gets grabbed by the \nMiddle East, our long-term interests lie in Asia and the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership region.\n  So I hope today that Members will put aside tendencies to decide they \nwant to play politics with the trade promotion authority and instead, \nindeed, pursue policies that will give us a chance to grow our economy, \nto make more products representative with the symbol and the label \n``Made in America.'' That is the chance we have today--to give our \nworkers a competitive advantage, to create an opportunity for increased \ntrade in an area of the world where we face increasing competition and \nregional threats, to show that the United States will indeed be a part \nof a region in the world that represents so much opportunity.\n  As we have seen increases in Colorado and beyond in trade and trade \nopportunities, this bill represents a chance for us to continue \nimproving our ability to grow Colorado's economy and Colorado trade.\n  So to our colleagues across the Senate, I indeed hope that we will \ninvoke cloture today, that we will move forward on debate, and that we \nwill have an opportunity to continue our work to support trade and to \nmove toward passage of the final TPP.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The trade package we are considering today is missing important \nprovisions that support American companies and American workers. We \ncannot have trade promotion without trade enforcement. Even supporters \nof fast-track and TPP--those cheerleaders, the most outspoken \ncheerleaders for free trade--even those supporters acknowledge there \nwill be winners and losers from this agreement.\n  Past deals show how widespread the losses will be. Travel the State \nthe Presiding Officer and I represent in the Senate and look at what \nNAFTA has done, look at what PNTR with China has done, look at what the \nCentral America Free Trade Agreement has done, and look at what the \nSouth Korea trade agreement has done to us.\n  It would be a tragedy if the Senate acted and failed to help the \nAmerican companies and the American workers and the communities that we \nacknowledge will be hurt by TPP. In other words, we take an action in \nthis body, working with the administration, and there are losers and \nwinners from this action. The losers are those who lose their jobs, the \nsmall businesses that go out of business, and the communities that get \nhurt by this. Those are the losers. How do you ignore them when it \ncomes to these trade agreements?\n  By excluding two of the four bills from the initial trade package, we \nare excluding critical bipartisan provisions that protect workers and \nensure strong trade enforcement.\n  We need to make sure that our steel manufacturers and other companies \nin our country are protected from unfair dumping. That is why I \nintroduced--along with my colleagues, Senators Portman, Casey, Burr, \nBennet, and Coats--the Leveling the Playing Field Act. We included it \nin the Customs and Border Protection reauthorization with bipartisan \nsupport. It would strengthen enforcement of trade laws. It would \nincrease the ability of industries--such as the steel industry, which \nis so important in my State--to fight back against unfair trade \npractices. It passed the Senate Finance Committee, but in the majority \nleader's package and Senator Hatch's package, it is nowhere to be found \non the floor today.\n  We need to make sure strong currency provisions are included. The \nFinance Committee overwhelmingly supported my amendment 18 to 8. We had \nthe support of Republican colleagues: Senators Portman, Grassley, \nCrapo, Roberts, Burr, Isakson--who is sitting in the Chamber--and \nScott. Again, this provision, which passed the Finance Committee \noverwhelmingly, ensures a level playing field for American businesses. \nIt is nowhere to be found in the majority leader's package on the floor \ntoday.\n  Finally, any trade package needs to ensure we are not importing \nproducts made with child labor. That is why the Finance Committee \npassed an amendment with overwhelming bipartisan support to close a 75-\nyear-old loophole that allowed products made with forced labor and \nchild labor into this country. For 75 years, that loophole stood. We \npassed that amendment 21 to 5. We had the support of Republican \ncolleagues: Senators Grassley, Crapo, Roberts, Cornyn, Thune, Toomey, \nPortman, Coats, and Heller. But, again, this bipartisan provision is \nnowhere to be found in the majority leader's package.\n  That is why I call on my Republican colleagues--many of whom I have \nnamed; almost every one on them on the Finance Committee--who have \nvoted for either the currency amendment or the level the playing field \namendment or the prohibition on child labor amendment. Some Republican \nmembers of the Finance Committee voted for all three of those \namendments, but they are not in the package.\n  I am hopeful my Republican colleagues will join Democratic colleagues \nto vote no on cloture so we can bring a package to the floor that does \ntrade promotion authority, that takes cares of workers, and also takes \ncare of enforcing trade rules.\n  The trade package which passed out of the Finance Committee is far \nfrom perfect. I still have grave concerns about fast-track. I know what \nbad trade rules have done to my State. There is a reason these \nprovisions were included in the trade package. The Senate should \nconsider all four of them. Majority Leader McConnell says he wants to \nrespect committee work on legislation. Well, here is his chance.\n  The only way to get these important provisions to the President's \ndesk is to combine all four into one. We have done it in the past. Keep \nin mind, every time Congress does major trade laws--2002 fast-track \nincluded provisions on enforcement, and it included provisions to help \nworkers through trade adjustment assistance; the same thing in 1988 in \nthe trade package; the same thing in 1974 in the trade package. Why \nwould we bifurcate this? Why would we take out enforcement when that is \na very important part of trade?\n  We should not move forward with any trade package that does not \ninclude all four bills. I ask my colleagues in both parties, those who \nsupported\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nour enforcement efforts in both parties in Finance, to join us and vote \nno on cloture when we take the vote in the next few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum call be charged evenly to both parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, a few moments ago, we heard an argument \nthat this envisioned trade agreement will increase the number of \nproducts that are stamped ``Made in America,'' ``Made in the United \nStates of America.'' Certainly that is the argument that has been put \nforward for trade agreement after trade agreement after trade \nagreement.\n  The first step in the process is to say: Look at those markets. \nWouldn't it be wonderful in that nation if we had direct access, \nimproved access?\n  Particularly, we have done a series of agreements with very low-wage, \nlow-environmental standards, low-enforcement nations. Well, that is the \nfirst stage.\n  Then the second stage becomes: Now that we have this broader \nconnection, we are competing with products made in that country, so we \nbetter make sure we open a factory there as well. And then suddenly, \ninstead of those products coming from the United States to a foreign \nnation, in fact, those products are being made in that foreign nation.\n  Then comes stage three: Oh, now that we are making those products \noverseas at a much lower price because of the lower wages and lower \nenvironmental standards and lower enforcement, it does not make sense \nto make those products in the United States anymore.\n  So that is how we lost 5 million manufacturing jobs in America. That \nis how we lost 50,000 factories in America. So for those who want to \nput forward the chimera, the illusion, the mirage that somehow this is \ngoing to increase American production, American citizens should know, \nin fact, that is a false promise--a false promise that has been put out \ntime after time after time and shown to be wrong again and again and \nagain.\n  Let's think about this: Why would you pave a path to put the workers \nin your State directly in competition with workers earning 60 cents an \nhour? Tell me that is advantageous to making things in your nation, and \nI will tell you, you are wrong.\n  So let's not go down a path in which we pave a highway to essentially \ndestroy American manufacturing, to disrupt American manufacturing, to \ndecrease the competitiveness of living wages here in the United States \nof America. Let's enhance and strengthen our position in the world, not \nundermine it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the remaining 2\\1/2\\ minutes we have, I \nwant to take a few seconds of it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed. All this does \nis get us on the bill. We need to have a robust debate about the trade \nagenda, and I am willing to do that. Of course, the centerpiece is \nTPA--no question about it. I know our staffs have been working together \nto find a path forward on Enforce Customs.\n  This is an important bill, and we need to get it through the Senate, \nbut to do that, we need to begin debate today.\n  Trade promotion authority is the key to our economic future. I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will stand with me and \nPresident Obama and vote yes so we may update and modernize our trade \nlaws, including TPA, and help lay the groundwork for a healthy economy \nfor our children and our grandchildren.\n  Ninety-five percent of the world's trade is outside of our country. \nTrade produces better salaries--13 to 18 percent. We have worked \nthrough all the problems in the committee. We have had plenty of \namendments, lots of debate, and we put this on the floor with the \nunderstanding that it would be voted on.\n  Mr. BROWN. Would the Finance chair yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. My time is just about gone, but go ahead.\n  Mr. BROWN. I would just ask, the four bills that we passed in \ncommittee--African growth and opportunity, trade adjustment assistance, \ntrade promotion authority, and the Customs bill--all passed out of \ncommittee by strong bipartisan majorities, right, and we hoped at the \ntime they would come together in the motion to proceed to a vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand the question. They passed out with an \nunderstanding between the vice chairman of the committee and me that we \nwould vote on them separately but would move TPA and TAA--which most \nRepublicans hate--we would move them together, and then we would move \nthe third one, and then we would move the fourth one. It was supposed \nto be done that way because everybody knew that putting the Schumer \namendment on the one bill would not be acceptable in the House and \nwould not be acceptable to the President, and that is the problem here. \nWe all are prepared to have a vote on that bill, but the agreement was \nthat we would vote individually on all four bills. Finally, we agreed \nto do TPA and TAA because your side was concerned about whether this \nside would allow TAA to go through. There never had been a question \nthat we were willing to do that even though most of us hate that bill.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I object.\n  Mr. BURR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. If we could get a minute, too, I would be happy to have \nthat. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 1314, an act to amend the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 to provide for the right to an administrative \n     appeal relating to adverse determinations of tax-exempt \n     status of certain organizations.\n         Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker, Joni Ernst, Bill Cassidy, \n           John Cornyn, Thad Cochran, Shelley Moore Capito, Deb \n           Fischer, John McCain, James Lankford, Patrick J. \n           Toomey, Roy Blunt, Ron Johnson, Pat Roberts, David \n           Perdue, David Vitter, Ben Sasse.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are always limits to what can be accomplished when the \nAmerican people choose divided government, but of course it does not \nmean Washington should not work toward bipartisan solutions that make \nsense for our country. Trade offers a perfect opportunity to do just \nthat. We on this side believe strongly in lifting up the middle class \nand knocking down unfair barriers that discriminate against American \nworkers and American products in the 21st century.\n  On this issue, the President agrees. So we worked in good faith all \nyear--all year long--to formulate a package that both parties could \nsupport. The top Republican on the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, \nengaged in months of good-faith negotiations with the top Democrat on \nthe committee, Senator Wyden. They consulted closely with colleagues \nover in the House such as Chairman Ryan. They consulted closely with \nPresident Obama, with Democrats, with Republicans.\n  The issues they had to work through were tough. Difficult concessions \nhad to be made. Many believed an agreement would never emerge, but in \nthe end a strong bipartisan trade package came together that was able \nto pass through the committee by an overwhelming margin of 20 to 6--20 \nto 6. It was a significant win for the people we represent. It was a \nwin for the Americans who look to us to secure economic growth and good \njobs for them, not give in to the special interests who, apparently, \nwould rather see those jobs end up in countries like China.\n  It was a win for the security of our country and for our leadership \naround the world. The Secretary of Defense, for example, was at lunch \nwith Republicans today talking about the importance to our \nrepositioning to the Pacific, from a defense and foreign policy point \nof view, to get TPP. He was accompanied by seven--not at our lunch, but \nseven former Defense Secretaries of both parties said this just last \nweek, ``The stakes are clear and America's prestige, influence and \nleadership are on the line.''\n  So the rationale for voting yes today, a vote that would have simply \nallowed the Senate to debate the issue, was overwhelming. It was \nsupported by the facts, and yet voices in the President's party who \nrail against the future won out today. I do not routinely quote \nPresident Obama, but today is no ordinary day. So when the President \nsaid, ``The hard left is just making stuff up,'' when the President \nsaid their increasingly bizarre arguments didn't ``stand the test of \nfact and scrutiny,'' it was hard to argue with him.\n  ``You don't make change through slogans,'' the President reminded his \nadversaries on this issue. ``You don't make change through ignoring \nrealities.''\n  I think that is something worth reflecting on.\n  Now this doesn't have to be the end of the story. Trade has \ntraditionally been a bipartisan issue that cuts across the partisan \ndivide. I suspect we have colleagues on the other side who aren't that \ncomfortable filibustering economic benefits for their constituents or a \nPresident who leads their party.\n  What we have just witnessed is that the Democratic Senate shut down \nthe opportunity to debate the top economic priority of the Democratic \nPresident of the United States.\n  I suspect some may be parking their vote, rather than buying the \noutlandish rhetoric we have heard from the left. Certainly, that is my \nhope.\n  But to get the best outcome for the country, we have to be realistic. \nFor instance, the idea that any Senator can make a guarantee that a \nparticular bill will be enacted into law is simply impossible.\n  I assure you that we would have had a different outcome on today's \ncloture motion if Senators actually wielded the power to force things \nthrough by sheer will alone. Obviously, we don't. What we can guarantee \nis that Senators receive a fair shake once we proceed to the debate our \ncountry deserves on a 21st century American trade agenda.\n  We will have an open and fair amendment process. How many times have \nI said that this year? That is what we intend to do when we get on TPA. \nFor my part, I can restate my commitment to processing TPA, TAA, and \nother policies that Chairman Hatch and Senator Wyden can agree to.\n  The Senate has historically been a place where our country debates \nand considers big issues. This is an issue worthy of our consideration. \nYet today we have voted to not even consider it. It doesn't mean we can \npredetermine outcomes. It doesn't mean we can even guarantee the \nsuccessful passage of legislation once we proceed to debate it. We \ncan't make those kinds of guarantees that the other side was saying are \npreconditions to even considering the President's No. 1 domestic \npriority.\n  But blocking the Senate from even having a debate of such an \nimportant issue is not the answer. Senators who do so are choosing to \nstand with special interests and against the American jobs that \nknocking down more unfair trade barriers could support.\n  So I sure hope that some of our colleagues across the aisle will heed \nthe words of President Obama and rethink their choice. I hope they will \nvote with us to open debate on this issue.\n  Let me reiterate. We will continue to engage with both sides. We will \ncontinue to engage with both sides. We will have an open amendment \nprocess. We will continue to cooperate in the same spirit that got us \nthrough so many impossible hurdles already in getting this bill to the \nfloor.\n  This was no small accomplishment to get it as far as it has come, \ngiven the various points of view on the Finance Committee. Chairman \nHatch and Senator Wyden deserve a lot of credit for that. But they \ndidn't go through all of that to stall out on the floor before we have \nthe chance to do something important for the American people.\n  So I hope that folks on the other side who are preventing this debate \nwill seriously consider the implications. Other countries are taking a \nlook at us. They are wondering whether we can deliver. We hear TPP is \nclose to being finalized, and here is the headline they see--that every \nsingle one--with one exception, I believe--of the President's own party \nin the Senate prevented the mechanism for having trade considered, \nprevented it from even coming to the Senate floor. That is not the kind \nof headline that we want to send around the world--that America cannot \nbe depended upon, that America cannot deliver trade agreements. To our \nallies in the Pacific that are apprehensive about the Chinese--and who \nthought this was not only good for\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\ntheir commerce but good for their security--what kind of message does \nthat send?\n  So I moved to reconsider. Hopefully, it will be an opportunity for \npeople to think this over, and we will be able to come together and go \nforward on a bipartisan basis to achieve an important accomplishment \nfor the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the majority leader, has one \nperson to blame for our not being on the floor now debating this \nimportant piece of legislation, and that person is the majority leader. \nThe next time he looks in the mirror, he can understand who is \nresponsible for not having debate, as he said, with robust amendments. \nIt is he.\n  The reason for this situation we are in today is very simple. The \nFinance Committee reported four bills out by a large, bipartisan vote \nof the Finance Committee. The majority leader decided, on his own, that \nhe would consider two of those and that the others would have to figure \nout some other way to get done.\n  As the Republican leader said this morning in his opening statement, \nlet's move to those two bills, and then we will start the amendment \nprocess. Do all four and start the amendment process. It is very \nlogical.\n  It is illogical what he is saying. Why should we only do two of the \nfour reported out of the Finance Committee? It doesn't make sense.\n  Now, my friend the Republican leader is very aware of motions to \nproceed. During the last 4 years, because of the Republicans' cynical \napproach to government, they basically defeated everything we tried to \ndo while not allowing us to proceed on legislation. However, we are \nsaying we are willing to work with you on this legislation. We don't \nwant to stop moving forward on this bill. We think, though, the bill \nshould be what was reported out of the Finance Committee. That seems \nthe fair thing to do.\n  That is all we ask--a path forward, a realistic path for all of us to \nproceed on this legislation. If we are stuck here, it is too bad. We \nshouldn't be.\n  I say to my friend the Republican leader, I am always available to \nspeak with him--here, telephone, my office, his office--to figure a way \nforward on this legislation.\n  I have stated the last week or so that the way we should go forward \nis to have all four of the measures that came out of the Finance \nCommittee lumped together and start legislating on those--to have, in \nthe words of the Republican leader, a robust amendment process on those \nbills as lumped together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, obviously the most sensitive political \nissue surrounding this is the currency issue. I want to make sure \neverybody has a clear understanding of where we are on that.\n  In committee a Senator stated: I explicitly did not offer the \ncurrency amendment to the TPA bill. We were told that it would not be a \npart--if it were a part of TPA, we all know it would kill it, the \nPresident wouldn't sign the bill. So my goal is not to use currency to \nkill the TPA bill and not to kill the TPA bill, it is to get currency \npassed. That is why we offered it to the Customs bill, a separate bill, \non the strong view that no one disputed in committee--no one disputed \nthis in committee--that we would get a vote separately--separately, I \nrepeat--on the Customs bill on the floor and that it would come to the \nfloor just like the other bills.\n  As for currency, in the committee they agreed they would deal with it \non the Customs bill and not on TPA. And now our friends on the other \nside are trying to bunch it all together.\n  But look, we need to be clear. The currency issue on TPA is a killer. \nThe President would veto the bill. It would defeat the bill. That is \nwhy in committee they sensibly reached the conclusion to deal with \ncurrency on the Customs bill. So I want to be clear about that. So when \nwe get on the bill, everybody will understand the significance of that \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one word before my friend from Oregon is \nrecognized--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that is exactly what Senator Schumer \nsaid in committee, what I just read. That was what Senator Schumer said \nin committee. It was not clear from my notes who said it, but that is \nexactly what Senator Schumer said in committee:\n\n       And, explicitly I did not offer the currency amendment to \n     the TPA bill. We were told that it would not be part--if it \n     were part of TPA it might kill it.\n\n  Senator Schumer:\n\n       My goal is not to use currency to kill the TPA bill and not \n     to kill the TPA bill, it's to get currency passed.\n\n  Senator Schumer, further:\n\n       And that's why we offered it to the customs bill, on the \n     view, strong view, that no one disputed in committee that \n     we'd get a vote separately on the customs bill on the floor, \n     that it would come to the floor just like the other bills.\n\n  That is Senator Schumer in committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Schumer has been involved in the \ncurrency issue from basically the time he came to the Senate. It has \nbeen an important issue for him, and he can speak for himself.\n  I am not an expert on the bill, and I don't intend to debate anyone \nhere on the merits of the bill. People know how I feel about the \nlegislation generally, but I am kind of an expert on the procedural \naspect of what goes on around here.\n  I suggest the best way to move forward is to come up with a program \nto have all of these bills discussed at the same time, and that is why \nwe have felt the way we did and we indicated that in the vote we just \ntook. So I think everybody should just take a deep breath, and I think \nthere are probably ways we can move forward with this without \ndisparaging either side.\n  I think the vote was important, procedurally. We, as a minority--as \nthe Republican leader certainly can understand, having been in the \nminority for a number of years--I think we would be better off with the \nminority having a say in what goes on in this body.\n  That is the way we spoke today. We believe that, and we look forward \nto continuing the process of moving forward on this bill. We cannot be \ndebating the merits of this legislation unless we figure out some way \nto move forward, and right now that process is not looking very good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator briefly yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nbill manager, the ranking member of the Finance Committee is recognized \nto speak, that I be recognized to speak, and that following me, the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee be recognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the majority leader has entered a motion to \nreconsider the trade legislation. I want to be clear, both for the \nmajority leader and all our colleagues here, that I am very interested \nin working with the majority leader and our colleague from the other \nside of the aisle to find a bipartisan path to get back to the trade \nlegislation at the earliest possible time.\n  This morning, 14 protrade Democrats met, and I can assure all the \nSenators here that these are Senators who are committed--strongly \ncommitted--to ensuring that this bill passes.\n  Now, with respect to just another brief description about where we \nare, all the hard work that the majority leader correctly described as \ngoing on in connection with this legislation has been about four bills: \nthe trade promotion act, Customs--which is really trade enforcement to \nhelp displaced workers--and then trade preferences for developing \ncountries.\n  Just briefly, I want to describe why it was so important for Senators \non a bipartisan basis in the Finance Committee to tackle these issues.\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\n  The first, trade promotion authority, helps strip the secrecy out of \ntrade policy. The second is the support system for American workers. \nThis is known as trade adjustment assistance, which has been expanded. \nThe third finally puts our trade enforcement policies into high gear so \nAmerica can crack down on the trade cheats. The fourth renews trade \nprograms that are crucial to American manufacturers. Together, these \nbills would form a legislative package that throws out the 1990s NAFTA \nplaybook on trade. It is an opportunity to enact fresh, middle-class \ntrade policies that will create high-skill, high-wage jobs in Oregon \nand across our land. That opportunity is lost if this package of four \nbills gets winnowed down to two.\n  In particular, dropping the enforcement bill in my view is \nlegislative malpractice. The calculation is quite simple. The Finance \nCommittee gave the Senate a bipartisan trade enforcement bill that will \nprotect American jobs and promote American exports, which are two \npropositions that I believe every Member of this body supports. The \nenforcement legislation closes a shameful loophole that allows for \nproducts made with forced and child labor to be sold in our country. \nThis is 2015, and there is absolutely no room for a loophole that \nallows slavery in American trade policies. If the decision is made to \ndrop this bipartisan legislation, that shameful loophole would live on.\n  Now, any Senator who goes home and speaks, as I do, about the virtues \nof job-creating trade policies has, in my view, a special obligation to \nensure that American trade enforcement is tough, effective, and built \non American values. That is what the Finance Committee's bipartisan \nenforcement bill is all about. Without proper enforcement, no trade \ndeal can ever live up to the hype. This enforcement bill is a jobs \nbill, plain and simple, and it needs to get to the President's desk.\n  Some elements of this package represent priorities that have \ntraditionally belonged to Republicans. Other elements are traditionally \nDemocratic. But taken as a whole, this is a bipartisan package that \nboth sides of the Finance Committee supported strongly, with the \nunderstanding that its component parts would be linked together. You \ncan't make this stool stand up with just two legs.\n  The Senate should not begin debate until there is a clear path \nforward for each of these four bills, and I use that word specifically \nbecause I have talked with colleagues about it. We are going to work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion. That is what Chairman Hatch and I \nhave done since he became chairman, and I have been grateful to him \nbecause that is the way he sought to carry out his responsibilities \nwhen I was chairman. We are going to work together, but the challenge \nhas always been to find a clear path forward for each of these four \nbills.\n  So I urge my colleagues to continue down the Finance Committee's \nbipartisan route and find a path that moves all four of these bills \nforward.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate that with the majority leader having \nentered into a motion to have the trade bill reconsidered, I want to \nexpress to my colleagues--and I see several Finance members here, \nChairman Hatch and Senator Cornyn, a senior member of the committee, a \nmember of the leadership--that I am very interested in working closely \nwith both of them to find a bipartisan path and get back to this \nlegislation just as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chairman \nof the Finance Committee be recognized and then I be recognized \nfollowing his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kindness in \ndoing that.\n  I listened to the debate, and I have to say I am very disappointed.\n  Everybody knew that Senator Schumer accommodated us--the ranking \nmember and myself--in putting the language on the Customs bill. In \nfact, here is what Senator Schumer said:\n\n       And, explicitly I did not offer the currency amendment to \n     the TPA bill. We were told that it would not be part--if it \n     were part of TPA it might kill it. My goal is not to use \n     currency to kill the TPA bill and not to kill the TPA bill, \n     it's to get currency passed. And that's why we offered it to \n     the customs bill, on the view, strong view, that no one \n     disputed in committee that we'd get a vote separately on the \n     customs bill on the floor, that it would come to the floor \n     just like the other bills.\n\n  That was the agreement. The distinguished Senator from Oregon knows \nthat was the agreement; that we were going to lump the two together, \nthe TPA and TAA--although I would have preferred to have those voted on \nseparately, but we agreed to do that because there was a concern on the \nDemocratic side that maybe we wouldn't put TAA out. That was a \nridiculous concern because we know TPA can't pass unless you give the \nunions what they want on TAA. So we grit our teeth and we were willing \nto do that. We put them together so we could accommodate again. And it \nwas completely understood that the AGOA bill, the next two bills, would \nbe voted on separately. Senator Schumer knew, and said so; that he \nrealized it would give the House a very, very bad stomachache because \nthey probably couldn't put this bill through with that language on it.\n  I even agreed with Senator Schumer that we could have hearings later. \nHe could bring up a bill. We would have hearings. We would have a \nmarkup on the currency matters because there are a lot of people who \nwould like to see something done on currency--but not to destroy the \nTPA bill or, should I say, all of the negotiations that this \nadministration has been conducting with regard to TPP--the Trans-\nPacific Partnership--with 11 nations, including Japan, which has always \nbeen difficult to get to the table because they have very great \nconcerns there, but they were willing to come to the table. And it \nmight ruin TTIP, which is 28 nations in Europe.\n  Forty to sixty percent of all trade in the world would come through \nthese two agreements that would be done by the Trade Representative, \nsubject to the review by Congress provided in TPA, which happens to be \nthe procedural mechanism pursuant to which we can assert congressional \ncontrol over these foreign policy agreements, these trade agreements.\n  So there was no agreement to bring these up all at one time. The \nfirst time I heard that was, I think, yesterday or the day before, and \nI was flabbergasted. To have our colleagues vote against cloture on a \nbill the President wants more than any other bill, after he talked to \nthem, is astounding to me.\n  So I am going to take a moment to talk about what transpired this \nafternoon because I think it warrants further discussion.\n  As I stated this morning, with today's vote, we were trying to do \nsomething good for the American people, to advance our Nation's trade \nagenda and to provide good jobs for American workers, all of which \nwould happen should we get this through both Houses of Congress and the \nPresident signs it into law.\n  Now, to do that, we can't have killer amendments put on bills that \neverybody knows will kill it and that the President can't sign. I know \npeople disagree with us on how we intended to get there. That much was \nclear from the outset. Sadly, these colleagues--who have always been \nagainst TPA--were unwilling to have a discussion about their \ndisagreements in a fair and open debate, and, I have to say, that was \nall of them on the other side today. Instead, they voted this afternoon \nto prevent any such debate from taking place.\n  We are willing to debate, we are willing to have amendments, but I am \nalso only willing to abide by the agreement we have with Senator \nSchumer with regard to the Customs bill. That was the agreement, and I \ncompliment Senator Schumer for being willing to put it on there because \nhe knew it would kill TPA.\n  Needless to say, I am disappointed by this outcome.\n  While we are talking about trade policy at large, the bill receiving \nthe most attention was, of course, the TPA bill, which is bipartisan. I \nmade sure it was bipartisan--that we could work together, that we could \ncome together, that we could all basically feel good about it--and it \npassed 20 to 6, which is astounding to even me. I didn't know\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nwe would get seven Democrats on the bill, and I compliment the \ndistinguished ranking member for working hard to get seven Democrats on \nthe bill. But still, that doesn't take away the fact that the minority \nleader and others don't want any bill at all.\n  While we are talking about trade policy at large, I would just say \nthe bill receiving the most attention was, of course, the TPA bill, \nwhich is bipartisan, supported by Republicans and Democrats in both the \nHouse and the Senate, by the way, not to mention the President of the \nUnited States and his administration.\n  On April 22, the bill was voted out of the Senate Finance Committee \nby a historic vote of 20 to 6, with seven Democrats on the committee \nvoting to report the bill. The bill which was President Obama's top \nlegislative priority, by the way, was riding a wave of amendments \nheaded to the floor. Yet, today, the mere thought of even debating this \nbill was apparently too much for my Democratic colleagues to bear. \nNothing changed. It is the same bill we reported out of committee. I \ncan remember the happy time we had talking about how wonderful it was \nto finally get this bill out of the committee, after going to 10 p.m. \none night and actually beyond that for staff.\n  This is the same bill we have been talking about for months. The only \nthing that was different today than just a few days ago was the \nstrategy being employed by the opposition.\n  As we all know, the TPA bill wasn't the only trade bill reported out \nof the Finance Committee in April. We also reported a bill to \nreauthorize Trade Adjustment Assistance, a bill to reauthorize some \ntrade preference programs and a Customs and Enforcement bill.\n  A few days before we were to begin the floor debate on trade policy, \nwe heard rumblings from our colleagues on the other side, and we \nstarted hearing statements from some Senators, including some who had \ngenerally been supportive of TPA, that they would only support the \npending motion to proceed if they had assurances that all four bills--\nTPA, TAA, preferences, and Customs--would be debated and passed at the \nsame time. That never was the agreement, and everybody understood that. \nThese new demands brought forward at the eleventh hour were problematic \nfor a number of reasons, most notably because, as reported out of the \nFinance Committee, the Customs bill faces a number of problems both \nwith the White House and the House of Representatives, and my friends \non the other side realized that in this bipartisan effort that we were \nmaking together. They recognized that there were problems for both the \nWhite House and House of Representatives that would prevent it from \nbeing enacted into law any time soon. I will not detail all the \nproblems, but I think most of my colleagues know what they are. But I \nwill say that those problems existed from the beginning and we knew \nabout them at the outset. We had people on the committee who were \ntotally opposed to this bill. I made sure they had a right to bring up \ntheir amendments. I respect them. I don't agree with them. I can't even \nagree on how they ever reached the positions that they do. But the fact \nis they have a right to do that, and we protected that right.\n  Now, I might say these problems existed from the beginning. We knew \nabout them from the onset. That is why the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee and I agreed at our markup to move our four trade \nbills separately.\n  As one of the principal authors of three of the four trade bills, I \nwant to be very clear because there has apparently been some confusion \non this point. There was never a plan to move all four of these bills \ntogether or as part of TPA.\n  While we agreed that TPA and TAA would have to move on parallel \ntracks--we did agree to that--there was no such agreement with regard \nto the other bills, only a commitment that we would do our best to try \nto get all four enacted into law, with no guarantees that they would be \nbut to do our very best.\n  The agreement with TPA and TAA was honored. Both the majority leader \nand I made clear today that if cloture was invoked on the motion to \nproceed, we would file a substitute amendment that included both of \nthese bills--TPA and TAA.\n  We also made commitments--commitments I had already made--to work \nwith our colleagues to find a path forward on the Customs and the \npreferences legislation. But that was not enough, apparently. We have \nhad numerous discussions regarding alternative paths for other trade \nbills. That was not enough, either. The only thing they would accept \nwas full inclusion of all the trade bills at the outset of the debate. \nWe could not agree to that, and they knew it.\n  Of course, to be fair, some of the Democrats were not necessarily \ninsisting that the four bills be part of the same package. Instead, \nthey just wanted guarantees that all of them would be enacted into law. \nThat is not the way it works around here.\n  I do not even know how to comment on that. It is, to put it bluntly, \nsimply absurd to think that a Senate leader can guarantee any bill will \nbecome law before a debate even begins. Yet those were the demands we \nfaced over the last few days. Although they were obviously impossible, \nwe worked in good faith to try to reach an accommodation with those \nwho--in my opinion--were not working in good faith. And I am willing to \nforgive that. Even then, there was no path to yes.\n  Of course, as we all know that the idea for demanding a ``four bills \nor no bills'' strategy did not originate in the Finance Committee. This \ndemand materialized last week and came directly from the Senate \nDemocratic leadership, virtually all of whom oppose TPA and their \nPresident on this bill, outright. Sadly, it seems they were able to \nsell this idea to other Members of their caucus, including more than a \nfew who should know better.\n  We were never talking about reaching an agreement with people who \nwanted a path forward on good trade legislation. We have been talking \nabout an idea devised for the sole purpose of stopping progress on TPA. \nAt least for today, it appears they have been successful.\n  Once again, I am disappointed. A lot of work has gone into this \neffort in both the Senate and the House of Representatives--not to \nmention the administration. I, personally, have been at this from the \nvery moment I took over as the lead Republican on the Senate Finance \nCommittee in January 2011.\n  In January 2014--more than a year ago--I introduced legislation with \nthe former chairmen, Max Baucus and Dave Camp, that formed the basis of \nthe bill that we had hoped to start debating this week. Both Baucus and \nCamp were committed to this effort. Sadly, Chairman Camp retired and \nChairman Baucus was sent off to China.\n  When Senator Wyden took over the committee, I worked with him to \naddress his concerns about the bill, and that work continued after I \ntook over as chairman this year. Even though I thought some of his \nproposals were unworkable, I bent over backwards to accommodate his \ndesires, because in the end, I thought it would broaden support for \nTPA, and I wanted to please him, as my partner on the committee.\n  Chairman Ryan joined us in this effort, and we did all we could to \nput together a bill and a path forward that both parties could support. \nWe met with Chairman Ryan regularly. Until the last few days and the \nadvent of these new demands materializing out of whole cloth, I thought \nwe had been successful. Even after these new demands came up, I did my \nbest to find an agreement, working right up to the vote to find a \nreasonable path forward. But, apparently, something reasonable was not \nin the cards.\n  Everyone here knows I am an optimist. I still believe we can get \nsomething done, that we can work something out. I have told the \nPresident the same. I am still willing to do what it takes to pass \nthese bills. I hope my colleagues will see the light here and come to \nthe table with some realistic alternatives for a path forward. Until \nthat happens, the President is going to have to wait on these trade \nagreements, as will all the farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and other \njob creators in our country who desperately need market access and a \nlevel international playing field in order to compete.\n  In the future, if we see a sharp decline in U.S. agriculture and \nmanufacturing and if the United States retreats\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nfrom the world, ceding the Asia-Pacific region, in particular, to \nChina's overwhelming economic influence, people may very well look back \nat today's events and wonder why we could not get our act together. I \nam already thinking that. Why couldn't we get our act together?\n  I certainly hope that does not happen--that these other nations--\nparticularly China--take advantage of our not getting our act together. \nPerhaps, in my frustration, I am being a little dramatic. Still, I have \nno doubt that some will come to regret what went on here today--one way \nor another.\n  As for me, I have no regrets. I have done all I can to get these \nimportant bills across the finish line. I am going to continue to do \nall I can in the future to get these bills across the finish line.\n  Unfortunately, after today, it is very unclear how many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to do the same. I \nbelieve there are honest, good people on that side of the aisle who \nwant to make this right, who want to make up for what happened here \ntoday. I feel confident that is so. I am going to proceed on the basis \nthat that is so. I sure hope it is so because, my gosh, to put this \nNation's foreign policy--especially in the Asia-Pacific region, in \nparticular--on hold when we could be building relationships in these \ncountries as never before and at the same time spurring on \ninternational trade as never before is a matter of grave concern to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, who I know has labored long and hard to get this \nbill where it is today. I know how disappointed he is at the filibuster \nby our friends across the aisle on the President's No. 1 domestic \npriority.\n  I have heard it said that the U.S. economy is just one or two steps \naway--a few policy choices away--from awakening that slumbering giant \nknown as the U.S. economy and growing it for the benefit of all \nAmericans. Unfortunately, the filibuster that occurred today is a \nbackwards step.\n  I know there are some people that say to Republicans: Why would you \nwant to work with President Obama? The truth of the matter is that is \nwhat we are here for, if we agree on the principle. We are not here to \nagree with him just to agree with him. As a matter of fact, sometimes \nit is easier to go back home and say: Well, I disagreed with the \nPresident.\n  But this is one area where the President of the United States is \nabsolutely correct. We are here not to do what he wants us to do, but \nwe are here to do what our constituents--what the American people--want \nus to do. What they want is the better jobs, the improved wages, the \nsort of robust economic growth that comes along with trade agreements.\n  It has been said numerous times, but I will say it again: 95 percent \nof the world lies out beyond our borders; 80 percent of the purchasing \npower in the world lies beyond the borders of the United States. Why in \nthe world would we not want to open markets to the things that we grow, \nthat our ranchers raise, and that our manufacturers make? Why in the \nworld would we not want to do it?\n  You will have to ask our colleagues across the aisle, who today, with \nthe exception of one Democrat, chose to filibuster this bill. I am \nintrigued to hear the numbers that were mentioned earlier: 14 protrade \nDemocrats--14. I guess that means there are at least 32 antitrade \nDemocrats. But I must say, on this side of the aisle, we are by and \nlarge a protrade party--for the very reasons that I mentioned earlier. \nWe would like to work with anybody--including the President of the \nUnited States--to try to get our economy growing again, to open markets \nto the things that we make and grow and manufacture here in the United \nStates, because it benefits the entire country, including hard-working \nfamilies.\n  The irony is that last week the Senate overwhelmingly voted on a bill \nthat would guarantee Congress the time and opportunity to review a \npotential agreement between President Obama and Iran. That bill passed \n98 to 1 and will prevent implementation by the President until the \nAmerican people, through their elected representatives, are given the \nchance to scrutinize, study, and debate that particular agreement and \nvote on it up or down. So far, the so-called deal or framework has been \nincredibly vague, and I think it is important that we understand what \nis in it.\n  You can imagine that if we voted 98 to 1 to require the President to \nlay before the American people this important negotiation with Iran, \nwhy it is so strange that our Democratic friends do not want us to \nparticipate in the same process by which to vote up or down on trade \nagreements.\n  Trade promotion authority, historically, has had bipartisan support \nhere in the Chamber. By the way, this is not just something that will \nbe extended for the next 20 months of President Obama's administration. \nThis will be extended 6 years into the Presidency of the next President \nof the United States.\n  The Chairman mentioned that this legislation sailed through the \nFinance Committee by a wide margin of 20 to 6. And, of course, as I \nsaid--and I will say it again--it is supported by the administration, \nby President Obama's administration.\n  It is very strange to see Democrats blocking a bill supported by the \nleader of their political party, the President of the United States. \nThe excuses they gave here today are that all of a sudden they woke up \nand decided that the deal that Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch agreed \nto--which is to combine trade promotion authority with trade adjustment \nassistance--was not good enough and they wanted to renegotiate the \ndeal.\n  I think, from my perspective, there are really two types of folks in \nthe camp across the aisle. There are those who, perhaps, would like to \nget to yes, and that means that you can have a negotiation and try to \nfind a way to get to yes. But I can only gather from what was said \nearlier that there are probably 32 Senators on that side of the aisle \nwho are antitrade. They are not interested in getting to yes. What they \ndo is they throw up phony barriers, such as this attempt to renegotiate \nthe package that was brought here to the floor. This is sort of typical \nobstructionism.\n  We saw this happen in the antitrafficking legislation as well, when a \npiece of legislation passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously and came to the floor. And then all of a sudden, someone \nwoke up and said: Well, we did not read the bill, and now we object.\n  This trade tool will give Congress the opportunity to examine any \nupcoming deal that the President is trying to cut and make sure--we \nmake sure; we do not take the President's word for it. We make sure the \nAmerican people get a fair shake.\n  Many of the provisions in trade promotion authority are common sense \nand they are nonpartisan. For example, if passed, TPA would give \nCongress the authority to read the full text of the trade agreement. It \nis hard to argue that this is a bad thing. It is hard to get more \nstraightforward than that, but we have no guarantee without this \nprovision.\n  Trade promotion authority would promote greater transparency and \naccountability in the negotiations process. Some, understandably, have \ncomplained that up to this point the Obama administration has relayed \nvery little information about this unfolding trade agreement--known as \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership--or the affected industries--that it has \nrelayed very little information about the negotiations taking place \nwith countries along the Pacific Rim and in Europe.\n  This bill prioritizes transparency and accountability front and \ncenter and will require the administration to brief Members of Congress \nregularly on the progress of the negotiations. It will actually allow \nMembers of Congress to attend the negotiations. How more transparent \ncan you get than that? That way Congress can work directly with those \nwho are finalizing this agreement to ensure, again, that the American \npeople are getting a good deal.\n\n  So through the trade promotion authority, the bill that has been \nfilibustered today, Congress would have been able to get to know \nimportant details regarding the actual implementation of the trade \ndeal.\n  I am disappointed our Democratic colleagues were not able to see how \nimportant this legislation is, not to us,\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nnot to the President but to the people they represent and to the \neconomy and wages we need to see grow.\n  Well, as we heard from Secretary Ash Carter today at lunch, this is \nimportant for national security reasons as well. It is important \nAmerica thoroughly engage in Asia with our trading partners because \nthere is a strange but simple phenomenon that occurs when two countries \ntrade with each other. They are sure a lot less likely to go to war \nwith each other if they are doing business and talking to each other.\n  From a national security perspective, we want to make sure we make \nthe rules with regard to trading in Asia and that we don't default and \nlet China fill the void, which they will be happy if we don't take care \nof our business.\n  Trade is important to my State, and as I said, it is important to the \nUnited States. In the 20th century all we needed back in Texas were \nfarm-to-market roads to find customers for our goods. But in the 21st \ncentury, our customers are not just in the next town over, they are all \naround the world. As I said, 95 percent of our potential customers live \noutside of the United States.\n  This legislation would help connect American farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall businesses to the markets around the world which would help our \neconomy. As the country's largest exporter, we in Texas know the value \nof trade firsthand because we depend on it. I know a lot of people \nthink, well, Texas is just about oil and gas. Well, that is not \nactually true. We have a very diversified economy. But part of what we \nhave done, which has set us apart from the rest of the country in terms \nof economic growth and job creation, is trade.\n  Last year, Texas reported $289 billion of exported goods, with some \n41,000 businesses exporting goods from Texas to outside the country. \nNow, this type of trade has helped our economy grow and keep people \nemployed, able to provide food for their families and other necessities \nof life. We have prospered, relatively speaking, during a time when \nmuch of the American economy has been relatively stagnant and trade has \nbeen an important part of that.\n  Opening up our country to greater trade through the trade promotion \nauthority would help American businesses send their goods to even more \nmarkets. The United States is the leading exporter of agricultural \nproducts. Last year alone, America's farmers and ranchers who could \nbenefit tremendously from this legislation exported more than $152 \nbillion in agricultural commodities and products to customers around \nthe world.\n  In Texas, for example, in the agriculture sector, we lead the Nation \nin exports of beef and cotton. By opening up more international \nopportunities for these products, our economy would grow and our Texas \ncommodities, such as beef and cotton, would become staples in fast-\ngrowing markets like Asia.\n  We also know, as I suggested earlier, that trade is not just about \nselling products, it is about the jobs that are necessary to make and \ngrow the products we sell. According to a report released last month by \nthe International Trade Administration, as of 2014, more than 1 million \njobs in Texas alone are supported by exporting, and in the entire \ncountry that figure is 11 million. So with 11 million jobs dependent on \nexports, why in the world wouldn't we want to improve our ability to \nexport more abroad to other markets around the world and to create more \njobs in the process?\n  Well, TPA is important because it would allow Congress to also have \nclear oversight over the pending trade agreements. I know there is a \nlot of skepticism about the kind of deal that is being cut behind \nclosed doors. We would open those doors and bring it out into the open \nand allow all Americans to examine it. And we, as their \nrepresentatives, will exam it as well and ask the hard questions, such \nas why is this in the best interest of the American farmer, rancher, \nand manufacturer.\n  We know that TPP--the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is the big \nAsia trade agreement--alone makes up about 40 percent of the world's \neconomy.\n  I admit I am a little disappointed that the Democrats, with the \nexception of one Senator, would choose to block this important piece of \nlegislation. With so much of the world's purchasing power located \nbeyond our borders, one would think that on a bipartisan basis we would \nall support opening up new access to consumers and markets for \nAmerica's farmers, ranchers, and manufactured goods, and that should be \na top priority.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues across the aisle did not see our \nNation's businesses and our economy as their main priority today. I \nhope that after today's failure of this particular legislation, we will \nengage in serious negotiations.\n  I agree with the majority leader, that after November 4, the American \npeople gave the U.S. Senate new management. They were dissatisfied with \nthe management of last year and previous years because all they saw was \ndysfunction. Well, now the U.S. Senate is starting to function again. \nWe are starting to produce important pieces of legislation, such as the \nfirst budget since 2009. This is a great opportunity for us on a \nbipartisan basis--on a nonpartisan basis--to do something really good.\n  I hope, after making the mistake of blocking this legislation, that \nour colleagues--the 14 so-called progrowth Democrats out of the 46 \nacross the aisle--will see fit to work with us to try and move this \nlegislation forward.\n\n\n           Order for Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m., the Senate \nstand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to reflect on this year's \nMemorial Day and the importance of this holiday in American life.\n  As I attend Memorial Day parades and commemorations, I am struck by \nour spirit of national unity. I know that across Michigan--and across \nour Nation--our fellow Americans are taking part in similar gatherings \nwhere we stop and reflect on our history and the sacrifice made by so \nmany in order to bring our Nation to where we are today.\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\n  Memorial Day is unique among American holidays. On Memorial Day, we \ndo not honor a particular date or event, a battle or the end of a war. \nOn Memorial Day, we do not honor an individual leader--a President or a \ngeneral.\n  On Memorial Day, we pay homage to the thousands and thousands of \nindividual acts of bravery and sacrifice that stretch back to the \nbattlefields of our Revolution and to those taking place today in \nconflicts across our world.\n  Last month, I was reminded of the significance of this day when I \nwelcomed 76 Michigan World War II and Korean war veterans to Washington \nfrom Michigan's Upper Peninsula as part of the Honor Flight Network.\n  These veterans visited the World War II and Korean war memorials, and \nat the end of the day, received personalized notes thanking them for \ntheir service. The mission of the Honor Flight Network is a fitting \ntribute to our ``greatest generation.''\n  This Memorial Day we not only honor past generations, but our current \ngeneration of young men and women who are serving or have come home. In \nApril, 350 airmen and 12 A-10 Thunderbolt II planes from our Selfridge \nAir National Guard Base deployed to the Middle East to fight the \nterrorist group ISIL as part of Operation Inherent Resolve.\n  This Memorial Day is a reminder of our obligation to honor our \ncommitment to all our generations of veterans by making sure they have \nthe support they need and the benefits they deserve.\n  As we observe this holiday, let us remember the centuries of \nsacrifice by the many men and women that this day represents. And let \nus make sure that all who served with honor are honored in return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CORPORAL BRYON K. DICKSON\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to honor Corporal Bryon K. \nDickson, a Pennsylvania State trooper who was killed in the line of \nduty on September 12, 2014. Corporal Dickson was a resident of Dunmore, \nPA, who served our Commonwealth and our Nation with honor, valor and \ndistinction.\n  Corporal Dickson spent the majority of his life in service to others. \nA graduate of Wyoming Area High School, he entered the Marines after \nhigh school and served with honor for 4 years. Following his discharge, \nCorporal Dickson went on to study at the Pennsylvania State University, \nwhere he earned a degree in the administration of justice before \nentering the Pennsylvania State Police Academy.\n  As a member of the Pennsylvania State Police, Corporal Dickson \ndistinguished himself as a passionate and dedicated officer. He became \na certified drug recognition expert and devoted himself to removing \nimpaired drivers from Pennsylvania's roads. In recognition of his \nefforts, Corporal Dickson received several awards from the Pennsylvania \nDUI Association, and numerous State police commendations. At the time \nof his death, he was a 7-year veteran of the force, serving as the \npatrol unit supervisor for Troop R at the Blooming Grove Barracks.\n  Corporal Dickson represented the very best of law enforcement in \nPennsylvania and around the country. He wanted to help his community, \nso he put himself at risk every day to keep us safe. He ultimately \ngave, as Abraham Lincoln once said, ``the last full measure of \ndevotion'' to his Commonwealth and his country. We owe him a debt of \ngratitude for that sacrifice.\n  As he was laid to rest, thousands of police officers from around the \ncountry, some from as far away as Alaska, lined the streets of \nScranton, PA to pay their final respects to Corporal Dickson. He was \neulogized by police commissioner Frank Noonan as a ``steadfast soldier \nof the law.'' But Corporal Dickson was more than just a brave public \nservant. In addition to being an honored marine, and distinguished \nState trooper, he was a devoted family man who ``took perfect care of \nhis wife'' and handcrafted flawless wood toys for his two young sons. \nHe was, most importantly, a loving husband, father, son, brother, \nuncle, and friend; and that is how he will be most dearly remembered.\n  My thoughts and prayers will remain with his wife Tiffany, his two \nchildren Bryon III and Adam, and all those who knew and loved Corporal \nDickson. May he rest in peace. And may his sacrifice never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2793-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING THE LOUISIANA VETERANS FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, today, I recognize the Second \nAnnual Louisiana Veterans Festival taking place on May 16, at the \nNorthshore Harbor Center in Slidell, LA. The event is hosted by the \nEast St. Tammany Habitat for Humanity, which constructs homes for low-\nincome families in Louisiana, including veterans. The event offers an \nopportunity for families of military personnel and members of the \ncommunity to celebrate and thank veterans for their service to our \nNation.\n  Habitat for Humanity's efforts are incredibly important, especially \nfor our veterans. When we send our American citizens to war, we make a \npromise to protect them and a commitment to support them when they \nreturn home. Habitat for Humanity's work ensures that many will have a \nhome when they return.\n  Throughout America's history, our military has bravely defended our \nNation--especially our beliefs and values--from the threat of tyranny \nand oppression. Our service men and women have defended us in all \ncorners of the Earth, and they continue to defend us today. It is \nthrough the service and devotion of the military members and our \nveterans that our Nation has remained the strong America we know today. \nFor their sacrifices, we owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be \nrepaid.\n  Through my work in the United States Congress, I have had the \nprivilege of meeting with veterans throughout the State of Louisiana, \nfrom World War II veterans to recent veterans from Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. I am humbled by the stories of \nheroism and selflessness. May we never forget those who have made the \nultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.\n  It is our responsibility to remember their courage, not only in \nceremonies such as the Veterans Festival in Slidell, but also every \nday. Louisiana is blessed to have such a successful organization with \nso many dedicated workers and volunteers building a better future for \nour veterans and their families. We honor those who have served for us \nand have given so much, and I am pleased to recognize the Second Annual \nLouisiana Veterans Festival and the East St. Tammany Habitat for \nHumanity for its role in building homes for veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/12/senate-section/article/S2793-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on Finance:\n       Report to accompany S. 995, A bill to establish \n     congressional trade negotiating objectives and enhanced \n     consultation requirements for trade negotiations, to provide \n     for consideration of trade agreements, and for other purposes \n     (Rept.

A bill to require the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \nof Agriculture to collaborate in promoting the development of \nefficient, economical, and environmentally sustainable thermally led \nwood energy systems; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Bioenergy \nAct of 2015.\n  Managed in an environmentally responsible way, woody biomass presents \na carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels for heating and powering \nhomes, schools and businesses. Much of the woody biomass in the U.S. \nthat could be used for energy production is either waste from the \nforest products industry, or small trees that contribute to the \novercrowding of forests and wildfires. In 2013, wildfires burned 4.3 \nmillion acres of American forests and rangeland, and the Federal \nGovernment spent $1.7 billion to fight them. Additionally, about 2 \nbillion metric tons, or 30 percent, of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions \ncame from fossil fuel use in space heating, water heating or \nelectricity generation for American homes and businesses. Using woody \nbiomass for heat and power can help fund wildfire risk reduction and \nforest restoration, all while creating low-carbon energy and a stable \nsource of jobs in rural economies across the country.\n  Despite this potential, the U.S. Department of Energy, DOE, has not \ninvested in biomass heat, bioheat, and power, biopower, projects and \nresearch. This bill introduces modest steps to develop this resource, \nlearn more about its full potential, and improve interagency \ncoordination between DOE and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nForest Service on this topic.\n  Specifically, the bill will establish a competitive cost-share grant \nprogram at the Department of Energy to improve technologies for \nprocessing woody biomass and bringing down transportation costs, as \nwell as innovative technologies for using biomass for heat and power--\nfrom new power plant designs, to neighborhood heating systems called \n``district energy'' systems.\n  The bill also creates a cost-share grant program through the U.S. \nForest Service to support proven biomass technologies, like combined \nheat and power, CHP. To assist with financing, the bill expands a loan \nprogram run by the USDA Rural Utilities Service to include bioheat and \nbiopower, and establishes a new loan program for projects that are not \nlocated in a rural utility service territory. Finally, the bill would \nsupport continued research into the environmental sustainability and \neconomics of using biomass for heat and power, and would establish a \ncollaborative platform for directing this research across the \nDepartments of Energy and Agriculture.\n  This bill is good for the environment, good for rural jobs, and good \nfor stopping wildfires before they start. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise and extend provisions under the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nMurkowski, Udall, Durbin, Coons, Warren, Schatz, Heinrich, Donnelly, \nAyotte, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Stabenow, Tester, Hirono, Merkley, \nSanders, Grassley, Collins, and Reid in the introduction of the Garrett \nLee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization.\n  This legislation is named for the son of our former colleague, \nSenator Gordon Smith, who took his own life at the young age of 22. \nAfter this tragedy, Senator Smith worked to gain the support of members \nacross the aisle and in both chambers to prevent other children from \ndoing the same with passage of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act in \n2004.\n  Although great strides have been made over the last decade, suicide \nremains the third-leading cause of death for adolescents and young \nadults between the ages of 10 and 24. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, youth suicide results in \napproximately 4,600 lives lost each year. Additionally, the CDC reports \nthat 157,000 young adults in this age group are treated for self-\ninflicted injuries annually, often as the result of a failed suicide \nattempt.\n  More work must be done to address the mental and behavioral health of \nchildren and young adults before they hurt themselves and others. \nParents also need help in identifying early warning signs of mental \nillness and accessing the appropriate treatment before it is too late.\n  The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act authorizes critical resources for \nschools--elementary schools through college where children and young \nadults spend most of their time--to be able to reach at-risk youth. \nSince 2005, this law has supported 370 youth suicide prevention grants \nin all 50 States, 46 tribes or tribal organizations, and 175 \ninstitutions of higher education.\n  The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today, with the support \nof over 40 member organizations of the Mental Health Liaison Group, \nwould increase the authorized grant level to States, tribes, and \ncollege campuses for the implementation of proven programs and \ninitiatives designed to address mental illness and reduce youth \nsuicide. It will enable more schools to offer critical services to \nstudents and provide greater flexibility in the use of funds, \nparticularly on college campuses. This change to the Campus Suicide \nPrevention Program comes at a vital time.\n  Over the last decade, we have seen an increasing trend in the number \nof students seeking help for mental health issues on college campuses. \nOf these students seeking services for mental health issues, over 30 \npercent report that they have seriously considered attempting suicide \nat some point in their lives. With more students seeking mental health \nservices, we must work to ensure that college and university counseling \ncenters are equipped with the necessary tools to meet this demand.\n  We can play a role in helping these children and their families. \nIndeed, passing the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization is \none way we can better address the mental health needs of this \npopulation. I urge our colleagues to work with us to pass this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. McConnell, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Corker):\n  S. 1300. A bill to amend the section 221 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act to provide relief for adoptive families from immigrant \nvisa feeds in certain situations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Adoptive \nFamily Relief Act, which would provide support and relief to American \nfamilies seeking to bring their adoptive children from the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo home to the U.S. It would also provide relief to \nsimilarly situated adoptive families should barriers arise in other \ncountries in the future. I thank my colleagues, Senators Ron Johnson, \nChuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, Amy Klobuchar, Barbara Boxer, and Bob \nCorker for joining me as original cosponsors.\n  Within the past few years, over 350 American families have \nsuccessfully adopted children from the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nHowever, since September 25, 2013, they have not been able to bring \ntheir adoptive children home to the United States because the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo suspended the issuance of ``exit permits'' \nfor these children until its parliament passes new laws regarding \ninternational adoption. These exit permits are necessary for adopted \nchildren to leave the Democratic Republic of Congo and be united with \ntheir American families in the U.S. As the permit suspension drags on, \nhowever, American families are repeatedly paying visa renewal and \nrelated fees, while also continuing to be separated from their adopted \nkids.\n  The Adoptive Families Relief Act would grant flexibility to the \nUnited States Department of State to waive immigrant visa renewal fees \nfor adoptive American parents in extraordinary circumstances like this, \nwhere the cause of delay is due to factors not in the control of the \nchild or parents. The Department of State is fully supportive of this \nlegislation and is eager to provide some relief to the many families \nwho are affected.\n  Under current law, adopted children from abroad must secure U.S. \nimmigrant visas in order to travel to the United States to unite with \ntheir adoptive parents. However, these visas expire after 6 months. \nOrdinarily, such visas are used within the allotted 6 months. However, \nin rare circumstances, such as the suspension of exit permits in the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, adopted children are prohibited from \nleaving their country of birth and cannot use their U.S.-issued visas \nwithin the prescribed timeframe.\n  Adoptive parents consequently pay $325 in visa renewal fees every 6 \nmonths if they want to preserve the validity of their adopted child's \nvisa to travel to the U.S. To renew the visa, the child must also \ncomplete another medical exam, which costs the child's adoptive family \napproximately $200. Many families from across the country have already \npaid for at least three visas, which amounts to $975 per child, plus \ncosts for medical exams. Additionally, many families are also paying \nmonthly childcare or foster care fees, and some families have adopted \nmore than one child. So, in addition to the emotional stress of being \nseparated from their adoptive children, American parents face a \nfinancial burden while the situation goes unresolved.\n  This bill would not change any of the substantive requirements for \nissuance of a renewed visa, such as necessary medical exams and \nbackground checks. It simply allows the Department of State to waive \nthe visa renewal fee to alleviate the financial burden imposed on \nAmerican families to renew their child's visa, and reimburses those who \nhave already renewed their child's visa since the exit permit \nsuspension.\n  The Department of State does not anticipate this waiver authority to \nbe used broadly based on its past experiences and its other adoption \nprograms abroad. The bill would not be a financial burden on the United \nStates. According to the State Department, once the initial visa, which \nthe parents must pay for, is issued, the subsequent work for consular \nofficers involved with renewing a visa is relatively quick and simple. \nThe work involved to renew the visa therefore does not amount to the \nfull cost of the visa renewal fee, so the State Department maintains it \nwould not impact its consular resources.\n  This legislation builds on the efforts of other members who have \ntried to resolve the Democratic Republic of Congo's exit permit \nsuspension in various ways. Last April, 171 Members of Congress sent a \nletter to Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila asking \nfor his intervention. In June of 2014, 167 Members of Congress also \nsent a letter to President Obama requesting his outreach to President \nKabila to resolve this situation. Members of Congress sent a letter to \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo Parliament offering technical \nassistance on October 28, 2014, and the Senate passed S. Res. 502 in \nthe 113th Congress, concerning the Democratic Republic of Congo's \nsuspension of exit permits for Congolese adopted children. This year, \nthe Senate passed an amendment to promote the return of legally adopted \nchildren from the Democratic Republic of Congo. My Senate colleagues \nand our staff have met with our constituents directly affected by the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo's exit permit suspension, and heard their \ncall for help. Furthermore, I, and other Senators, have also had \nindividual meetings with Congolese Ambassador to the U.S., Faida \nMitifu.\n  However, since the exit permit suspension continues despite these \nefforts, it is imperative to bring some relief to our American adoptive \nparents. While we continue to urge the Democratic Republic of Congo to \nlift its exit permit suspension, I urge my colleagues to pass the \nAdoptive Family Relief Act to provide some relief to American families \ncaught powerless in this difficult situation.

TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall \n     trade negotiating objectives of the United States for \n     agreements subject to the provisions of section 103 are--\n       (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market \n     access;\n       (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and \n     distortions that are directly related to trade and investment \n     and that decrease market opportunities for United States \n     exports or otherwise distort United States trade;\n       (3) to further strengthen the system of international trade \n     and investment disciplines and procedures, including dispute \n     settlement;\n       (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, \n     enhance the competitiveness of the United States, promote \n     full employment in the United States, and enhance the global \n     economy;\n       (5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are \n     mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the \n     environment and enhance the international means of doing so, \n     while optimizing the use of the world's resources;\n       (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of \n     children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO (as \n     set out in section 111(7)) and an understanding of the \n     relationship between trade and worker rights;\n       (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which \n     parties to those agreements ensure that they do not weaken or \n     reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and \n     labor laws as an encouragement for trade;\n       (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses \n     equal access to international markets, equitable trade \n     benefits, and expanded export market opportunities, and \n     provide for the reduction or elimination of trade and \n     investment barriers that disproportionately impact small \n     businesses;\n       (9) to promote universal ratification and full compliance \n     with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and \n     Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of \n     Child Labor;\n       (10) to ensure that trade agreements reflect and facilitate \n     the increasingly interrelated, multi-sectoral nature of trade \n     and investment activity;\n       (11) to recognize the growing significance of the Internet \n     as a trading platform in international commerce; and\n       (12) to take into account other legitimate United States \n     domestic objectives, including, but not limited to, the \n     protection of legitimate health or safety, essential \n     security, and consumer interests and the law and regulations \n     related thereto.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade in goods.--The principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding trade in goods are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for exports \n     of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more \n     open conditions of trade, including through the utilization \n     of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and \n     nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign \n     governments directly related to trade that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort \n     United States trade; and\n       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier \n     elimination agreements, including with respect to those \n     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (2) Trade in services.--(A) The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States regarding trade in services is \n     to expand competitive market opportunities for United States \n     services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of \n     trade, including through utilization of global value chains, \n     by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in \n     services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny \n     national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict \n     the establishment or operations of service suppliers.\n       (B) Recognizing that expansion of trade in services \n     generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and \n     facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph \n     (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a \n     plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able \n     to undertake high standard services commitments for both \n     existing and new services.\n       (3) Trade in agriculture.--The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is \n     to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports \n     of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially \n     equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign \n     exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and \n     more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and \n     value added commodities by--\n       (A) securing more open and equitable market access through \n     robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that--\n       (i) encourage the adoption of international standards and \n     require a science-based justification be provided for a \n     sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the measure is more \n     restrictive than the applicable international standard;\n       (ii) improve regulatory coherence, promote the use of \n     systems-based approaches, and appropriately recognize the \n     equivalence of health and safety protection systems of \n     exporting countries;\n       (iii) require that measures are transparently developed and \n     implemented, are based on risk assessments that take into \n     account relevant international guidelines and scientific \n     data, and are not more restrictive on trade than necessary to \n     meet the intended purpose; and\n       (iv) improve import check processes, including testing \n     methodologies and procedures, and certification requirements,\n\n     while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to \n     protect human, animal, or plant life or health in a manner \n     consistent with their international obligations, including \n     the WTO Agreement on the Application\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\n     of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in \n     section 101(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 \n     U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (B) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease market opportunities for United \n     States exports--\n       (i) giving priority to those products that are subject to \n     significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major \n     producing countries; and\n       (ii) providing reasonable adjustment periods for United \n     States import sensitive products, in close consultation with \n     Congress on such products before initiating tariff reduction \n     negotiations;\n       (C) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or \n     lower than those in the United States;\n       (D) reducing or eliminating subsidies that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or unfairly distort \n     agriculture markets to the detriment of the United States;\n       (E) allowing the preservation of programs that support \n     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade;\n       (F) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, \n     so that production that is in excess of domestic food \n     security needs is sold at world prices;\n       (G) eliminating government policies that create price \n     depressing surpluses;\n       (H) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever \n     possible;\n       (I) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules to \n     eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States \n     market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets \n     to the detriment of the United States, and ensuring that such \n     rules are subject to efficient, timely, and effective dispute \n     settlement, including--\n       (i) unfair or trade distorting activities of state trading \n     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with \n     emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of \n     state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order \n     to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price \n     undercutting;\n       (ii) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions not based on scientific principles in \n     contravention of obligations in the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     or bilateral or regional trade agreements;\n       (iv) other unjustified technical barriers to trade; and\n       (v) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff rate \n     quotas;\n       (J) eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in \n     perishable or cyclical products, while improving import \n     relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of \n     perishable and cyclical agriculture;\n       (K) ensuring that import relief mechanisms for perishable \n     and cyclical agriculture are as accessible and timely to \n     growers in the United States as those mechanisms that are \n     used by other countries;\n       (L) taking into account whether a party to the negotiations \n     has failed to adhere to the provisions of already existing \n     trade agreements with the United States or has circumvented \n     obligations under those agreements;\n       (M) taking into account whether a product is subject to \n     market distortions by reason of a failure of a major \n     producing country to adhere to the provisions of already \n     existing trade agreements with the United States or by the \n     circumvention by that country of its obligations under those \n     agreements;\n       (N) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization have made meaningful market \n     liberalization commitments in agriculture;\n       (O) taking into account the impact that agreements covering \n     agriculture to which the United States is a party have on the \n     United States agricultural industry;\n       (P) maintaining bona fide food assistance programs, market \n     development programs, and export credit programs;\n       (Q) seeking to secure the broadest market access possible \n     in multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations, \n     recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets of negotiations \n     may have on United States import sensitive commodities \n     (including those subject to tariff rate quotas);\n       (R) seeking to develop an international consensus on the \n     treatment of seasonal or perishable agricultural products in \n     investigations relating to dumping and safeguards and in any \n     other relevant area;\n       (S) seeking to establish the common base year for \n     calculating the Aggregated Measurement of Support (as defined \n     in the Agreement on Agriculture) as the end of each country's \n     Uruguay Round implementation period, as reported in each \n     country's Uruguay Round market access schedule;\n       (T) ensuring transparency in the administration of tariff \n     rate quotas through multilateral, plurilateral, and bilateral \n     negotiations; and\n       (U) eliminating and preventing the undermining of market \n     access for United States products through improper use of a \n     country's system for protecting or recognizing geographical \n     indications, including failing to ensure transparency and \n     procedural fairness and protecting generic terms.\n       (4) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law \n     on the whole provides a high level of protection for \n     investment, consistent with or greater than the level \n     required by international law, the principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment \n     are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade distorting \n     barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign \n     investors in the United States are not accorded greater \n     substantive rights with respect to investment protections \n     than United States investors in the United States, and to \n     secure for investors important rights comparable to those \n     that would be available under United States legal principles \n     and practice, by--\n       (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of \n     national treatment;\n       (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;\n       (C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, \n     forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers \n     to the establishment and operation of investments;\n       (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and \n     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States \n     legal principles and practice;\n       (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable \n     treatment, consistent with United States legal principles and \n     practice, including the principle of due process;\n       (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving \n     investment disputes;\n       (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes \n     between an investor and a government through--\n       (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter \n     the filing of frivolous claims;\n       (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of \n     arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;\n       (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input \n     into the formulation of government positions; and\n       (iv) providing for an appellate body or similar mechanism \n     to provide coherence to the interpretations of investment \n     provisions in trade agreements; and\n       (H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in the \n     dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent consistent with \n     the need to protect information that is classified or \n     business confidential, by--\n       (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are \n     promptly made public;\n       (ii) ensuring that--\n\n       (I) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public; and\n       (II) all hearings are open to the public; and\n\n       (iii) establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus \n     curiae submissions from businesses, unions, and \n     nongovernmental organizations.\n       (5) Intellectual property.--The principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding trade-related \n     intellectual property are--\n       (A) to further promote adequate and effective protection of \n     intellectual property rights, including through--\n       (i)(I) ensuring accelerated and full implementation of the \n     Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \n     Rights referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(15)), particularly with \n     respect to meeting enforcement obligations under that \n     agreement; and\n       (II) ensuring that the provisions of any trade agreement \n     governing intellectual property rights that is entered into \n     by the United States reflect a standard of protection similar \n     to that found in United States law;\n       (ii) providing strong protection for new and emerging \n     technologies and new methods of transmitting and distributing \n     products embodying intellectual property, including in a \n     manner that facilitates legitimate digital trade;\n       (iii) preventing or eliminating discrimination with respect \n     to matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, \n     maintenance, use, and enforcement of intellectual property \n     rights;\n       (iv) ensuring that standards of protection and enforcement \n     keep pace with technological developments, and in particular \n     ensuring that rightholders have the legal and technological \n     means to control the use of their works through the Internet \n     and other global communication media, and to prevent the \n     unauthorized use of their works;\n       (v) providing strong enforcement of intellectual property \n     rights, including through accessible, expeditious, and \n     effective civil, administrative, and criminal enforcement \n     mechanisms;
