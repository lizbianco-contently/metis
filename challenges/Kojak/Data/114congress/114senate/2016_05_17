Mr. President, last week, the Republican-led Senate \npassed, by an overwhelming majority, the first appropriations bill of \nthe year--the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill. \nThe Republican-led Senate did so in record early time. We began \nconsidering an annual appropriations bill this year at the earliest \npoint in 40 years--40 years--and then we passed an annual \nappropriations bill this year at the earliest point in 40 years. \nPassage of this bill also marks the first time the Senate has passed an \nindividual energy and water funding measure since 2009.\n  This shows what is possible with a little cooperation and regular \norder. By returning to regular order, we are better able to make better \ndecisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent through the \nappropriations bills.\n  Here is what we mean when we talk about returning to regular order. \nWe mean working in committee and allowing Senators from both sides to \nhave their voices heard. We mean bringing bills to the floor and \nempowering more Members to offer suggestions they think might make a \ngood bill even better. We mean working through hours of debate and \ndeliberation, processing amendments from both sides, and then arriving \nat a final bill that actually passes.\n  That is just what we did here, and it resulted in the record early \npassage of an energy and water appropriations bill that will help \nsupport economic development, waterways infrastructure, and energy \nprograms--initiatives that are important in my home State of Kentucky \nand in States across our country.\n  So I want to thank Senator Alexander for working diligently with \nSenator Feinstein to move this bill forward. They collaborated with \nboth Democratic and Republican colleagues to ensure a fair process and \nan outcome that a majority of Senators could support.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Mikulski for \nworking within the Committee on Appropriations to move appropriations \nmeasures so early this year. We have already begun considering two more \nof them this week. The first measure is the transportation and housing \ninfrastructure bill. It will make smart investments in important \ninfrastructure priorities. It will strengthen our surface \ntransportation network and help make air travel safer, more efficient, \nand more reliable.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her dedicated leadership on this \nimportant legislation.\n  The second measure is the Veterans and Military Construction funding \nbill. It will increase accountability at the VA and help ensure \nveterans receive the health care and benefits they rely on. It will \nadvance vital national security projects, such as missile defense, and \nhelp ensure military families are supported with housing, schools, and \nhealth facilities to serve them.\n  This is the result of great work by a true champion of veterans--\nSenator Kirk. Senator Kirk and Senator Collins both worked hard to move \nthese bills out of the Committee on Appropriations with unanimous \nbipartisan support. Now they are working hard to pass them together out \nhere on the floor. They have already lined up several amendments that \nwe will consider later today.\n  I would like to say a few words about one of these issues in \nparticular. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that preventing the \nspread of Zika is a bipartisan priority. That is why Members from both \nparties have been looking at different approaches to properly address \nthe situation. They worked through the best avenue to address the \nfunding that may be needed to do so--the appropriations process--and \ncame up with several different approaches for us to consider later \ntoday.\n  One amendment is from Senators Blunt and Murray. It is a targeted \napproach that focuses on immediate needs while also providing resources \nfor longer term goals, such as a vaccine. It includes accountability \nmeasures and represents a notable departure\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nfrom our Democratic colleagues' initial position. It is good to see our \nDemocratic friends compromise.\n  Another amendment is from Senators Cornyn and Johnson. Their enhanced \napproach builds upon the appropriators' work by responsibly offsetting \nZika funding with funds that have been set aside for public health and \nprevention purposes. It would also remove redtape and help promote \nmosquito control, which is the best way to keep Americans safe from \nthis virus in the near term while a vaccine is under development. The \nHouse is also advancing its own paid-for Zika measure this very week.\n  So we will take several votes today. We will continue moving forward \nwith the appropriations process, and we will address Zika funding in \nthat context because keeping Americans safe and healthy is a top \npriority for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2833-5"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is International Day Against \nHomophobia and Transphobia. This day of recognition is especially \nsignificant for America since the civil rights of transgender Americans \nare at the forefront of an important national debate. At its core, the \ndebate comes down to a simple question: With whom do we stand? Do we \nstand with the bullies or do we stand against the bullies? Do we stand \nup for the bullies or against the bullies? Do we defend the persecutors \nor do we come to the defense of the persecuted?\n  These are the questions posed to us, and they should be. These are \nthe questions posed to us by what is happening in North Carolina and \nthe law there that undermines the civil rights of transgender \nAmericans.\n  During a 1-day special session in March, the North Carolina \nlegislature rammed through a controversial law that strikes down local \nantidiscrimination ordinances. The actions taken by North Carolina's \nlegislature and Governor are nothing short of State-sponsored \ndiscrimination against transgender individuals. The law is clearly and \ncompletely illegal. It is in direct opposition to Federal civil rights \nstatutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex.\n  The Federal courts have made it clear that sex discrimination under \nthe Civil Rights Act covers transgender individuals. This goes back to \n1989, when the Supreme Court ruled in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that \nsex discrimination includes sex stereotyping under title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. Relying on the Supreme Court's ruling in that \ncase, appellate courts have concluded that discrimination against \ntransgender people is prohibited when it is based on gender \nnonconformity.\n  That is why last week the Department of Justice sued North Carolina, \nfinding that its law constitutes a pattern or practice of \ndiscrimination under the Civil Rights Act, the Education Amendments Act \nof 1972, and the Violence Against Women Act, which we passed just last \nyear.\n  This kind of shocking discriminatory lawmaking has no place in the \n21st century. It certainly has no place in America. Attorney General \nLoretta Lynch said last week:\n\n       This is not the first time we have seen discriminatory \n     responses to historic moments of progress for our nation. We \n     saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation \n     Proclamation. We saw it in fierce and widespread resistance \n     to Brown v. Board of Education. And we saw it in the \n     proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions intended to \n     stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day \n     be afforded the right to marry.\n\n  This issue has been far-reaching. It has far-reaching consequences. \nThis is about access to employment, education, and just about \neverything else in public life. This is about whether we are going to \nallow our fellow citizens to be bullied, intimidated, and harassed.\n  The North Carolina law is not only wrong, but it runs counter to the \nprogress we are seeing in States and cities across all of America. \nRight now, 18 States and approximately 200 cities have laws on the \nbooks to protect transgender individuals in being able to use the \nrestroom that matches their gender identity.\n  Take, for example, what happened in Reno, NV, just last year. Reno, \nNV, is in Washoe County. It is the second largest school district in \nNevada. In February 2015, in response to concerns from parents and \nstudents, the Washoe County School District issued policies to help \nfoster a healthy and inclusive environment for transgender students.\n  The Washoe County School District developed thoughtful and \ncommonsense policies that allow all students in Washoe County to have \naccess to all school programs and activities. It was the first district \nin Nevada to do so. In the year since those regulations were adopted, \nschools across the district have reported few, if any, concerns about \nthe new policies.\n  North Carolina leaders need to learn from Washoe County. They need to \nlearn a thing or two about tolerance, as exhibited by the students and, \nyes, the adults across Washoe County.\n  North Carolina is already paying a severe price for its \ndiscriminatory law, and more is yet to come. Hundreds of America's \nbiggest and most prestigious corporations and organizations have \nalready come out in firm opposition to the law--companies such as \nGoogle, Bank of America, Starbucks, and Pfizer. You have major \nbusinesses that don't want to do business there. You have entertainers \nwho won't perform there, such as Bruce Springsteen. But it is not just \nthat. It is hundreds--hundreds--of other firms that are coming out in \nopposition to the law because what they are doing is illegal.\n  But Republican leaders are standing by their bigotry at a tremendous \ncost to the State, and that is disappointing. I stand with the \nadministration in opposing the North Carolina law. I stand with all \nAmericans against this shameful bullying. Most of all, I stand with the \ntransgender people of North Carolina and our country who are the \ntargets of this State-sponsored discrimination. My heart goes out to \nthem.\n  This is not how a great nation should operate. We are better than \nthis. So I look forward to the day, and it is coming soon, when this \nhateful law is struck down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2834-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2834-S2835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ZUBIK V. BURWELL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, the Supreme Court chose not to \nrule on the merits of Zubik v. Burwell, a case brought by religiously \naffiliated nonprofit employers challenging the accommodation to the \nAffordable Care Act's contraceptive coverage provision. Instead, the \nCourt remanded the case to lower courts for further proceeding.\n  The good news is that the order doesn't stop women who rely on the \nAffordable Care Act for contraceptive coverage from getting the \nservices they need while the legal process plays out. But this remand \nhighlights that the Supreme Court cannot properly do its job until we \ndo ours here in the Senate. We must give Judge Merrick Garland a \nhearing and a vote so the Supreme Court can become fully functioning \nagain.\n  There have been numerous cases that have been determined differently \nbecause of a 4-to-4 split. A number of them are just tied 4-to-4. A \n     number of them have been remanded back to lower courts \n     without action.\n  The Supreme Court to do its job needs nine--nine--Justices. So I hope \nthe time is coming quickly when American women will know once and for \nall that their bosses can't interfere with their health care decisions, \nand I am confident the courts will ultimately do the right thing and \nuphold the Affordable Care Act's accommodation to the contraceptive \ncoverage provision. Until that time, though, Senate Democrats will \ncontinue to watch this matter very closely and do everything in our \npower to defend access for women to birth control measures that they \nfeel appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I think it is such a blight on the Senate that we are \nnot doing anything to fill that ninth spot. It needs to be done, and it \nneeds to be done quickly. Justice is being delayed. Justice is not \nbeing served.\n  I see my friend from Montana is on the floor. I ask the Chair, prior \nto his being recognized, to tell the Senate what we are going to do \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2834-3"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the managers or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the fiscal \nyear 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations \nbill, I want to start by thanking the chairman of the subcommittee and \nhis staff.\n  The process Chairman Kirk and I put into place was fair, inclusive, \nand open, and I appreciate that he went out of his way to incorporate \ninput from me, my team, and Senators from this side of the aisle.\n  This bill does right by our brave service men and women by honoring \nour Nation's commitment to veterans, Active-Duty military, and their \nfamilies. We owe these folks our gratitude for their selfless sacrifice \nto freedom and democracy.\n  As a result of last year's bipartisan budget agreement, we are on the \nsame page this year in terms of top-line funding numbers. This level of \nfunding has allowed us to make critical investments in military \nconstruction, veterans programs, as well as Arlington National Cemetery \nand the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n  For VA, this bill provides $102 billion in mandatory funding for \nveterans' benefits--$102 billion--and includes an additional $103.9 \nbillion in fiscal year 2018 advance funding to ensure that there is not \na lapse in getting disability compensation and education benefits to \nour veterans.\n  For VA's discretionary accounts, including the Veterans Health \nAdministration, the bill appropriates $74.9 billion. That is $3.4 \nbillion more than the Department has this year. Within that amount, we \nare able to target increased funding for several key priorities for \nveterans. That includes health care, disability claims and appeals \nprocessing, medical and prosthetic research, and family caregiver \nsupport. That means the VA will be able to aggressively pursue critical \nveteran-centered research into a host of medical conditions, including \nPTSD and traumatic brain injury--the unseen wounds of war that are so \ndifficult to both identify and treat. It also means the VA will have \nadditional resources to meet the growing demand of caregivers who are \nproviding critical, family-centered, long-term care for our veterans, \nand it will allow VBA to hire 300 new claims processors and 240 \nadditional employees for the Board of Veterans Appeals, all focused on \nreducing the appeals backlog--something Senator Sullivan and I are \nworking on over on the authorizing side. These funds will complement \nthat work.\n  The bill before us also includes a new medical community care account \nthat consolidates the various sources of funding that connect veterans \nto care in their own communities. The creation of this new account is \nextremely important in providing better oversight over a program that \nis critical for our veterans, particularly those in rural areas where \nservices through the VA are often unavailable. It is also a key \ncomponent in ongoing efforts to consolidate and streamline the number \nof different programs the VA has to get veterans care in their local \ncommunities. That is something a number of us are working on in a \nbipartisan manner in the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  On the MILCON side of the ledger, the bill before us also delivers. \nWe have provided increased funding for a number of unfunded MILCON \nrequirements identified by the services. Given the severe constraints \non the budget, funding for military construction is squeezed more \ntightly now than ever. It is not just the cost of trying to maintain a \ndeteriorating building, which in itself is substantial, it is also the \nimpact that effort has on training, readiness, and retention of \npersonnel--the very areas DOD is struggling to reinforce.\n  Shortchanging military construction is not a cost-effective or \nsustainable defense strategy over the long haul. That is why I am glad \nthis bill provides nearly $500 million over the budget requested for \nunfunded priorities.\n  I am pleased the majority chose not to put forward controversial \namendments on this bill during committee consideration. The bill that \nfunds veterans health care and our military installations should not be \na vehicle for politics. Our veterans and our servicemembers deserve a \nclean bill, so we need to avoid the ugly stuff on this bill.\n  I have a lot more to say about this bill as it is considered over the \nnext, hopefully, several days. For now, I reiterate my thanks to the \nfolks on the majority side, as well as Vice Chairman Mikulski, for \ntheir efforts in getting us where we are today.\n  Lastly, I remind all of our colleagues that we are open for business. \nSo if there are amendments you are thinking about, get them filed and \nget them to our staffs so we can move forward. Amendments at the \neleventh hour are never good, so get them in early so we can consider \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n      President's Policy on Transgender Access to School Bathrooms\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, since Friday, my State and DC offices have \nbeen flooded with calls from concerned constituents regarding President \nObama's latest unilateral action directing public schools and colleges \nto allow transgender kids into the bathrooms and locker rooms of their \nchoice. In Oklahoma, we understand what this is all about. This is all \nabout a liberal agenda being crammed down the neck of Oklahoma and the \nrest of the country.\n  On Sunday, I went to a church service near the Grand Lake area in \nNortheastern Oklahoma, where the nearest community has about 250 \npeople. The pastor, whose name is Mark, said, ``If ever there were a \nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego moment in America, it is now.''\n  They understand that there is a real battle going on in Washington \nfor our values. These values should be decided at the local level by \nthe parents and teachers who truly understand what needs to take place \nto protect all kids.\n  He went on to say that ``we have to embolden our school board members \n[and other politicians] with our support.'' I agree. This is why I put \nforth a bill last year, which passed last year, to empower local school \nauthorities to make these kinds of decisions. What the President is \ndoing is unilaterally redefining title IX of the education law that \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. With the new guidance he \nhas issued, Obama is aiming to prohibit anything that could be \nconstrued as discrimination against ``gender identity, including \ndiscrimination based on a student's transgender status.''\n  Ultimately, the President is demanding, under threat of losing \nsignificant public assistance--in my State of Oklahoma, this amounts to \nabout $450 million--if States and school districts don't comply. In \nother words, it is blackmail: You comply or you lose something you are \nentitled to.\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\n  By rewriting the law, President Obama has decided, without any input \nfrom Congress, that local schools must accommodate a very small segment \nof the population in a very specific way by allowing them to use the \nbathroom of their choice. By blackmailing our schools with funding that \ngoes to low-income and special needs kids--money which schools are \nalready entitled to receive--the Obama administration is writing its \nown laws to punish those who disagree.\n  As the pastor said this weekend, ``We should not sell out the \ninnocence and the safety of our children'' as a condition for receiving \nFederal money that helps those who need it the most. In fact, he went \non to say: We just will not accept it. We don't need to accept it. It \nis not worth the price we would pay.\n  This misguided policy is directed at the comfort of a microminority \nat the expense of the comfort, privacy, and safety of the majority of \nstudents who do not want to expose themselves or be exposed to another \nstudent of a different sex.\n  As Oklahoma's attorney general, Scott Pruitt, has noted, the \nadministration's letter ``definitely changes the law in that it takes \nthe unprecedented step of redefining `sex' to mean 'gender identity.' \n'' Furthermore, he states that the President's actions ``are unlawful'' \nand that they represent the ``most egregious administrative overreach \nto date'' and that Oklahoma ``will vigorously defend the State's \ninterests.''\n  I fully support Oklahoma and other States that are vowing to fight \nthis undemocratic edict from a politician who is no longer accountable \nto the voters. Oklahoma's parents, schools, and State and local boards \nare best equipped to deal with the issues they face in the classroom \nand on school grounds and should not be dictated to from Washington.\n  Our Nation's schools should not be ground zero for social experiments \nfrom the liberal agenda, and this is exactly what is happening now, but \nit doesn't take an Attorney General or a U.S. Senator to come to these \nconclusions. I thank God that basic morality is ringing out from the \npews, not just in Northeastern Oklahoma but throughout America.\n  You are doing the Lord's work, Mark. Keep it up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time spent in a \nquorum call before 12:30 p.m. today be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a mother and a grandmother, I know \nthat one of the most frightening questions an expecting parent has to \nask their doctor is, ``Is my baby safe?''\n  Too many parents are asking that question right now because of the \nZika virus. There are now more than 1,200 reported cases of Zika in the \nUnited States and the three territories--more than 100 of these are \npregnant women--and on Friday, Puerto Rico announced its first case of \nZika-related microcephaly.\n  Unfortunately, those numbers are only expected to grow in the coming \nmonths. So this is an emergency, and public health experts have \nrepeatedly made it clear that as we get closer to the summer and to \nmosquito season, we cannot afford to delay. We need to better control \nmosquitoes that carry the Zika virus. We need to raise awareness to \nmake sure families are informed about this disease, and we need to \nexpand access to family planning services and accelerate the \ndevelopment of a vaccine. The President laid out a strong emergency \nfunding proposal to accomplish each of those goals in February.\n  I support that plan. I was very disappointed that instead of acting \non it as quickly as possible, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle simply refused to even consider it. Instead, they found reason \nafter reason to delay. First, they said the administration should take \nfunds from the ongoing Ebola response to combat Zika. Then, they said \nthey needed more information about the President's proposal, even \nthough Zika has been discussed in 55 congressional hearings, even after \nbriefings by senior administration officials, and even though the \nadministration's 25-page proposal had been available for months for \nanyone to see.\n  House Republicans have released a proposal that would provide a very \nmeager $622 million, less than one-third of what is needed for this \nemergency, without any funding for preventive health care or outreach \nto those who are at risk of Zika, and they are still insisting in the \nHouse for the funding for the offset.\n  In the face of all of that partisanship and inaction and with public \nexperts making it clearer every day how much we need to act before \nmosquito season is in full effect, I was encouraged that Chairman Blunt \nand others on the Appropriations Committee were willing to work with \nDemocrats on a first step to respond to this emergency. The agreement \nwe have reached would put a down payment on the President's proposal \ninto the hands of our first responders and researchers right away. It \nwould provide much needed relief for Puerto Rico, backfill nearly $100 \nmillion in essential public health funding that the administration had \nbeen forced to reprogram, invest in prevention and support services for \npregnant women and families at home and abroad, and put research \ndollars into developing a vaccine.\n  I believe the Republicans should do what we have urged them to do for \nmonths and join Democrats in supporting the President's full emergency \nfunding request. But if they continue to refuse, then at the very \nleast, they should be willing to support a bipartisan first step toward \nprotecting families from this virus, and Democrats will continue \npushing for every necessary resource going forward.\n  Families across the country are looking to Congress for action on \nZika. They do not have time for lengthy debates about offsets, and they \ndon't have more time to wait. So I hope we can move very quickly to get \nthis emergency funding package through the Senate and the House and \nonto the President's desk. If we act now, we can help protect our \nfamilies across the country from the truly tragic consequences of this \ndisease, and there is no reason to delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, for months Democrats have asked the \nRepublicans who control the Senate to let us act, while the Zika virus \nhas spread across South America, Central America, and several U.S. \nterritories. For months, we have asked the Republicans who control the \nSenate to let us act, while more and more American travelers are back \nin the United States after contracting the Zika virus. For months, we \nhave asked the Republicans who control the Senate to let us act, while \nhealth experts at the World Health Organization, the National \nInstitutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention have begged Congress for the resources to fight this \ndisease. For months, we have asked Republicans who control the Senate \nto let us act, while more people infected by Zika have developed a \ndebilitating and sometimes fatal condition that damages the nervous \nsystem. For months we have asked the Republicans who control the Senate \nto let us act, while more mothers infected by Zika have given birth to \nbabies with severe brain defects. And for months, we have asked the \nRepublicans who control the Senate to let us act, while the President \nhas been forced to divert emergency funds from other critical areas, \nincluding the emergency Ebola response.\n  Today, months after President Obama first requested nearly $2 billion \nto fight the Zika virus in the United States, the Republicans who \ncontrol the Senate will finally let us vote on options for funding the \nZika response.\n  Today the Senate will consider three proposals. The first proposal \nwould completely fund the President's response plan. It offers our best \nhope to fully protect Americans, and I will vote for that proposal. I \nplead with every Senator to do the same because that is\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nwhat our Nation's experts have said it will cost to limit the sickness, \ndeath, and deformity caused by the Zika virus.\n  I know that some Republicans understand this point. Senator Rubio, \nwhose State of Florida is at great risk for local transmission of Zika, \nrecently said this:\n\n       I believe in limited government, but I do believe one of \n     the obligations of a limited Federal Government is to protect \n     our people from dangers, whether they be foreign enemies or \n     the risk of disease outbreak. . . . I don't think we want to \n     be halfway through the summer and wake up to the news that \n     hundreds and hundreds of Americans in multiple States have \n     been infected and we did nothing.\n\n  Senator Rubio supports fully funding the President's response plan. I \nhope it passes the Senate. If it doesn't, it will be because the \nmajority of Senate Republicans vote against it. If that happens, we \nwill be forced to consider another proposal.\n  The second proposal would give the President half of what is needed \nto fight the outbreak. I will support this proposal if that is the last \nresort, as will many Democrats, because this is a health emergency. If \nyour ship is sinking and you need 12 lifeboats but you can only get 6, \nyou take the 6. We will take whatever the Republicans who control the \nSenate are willing to give to protect the American people.\n  Cutting the Zika funding request in half might give Republicans a \nchance to tell people how tough they are on spending, and that may be \nhow Republican politics works, but it is not how science works. It is \nnot possible to delay a response to a health emergency for month after \nmonth without consequences. It is not possible to nickel-and-dime a \nresponse to a health emergency without consequences. Sure, the \nRepublicans' half measure is better than nothing. But an estimated 4 \nmillion people are facing the prospect of Zika infection by the end of \nthis year, and a half response is not good enough.\n  The final Republican proposal is even dumber. It would not only give \nthe President about half of what is needed but it would cover the cost \nby gutting the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides \nsignificant support to local public health departments all across the \ncountry. You heard that right. Some Senate Republicans think the best \nway to fund America's emergency response to the Zika virus is to rob \nfrom America's frontline responders who help identify and track \ninfectious diseases such as the Zika virus.\n  On the other side of Congress, House Republicans are kicking around \nan even more bizarre idea--funding only about one-third of the \nPresident's plan to fight Zika and doing it by cutting hundreds of \nmillions of dollars out of our Ebola response. With the Ebola epidemic \njust passed and still no FDA-approved vaccine or treatment for Ebola, \nwhat could possibly go wrong with that plan?\n  I simply do not understand the Republicans. The responsible thing to \ndo--the rational thing to do--is to invest the resources needed to stop \nthe Zika threat in its tracks and to invest in more science and public \nhealth infrastructure so that we are ready when the next crisis comes.\n  As congressional Republicans embrace this irrational anti-spending \nideology, this country is put in greater and greater danger. Instead of \ninvesting in research so we can develop effective treatments, instead \nof supporting careful planning so we are ready for the next health \nchallenge, and instead of fully funding emergency response \ninfrastructure so we are prepared to respond to new threats, these \nRepublicans govern by simply lurching from crisis to crisis.\n  We are in this mess with Zika--a mess that is about to get a lot \nworse--because of stupid decisions made right here in Congress. Keep in \nmind that Zika, like Ebola, is a disease we have known about for years. \nBut our ability to do the necessary research to eradicate these threats \nhas been undercut by Republicans' desire to make more and more budget \ncuts, even when they put the health of Americans in danger.\n  This country's scientific research capacity has been decimated. Over \nthe last decade, the budget of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases has lost about 20 percent of its purchasing power--\n20 percent. The Prevention and Public Health Fund that helps build the \ninfrastructure needed to prevent people from getting sick and to shut \ndown outbreaks like Zika has been on the Republicans' chopping block \nyear after year.\n  Here is the bottom line. Our doctors, scientists, and health \nofficials need our complete support in fighting this virus. They have \ntold us how much money they need to do that. The less money Congress \ngives them, the more people will be hurt by the Zika virus--more babies \nwith heartbreaking deformities, more adults with devastating illnesses.\n  The Zika virus does not care what politicians in Washington decide is \npolitically expedient. The virus is coming, and if Republicans block \nCongress from protecting the people of this country, then Republicans \nmust accept responsibility for the devastating consequences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, first of all, let me begin by saying how \nencouraged I am that we are finally seeing some action here in Congress \ndealing with the Zika virus. Today, we have not one but three separate \nproposals to deal with this which are going to come up for a vote.\n  I support fully funding the request made. People say the President's \nrequest. Fine, it came from the White House. But it is really the \nscientists' request, the doctors' request, and the public health \nsector's request for how to address this issue.\n  The fundamental point I make is twofold. We can pay for it. We can \nfind $1.9 billion. By the way, we can always come back later and find \nit, too, although I know that is hard to see happening here in \nWashington. But this is a public health emergency that cannot wait for \nthis extended debate on this issue, especially when you talk about an \n$18 trillion debt. Zika funding is not the reason why we have an $18 \ntrillion debt. It is not the national driver of our debt. That is why \ndealing with the long-term security of Medicare and Social Security is \nso critical. But we can pay for $1.9 billion, and we should. But it is \npublic health experts who have said the amount we need is $1.9 billion.\n  I continue to urge my colleagues to take this with the sense of \nurgency that the public health experts have. The people I have met \nwith, the people I have interacted with, and the people I have been \ntalking to are not political people. I haven't been talking to people \nin the White House political office. I have been meeting with people \nwho work at the Centers for Disease Control. I have been meeting with \npeople who work at the Florida Department of Health. I have been \ntalking to department of health officials in Puerto Rico. I have been \ntalking with doctors who are in the frontline of dealing with \nmicrocephaly and what it means long term for the children who have been \nimpacted by it. That is with whom I have been talking.\n  They have outlined the kinds of things we need to be doing. But more \nimportantly, what they outlined is that there is so much we still don't \nknow about Zika. For example, we don't know what the long-term \nconsequences are of a mother who is infected with Zika while pregnant \nand the child was born without microcephaly. We don't know what happens \nin 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, or 5 years down the road. But I do know \nthat many medical experts believe there will be further manifestations \nof the disease's impact on the central nervous system in many of these \nchildren years after this debate in Congress is finished.\n  I do know that Puerto Rico is being ravaged by this. Puerto Rico is a \nterritory of the United States. These are American citizens who have \nbeen infected with Zika. They don't have a Senator from Puerto Rico, \nalthough I am more than honored and grateful for the opportunity to \nspeak on their behalf on these issues. But what people have to \nunderstand is--this is not the right way to approach it, but even if \nyour approach is that it is Puerto Rico and it is not the mainland of \nthe United States, then I invite you to go to the airport in Orlando or \nMiami, and you can see the daily flights and the constant flow of \npeople back and forth.\n  We also look at the fact that the summer months are coming. This is a \nmosquito-borne infection. We know that mosquito season is here, and it \nis coming fast. We know that the Zika virus becomes more potent as \ntemperatures get warmer. Guess what. It is\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nabout to get really warm not just in Florida but throughout the Gulf \nCoast States and throughout the country.\n  We know that places such as Brazil have been deeply impacted by the \nZika virus. Guess what. Tens of thousands of people are about to travel \nthrough the United States to and from Brazil for the summer Olympics.\n  We know that Major League Baseball canceled a game in Puerto Rico \nbecause they believed it was a serious enough risk that they didn't \nwant to put the players at risk, not to mention the crowd.\n  We see something percolating, and we don't know much about it. We \nknow enough about it to know it is a serious problem. We do not know \nhow far this is going to go. As a result, we see the people of this \ncountry facing a public health threat, and our response should be to \ndeal with it the way medical experts say we need to deal with it.\n  We can put language in the proposal that says: If you don't end up \nspending the full $1.9 billion and you don't need all of that money, \nall of that money automatically goes back to Treasury within it a year \nor two if it hasn't been spent.\n  Why take the chance? Why take the chance that at some point this \nsummer we could have a significant and serious outbreak in the United \nStates of America when all the Senators are back in their home States \ndoing campaign stuff or whatever they are doing and have to come back \nhere and deal with it and explain to the people why, when doctors and \nmedical experts were warning us that this was a significant risk, we \ndecided to lowball it and spend less than what was called for by \nexperts.\n  By no means do I intend for this to sound as if I am criticizing \nSenators Murray and Blunt. I thank them for their work. They have tried \nto come up with a bipartisan proposal that can pass.\n  I said earlier, I am proud of the amendment that my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson, and I are proposing here today. I hope that \nthe $1.9 billion amount passes, but if we are left with a vote on the \nBlunt-Murray amendment, I think that is better than nothing, and I will \nsupport it. But why are we taking this chance? It makes absolutely no \nsense.\n  While I am happy that the Senate will hopefully take action on this \nissue, I am concerned about what I hear coming from the House. I am \nglad that they are finally beginning to move on the legislation and \nthat something is happening, but I am very concerned about the \ndirection of their own funding measure. Their funding measure isn't \neven $1.1 billion. It is $622 million, and quite frankly, that will not \ncut it. If we don't spend more than that on the front end, I believe we \nwill spend a lot more later on because the problem is not going to go \naway, and it certainly will not go away with $622 million to combat it. \nThis is concerning to me because even if we do manage to pass the $1.9 \nbillion request, I am afraid even that may not be enough for the long \nterm.\n  The issue that seems to be holding them back is the desire to offset \nspending. As I said, I support that 100 percent. I believe we can find \n$1.9 billion and transfer it from some other part of our budget to \nensure that we are not deficit-spending. We can do that and we should \ndo that. I am in favor of doing that, but that will not keep me from \ntrying to do something about it.\n  In times of public health emergencies, just like during times of \nnatural disasters, I don't think we should delay action while we try to \nfigure out these budgetary moves and try to agree on what we are going \nto cut from other parts of the budget. I still belive we should do it, \nbut we cannot hold back for another few weeks while we are trying to \nget to that point.\n  The administration has already diverted half a billion dollars that \nwas intended for the fight against Ebola, but the House would raid even \nmore of the Ebola funds for the Zika response.\n  It is easy to say: Ebola is not in the headlines anymore. We are not \nreading about it that much, so it must not be a problem.\n  Ebola still exists. It is not polio. We haven't eradicated it from \nthe United States or the world. It is just not a percolating crisis \nright now, but there is nothing to say that it couldn't pop up again.\n  By the way, these sorts of pandemics will become more and more common \nas people are able to extensively travel all over the world. We are at \nthe crossroads of a lot of that travel.\n  I don't think I am prepared to walk away. Maybe they don't need the \nfull half a billion dollars, but I think it would be shortsighted to \nsay that Ebola is finished, so we don't have to worry it anymore. There \nhas to be some money available in case that comes up again, because it \ncould.\n  I believe the House can and should do better than what it has \nproposed and should provide offsets to the spending--provide the $1.9 \nbillion offsets. I guarantee they will be able to find that fairly \nquickly. They could provide stringent accountability measures. They \ncould stipulate in the law that they pass, for example, that if we are \nwrong and don't end up spending or needing anything close to $1.9 \nbillion or even $1.1 billion, that the taxpayers' money will be \nreturned to the Treasury. But let's not play with fire.\n  As of now, there are 112 people in the State of Florida who have been \ninfected. We have many more American citizens who have been infected in \nPuerto Rico. There are many unborn children who are at risk, and many \nmore will be impacted once mosquito season sets in. At the end of the \nday, these are the people we should be fighting for, and quite frankly, \nwe can do much better than what the House is proposing.\n  This is a devastating disease. It has taken lives throughout our \nhemisphere, and the way it impacts unborn children alone should call us \nto action. We have seen the images from Brazil of the children born \nwith microcephaly. This is a devastating condition. The cost of caring \nfor those children throughout their lives is extensive, and we are \ngoing to do it. We need to do it, and we will do it, but let's try to \nprevent it. Let's try to get ahead of it. Let's try not to just be \nreactive but proactive.\n  There are reports in the press today that scientists have been able \nto take a significant step toward potentially creating a vaccine. Once \nthere is a vaccine for Zika, this problem will be under control.\n  As I said earlier, let's not play with fire. I hope my colleagues \nwill jump on board and fully fund the $1.9 billion. If they want, we \ncan put language in the legislation that says that if the money isn't \nfully spent, it will be refunded to the Treasury.\n  Why take the chance? Why take a chance on an issue that is not yet \nwell defined? Why take the chance on a disease that we still don't know \neverything about? Why take the chance that we could have an outbreak \nmuch worse than anything any of us anticipated and be caught off guard? \nWhy take the chance that you will have to go home in August and \nSeptember and explain to millions of people across this country why so \nmany Americans are now being infected by this disease and you lowballed \nour approach to it a few months ago? Why take the chance?\n  Let's do it once. Let's get it right. Let's ensure that we are \nprotecting our people and deal with it now and deal with it fully. This \nis our obligation, and I hope we will embrace it here today. There is \nno reason we should not fully fund this proposal and listen to the \ndoctors and health care experts who are asking us for this and build \nfrom there. I hope that is what my colleagues will do in a few hours \nwhen we vote on these proposals that stand before us.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak with regard to \nproviding funding for the emerging Zika crisis that the Senate will be \nconsidering on the floor today.\n  We in this body and the entire Congress over the past several years \nhave provided a lot of additional health-related supplemental funding. \nIn fact, over the past 13 years, roughly $19 billion has been directed \ntoward health-related emergency supplemental funding. This, of course, \ndoes not include the hundreds of billions of dollars in\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\nother supplemental spending that has circumvented the budgetary \noversight process.\n  With a national debt of $19 trillion, we have to make sure we budget \nfor these types of emergencies. When we have appropriated on a \nsupplemental basis $19 billion over the past 13 years--supplemental \nhealth funding--then we know we need to budget for this type of crisis \nand not simply go the supplemental route and go out from under our \nbudgetary caps.\n  I will support cloture today on the measure that includes an offset. \nWe have to be more fiscally responsible as we deal with these crises. \nThis is a crisis we need to deal with, but we ought to at least attempt \nto offset that funding. I believe taxpayers deserve nothing less than \nthat.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it has been 3 months since the \nadministration sent Congress the emergency funding request for Zika, \nand Congress hasn't acted on it. But today we have an opportunity to do \nso, and I hope we do.\n  We will have pending before the Congress three different options on \nhow to fund this public health emergency, but we must realize it is an \nemergency, and we need to have a sense of urgency to protect the \nAmerican people and to help those south of the border to be able to \ncope with it. What are we waiting for? The mosquitoes are here. The \nmosquitoes have not only come, they have already come.\n  I have said in the past that we can't build a wall to keep them out--\nthe mosquitoes will not pay for it--but it is no laughing matter. The \nPresident has said we need $1.9 billion to fight Zika to stop it from \ndoing any more harm. That is what I am fighting for. We know we need to \nget the job done.\n  It is not just Senator Barb talking. The World Health Organization \nhas declared Zika a public health emergency. The President declared it \nas such. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through Dr. \nFreiden, has said this is a national and international emergency. And \nDr. Fauci, head of the Institute of Infectious Diseases and Neurology \nat NIH, whom we have turned to on so many occasions, has also said it. \nSo every public health entity has validated that this is a serious \npublic health crisis.\n  We can prevent its dire consequences. Through action, particularly \nrelated to mosquito control and working with pregnant women and women \nof childbearing age, we can deal with this. This is not some unknown \ndisease that would suddenly be arriving on our shores for which we \nwould have no knowledge and no tools. These are basic public health \ntools related to mosquito control and helping women of childbearing \nage.\n  If we refuse to act, this will be a self-inflicted wound on our own \npeople, and the consequences are dire. For those who care about \nchildren--I am sure we have already seen what has happened south of the \nborder with little children being born with microencephalitis. My gosh, \nit is heartbreaking. It is heartbreaking for the little child with a \nlimited life expectancy and limited life opportunities, the \nresponsibility that will come to the family--usually to the mother--and \nto the society that will have to care for that child.\n  Today we are talking about money, but we have to think about the \nhuman concerns. Both Dr. Freiden and Dr. Fauci have conveyed to me and \nother Members of this body, particularly those on the Appropriations \nCommittee and on the Health and Education Committee, that there are \nother unknown health issues related to those over the age of 65 or \nthose with compromised immune situations now. If you have a chronic \ncondition like diabetes, you could be subject to really negative \nconsequences from being bitten. We have heard about Guillain-Barre. \nThere are other diseases that are a consequence of Zika that give \narthritic symptoms that can last for over 10 years.\n  Why don't we do something about it? We know that mosquitoes carry \nZika. We already know they are in several States. We know Puerto Rico \nis already being hard hit. Sports events and other events have been \ncanceled. We know it is down in Florida. Look at the way Senators \nNelson and Rubio are working together. We need to act, and we need to \nact now because we do know these horrible and devastating impacts. We \nhave heard eloquent and poignant and even wrenching descriptions of \nwhat happens to children.\n  I know a topic in our Congress and in the Senate has often been the \nunborn. Well, we really want to protect the unborn, and this is the way \nto do it. We have to stop the mosquitoes through mosquito control.\n  This is basic public health. We also have to work with those women \nwho are pregnant or of childbearing age to know about the consequences \nand what actions they can take to be able to do that. We need to be \nable to do this at the Federal level. Congress needs to act.\n  They are already acting at a local level, but they are spending local \nmoney to be able to do it. My own Governor, a Republican, Larry Hogan, \nis acting. He convened a task force. He pulled his public health people \ntogether. He ordered his own health department to coordinate education \nand awareness with local health departments in Maryland. I salute \nGovernor Hogan in taking that action. He has already authorized the \ndistribution of thousands of prevention kits for pregnant women across \nthe entire State. Those kits cost about $130,000 to put together and to \ndistribute. Maryland is doing this on its own dime. Well, mosquitoes \nare a national consequence and even an international one.\n  The counties in Maryland are doing their job--again, not Democrat or \nRepublican. Again, my Governor is a staunch fiscal conservative, but he \nknows public health saves money, along with helping people with their \nlives.\n  Anne Arundel County, the home of the State capital, headed by a \nRepublican county executive, is acting. This local county is already \ndistributing its own prevention kits. It is not only the State capital, \nit is the home of the Naval Academy. Everybody is acting on their own.\n  In Baltimore City, our mayor is acting, working with the Bloomberg \nSchool of Public Health. We are spending local money on mosquito \ncontrol. They need help. They need help from their own government to \ndeal with the issue south of the border as they come up here, and they \nneed help in their own communities to be able to fund the basic public \nhealth measures that we know are tried and that we know are true to be \nable to do that. I really encourage us to be able to do this and not to \ndo it by raiding our programs.\n  I absolutely oppose taking money from the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund to pay for Zika. The prevention fund provides resources to \nStates against other public health problems. We can't prepare for and \nprotect against Zika by taking funds from other public health \nactivities. We don't know what the summer and the winter hold. States \ncould lose as much as 40 percent of their surveillance dollars to track \nother infectious diseases.\n  We have been asked for a very straightforward set of options. There \nis the Nelson-Rubio amendment asking for $1.9 billion. That is what I \nsupport. It would fully fund our measures, both nationally and \ninternationally, and particularly help deal with the spread of this \ndisease and helping local communities.\n  I reject another amendment that will be coming, offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, who is well intentioned, and I \nappreciate his sincere interest in this. But he is robbing the \nprevention fund. We need an urgent supplemental. This was an unexpected \nevent, which means that it is temporary, it is unexpected, and we need \nto deal with it.\n  I really want to congratulate--I know Senator Blunt and Senator \nMurray have been working on another option if the other two fail. \nWhatever it is, at the end of the day we need to take action. This is a \npublic health emergency. We need to deal with it in the most \nexpeditious way. I know every Senator here is concerned about it.\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\n  The mosquitoes have already come to Maryland. What we don't want is \nto be stung by its consequences. So let's get on with the business of \nthe day. I thank my colleagues for dealing with this issue now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk about the amendment I have \noffered with Senator Murray and Senator Mikulski and Senator Cochran. \nThe chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee \nhave joined in that amendment, as have Senator Graham and Senator \nLeahy. The committees involved are truly looking at this, trying to \nfind a way forward that allows us to take action. We do need to take \naction, as my good friend from Maryland has just so well explained.\n  There is no vaccine. There is no simple diagnostic test. There is no \nway to treat the virus once you get infected. So communities really \ndon't have very many options right now. The limited resources they have \nto manage the one thing we can do something about immediately besides \neducation--the local mosquito population--are resources that are not \nnearly adequate to meet the current need.\n  At this time, there is no way to fully prevent the infection, leaving \nhigh-risk populations at risk, especially pregnant women or women \ntrying to get pregnant. That seems to be the population where the \nimpact of this disease--the impact of this Zika infection--has not only \nthe most short-term but the most long-term implications because of \nmicrocephaly and other things that are going to be impacting children \nborn.\n  I am told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that \nevery indication now would be that once you have had Zika, you cannot \nget it again. It becomes the inoculation, so just because you get Zika \nand may at a later time become pregnant, you are not likely to have the \nsame thing. That is one of the studies going on, to verify for sure \nthat is the case and also to verify for sure how long after you have \nhad Zika that pregnancy can still be a problem.\n  This is a growing problem. There are already 650 confirmed Zika cases \nin the U.S. territories, with the majority of those being in Puerto \nRico. There are over 500 travel-associated cases of Zika in the United \nStates. If they got it here, it has been through sexual transmission \nand not from the mosquitoes themselves because obviously it is not \nmosquito season yet, but that is very close.\n  This is a public health threat and clearly an emergency. This is not \nsomething we can plan now to deal with 2 years from now because 2 years \nfrom now would be too late to deal with this crisis. However, I want to \nmake clear that our deliberations over the supplemental request have \nnever been an either-or scenario. There has never been a scenario where \nwe are either going to rubberstamp the administration's request or do \nnothing. That straw man will not work. That is not the situation.\n  We need to evaluate this request. The request has certain items the \nadministration asks for that I think if you look at them not even very \nclosely--and certainly when you look at them closely--you find out they \nare unnecessary, they are unwarranted.\n  This is a bill designed to address an emergency situation, not a bill \ndesigned to make the most of an emergency. For example, the \nadministration's proposal has a request for the building and expansion \nof new Federal buildings; $85 million of that initial request was to \nbuild new buildings. There is no way those buildings would probably \neven be started during the so-called emergency timeframe or during the \nreal emergency timeframe. Certainly they would not be of use during the \ntimeframe. That is not a real reason to ask for money; it is just an \nexcuse to ask for money. The Congress could, should, and I believe will \nsay: No, we are not going to do that.\n  The second request I would like to point out today, the request to \nprovide the department of health with $175 million of that $1.9 \nbillion, was just a slush fund. It was just a fund with virtually \nunlimited authority to transfer that $175 million or any part of it to \nany purpose of any Federal Government agency.\n  There may be some purposes in this emergency we don't know about yet, \nbut they are not going to be $175 million, and they are not the kind of \nemergency appropriations you couldn't get by other means where the \nCongress is clearly involved. We did not provide this kind of funding \nin the Ebola crisis when the Democrats were in charge of the Senate. We \nshould not provide it today.\n  There is no reason for a $175 million undesignated fund to be used \nanywhere in the Federal Government, any more than there is a reason to \ntake $85 million and build a new Federal building, and say ``Well, it \nis part of the Zika emergency'' because it clearly is not. If there is \na need for a Federal building at CDC, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention can come to the Congress and make that case. That is the \nway that should be done.\n  If this amendment prevails today, that money will not be available. \nIt is not unreasonable to ask the administration for details on what \nactivities would be funded. What are their priorities, and when would \nthey realistically spend these funds?\n  The $1.1 billion emergency fund would take us through the end of not \njust this fiscal year but the next fiscal year, about the same time we \nwould hope in talking to the National Institutes of Health that a \nvaccine will be available. Once a vaccine is available, we will need to \nlook at this Zika infection in a new way, and we will get to look at it \nin a new way.\n  If the administration had been a little more transparent at first, \nmaybe we could have reached this point earlier. But to suggest that the \nCongress has needlessly delayed funding is both unfair and untrue.\n  I also think that this is the time we can move forward. The role of \nthe Appropriations Committee is to look at this and to see that the \nmoney appropriated is going to be spent in the right way.\n  In the meantime, the administration has made available to the Zika \ncrisis almost $600 million. Mr. President, $589 million is a lot of \nmoney. It is particularly a lot of money when it is basically one-third \nof what was being asked for. Whether what was being asked for was \nnecessary or not, $589 million of unobligated funds that were available \nin other places have been brought to this cause.\n  The fact that the administration did that shows in a good way just \nhow serious they are about the crisis. If this were not a real crisis, \nthey would not be taking $589 million that in some process would be \nspent somewhere else and say: Listen, we need to spend this on Zika \nright now. But for the people we work for, it is important to \nunderstand that $589 million is being spent on this, and that is no \nmore than what would possibly have been spent if this appropriation \nwould have happened the day the administration asked for it.\n  The Appropriations Committee took the necessary time to understand \nthe funding needs and response requirements to ensure that we protect \nall Americans, including taxpaying Americans. We worked in a bipartisan \nmanner to provide the Department of Health and Human Services and the \nDepartment of State with targeted funding to respond to Zika.\n  Today we have that result, a bipartisan amendment worked out between \nthe leaders of the Appropriations Committee and the Labor HHS and State \nand Foreign Operations Subcommittees to meet this emergency. \nSpecifically, I worked with my ranking member on Labor HHS, Senator \nMurray, to reach an agreement that will provide $850 million to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to respond in a three-pronged \nstrategy.\n  First, that Department is to provide the funds necessary to develop \nvaccine candidates, therapeutics, and new diagnostic tools.\n  Secondly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able \nto focus responsible efforts domestically and internationally on the \nhighest priority activities, such as vector control, emergency \npreparedness, and public health outreach.\n  Finally, the supplemental provides targeted funding to Puerto Rico, \nwhich public health experts believe will be the most at-risk area in a \nZika outbreak.\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\n  Additionally, this amendment, with the work of Senator Graham and \nSenator Leahy, includes $248 million for the Department of State and \nUSAID to support other affected countries' ability to implement \nprograms to reduce the transmission of the virus.\n  This amendment is a targeted response providing the funding needed \nthrough 2017. It includes funding for priority initiatives focused on \nprevention, control, and treatment. It does not include funding for \nunessential requests.\n\n  I hope at the end of the day all Members find a way to meet this \nemergency. I believe the bipartisan amendment we are offering is the \nmost likely of these amendments to meet the need. Certainly, in my \nview, it is the amendment that has taken the most focus on exactly what \nis needed to meet this crisis and meet it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Missouri \nthat while this Senator is most appreciative that he and Senator Murray \nhave come forth in a bipartisan fashion with about half of the funding \nthat this Senator--also in a bipartisan proposal, since my colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Rubio, is the sponsor of this amendment with this \nSenator, I would point to the Senator's own words commending the \nadministration that they recognized that this was crisis enough to go \nin and borrow $580 million from the Ebola fund to get started, since we \ncouldn't get Congress off dead center until now.\n  I commend Senator Blunt and Senator Murray for their action. I \ncommend the leadership for being willing to put this on the T-HUD bill, \nappropriations bill, but for the Senator to suggest that he raised that \npoint that it was such an emergency--$589 million--but the \nAppropriations Committee proposal only replaces the $589 million that \nhas been taken from the Ebola fund. It replaces, replenishes it only \nwith $88 million instead of $589 million.\n  By the way, the news just broke. There is another outbreak of Ebola.\n  This Senator is not here to talk about Ebola. This Senator is on the \nfloor to talk about another health care medical emergency, of which \nthere is well over 100 cases in this Senator's State of Florida. \nSenator Rubio and I are desperately trying to help.\n  Before Senator Blunt leaves, I wish to say one other thing. He \nmentioned that we need to control the vector. What does that mean? The \nvector is the gremlin that spreads the virus; that is, the aegypti \nstrain of mosquito. That mosquito is now all over the southern United \nStates, especially in Puerto Rico, and mosquito control costs money.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from one of my counties, the Osceola County Commission, saying \nthat they desperately need the funds as they are out of funds for \nmosquito control.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 12, 2016.\n     Subject: Mosquito Control--Urgent Need for Funding\n     Emergency Funding Request,\n     Florida Department of Health Emergency Prepardness and \n         Response, Tallahassee, FL.\n       On February 04, 2016 Governor Scott declared a state of \n     public health emergency for four Florida counties. This \n     public health emergency has placed Osceola County under \n     significant financial pressure. Our program is locally funded \n     with an annual budget of less than $500,000 for arthropod \n     control, so the County does not have the additional resources \n     to address this catastrophic public health emergency.\n       At the time of the Governor's Declaration, Osceola already \n     had ceased operations and gone into off-season mode. However, \n     on February 05, 2016, local media covered the first case of \n     Zika virus in Osceola County. Since then, the virus has \n     expanded into several other areas and resulted in a \n     substantial service demand increase, and the number of Zika \n     cases is still climbing, even as resources are being \n     depleted. Media continues to report that the positive cases \n     are all travel-related--with Central Florida hosting more \n     than 63 million visitors annually, and with Osceola County's \n     predominant Hispanic demographic, we are the epicenter for \n     this life-threatening virus.\n       Current staffing levels are not sufficient to meet this \n     emergency. County resources are exhausted, and funds are not \n     readily available to respond to this disaster. Lives are at \n     stake.\n       To date, we have tried to be as creative as possible, \n     reallocating staff and other departmental resources to \n     respond to the public threat. We have shifted larvacide staff \n     to go door to door, conducting Zika sweeps in response to \n     service calls. This shifting of staff has reduced our ability \n     to larvicide, which creates a catch-22 situation--larva not \n     eliminated today become biting adult mosquitos tomorrow. \n     While it's hard to predict all the potential mosquito control \n     needs for the remainder of this year, the continuing \n     emergency situation and citizen anxiety continues to require \n     a heightened awareness and response.\n       Below is a list of currently identified funding shortfalls, \n     with potentially more to come as the summer trap numbers \n     rise.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional full-time temporary staff to perform day time        $200,000\n sweeps and Larvicide...................................\nFunding for increased aerial spraying...................         100,000\nAdditional Back Pack Sprayers (5 X 1800.00).............           9,000\nExtra on-hand fuels, chemicals, dry ice and baits.......          50,000\nPrivate contractor for Tire pile removal................         250,000\n5 spray trucks with mounted sprayers to increase                 200,000\n frequency of adulticide treatments county wide.........\nAdditional funding for spray driver pool (to compensate           80,000\n for additional work for night-time drivers)............\n                                                         ---------------\n    Total initial request...............................         889,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Donald Fisher,\n                              County Manager, Osceola County BOCC.\n\n  Mr. NELSON. What Senator Rubio and I have is an emergency \nappropriation of $1.9 billion, although it is not treated that way in \nthis appropriations bill.\n  The Centers for Disease Control predicts that up to 25 percent of our \nfellow American citizens on the island of Puerto Rico are going to be \ninfected by the end of the year; that is, 800,000 people just there.\n  Already in the United States, we have over 1,000 cases reported in 45 \nStates; 113 of those 1,000 are in Florida. Most of them are in South \nFlorida, Miami-Dade County. Yesterday we just had another case that \nbrought that total to 113. Those 113 cases are spread all over the \nState of Florida.\n  The community leaders, as indicated by this letter from Osceola \nCounty, are saying they are out of funds. Help. This is an emergency. \nWith four reported cases of the virus so far just in that county, which \nis near Orlando, they have determined they will need to triple their \nannual budget for mosquito control.\n  The county manager writes:\n\n       This public health emergency has placed Osceola County \n     under significant financial pressure.\n       County resources are exhausted, and funds are not readily \n     available to respond to this disaster. Lives are at stake.\n\n  Think about what the House has done--a $600 million Zika bill. That \nis nowhere what we need. Such a figure is not only absurd, it is an \ninsult to the men and women who are on the frontlines trying to battle \nthis virus. These are local governments, such as the one I mentioned in \nOsceola County. We have an opportunity to respond.\n  This Senator understands it is already baked in the cake. Even though \nthis proposal by Senator Rubio and me is bipartisan, it is already \nbaked in the cake that it is going to be the $1.1 billion, but beware. \nThe crisis is looming. We haven't gotten an effective method for \ncontrolling the mosquito. We do not have a vaccine. All of these things \ntake time, they take money, and it is going to need research. There is \n$277 million in this proposal that Senator Rubio and I think needs to \ngo to the National Institutes of Health to accelerate their research \nfor a vaccine and other basic research.\n  When you compare the two competing provisions out here today--the \ncommittee position and ours--going to Puerto Rico, ours is $250 \nmillion. That island is devastated--$250 million for Medicaid funds. \nWhat is in the committee report is $126 million--half.\n  For example, take the $743 million in our proposal for the CDC, the \nCenters for Disease Control. In the committee, there is $449 million. \nOverall, take the funding to HHS. There is $105 billion in ours and \nroughly half, $850 million, in the committee provision.\n  I think we should not nickel-and-dime our response to what the World \nHealth Organization has said and already declared a public health \nemergency of international concern. The urgency is now and we ought to \ndo the right thing.\n  I conclude by staying we have the Olympics in a few months in Rio. \nBrazil is covered with Zika infestation and infection. Remember, it \ncannot\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nonly be transmitted by the mosquito, the aegypti, but it can also be \ntransmitted sexually.\n  Also, remember the doctors do not know--other than to suspect that it \ncan be transmitted to the pregnant woman any time during the 9 months \nof pregnancy and it may not show up in the infant until years later in \nsome developmental issue. They do know that in the first trimester of \npregnancy, the infected virus is producing the babies with \nmicrocephaly. Such a case was just reported with an infected pregnant \nwoman in Puerto Rico.\n  We have not heard the last of this, and you are going to see it \nmagnified with regard to the Olympics. Sooner or later we are going to \nhave to face the music. It looks like we are going to face the music \nwith about half of the appropriation today. Ultimately, this is a full-\nblown emergency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while our colleague from Florida is on the \nfloor, I thank him for being a loud and vocal proponent and for taking \nswift action. I thank the Senator for leading the fight.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator for his support because he recognizes \nthe emergency.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in support of emergency \nsupplemental funding for Federal efforts to combat the impending threat \nof the Zika virus.\n  Reports of the spread of this virus are concerning. Actually, they \nare troubling, not just for public health officials but for many \nAmericans who are reading about it in the paper and seeing coverage of \nit in the news almost by the hour. Families are reconsidering vacations \nthey had planned, especially to more tropical locations.\n  As we approach the mosquito season, people are understandably worried \nabout how this outbreak will affect them and their families, not just \nto go on a vacation and camping but literally to go outside and have a \ncookout or eat out on the porch.\n  We need to continue working to fully understand and combat the health \nrisks that are posed by Zika. Just like our response to Ebola, our \nresponse to Zika must be an all-hands-on-deck effort.\n  In February, President Obama submitted a $1.9 billion emergency \nsupplemental funding request to Congress to bolster programs and \nactivities which would curb the spread of this virus. Given the real \nthreat posed by Zika, I support the funding level requested by the \nPresident. I intend to vote for the amendment offered by our colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Nelson, which would fully fund this request.\n  With that being said, I understand that a bipartisan agreement on \nfunding has been reached between Senator Blunt and Senator Murray, \nwhich would provide $1.1 billion toward the Zika effort. I appreciate \ntheir hard work in negotiating this language. I am going to support \ntheir amendment as well so our Nation's public health officials can \ntake all necessary actions to combat the spread of this virus.\n  As we have heard, the Zika virus has spread explosively throughout \nCentral America and South America. In fact, it has already reached \nPuerto Rico, other U.S. territories, and is expected to spread further \nnorth as the weather continues to warm.\n  Researchers have learned much about this virus in just the last \ncouple of months. Their findings are indeed troubling.\n  Last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced \nthere is now enough scientific evidence to confirm what many have long \nspeculated--the Zika virus is the direct cause of severe birth defects.\n  Further complicating matters, it now appears that the mosquito \nprimarily responsible for transmitting the virus has a wider presence \nin the United States than we had originally thought.\n  I have two maps. We will look at the first one.\n  The blue color is not good. Orange is less dangerous, less \nthreatening in terms of the mosquitoes. The combination of the blue and \nthe orange is troubling. If you look at the combination of blue and \norange, it means that the two most worrisome mosquitoes are going to be \ncovering the southern half of our country this summer.\n  The areas to the northeast and the Midwest, to the northern part, are \nsomewhat less troubling, but my State of Delaware is right here.\n  Arizona, the State of the Presiding Officer, is right over here. \nSenator Nelson's State is right here. The only person on the floor \nwhose State looks like they are going to escape is Maine. Senator \nCollins is here. Maybe she is in the clear, but she is here to help \nlead the fight to make sure we are all in this together and we are \nlooking out for each other.\n  I wish to show another map. Major cities across the East Coast, \nincluding in the District of Columbia, could be hit hard by the Zika \nvirus.\n  With mosquito season upon us and with more than 500 travel-related \ncases already diagnosed within the continental United States, we must \nbe prepared for the possibility of outbreaks in some parts of this \ncountry. That is why I was glad to see President Obama and his \nadministration take an early and proactive role in addressing Zika. \nSome of the actions already undertaken by Federal agencies include \nassisting State and local governments in mosquito-control efforts and \nensuring that local health officials have the equipment they need to \ntest people for this disease.\n  We also know that promising advances are being made in medical \ncountermeasures and vaccine development. To date, these efforts have \nrequired the transfer of resources from other priorities, as we know, \nincluding Ebola. Last month the Obama administration announced it would \nredirect, on an interim basis, almost $600 million from other public \nhealth accounts to pay for Zika-related activities. I believe the \nPresident made the right call in light of the circumstances and the \ndire threat that is posed by the Zika virus.\n  Now, however, it is time for this Congress to do our job. It is my \nhope that we can come together in passing an amendment offered by our \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Nelson. However, if we are unable to \nfully fund the President's request, I believe the funding provided by \nthe Blunt-Murray amendment will go a long way toward supporting the \nmany efforts currently being undertaken by the administration to combat \nZika. I urge my colleagues to join me in providing the funding needed \nto stop the spread of the Zika virus.\n  Mr. President, I will close with this: When the President gave his \nState of the Union speech--I think right after the 2014 election--he \nhad up in the Gallery sitting next to Mrs. Obama some of the folks who \nhelped lead the fight against Ebola in Africa. There were doctors, \nnurses, and other people who developed vaccines and that type of thing. \nIt was a proud moment for our country about 3 months after the \nelection, the early part of 2015.\n  We were not directly threatened here by Ebola. They lost 40,000 \npeople in Africa, in the western part of Africa. For the most part, \nthere were a lot of scare tactics about Ebola used in the runup to the \nelection here in this country, but the actual threat, in hindsight, was \nnot that great.\n  What we did was we reached across the world and we invested a lot of \ntaxpayer resources to help people who were in a terrible situation. We \nhelped save literally hundreds of thousands of lives--their lives; not \nso much our lives but their lives. This is different. This is \ndifferent. What we have at stake here is our lives and the quality of \nour lives and the ability of women to bring healthy babies into this \nworld. It is not just us, it is our friends to the south of us in \nMexico, Central America, South America, the islands of Puerto Rico and \nCuba. We are all in this together.\n  This is an all-hands-on-deck moment, and we need a good team effort. \nThe Senate is going to vote today on whether we are going to be a full \npartner in that effort, and we need to be that full partner. We need to \ndo our job. And this is one of those days that I am confident and \nhopeful that we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the presence of the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, which hopefully will not be affected by this virus. I am \nhappy to yield to her.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, our Nation is facing a serious threat to \npublic health. The Zika virus has the potential to be a major public \nhealth crisis.\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, there are over 500 cases \nin the United States, including 9 in Hawaii. Currently, all of these \ncases are travel-related. There are 700 cases in U.S. territories, \nalmost all of which were locally acquired. Summer, which is the peak \ntravel season and peak mosquito season, is almost upon us. Every year, \n40 million Americans travel to Zika-affected countries. It is just a \nmatter of time before the threat of locally transmitted Zika becomes a \nreality in the United States.\n  Although the President sent his emergency funding request to fight \nZika to Congress more than 3 months ago, I am glad to see Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together now to prevent a major U.S. Zika outbreak. \nPublic health experts at the Centers for Disease Control, Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and elsewhere in the administration have \nsaid that $1.9 billion is needed to fight the Zika virus.\n  During the Senate's last State work period, I met with Hawaii \nresearchers and health care providers, who agreed that we need this \nFederal funding to get ahead of Zika. This funding would go toward our \nvector-control programs, education, and vaccine development.\n  I visited a Hawaii company--Hawaii Biotech--that is working on a Zika \nvaccine. This company has a proven track record in developing vaccines. \nHawaii Biotech has spent months working to develop a Zika vaccine using \nprivate funding. At this critical point of vaccine development, Dr. \nElliott Parks and his team at Hawaii Biotech agree that a public \ninfusion of funds will help them get over the finish line.\n  I also had the opportunity to visit with Governor David Ige, the \nHawaii director of health, and health care providers. They all shared \none message: that Federal funding is critical to getting ahead of a \nwidespread Zika outbreak.\n  The funding we are voting on today could help companies like Hawaii \nBiotech develop a much needed Zika vaccine. It would help States like \nmine increase mosquito control and awareness on Zika.\n  Zika is not the benign virus we once thought it was, and funding only \nbecomes more urgent as we learn about its harmful effects. Zika poses \nan imminent threat to pregnant women and, in reality, to all women of \nchildbearing age. By now, we have all seen the harmful impacts Zika has \non babies. The images and reports of babies born with microcephaly are \nheartbreaking. Zika can threaten our Nation's supply of donated blood. \nWhile blood banks across the country are working on methods to clean \nand test blood, they need funding to accelerate their research.\n  Congress can take steps to ensure the safety and well-being of all \ncitizens. We can be proactive, not reactive, to impending threats such \nas Zika.\n  The Federal Government should play a leading role in coordinating and \nassisting local and State governments with mosquito control and \nsupporting the latest research, much as we stepped up with Federal \nsupport when confronted with Ebola and avian flu.\n  While there are three Zika funding measures before us today, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on Senator \nNelson's amendment to fully fund the President's request at $1.9 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, what we do next on Zika is not an \nideological test; it is a test of our basic competence. It has nothing \nto do with one's views on the size and scope of the Federal Government \nbecause, after all, if you believe the government should do even just a \nfew things, preventing a catastrophic epidemic has to be one of them.\n  Zika is a public health emergency, and we have to act now to fund \n$1.9 billion in supplemental funding to address it, as requested by the \npublic health experts.\n  I congratulate Senators Nelson, Rubio, Blunt, and Murray for working \nacross the aisle to reach these agreements, and I would especially like \nto offer my support for the Nelson-Rubio $1.9 billion compromise. The \nNelson-Rubio amendment provides the full $1.9 billion in Zika funding \nthrough the following: approximately $743 million for the CDC, $277 \nmillion for NIH, $335 million for USAID, and $417 million for the State \nDepartment. And here is an important aspect of it: It also pays back \nthe borrowed Ebola money that we need to ensure that countries stay \nprepared to prevent another Ebola crisis.\n  There are a few proposals to pay for this, but I want to make the \nfollowing point: This is an emergency. It fits the definition \nprecisely, and so it shouldn't require a so-called pay-for.\n  I would like to say something to the Members who have rediscovered \ntheir fiscal conservatism. Remember that we just passed a $622 billion \ntax subsidy package last December, and none of it was paid for--more \nthan half a trillion dollars not paid for--and 5 months later we are \nnickeling-and-diming the Centers for Disease Control.\n  I recently visited CDC headquarters in Atlanta to learn more about \ntheir efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. \nI have total confidence in the CDC's ability to respond to challenges \nlike Zika, but we have to give them the strongest funding possible to \nmake sure they can do their good work. And taking money away from the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund will strip CDC and other important \nagencies of the funds they need to protect our country from within and \nfrom without.\n  It is fair to say that this is a Congress that has struggled to do \nits job. And even when it stumbles through a solution such as this, it \nsometimes creates a new set of problems. So far in addressing Zika, we \nhave forced the administration to pull money from the CDC for Ebola or \nfrom States to address public health risks. If you want to find \nsavings, there are plenty to be had in the Tax Code, including the more \nthan half a trillion dollar package that was passed in December, and \nnot a penny was paid for. There was $622 billion in tax subsidies--some \ngreat things in there, some questionable things in there--and not a \npenny of it was accounted for and paid for properly.\n  Regardless of your side of the aisle, we can all agree that this is \nthe one thing the government ought to do: keep us safe.\n  Thank you to Senator Rubio and others for their calls to make Zika \nfunding nonpartisan. Investing in the CDC and other agencies will \nprotect our citizens from horrific diseases and shouldn't depend on \nyour philosophy regarding the size and scope of the Federal Government.\n  Let's do our job. Let's keep the people of the United States safe. \nLet's fund this emergency for Zika and keep us safe from Ebola and \nother dangerous diseases.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the urgent \nneed for Congress to approve emergency funds to fight the Zika virus.\n  The Zika virus is a rapidly growing public health threat, and the \nstakes for women are particularly high. I strongly believe Congress \nshould approve the full $1.9 billion requested by the administration to \nfight the virus. Investing the required resources now will mean fewer \ncases of Zika down the road.\n  The virus is carried by two species of mosquito. They are found in 40 \nStates in this country. These mosquitos have been found in 12 counties \nin California, including the five most populous: Los Angeles, San \nDiego, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino. More than 20 million \npeople live in these counties.\n  There have been 503 travel-related cases in the United States so far, \nmeaning an individual was infected during a trip to Latin America, \nSouth America, or the Caribbean, where the virus is widespread.\n  There have not yet been any reported cases of local transmission in \nthe continental United States, although more than 700 cases have been \nreported in U.S. territories, including one fatality on April 29. It is \nonly a matter of when, not if, we see the first case of local \ntransmission, particularly as we approach the summer, when mosquitos \nare most active. By July, 7 States are expected to see high mosquito \nactivity.\n  While scientists are still working to understand the effects of the \nZika virus, they are more serious than we initially thought. Zika \ncauses severe, brain-related birth defects in babies when women are \ninfected during pregnancy.\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\n  Microcephaly, one of the most serious effects of Zika, causes babies' \nheads to be much smaller than normal. In severe cases, you will also \nsee seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, feeding \nproblems, and hearing and vision loss.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to research \nthe virus, and it could be several years before the full range of \nhealth effects is known.\n  The most common way people contract Zika virus is through mosquito \nbites, but there have been documented cases of the virus being spread \nfrom men to women through sexual contact. Scientists now believe sexual \ntransmission is more common than initially thought.\n  Zika symptoms are mild--fever, rash, and joint pain--meaning that \nmany people may become infected and spread with disease without knowing \nthey have it. Unless we act now, we could end up with a significant \nnumber of Zika carriers who don't know they are infected.\n  As I mentioned previously, the administration has asked Congress for \n$1.9 billion in emergency funding to stop the spread of the Zika virus. \nSenator Nelson introduced a bill, which I have cosponsored, to provide \nthe full $1.9 billion. Senator Nelson and Senator Rubio have also \nintroduced an amendment to the bill currently under consideration to \nprovide the full $1.9 billion. Last week, an agreement was reached \nbetween Senators Murray and Blunt on an amendment that would provide \n$1.1 billion in funding.\n  I applaud their efforts and know they worked hard to come to \nagreement on a package that could get broad bipartisan support. The \nFederal Government will use these funds for a number of prevention and \nmitigation activities, including controlling mosquito populations, \nresearching and testing for the virus, educating the public, and \ndeveloping a vaccine.\n  However, I think it is important to highlight what we are losing by \nfunding the Zika response at $1.1 billion and not $1.9 billion. Reduced \nfunding now will hinder our response in a number of ways.\n  It will be harder to address Zika in the future, with a potentially \nhigher cost. Notably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nwill receive nearly $300 million less. The National Institutes of \nHealth will receive $77 million less. The Health and Human Services \nEmergency Fund will receive $83 million less. This means that testing \nmay not be as widely available as it should be, and developing a \nvaccine may take longer.\n  There is also $114 million less to fight Zika abroad. We live in a \nglobal society. To prevent the spread of Zika virus, we must fight the \ndisease where it is, not wait for it to come here.\n  It's also important to note that we can't launch prevention and \nmitigation activities overnight. It takes time to address mosquito \npopulations and distribute testing kits. If we don't approve the \nnecessary funds now and Zika spreads, funds approved later may not be \nas effective.\n  Past is prologue, and we have seen the effects of similar health \ncrises. I remember when rubella was widespread in the United States \nbefore a vaccine was available. This is also a disease with mild \nsymptoms. It spread easily and was particularly dangerous for pregnant \nwomen and their babies.\n  The rubella vaccination campaign in 1969 was critical to stopping \nthis disease, which infected 12.5 million people from 1964-1965. In \n2004, the United States was declared rubella-free. We're down to an \naverage of 11 travel-related cases per year.\n  The point is we know enough about the Zika virus to understand that \nit is a serious threat. We also know from history how important it is \nto address public health threats as early as possible. This is \nespecially important when the virus is carried by an insect as common \nas mosquitoes and the initial symptoms of the disease are mild or even \nundetectable.\n  In closing, Congress cannot afford to delay. I strongly urge the \nSenate to approve the administration's sensible request to fight this \ngrowing public health threat. Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to speak in opposition to \nSenator Cornyn's amendment. This amendment eliminates protections under \nthe Clean Water Act related to spraying pesticides into the Nation's \nrivers, streams, and lakes to control mosquitoes.\n  Pesticide pollution is a significant problem and a major contributor \nto poor water quality in our Nation's water bodies. According to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, more than 1,800 waterways in the U.S. \nare known to be polluted by pesticides, and many more may be polluted \nbut are not monitored. We know that pesticides harm fish and wildlife \nand are linked to a wide range of damaging human health impacts, \nincluding cancer and harm to pregnant women, infants, and children.\n  Exempting pesticide spraying from the Clean Water Act is completely \nunnecessary to control the spread of mosquitoes to address the Zika \nvirus. In 2011, EPA issued a streamlined Clean Water Act general \npermit, which allows operators to get one permit for up to 5 years. The \npermit requires simple management techniques and reporting to protect \nwater quality, fish and wildlife habitat, swimming, and recreational \nuses.\n  Most mosquito control districts around the country already have \nauthorization to spray pesticides to control mosquitoes under this \nexisting pesticide permit. In addition, EPA's permit includes \nprovisions to allow immediate spraying to address public health \nemergencies. If a local government is not currently authorized to spray \nunder EPA's permit and a pest emergency is declared at the local, \nState, or Federal level, pesticides can be immediately sprayed to \naddress the health concerns without approval by EPA or a State.\n  In the case of Zika, States or local governments can declare a pest \nemergency under the general permit in areas where they believe Zika-\ncarrying mosquitos may be a problem, and they can immediately begin \nspraying pesticides to control the spread of the virus.\n  These requirements are a commonsense approach to ensure gallons of \nexcess pesticides are not dumped into our waters, and they provide \nsufficient flexibility to address public health threats, such as Zika.\n  The Cornyn amendment is not about improving the response to Zika. It \nis a backdoor attempt to gut the Clean Water Act, one of our Nation's \nbedrock environmental laws.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Cornyn amendment and help keep our \nwaterways clean.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3922, as Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the adoption of the Feinstein-Portman amendment No. \n3922 that it be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II of division A, insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __.  Section 218(g) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National \n     Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12748(g)) shall not apply \n     with respect to the right of a jurisdiction to draw funds \n     from its HOME Investment Trust Fund that otherwise expired or \n     would expire in 2016, 2017, 2018, or 2019 under that section.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on three \ndifferent versions of appropriations bills that will provide the needed \nmoney to help combat the anticipated challenges we are going to have \nwith the Zika virus, which we have talked a lot about. Obviously, Zika \nis a threat, particularly to women of childbearing age because of the \nhorrific birth defects associated with it, most prominently \nmicrocephaly, or basically a skull that is smaller than normal, leading \nto premature death and, obviously, horrific injuries.\n  There is bipartisan support for this legislation.\n  First of all, we will have a chance to vote on the President's \nrequest of $1.9 billion. The biggest objection I have to that $1.9 \nbillion is that it really doesn't come with a plan that says how the \nPresident will spend that money. It also is not paid for. As the \nPresiding\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nOfficer well knows, we have a huge national debt, and there is no \nreason to just gratuitously rack up more debt in order to deal with \nthis public health concern.\n  There is a second vote we will have on a $1.1 billion appropriations \nbill. This is the product of the good work done by Senator Roy Blunt of \nMissouri and Senator Patty Murray of Washington. They have cut down the \nPresident's request from $1.9 billion to $1.1 billion, and they believe \nthis will fund the needed work not only of this fiscal year but into \nthe next fiscal year as well. That is also not offset or paid for, and \nI think that is a problem.\n  First of all, the House has proposed a roughly $600 million bill that \nis fully offset, so we are going to have some differences between the \nHouse and the Senate over how we address the Zika virus challenge.\n  The third is a piece of legislation I have offered that I would \ncertainly ask my colleagues to support. This is fully offset out of \nsomething called the Prevention and Public Health Fund that was created \nby the Affordable Care Act. So there is money in the Treasury now that \ncould help pay for the $1.1 billion. I should say that about $900 \nmillion of it could be paid for now, and by next year there will be \nmore money put into this Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  As we can see, the Affordable Care Act provides that. This Prevention \nand Public Health Fund is ``to provide for expanded and sustained \nnational investment in prevention and public health programs.'' I can't \nimagine any more urgent public health program or one that we should be \nlooking to prevent more than this particular threat, the Zika virus.\n  I would point out that the Prevention and Public Health Fund has been \nused to fund some things--many good things, some which I think are \nquestionable, like promoting free pet neutering, encouraging urban \ngardening, and boosting bicycle clubs. Certainly, prevention of these \nhorrific birth defects and the threat of the Zika virus spreading \nthrough the continental United States and its impact on our population \nis more important than these.\n  So I ask my colleagues, please, let's deal with this threat in the \nresponsible way that we all agree we should, but let's do so in a \nfiscally responsible way as well. There is no reason to gratuitously \nadd to the deficit and the debt. We can do this in a responsible way \nfrom a public health standpoint and fiscally as well.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, is \ncoming to the floor at noon, and we are going to present a matter for \nthe Senate's consideration. I don't see him here yet, but I am told he \nis on his way. So let me turn to that topic, and I know Senator Schumer \nwill be here momentarily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2835-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2845-S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, all of us remember the horrible events of \nSeptember 11 and the grief and pain so many people went through in New \nYork. Roughly 3,000 people lost their lives. Obviously, the family \nmembers have not forgotten that, and the Nation hasn't forgotten their \nloss either.\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and I have introduced \nlegislation called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This \nis bipartisan legislation which would enable Americans and their family \nmembers who lost loved ones on that horrible day to pursue their claims \nfor justice against those who sponsored those acts of terrorism on U.S. \nhomeland.\n  This bill was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee without \nobjection, and similar legislation passed the Senate unanimously last \nCongress. I believe that kind of unanimous support sends a clear \nmessage: that we will combat terrorism with every tool we have \navailable and that the victims of terrorist attacks in our country \nshould have every means at their disposal to seek justice.\n  I am grateful for the work of the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, \nin introducing this bill along with me and Chairman Grassley for \nshepherding it through the Senate Judiciary Committee. I also \nappreciate the support of a large bipartisan group of like-minded \nSenators in this Chamber. We worked with a number of Senators, \nincluding the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from South Carolina, \nwho expressed concerns about earlier versions of the legislation. I \nappreciate their willingness to work with us to deal with their \nconcerns in a way that now has gained their support.\n  This legislation amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act passed \nin 1976. So we already have a piece of legislation on the books that \nwaives sovereign immunity under some circumstances, but the problem is \nthat it does not extend to terrorist attacks on our homeland by \ncountries and organizations that have not already been designated as \nstate sponsors of terrorism. This makes some small changes in that \nlegislation that first passed in 1976 to expand the scope of that to \nallow the families of the 9/11 tragedy to seek justice in our courts of \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, there are some aspects of the bill that I would like \nto discuss in particular, and to that effect I would like to enter into \na colloquy with my friend on a number of points.\n  Senators Sessions and Graham had expressed concern that earlier \nversions of this legislation might be interpreted to derogate too far \nfrom traditional principles of foreign sovereign immunity and put the \nUnited States at risk of being sued for our operations abroad. We \nworked extensively with them on this issue.\n  To alleviate the concerns they raised, the substitute amendment to S. \n2040 narrowly tailors the immunity exception in several way.\n  First, it is limited--like the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act's \n``tort exception''--to physical injury ``occurring in the United \nStates.'' The act of international terrorism that causes the injury \nmust also take place ``in the United States.''\n  This focus on U.S. territory avoids the issues raised by the State \nDepartment regarding section 1605A, the ``State Sponsor of Terrorism'' \nexception to the FSIA passed decades ago by Congress. Section 1605A \npermits jurisdiction over acts that occur anywhere, but is limited to \ncertain states.\n  Second, jurisdiction can only be predicated on acts of terrorism and \nnot on acts of war, as both terms are defined under the Anti-Terrorism \nAct.\n  Third, the injury must be ``caused by'' the tortious act or acts of \nthe foreign state. This language, which requires a showing of \njurisdictional causation, is drawn from decisions of Federal courts \ninterpreting section 1605A. Courts interpreting new section 1605B \nshould look to cases like Kilburn, Rux, and Owens, the analysis of \nwhich we intend to incorporate here.\n  Finally, this new version adopts the language of 1605A regarding the \nconduct of officials, employees, and agents of foreign states. This \nlanguage incorporates traditional principles of vicarious liability and \nattribution, including doctrines such as respondeat superior, agency, \nand secondary liability.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  My friend the senior Senator from Texas is exactly right: we have \nmade several changes to the bill since the last time it was \nintroduced--and passed--to make it as narrow and targeted as possible.\n  I join him in thanking Senators Sessions and Graham for working with \nus to strike the right balance.\n  I have two points on this.\n  Congress addressed terrorism under the FSIA decades ago, in what \nbecame section 1605A, the exception for ``state sponsors of \nterrorism.'' I want to make clear that JASTA is responding to a very \nspecific issue about terrorism on U.S. soil. It is not our intent to \nimply anything about other areas of law. Other provisions of this \nstatute allowing victims of terror to sue foreign governments for acts \nof international terrorism have a longstanding jurisprudence that JASTA \nis not meant to alter.\n  The new version of the legislation also includes an important new \ntool for the executive branch to address litigation against a foreign \nsovereign under section 1605B.\n  Section 5 allows the Department of Justice to seek a stay of the \nlitigation--including related cases, not against the foreign state \nitself--if the government certifies that it is involved in good-faith \ndiscussions to resolve the matter. This stay can be extended.\n  Of course, if the administration seeks to use this new authority, it \nshould be\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\nprepared to provide substantial evidence of good-faith negotiations to \nthe court such as details about those involved in the discussions and \ntheir authority to reach a resolution, where and when the discussion \noccurred and a timeline for resolving the matter.\n  I wish to say a few words about secondary liability under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act, which JASTA addresses.\n  The purpose of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act is to \nhold foreign sponsors of terrorism that target the United States \naccountable in Federal courts.\n  One thing that has come up in our discussions of this bill is whether \nthe bill's provisions would extend civil liability under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act to situations where someone has been forced to make \npayments or provide aid to aid to a foreign terrorist organization \nunder genuine duress or, for example, as ransom payments for the \nrelease of someone taken hostage. This type of conduct is outside the \nscope of traditional aiding and abetting liability and our bill does \nnot change that.\n  To sum up, the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act has been amended, and \namended again, in its relatively short life, in order to strike the \nproper balance between our interests abroad and the rights of our \ncitizens to obtain redress when they are victims of wrongdoing--no \nmatter who the perpetrator is. This version of JASTA would move our \nlaws even closer to that ideal balance.\n  I yield again to the senior Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would also like to say a few words about \nsecondary liability under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which JASTA \naddresses.\n  This bill is called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. It \nhelps fulfill the promise of the original Anti-Terrorism Act, which was \nintended to ``interrupt, or at least imperil, the flow of money'' to \nterrorist groups. So, while JASTA clarifies the rule for secondary \nliability, which may attach to terrorism sponsors, it doesn't impact \nother aspects of the ATA that may also make them liable. For example, \nthis bill is not intended to alter how violations of sections 2339A--\nmaterial support--or 2339C--terrorist financing--can be the basis for \ndirect liability under the ATA.\n  Mr. President, I would add, there is already litigation pending by \nthe families who lost loved ones on 9/11, and right now there appears \nto be somewhat of a split in the Federal courts with regard to the \nscope of sovereign immunity and whether it applies. This legislation \nwould basically clarify that both for pending cases and for future \nclaims.\n  At this point, I would defer to my friend, the Senator from New York, \nfor any statement he would care to make, and then I would be happy to \noffer a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Texas for \nyielding and for the great job he has done. This is another example of \nbipartisan legislation and, in fact, another example of a Cornyn-\nSchumer collaboration, which works pretty well around here.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have introduced this bill for the last three \nCongresses, first under the leadership of Senator Leahy and then under \nSenator Grassley. It has twice passed without objection through the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, once by the full Senate. I thank Senators \nLeahy and Grassley for their help as well.\n  The bill is very near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it \nwould allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice \nby giving them a legal avenue to hold foreign sponsors of terrorism \naccountable for their actions.\n  The courts in New York have dismissed the 9/11 victims' claims \nagainst certain foreign entities alleged to have helped fund the 9/11 \nattacks. These courts are following what we believe is a nonsensical \nreading of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. For the sake of the \nfamilies, I want to make clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that every \nentity, including foreign states, will be held accountable if they are \nfound to be sponsors of the heinous act of 9/11.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Texas, and I have worked hard to \nnarrow the bill to strike the proper balance between our interests \nabroad and the rights of our citizens to obtain redress when they are \nvictims of terrible wrongdoing. We had a colloquy for the Record that \ngoes into more detail on some of the legal nitty-gritty, but we cannot \nlose sight of the bigger picture: What this legislation means to the \nvictims of 9/11 transcends day-to-day politics.\n  One of the most impassioned advocates of this bill is Ms. Terry \nStrada, who is seeking justice for her husband Tom. Tom lost his life \nin the North Tower on September 11. Terry didn't just lose a husband; \nshe lost a father to a young son of 7, a daughter of 4, and a tiny baby \nboy who was born shortly after the towers fell. She lost a loving \nfather and her best friend. Terry Strada and many others are seeking \nwhat we would all be compelled to seek if we suffered such loss at the \nhands of hate and evil, which is simply justice.\n  The fact that some foreign governments may have aided and abetted \nterrorism is infuriating to the families if justice is not done. That \nis what they seek--justice, justice, justice.\n  Terry and her three children have championed this bill for over a \ndecade. They are not cursing the darkness--as would be human nature to \ndo--at their terrible, unjust, and almost inexplicable loss. Instead, \nher family and many other families have chosen to light candles, to do \nwhatever they can to make sure this never happens again, so that any \nforeign entity that would seek to choose to help and aid and abet and \ndo terrorism here on our shores will pay a price if it is proven that \nthey have done so.\n  So Terry and the other families are lighting candles--a saintly act. \nI thank them and all the other families as well--Monica Gabrielle, \nMindy Kleinberg, Lori Van Auken, Kristen Breitweiser, Patty Casazza--\nfor their tireless advocacy and patience.\n  In conclusion, JASTA is long overdue--a responsible, balanced fix to \na law that has extended too large a shield to foreign actors who \nfinance and enable terrorism on a massive scale. The victims of 9/11 \nand other terrorist attacks have suffered such pain and heartache that \nthey certainly should not be denied justice.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Texas for the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for his \ncomments and for his partnership in working on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 362, S. 2040.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2040), to deter terrorism, provide justice for \n     victims, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of \n     Terrorism Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n     that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n       (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n     punish crimes against the law of nations and therefore \n     Congress may by law impose penalties on those who provide \n     material support to foreign organizations engaged in \n     terrorist activity, and allow for victims of international \n     terrorism to recover damages from those who have harmed them.\n       (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n     foreign commerce of the United States by harming \n     international trade and market stability, and limiting \n     international travel by United States citizens as well as \n     foreign visitors to the United States.\n       (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n     affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n     outside of the United States for conduct directed and \n     targeted at the United States.\n       (5) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n     action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n     the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (6) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n     (D.C.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n     that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n       (2) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n     foreign commerce of the United States by harming \n     international trade and market stability, and limiting \n     international travel by United States citizens as well as \n     foreign visitors to the United States.\n       (3) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n     affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n     outside of the United States for conduct directed and \n     targeted at the United States.\n       (4) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n     action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n     chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code.\n       (5) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia in Halberstam v.

Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n     leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, provides the proper legal framework for how \n     such liability should function in the context of chapter 113B \n     of title 18, United States Code.\n       (6) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n     recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n     or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n     significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \n     threaten the security of nationals of the United States or \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States, necessarily direct their conduct at the United \n     States, and should reasonably anticipate being brought to \n     court in the United States to answer for such activities.\n       (7) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n     persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n     committed within the United States with full access to the \n     court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, \n     entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly \n     provided material support or resources, directly or \n     indirectly, to the persons or organizations responsible for \n     their injuries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil \n     litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with \n     the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against \n     persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and \n     wherever they may be found, that have provided material \n     support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or \n     persons that engage in terrorist activities against the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, there is an urgent need that we must \naddress--I hope it will be later in the day--which is emergency funding \nto facilitate a rapid response to a spreading public health crisis--now \nin Puerto Rico but threatening the rest of our Nation. There must be a \nrapid, robust response to the public health emergency the Zika virus \nposes.\n  Zika is a vicious, virulent virus capable of crippling and killing. \nWe have seen its effects in some cases of developmental disability that \nhas resulted to children. It poses a threat to 4 million people in the \nAmericas.\n  Connecticut may not be generally thought to have a warm climate, but \nthe mosquitoes are swarming and spawning there. They include a type of \nmosquito--the Asian tiger--that has now been documented to carry Zika. \nThis poses an immediate and urgent threat for Connecticut and for the \nentire eastern coast and Northeast United States.\n  There is a way that Connecticut is contributing to a solution. Two of \nour companies in Connecticut, Quest and Protein Sciences, are actively \nworking on a vaccine. I visited Protein Sciences recently and saw \nfirsthand the work that is being done there, but the scientists at that \ncompany and others working on a vaccine need this emergency funding. \nThat is their plea to us, and I hope we will respond to it today--not \njust because the vaccine is needed, but it must be part of a broader \neffort, to include eliminating and eradicating mosquitoes wherever \npossible, educating the public on how to protect themselves and \nparticularly their children and pregnant women against this disease.\n  In Connecticut, there have already been six Zika diagnoses to date. \nThere have been none resulting from infections in Connecticut but still \naffecting pregnant women. Our experience documents that any State in \nour country may be eventually affected.\n  My plea today is that we use this opportunity to pass emergency \nfunding and not deplete or gut a critical resource--the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund. For example, this fund has provided $324 million \nfor section 317 immunization grant programs, which States rely on to \nmaintain and increase vaccine coverage, particularly for uninsured \nAmericans and for needed responses to disease outbreaks. Invading and \ndecimating this fund will do lasting damage to the public health of \nAmerica because the Prevention and Public Health Fund is the Federal \nGovernment's largest single investment in prevention.\n  Over the past 5 years, the fund has put more than $6 billion toward \noverdue investments in disease prevention and public health promotion. \nRaiding\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\nthis fund would wreak havoc on our efforts to reduce chronic disease \nrates, immunize our children, address infectious disease outbreaks and, \nironically, lower health care costs.\n  There is a saying I have heard numerous times on the floor of the \nSenate and at other public forums: An ounce of prevention is worth a \npound of cure. That lesson has been brought home by our experience with \nEbola as well as with other public health threats. It is equally true \nof Zika. We should endeavor to eradicate mosquitoes and educate the \npublic on the spread of this disease before it causes microcephaly, \nother developmental disabilities, and loss of vision and hearing in \nnewborns. It is a threat to adults, as well as to newborns. \nUndercutting the investments we have made to date in public health is \nfar from the right course to take. With women and families across the \ncountry looking to Congress for action, now is the time for us to take \nadvantage of the bipartisan measures that are before us.\n  I urge that we support those bipartisan measures that will help us \nincrease readiness and surveillance, develop a vaccine, and educate \ncommunities about how we can better protect women and children, as well \nas others, from this vicious and pernicious disease.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the importance of \nfighting the Zika virus and the urgency of being prepared for the full \nrange of threats we may face, whether naturally occurring, such as \nZika, or manmade.\n  To some, this may look like a grasshopper, but that is actually a \nmosquito. The question is, Prepared for all hazards? We still do not \nhave answers to all the questions surrounding Zika, but we do know \nthis: Zika is a very serious public health threat, and we need to act. \nThat is why I support the Blunt-Murray amendment to bolster our \nNation's response to it.\n  The CDC has indicated that the mosquitoes responsible for spreading \nthe virus could be found in a significant portion of the United States, \nincluding my State of North Carolina. What makes this virus \nparticularly troubling is that it has the potential to cause tragic \nbirth defects in babies born to mothers infected with Zika. The virus \nhas also been linked with serious neurologic conditions. The sad news \nof reported cases of microcephaly is an urgent call to us that this \nvirus poses a very serious threat to pregnant women and their unborn \nchildren. We need to take action to help these women deliver healthy \nbabies and stop the spread of the virus.\n  It is concerning to know that we do not have drugs to prevent or \ntreat Zika, and we will likely not have them until after the summer \nwhen mosquitos are present in many of the communities back home.\n  Zika underscores the importance of supporting a flexible, all-hazards \napproach and response framework under the Pandemic and All-Hazards \nPreparedness Act--legislation I authored almost a decade ago--to ensure \nour Nation would be better prepared for the range of serious public \nhealth threats we might face, such as Zika. It also underscores that \nMother Nature always has the potential to throw us a curveball, this \ntime in the form of a virus with the potential for devastating birth \ndefects transmitted through a simple mosquito bite. This mosquito-borne \nvirus also highlights why we must be prepared with the appropriate \ntools to protect the health of America from situations in which \ninfectious diseases are moving from animals to humans.\n  Thankfully, because of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, \nwe have been better prepared to respond to Zika and other recent \nthreats. But this work is never done, and we must always remain \nvigilant when it comes to medical and public health preparedness and \nresponse. The next threat may be naturally occurring, or it may be the \nresult of a deliberate attack. We need to be prepared for all of them.\n  After 9/11, Congress established the BioShield Special Reserve Fund \nto encourage the development of countermeasures that meet specific \nrequirements for use against chemical, biological, radiological, and \nnuclear agents that the Department of Homeland Security has determined \npose a material threat against the United States population sufficient \nto affect our national security. These are threats like anthrax, Ebola, \nhemorrhagic fever, and smallpox. Like Zika, the American people expect \nus to be ready to respond to these threats.\n  Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to support the amendment \noffered by my colleagues from Florida because it would gut BioShield. \nThe President's fiscal year 2017 budget proposed decreasing BioShield \nby $160 million, and then weeks later, with Zika's emergence, the \nadministration proposed raiding the BioShield fund. These actions do \nnot instill confidence that the Federal Government is prepared to \nhandle these threats and will be a committed partner in these public-\nprivate partnerships--partnerships that are crucial for defeating Zika. \nI want to work with the administration to improve our Nation's \nbiodefense preparedness and response, especially with regard to \nemerging infectious diseases, but gutting BioShield is not the answer.\n  I also wish to take a moment and talk about the Biomedical Advanced \nResearch and Development Authority, or BARDA, as I call it. BARDA is \ncurrently helping innovators navigate the development of the ``valley \nof death'' by supporting advanced research and development of medical \ncountermeasures and spurring innovation, such as platform technologies, \nto ensure that we are as nimble as possible when confronting serious \npublic health threats. BARDA is on the frontline of combating Zika \nbecause it is a linchpin in advanced medical countermeasures.\n  It is also critical that we support BARDA in fulfilling its mission. \nThe Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense recently issued a report that \nfound there are ``serious gaps and inadequacies that continue to leave \nthe Nation vulnerable to threats from nature and terrorists alike.''\n  We cannot lose our focus on preparing for the threats we have \nidentified. By strengthening our work in this area, we will be better \nprepared for the next naturally occurring threat. Regardless of the \nthreat, we know the American people expect us to protect them from it \nand to be prepared to combat it. Today the threat is Zika. Two years \nago the threat was Ebola. And the years before that, it was a novel flu \nstrain. We have been here before. We don't know what the next threat \nwill be or how it will arise, but by staying focused on identified \nthreats and being vigilant to finish what we start, we will be better \nprepared for the next threat, whether naturally occurring or the result \nof a deliberate attack.\n  I strongly support the Blunt-Murray Zika amendment because it will \nhelp protect women, babies, and families threatened by Zika in North \nCarolina and across the United States. It will also ensure that we \ncontinue to make progress against a full range of threats we may face \nin the future. I believe we must confront the threat of Zika with the \nresources this tragic virus demands and the compassion that women and \nchildren deserve. The Blunt-Murray amendment does both. I look forward \nto supporting it and continuing to fight to ensure that Americans are \nprotected from Zika and all other threats we might face.\n  While the Presiding Officer and chairman are here, I might add that \nAmerica is the world's response. We are the ones who funded and \ninitiated the cure for Ebola. We are the ones who took the seasonal flu \nvariations and modified them to reflect the greatest threat. And \nAmerica will be the one--for the world--that addresses a cure, vaccine, \nor countermeasure for Zika. The good news is that, as a Congress,\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nover 10 years ago we set up the architecture to be able to be ahead of \nthings like Zika and Ebola. Quite frankly, during different \nadministrations under different control, we failed to fund the things \nthat we recognized we needed to do.\n  As we have this crisis and we respond to it, let's also reassure the \nAmerican people that we are going to invest in that architecture and \nthat we will be ahead of novel diseases. I call it novel. We have known \nabout Zika for over 40 years, and the fact is that technology now \nallows us to address this in a different way. Let's invest in those \nplatform technologies. Let's make sure we have an architecture that \nallows advanced development for the vaccines or the countermeasures. \nLet's not let down the American people on the next disease or the next \nthreat that we might face.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and the chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2848-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the managers or their designees.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at this point I wish to yield to Senator \nReed of Rhode Island, the subcommittee ranking member and the comanager \nof this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman for her \nconsideration. I rise in support of the Zika supplemental amendment \noffered by Senators Murray and Blunt, as well as the amendment offered \nby Senator Nelson.\n  The threat of the Zika virus is a serious public health issue and \nCongress must act to help minimize the spread before we have an \nepidemic on our hands. It has been over 2 months since the \nAdministration asked for emergency funds for a comprehensive response \nto the Zika virus and to speed up development of a vaccine. This should \nnot be a partisan issue, and inaction leaves us more susceptible to \nthis serious public health emergency. This disease is spreading rapidly \nin other countries, and as we saw last year with Ebola--and with other \nmosquito-borne illnesses--we are living in an interconnected world and \nwe are not immune to the spread of these diseases.\n  Already, there are over 1,000 cases of Zika virus in the United \nStates and U.S. territories, including over 100 pregnant women. We have \nonly seen two cases so far in my home State of Rhode Island, but the \nvirus is spreading and it isn't going away on its own. We will \ncertainly see these numbers increase as we approach the summer months.\n  I had the opportunity to host a discussion in Rhode Island about this \ntopic just a few weeks ago, bringing together Federal officials from \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National \nInstitute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as public health \nofficials from the Rhode Island Department of Health, among other \nexperts in the State. Everyone agreed that funding is needed \nimmediately to ensure that we are prepared for Zika.\n  State and local public health departments will be critical to \nstrengthening efforts to prevent and diagnose cases of Zika, among \nother mosquito-borne illnesses this summer. While transmission of \nmosquito-borne illnesses has been limited in the United States so far, \nit is critical that state and local public health departments have the \nresources they need--in addition to ongoing communication with the \nCDC--so they have the most up-to-date information on diagnostics and \ntesting for mosquito-borne illnesses.\n  The NIH also needs more resources to help fast-track research and \ndevelopment of a vaccine for the Zika virus. The Zika virus has the \npotential to circulate in the United States over the long term, and we \nneed to be prepared for the fact that we will be combating this disease \nfor more than just a few months in the summer.\n  We also need more research on the virus. The Zika virus has been \naround for decades, and there have been outbreaks in other parts of the \nworld, but we didn't know it could cause a birth defect called \nmicrocephaly that impacts brain development until this year. We still \ndon't know the long-term impacts on these children and their mothers.\n  I plan to support Senator Nelson's amendment to fully fund the \nadministration's Zika supplemental request. I appreciate his efforts to \npush this issue and to help ensure that we have robust funding to help \ncombat the threat of Zika.\n  While Senator Nelson's approach is preferable, I also plan to support \nthe amendment of Senator Murray and Senator Blunt to provide $1.1 \nbillion in funding to address Zika. This amendment is a bipartisan \ncompromise, and my hope is that no less than this funding level will \nmove forward and be signed into law before we head into the summer \nmonths.\n  It is so critical that we move quickly on this so our state and local \nhealth departments will have the resources they need to deal with the \npotential growing cases in the coming months. Senators Murray and Blunt \nhave been working for weeks on this amendment, and I want to thank them \nfor their commitment to get to this agreement.\n  I will oppose Senator Cornyn's amendment, which would make harmful \ncuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This is a classic case \nof robbing Peter to pay for Paul. The Prevention and Public Health Fund \nmakes exactly the kinds of investments in our public health \ninfrastructure that better prepare us to deal with emergencies like \nZika or Ebola.\n  The Prevention and Public Health Fund also helps fund disease \nprevention programs such as cancer screenings and immunization programs \nthat save us money in the long run. Instead of cutting the Prevention \nand Public Health Fund to pay for the Zika supplemental, we should \nactually be investing more into these programs. So it is my hope we \nwill reject this approach and instead pass emergency legislation today \nto deal with the Zika virus.\n  The funding that will be made available as a result of today's votes \nwill be critical in the efforts to prevent outbreaks of the disease in \nthe United States and hopefully the creation of a vaccine in the near \nfuture.\n  There is still a lot we don't know about the Zika virus--and once we \npass this emergency funding package, Congress will still need to work \ntogether to continue evaluating needs and determining whether more \nresources are necessary.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect Americans \nfrom the potentially devastating impacts of the Zika virus.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly the Senate will proceed to \nconsider three alternative proposals to provide much needed funding to \ncombat the Zika virus. I am deeply concerned about the rapidly emerging \nand evolving Zika virus, which poses a particular threat to pregnant \nwomen and can cause serious birth defects.\n  To learn more about this virus and other public health challenges, I \nrecently toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in \nAtlanta, GA, with my friend and colleague Senator Isakson. I was deeply \nimpressed by the team of extraordinarily dedicated public servants who \nwork there. These scientists leverage an enormous range of knowledge to \nprotect the American people, including through rapid response to \ninfectious disease threats.\n  CDC's experts told me they call the mosquito that carries the Zika \nvirus the cockroach of the mosquito world because it is so difficult to \nget rid of. This mosquito can breed in water that fits within the size \nof a bottle cap. It is commonly found in the United States in areas \nlike Florida and our gulf coast.\n  There are now more than 1,000 cases of Zika virus in the United \nStates and\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nits three territories, including two laboratory-confirmed cases in the \nState of Maine. Earlier, one of our colleagues showed a map of the \nStates that are most affected by Zika, but the fact is, due to travel, \nthere are confirmed Zika cases in virtually every single State, but of \ncourse Puerto Rico in particular has been especially hard hit, with the \nnumber of cases soaring. These statistics are even more alarming when \nwe consider that we have not yet reached the summer months when \nmosquitoes tend to be more prevalent. Recent studies suggest that Zika \nmight spread across the warmer and wetter parts of the Western \nHemisphere. As many as 200 million people in our country live in areas \nwhere the mosquito that carries the virus could potentially thrive.\n  You may have read what may seem like good news--that the Zika virus \nis asymptomatic in approximately 80 percent of those affected, but CDC \nrecently concluded that the virus causes microcephaly and a range of \nother severe fetal brain defects. Americans are justifiably worried \nabout the Zika virus, as the failure to prevent its spread could have \ndevastating consequences for our families.\n  In addition to the human and emotional toll, the Zika virus may \nultimately cost the United States an astonishing sum of money when we \nconsider that we already spend more than $2.6 billion per year on \nhospital stays related to birth defects. So the investment we are \nmaking today is not only the right thing to do from a humanitarian and \npublic health perspective, it is also the right thing to do from an \neconomic viewpoint.\n  In addition to these serious birth defects, the Zika virus has been \nlinked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disease that can cause paralysis \nand even death.\n  It is imperative that we take steps to combat the Zika virus without \ndelay. To that end, I support the bipartisan compromise agreement \nworked out by Senators Blunt and Murray to provide an additional $1.2 \nbillion to combat the Zika virus, including $361 million for the CDC \nand $200 million for the National Institutes of Health. We can and we \nshould do more to plan for emerging disease threats through the regular \nappropriations process so we do not have to turn frequently to \nemergency supplemental funding, but in this case the Zika virus is an \nimminent and evolving public health threat that cannot wait and that \ncannot be ignored.\n  The CDC has a very specific plan to rapidly respond to this very real \nthreat, including by developing diagnostic tests that will help us \nidentify the virus and help to educate providers and the public about \nappropriate prevention methods. I think it is important to understand \nthat the CDC is the interface with State and local public health \ncenters and agencies, so its role is absolutely critical in the \neducation and prevention process.\n  The National Institutes of Health is similarly prepared to conduct \nresearch into vaccines that might help us better prevent the virus and \nthe conditions that it can tragically cause, but again that requires \nfunding.\n  The CDC has sounded the alarm in its warning about a serious Zika \noutbreak in our country. It is essential we devote sufficient financial \nresources to meet this new challenge. I am convinced that today the \nSenate will do its part to deal with this serious threat to our public \nhealth.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REED.

Madam President, I would now like to yield time to \nSenator Isakson for a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine for the \nrecognition.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3900, as Modified\n\n  I want to commend Senator Collins and Senator Reed for their hard \nwork and great leadership on this amendment, Senator Murray and Senator \nBlunt for bringing this issue before us, and the Senate for having the \ngood sense to invoke cloture on it this afternoon.\n  If anybody in the audience or in this room doesn't think this is an \nemergency, they should have been with Senator Collins and me 2 weeks \nago at the CDC in Atlanta. We spent 4 hours looking at the depiction of \nwhat a Zika outbreak is going to look like if it doesn't stop and if we \ndon't abate it.\n  There have already been 1 million cases in the Caribbean, Central \nAmerica, and South America and 500 cases in the United States of \nAmerica, and it is going to grow. The faster we get our arms around it, \nthe better off the American people are going to be.\n  This is a lot of money, but it is only a pittance compared to what it \nwould cost if the epidemic got out of control and we didn't stop it and \ndefeat it. This money will go to Labor, Health and Human Services, the \nState Department, the CDC, and other entities to provide the education, \ntraining, and information necessary to get control of this disease.\n  Remember what happened with Ebola. When it broke out and we finally \ngot involved, only through CDC's ability to educate and also to contain \nand control the disease did we finally get our arms around it and stop \nthe epidemic. The same thing is going to be true with Zika. We need to \ncontain, control, and get the necessary education to the countries to \nsee to it that we stop it.\n  I commend the Senate for invoking cloture on the amendment today. I \ncommend these two Senators for their hard work, and I am glad we are on \nthe leading point of the spear. I want everybody to be clear--this is \nan emergency. Had we not invoked cloture on this amendment today, in \nmonths we would have had a greater emergency because Zika would have \nspread unabated in the Southern United States.\n  Lastly, I want to give great credit to Senator Collins for all the \nhard work she has done on health and human services for so many years \nand for her hard work for the CDC. On behalf of Dr. Frieden, we are \nglad you finally came and visited. God bless you.\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                            Opioid Epidemic\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, we just invoked cloture on an amendment to \ndeal with the funding of an incipient epidemic--an epidemic that has \nserious ramifications for our society and for our country--and it is \nright that we did that.\n  I rise today, however, to point out the fact that we are in the midst \nnot of an incipient epidemic but a real epidemic that since lunchtime \ntoday has killed 15 people in this country. Fifteen people have lost \ntheir lives since the middle of the day today. The epidemic I refer to, \nof course, is heroin and opiate drug abuse and addiction. This is a \ncrisis which is upon us right now.\n  A month or so ago, we passed with great fanfare the CARA bill, the \ncomprehensive addiction bill. It was the right thing to do. It was a \ngood bill, but it had no funding. Passing a bill like that with no \nfunding is like sending the fire department to a fire with no water. We \ncannot deal with this problem until we have the capacity to provide \ntreatment to the people who need it.\n  Right now there is a huge shortage of treatment beds. There is even a \nshortage of detox beds, let alone treatment. When a person finally gets \nto the point where they are struggling with this terribly destructive \ndisease and they are ready to embrace and take on the treatment, to not \nhave it available or to have it available at an exorbitant cost is \ntragic.\n  We are losing lives every hour--47,000 people a year--and it is \nexpanding and exploding, and it is tearing our communities apart.\n  I am delighted that we invoked cloture on an amendment involving the \nZika virus. It is important that we do so. But we also should be \nattending to this crisis that is staring us right in the face and is \ntearing our country apart.\n  I hope we can soon get to an amendment that will allow us to begin \nthe process of funding the resolution of this scourge before it takes \nmore lives and before it tears apart more families and communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today the Senate invoked cloture on an \namendment to provide more than $1 billion in emergency spending to help \ncombat the Zika virus. I support this effort. I think it is a good \namendment, and I commend our leaders in the Appropriations Committee \nfor reaching this bipartisan agreement.\n  However, I join my colleague from Maine, my colleague from West \nVirginia, and all of those who are disappointed that the opioid \nepidemic is not being treated with the same degree of urgency.\n  Some Senators on the other side of the aisle have said it is their \npreference to deal with the opioid epidemic through the regular \nappropriations process. Let me say that I am not encouraged by the \nresults so far. With all due respect to my colleagues, an extra $1 \nmillion here and there for a few programs, which is what we are seeing \nin the appropriations process, is not going to address the nationwide \ncrisis that Senator King has said is going to kill tens of thousands of \nAmericans this year.\n  While the HHS appropriations bill is still being drafted, because of \nthe tight budget caps that are in place for this fiscal year, I am not \noptimistic that it will include the type of game-changing funding that \nwe need to stem the tide of this crisis. Unfortunately, we saw that the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill included only minor \nincreases to programs to address the heroin and opioid epidemic. That \nis why we need emergency funding, and we need it now.\n  In March, the Senate had an opportunity to provide $600 million in \nemergency funding to address this crisis, but despite strong bipartisan \nsupport, that amendment was defeated on a point of order. Congress \nneeds to rise to this challenge, just as it has done during previous \npublic health emergencies and just as we are doing right now to address \nthe Zika virus. Just last year Congress approved $5.4 billion to combat \nthe Ebola outbreak, which killed one American, but in 2014, 47,000 \nAmericans died from drug overdoses. Each day we wait, another 120 \npeople die of drug overdoses. We are losing one person a day in New \nHampshire.\n  Now is the time to act. I urge my colleagues to reconsider.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, first of all, I thank my good friend \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, for putting in this most needed \nfunding to fight this epidemic, and I thank Senator King from Maine as \nwell. We are all fighting it.\n  My State has been hit the hardest of all the States, and New \nHampshire is right behind us as far as having more deaths from opioid \ndrug abuse than any other State. If you put what we are asking for into \nperspective and look at what we have done over the years since the war \non drugs began about four decades ago, we have spent $1 trillion in the \nUnited States, but we are fighting this war the wrong way. We have all \nlooked at this as a horrific crime, and we have just kept putting \npeople away. In that period of time, we spent $450 billion to lock up \nthese people in Federal prisons and most of them were locked up for \nnonviolent crimes.\n  We need to look at this. This is an illness, and to treat an illness, \nyou have to have funding. We just talked about Zika, and we have done \nit for Ebola. I even checked what we have done with polio. Since we \neradicated polio, we have saved this country $220 billion. Can you \nimagine what would have happened if we hadn't? We wanted to have it \neradicated around the world by the year 2000.\n  The savings is enormous, but the bottom line right now is \nproductivity. I have the lowest workforce participation in the country \nright now in West Virginia. A lot of it is due to the addictions that \npeople have. In 2014, we had 42,000 West Virginians--including 4,000 \nyouth--who sought treatment for illegal drug use but failed to receive \nit. There was no place for them to go. They wanted to change their \nlives. They asked in every way possible to do that, but we have no \ntreatment centers.\n  This goes a long way to basically help treat an illness which is \nabsolutely destroying America, not just in West Virginia, New \nHampshire, and Maine, but I am talking about all 50 States. We have an \nepidemic we are dealing with today. Yet we are not dealing with it \nbecause we have no treatment, and that is because no one has put the \npriorities and values that we have in this country to eradicate this \nhorrible scourge in our country.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to please reconsider the funding that is \nneeded to fight opioid abuse with proper treatment around the country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n Brown v. Board of Education Anniversary and Filling the Supreme Court \n                                Vacancy\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to discuss the pending vacancy on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, and I do so on a very momentous day in American \nlegal history. May 17, today, is the anniversary of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in the pivotal case of Brown v. Board of Education. On May 17, \n1954, the Supreme Court ruled that the promise of equality--stated as \nparamount in the Declaration of Independence and then reaffirmed in the \n14th Amendment to the Constitution passed in the aftermath of the Civil \nWar--could not be denied to little school children based on their skin \ncolor. The Brown v. Board case was actually five cases consolidated \ntogether--one from Virginia, one from Kansas, one from Delaware, one \nfrom South Carolina, and one from the District of Columbia.\n  While most of us know what the Brown case resolved, few remember that \nthe Brown ruling was in serious jeopardy because of the death of a \nSupreme Court Justice and the deep divisions on the Court among the \nremaining eight members. It was only through the prompt filling of a \njudicial vacancy that the Court was able to come together and render a \nruling in America's best interest.\n  The Brown case was originally argued in 1952, and the court that \nheard the argument was hopelessly divided. In fact, it was so divided \nthat they asked that the case be reargued in 1953, and then to make \nmatters worse, Chief\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nJustice Fred Vinson died before the reargument. By many accounts, his \ndeath left the Court evenly divided over an issue of the most \nfundamental importance. Had the vacancy left by the death of Judge \nVinson persisted, there is no way of predicting whether the Supreme \nCourt could have even resolved the case. Imagine how different our \nhistory as a Nation would be if the Supreme Court had been unable to \ndecide on a matter of fundamental importance.\n  President Eisenhower nominated former California Governor Earl Warren \nto fill the vacancy. The Senate did its job, held a prompt hearing, and \nconfirmed the appointment. Chief Justice Warren then used his skill to \ncut through the division and convince his colleagues that the Court \nshould speak unanimously and say that a child's skin color should not \ndetermine which school he or she should attend. Because the Senate did \nits job, the Court was able to do its job, and all of America was \nlifted.\n  I have listened to my colleagues and Virginia citizens about the \ncurrent Supreme Court vacancy for 3 months. I have come to this \nconclusion: I think the Senate is treading on dangerous ground here. We \nare communicating--and I think the communication could be \nunintentional--a message to our public that is painful, and our actions \nin this high-profile matter are creating pain among many of my \nconstituents. I fear that a precedent is about to be set that could \nundermine all three branches of our government.\n  I offer these comments today because the Senate can correct the \ndangerous message we are sending, and I hope that calm reflection will \ncall us to honor the great traditions of this body.\n  The death of Justice Scalia on February 13 created a naturally \noccurring vacancy on a Court that is statutorily required to have nine \nmembers. Within hours of Justice Scalia's death, the majority leader \nannounced a blockade on the vacancy, declaring that no nomination by \nPresident Obama would ever receive a hearing or a vote. This hastily \nannounced blockade has been described as follows: The majority thinks \nthe American people should decide on the Presidential race, and \ntherefore, this nomination should be for the next President to make, \neven if that means a Supreme Court vacancy for more than a year.\n  I want to examine the majority's rationale. What has the Senate done \nin other instances when a vacancy has occurred during the last year of \na President's term? Well, that is easy enough to find out. Before \nJustice Scalia's death, more than a dozen Justices have been confirmed \nduring a Presidential year. For the last 100 years, with the exception \nof nominees who have withdrawn their nomination, the Senate has taken \naction on every pending nominee to fill a vacancy on the Court.\n  In the past, some Senators have suggested that a vacancy occurring \nduring the final year of a Presidential term should be entitled to less \ndeference than other Executive nominations, but that is related to the \nquestion of whether or not a Senator votes yes or no, and, of course, \nSenators are free to vote yes or no on nominees. But the refusal to \neven consider a nominee is unprecedented.\n  Beyond the precedent of previous Senate actions, let's look at \narticle II, section 2, of the Constitution. It says that the President \n``shall nominate'' and ``appoint''--``by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate''--various officials, including Supreme Court \nJustices.\n  While all agree that the advice and consent provision gives the \nSenate the ability to affirm or reject a nominee, there is nothing in \nthe clause suggesting that the Senate can blockade the consideration of \na nominee, and there is certainly nothing in the clause to suggest that \nthe President's appointed powers or the Senate's confirmation powers \nare somehow limited in the last year of a Presidential term.\n\n  Finally, the meaning of the constitutional clause was extensively \ndiscussed as the Constitution was drafted, approved, and ratified by \nthe States, and Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Paper 76 also discusses \nthe provision at length. All understood that the advice and consent \nprovision was an opportunity for the Senate to determine whether a \nPresidential nominee for a Senate confirmable position possessed ``fit \ncharacter.'' That is the check against Presidential power intended by \nthe clause. The President, knowing that a Senate would inquire into the \ncharacter of a nominee, would not just nominate people purely for \npartisan, personal, or regional reasons--wanting to fill it with people \nfrom my State, for example. ``Fit character'' would require that the \nPresident nominate somebody who could pass that scrutiny in the Senate. \n``Fit character'' is a phrase with some significant subjectivity to it, \ngiving each Senator the ability to decide what it means in a given \ninstance. But the position that the character of the nominee doesn't \nmatter at all--as evidenced by the majority's view that there would be \nno meetings, no hearings, and no vote regardless of the person \nnominated for the vacancy--is directly contrary, in my view, to the \nintent of the provision.\n  I look at this, and I believe the asserted rationale that we should \nnot take up the Garland nomination because the vacancy occurred in the \nfinal year of a Presidential term is at odds with the text of the \nConstitution, with the clear meaning of the text, as explained during \nthe drafting of the provision, and with the clear line of Senate action \nin previous cases.\n  What could explain the blockade of Judge Garland? I obviously don't \nknow, and I can't comment upon motivations that I am unaware of, but I \ndo want to discuss how it appears--a perception that we are leaving, \npossibly unwittingly, based on my discussions with Virginians. The \ncurrent Senate blockade is variously interpreted as an opposition to \nthe nominee, as opposition to the particular President making the \nnomination, or as some effort to undermine judicial independence.\n  Let's look at those three interpretations that are very commonly held \nby Virginians and others. The first interpretation: Is it opposition to \nthe nominee? I think we can dispense with that pretty quickly. The \nblockade strategy is not based on the character of the nominee, Judge \nMerrick Garland, and I can assert this safely because the blockade \nstrategy was announced--no meeting, no hearing, no vote--before the \nPresident even nominated Judge Garland. It was said that regardless of \nthe character of a particular nominee, they would not entertain a \nnomination from this particular President. This is ironic, given that \nthe nomination for a Supreme Court Justice is fundamentally about the \nvery essence of justice and that the essence of justice must carry with \nit a duty to consider each individual on his or her own merits. The \nposition that we would refuse to consider Judge Garland on his own \nmerits seems contrary, to me, to the very notion of justice itself.\n  Now that Judge Garland has been nominated, we also know that the \nblockade is not about the character of the nominee. Judge Garland has \nan esteemed record as a prosecutor, private practitioner, and Federal \nappellate judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He is the chief \njudge on that court. His judicial service alone is approaching the 20-\nyear mark on a court that most believe is second in importance only to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have not seen any Member of the majority assert any credible \nweakness in Judge Garland's background, integrity, experience, \ncharacter, judicial temper, or fitness for the position. Indeed, the \nmajority's senior Member, a respected former chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has praised Judge Garland as exactly the kind of jurist who \nshould be on the Supreme Court.\n  In my recent interview with Judge Garland, I came away deeply \nimpressed with his thoughtful manner and significant experience as a \ntrial attorney and judge. This is no ivory tower jurist, but instead a \nman who understands the real-life struggles of plaintiffs and \ndefendants, lawyers and juries, legislators and citizens, and trial \njudges who depend upon the Supreme Court to give clarity and guidance \nto the rules that impact the most important issues of their lives.\n  I think we should give President Obama his due in proposing a nominee \nwith such impeccable credentials. I reject the first possible \nexplanation that the majority's opposition is about the nominee. In \nfact, a determination that Merrick Garland was not of fit character to \neven receive consideration as a Supreme Court Justice would set such a \nhigh bar for appointees that it is hard to imagine anyone ever clearing \nit.\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\n  Since the Garland blockade has nothing to do with the character of \nthe nominee, many perceive that it is instead explained by the \nmajority's views of this President.\n  Is there something about President Obama that would warrant his \nSupreme Court nominee receiving second-class treatment compared with \npast Senate practice?\n  Could it be the circumstances of the President's election? Some \nPresidents have been elected with less than a majority vote of the \nAmerican public and have thus been burdened with the notion that they \ndid not have a mandate from the American public, but President Obama \nwas elected in both 2008 and 2012 with overwhelming majorities in the \nelectoral college, and his popular vote margins in both elections were \nalso relatively strong in comparison with the norm in recent \nPresidential elections. So there is nothing about the legitimacy of \nPresident Obama's elections that would warrant treating this \nPresident's nomination different from previous Executives.\n  This makes extremely puzzling the majority's claim that they want to \n``let the American people decide.'' The American people did decide. \nThey gave President Obama the constitutional responsibility to nominate \nJustices to the Supreme Court from his first day in office to his last. \nSome may not be happy with the decision, but it is insulting to the \nPresident and it is insulting to the American electorate who chose him, \naccording to longstanding and clear electoral rules, to demean the \nlegitimacy of his election.\n  Could it be the unique unpopularity of this President? I think one \ncould hypothesize a situation where a President, in the last year of \nhis term, is so unpopular that a Senate might conclude that the public \nis no longer supportive of the Executive, but that is not the case with \nPresident Obama. The President's current popularity is actually quite \nstrong compared with other Presidents during their final years in \noffice. So there is nothing about the President's popularity with the \nAmerican electorate that would warrant treating his court nominee \ndifferent than the treatment afforded to past nominees.\n  So what could it be about President Obama that would warrant the \nblockade of his Court nominee in a manner completely different than the \nway the Senate has treated all other occupants of the Oval Office? In \nwhat way is this President different to justify such treatment?\n  I state again what I have said before. Obviously, I don't know the \nanswer. I cannot say why the Senate would be so willing to break its \nhistoric practice and, by my reading of the Constitution, to refuse \nconsideration of a nomination made by this particular President, but I \ncan say it is painful and offer some thoughts about how it appears to \nmany of my neighbors, to many of my constituents, as well as to many of \nmy parishioners with whom I attend church. They reacted with alarm when \nnews came that certain leaders had declared, soon after President Obama \nwas elected, that their primary goal was to assure that he would not be \nreelected. They watched with sadness as some in Congress raised \nquestions about whether he was even born in the United States. They saw \nsome in Congress question his faith and his patriotism. They observed a \nMember of Congress shout ``you lie'' at this President during a \ntelevised speech to the entire Congress. They noticed, recently, as the \nBudget Committees of both the House and Senate refused to even hold \nhearings on the President's submitted 2017 budget--the only time a \nPresident has been treated in such a manner since the passage of the \nBudget Control Act of 1974. In short, they are confused and they are \ndisturbed by what they see as an attack on this President's legitimacy. \nI am not referring to an attack on this President's policies, which \nshould always be fair game for vigorous disagreement, and I have often \nattacked this President's policies, but instead what people are worried \nabout is some level of attack on the very notion that it is this \nindividual occupying the Oval Office.\n  This latest action--the refusal to even consider any Supreme Court \nnominee afforded by President Obama in his final year, when other \nPresidents were granted consideration of their nominees--seems highly \nsuspicious to them. When that blockade is maintained, even after the \nPresident affords to the Senate a nominee of sterling credentials, the \nsuspicion is heightened. When the asserted reason is the need to ``let \nthe people decide,'' thus suggesting that the people's decision to \nelect this particular President twice is entitled to no respect, they \nare deeply troubled. What can explain why this President--the Nation's \nfirst African-American President--is singled out for this treatment?\n  Again, I don't know, but we cannot blind ourselves to how actions are \nperceived. The treatment of a Supreme Court nomination by this \nPresident that departs from the practice with previous Executives and \nthat cannot be explained due to any feature of the particular nominee \nunder consideration feeds a painful perception about motivations. The \npain is magnified when it is in connection with an appointment to the \nSupreme Court, whose very building proclaims in stone over its entrance \nthe cardinal notion of ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  There is a third interpretation of the Garland blockade that is also \ntroubling. Some see the blockade as just sort of power politics--as an \nattempt to slant the Court. The death of Justice Scalia creates concern \namong those who fear a natural transition on the Court, so there is an \neffort to stop that natural and lawful transition.\n  The blockade on filling a naturally occurring vacancy, in my view, is \nharmful to the independence of the article III branch. Even in the 3 \nmonths since Justice Scalia's death, the Court's rulings have shown the \nchallenges of an eight-member Court. On four occasions already, the \nCourt has been unable to render a clear decision in a case of great \nimportance. Since the blockade, if successful, will probably maintain \nthe artificial vacancy until the spring of 2017, it is likely to happen \nin other cases as well. So lower courts, and all persons whose rights \nand liberties are subject to rule by this Court, are deprived of the \nclarity on Federal issues that the Court was designed to provide, but \nit is more than just a hobbling of the Court's ability to decide \nindividual discrete cases.\n  Seventy years ago, when Winston Churchill spoke at Westminster \nCollege about the descent of an Iron Curtain across Europe, he defined \nthe differences between free societies and those driven by tyranny. Key \nto his description of free societies was an independent judiciary. It \nis an independent judiciary that serves as a bulwark against Executive \nor legislative power grabs, protecting the liberties of an individual \nfrom an overreaching Executive or from a majoritarian legislature that \ndoes not fully grasp the rights of minorities. That is what an \nindependent judiciary is designed to do. I think we all know this \nindependence of the American judiciary has been one of the great \nhallmarks of American democracy.\n  In my view, the blockade of the Garland nomination undermines this \nindependence. The Judiciary Act of 1869 sets the composition of the \nCourt at nine Justices with life tenure, and that statute has remained \nin force for 150 years. When President Franklin Roosevelt didn't like \ncertain rulings of the Supreme Court in the 1930s, he tried to expand \nthe Court and elbow out older Justices by proposing a forced retirement \nage and an expansion of the numbers in that Judiciary Act of 1869. \nEverybody understood that FDR's actions were an attempt to attack the \nindependence of the judicial branch, and so congressional leaders of \nboth parties stood up to stop him.\n  I think this current blockade is the legislative equivalent of what \nPresident Roosevelt tried to do. Refusing to consider an Obama \nnomination in order to artificially maintain a Court vacancy for more \nthan a year is as much an attack on the judiciary as trying to expand \nit beyond nine members. I hope we would agree with this: Whether an \nindependent judiciary is attacked by the executive or the legislative \nbranches, we need to be equally diligent in repelling that attack.\n  American diplomats work every day around the world trying to convince \nother societies of the virtues of the rule of law and the independent \njudiciary, but the current blockade, unless corrected, suggests that we \ndo not practice what we preach. By refusing to fill a naturally \noccurring vacancy,\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nwe send the message that the rule of law and an independent judiciary \nare ultimately secondary to having a more favorable or a more compliant \njudiciary, even when we have to weaken it to obtain what we want.\n  I once lived in a country with a military dictatorship that held this \nview of the judiciary. The judiciary was not prized for its \nindependence but instead was priced for its slavish obedience to a few \nin control of society. By refusing to fill a Supreme Court vacancy \nbecause a partial and weakened Court is deemed more acceptable than a \nfull and lawfully constituted Court, we move away from one of our best \ntraditions--to become more like legal systems that we are working to \nchange around the world every day. In doing so, we weaken the judiciary \nby leaving this vacancy that has already affected proceedings, we \nweaken the Executive by hobbling the constitutional power to fill \ndually constituted executive and judicial positions, but we also weaken \nthe legislative body, which has that important duty of checking these \nnominees for fitness of character, and by doing it without even being \nwilling to cast a vote, I think we hurt our own institutional \ncredibility.\n  In conclusion, I harken back to 1954. A matter of fundamental \nimportance to our Nation was before the Supreme Court. The death of a \nJustice left an eight-member Court that had already shown it was deeply \ndivided and likely unable to reach a ruling, but the Senate did its job \nand filled the Court and the Court could then render a ruling that \nchanged the course of American history for the better.\n  We should learn from that history and do our job. Persisting with \nthis current blockade and sending these possibly unintentional messages \nis deeply dangerous. The refusal to carry out the commands of the \nConstitution and the Judiciary Act of 1869, to abide by the Senate \nprecedents, to fill a naturally occurring Supreme Court vacancy, to \noffer the advice and consent that is part of a Senator's job \ndescription, and to entertain a well-qualified nominee--even for a \nhearing, much less a vote--will not be viewed favorably in the bright \nand objective light that history will shine on all of our actions.\n  We can fix this. If the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing, cast \na vote, report Judge Garland to the floor, and then ensure that the \nSenate debates this nomination and holds a floor vote, we will uphold \nour responsibility. Judge Garland might be confirmed or he might be \nrejected, but in taking action--rather than mounting an unprecedented \nblockade--we preserve the ability of each Senator to make the judgment \nabout whether Judge Garland possesses the fit character necessary for \nthis position. We act in accordance with the Constitution and the \nJudiciary Act of 1869, we follow the traditional practices of the \nSenate--practices that have served us well, as the case of Brown v. \nBoard of Education shows--and we cure the painful and dangerous message \nthat is communicated by the current blockade strategy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise to follow the eloquent remarks of \nmy colleague from the State of Virginia and to remark upon 62 years--62 \nyears since Brown v. Board was handed down by our Supreme Court; 62 \ndays since Judge Merrick Garland was nominated by our President to fill \na vital vacancy on our Nation's highest Court. I wish to thank and \ncommend my colleague, a very able attorney and someone who has argued \ncases passionately around a wide range of issues but none so much as \ncivil rights.\n  As Senator Kaine rightly pointed out, the history of Brown v. Board \nis that a series of cases were brought together from across several \nStates--including his State of Virginia and my State of Delaware--\ngathered together and argued in front of the Supreme Court by Thurgood \nMarshall, then chief counsel of the NAACP, and ultimately decided in \n1954. Initially, a divided Court was unable to render judgment because \nin the spring of 1953, Chief Justice Vinson had died, leaving the Court \nthen in a similar situation as it is now--divided on a range of vital \nand important issues.\n  The good Senator from Virginia has reminded us that our failure to \nact now--our failure to do our job and to follow the dictates of our \nConstitution, the ``shall'' language in article II, section 2--the \nfailure of this body to offer any hearing or vote on this very capable \ncircuit court judge sends the wrong message, not just here within this \ncountry to our citizens but around the world.\n  The Senator from Virginia spent time--and it changed his life and his \nperspective--in Central America as a younger man in a country where \njudicial independence was a fiction on paper. I, too, spent time in the \n1980s in a country in Southern Africa known as South Africa, where this \nsame legal system that existed here under Jim Crow existed there under \nthe name of apartheid. It is to that country I go in just 2 weeks, with \nCongressman John Lewis of Georgia and with the children of Robert \nKennedy, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a speech given in Cape \nTown 50 years ago.\n  It is a striking moment for us to reflect on the importance and the \npower and the centrality of Brown v. Board in wiping away the dark \nstain of Plessy v. Ferguson, that obscene legal fiction rendered in \n1896 that ``separate but equal'' allowed us to square the horrible \ndistension of justice in our country of a separation between the races \nwith the words in our Constitution, the words above the Presiding \nOfficer, the words above the entrance to our Supreme Court, the words \nabove the Presiding Officer's desk in our Chamber, ``E pluribus \nunum''--from many, one--more importantly, the words above the Supreme \nCourt entrance, ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  We have these soaring words in our foundational documents and in our \nmost important government buildings that suggest that we will \n``dispense justice equally,'' that we will be gathered from many \ndifferences in backgrounds into one. Yet the reality in this country, \nfor its initial decades, more than its initial century, was anything \nbut.\n  It was 62 years ago today that the Supreme Court of these United \nStates issued a unanimous decision wiping Plessy v. Ferguson away.\n  I rise briefly to comment that I grew up in a small town in Delaware \nknown as Hockessin. It was a so-called ``Colored'' school in Hockessin \nthat was the basis of one of these cases. There were actually two cases \nfrom Delaware: Belton v. Gebhart from Claymont, related to the Claymont \nHigh School, and Bulah v. Gebhart, relating to the Hockessin Elementary \nSchool. In both cases, a famous lawyer from Delaware named Louis \nRedding took their cases to the Delaware courts. A brave judge, Judge \nCollins Seitz, rendered a judgment that found the discriminatory \npractices in the State of Delaware illegal. It was that case that was \naffirmed--of the five gathered--in Brown v. Board.\n  Although Delaware has a very troubled and checkered racial history, \nthese cases are ones of which I and my constituents can justifiably be \nproud. Moments when the courts of this country have stepped up and \nwiped the stain of racism and of legal segregation from our books are \nmoments of which we can and should be proud.\n  As my colleague from Virginia pointedly reminded us, for 62 days the \nincredibly qualified and capable district court judge nominated by our \ncurrent President has waited--waited for an answer from this body, \nwaited for a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I \nserve, waited for a vote. In the century that there has been a \nJudiciary Committee of this body, every previous nominee who has not \nwithdrawn has received a hearing, a vote, or both.\n  What are we so afraid of in allowing this talented judge to come \nforward, to lay his views and his credentials and his experience before \nthis body or a committee of this body? What is the concern? My \ncolleague from Virginia has asked and I ask, what is the animating \nconcern that insists that for 62 or 63 or 64 or more days, Judge \nGarland must wait, throughout this entire year perhaps, into next year? \nHow many cases will remain undecided by an equally divided Court due to \nour unwillingness or the unwillingness of many in this Chamber to do \ntheir job, to take up the challenge, to have a hearing, and to cast \ntheir vote?\n  With that, I simply want to say that it is to me of grave concern \nthat we have not acted as a body, that we have\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\nnot acted collectively to provide a path forward for this talented, \ncapable judge. Many in this Chamber may find him not to be capable or \nqualified, but without a hearing, how would you know? He has submitted \na full response--thousands of pages--to the questionnaire typically \nexpected before the Judiciary Committee of any nominee. His record is \nbefore us--abundant, voluminous. He has more experience than any \nprevious nominee as a Federal circuit court judge. What is the concern \nthat would prevent us from moving forward?\n  On this 62nd anniversary of the most important decision, in my view, \nin the history of the U.S. Supreme Court, Brown v. Board, I call on my \ncolleagues to once again show the courage of Louis Redding, of Judge \nSeitz, of Justice Warren, and of all of those who rendered central \ndecisions in the history of this country that allowed our Supreme Court \nto operate independent of political interference and capable of making \nreal the promise above our Supreme Court of ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am very honored and I feel very \nprivileged to be a member of this body today as we commemorate the \nanniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. I thank my colleagues, the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, and most especially my very good \nfriend and colleague from Virginia for his very eloquent and powerful \nremarks and also for bringing us together in this colloquy today.\n  Sixty-two years ago on this day, the Supreme Court unanimously struck \ndown as unconstitutional the segregation of schools by race, declaring \nthat ``separate but unequal schools are inherently unequal.'' Today, \nthat proposition seems so obvious as to be indisputable and the fact of \na unanimous Supreme Court seems inevitable, but it was hardly \ninevitable 62 years ago.\n  It is a triumph and tribute to American justice that it happened and \nthat it happened at all given the staunch and implacable resistance \nthat there was to that proposition 62 years ago. In fact, the Supreme \nCourt courageously stepped forward to advance American justice and \nestablish a milestone and reestablish the principle that it is \nenshrined in our Constitution that every citizen is entitled to equal \nprotection under law.\n  The battle to upend years of racial and educational inequity remains \nunfinished today. If we emerge from this colloquy with any message, it \nmust be that the work remains unfinished and there is so much more work \nto be done in the spirit and letter of the law.\n  The culmination of decades-long work and strategy by innovative \nlawyers, community organizations organizers, and other advocates of \nsocial change was that decision. It is a tribute to their work as well \nand a reminder that individuals can make a difference in our system, \ncan litigate to a successful conclusion, can advocate principles that \nare a matter of moral imperative. It took an act of the Supreme Court, \nof an independent judiciary, to declare educational segregation \nunconstitutional and integration the law of the land.\n  As a law clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1974-1975 term, \nworking for Justice Harry Blackmun, I had the chance to watch \narguments, some of them on pressing issues of the time, but also to \ntalk with some of the Justices who watched or even participated in the \nBrown decision, including Justice Thurgood Marshall, the chief counsel \nfor the plaintiffs in Brown.\n  Anybody who thinks that decision was inevitable should talk to some \nof the lawyers who were involved in the litigation and who eventually \nadvanced it to the Supreme Court and to its successful conclusion and \nread the history of the controversy within the Court and the internal \ndebate that took place about the proper role of the Court and the \nprinciples to be applied. It was far from inevitable. But it also shows \nhow the branches of government, working together and collaboratively \nadvancing justice in America, are important to the fundamental dynamic \nof our constitutional system.\n  The Brown decision took enforcement. President Dwight Eisenhower led \nthat effort in one of the toughest tests in the massive protest in \nLittle Rock, AR, just 3 years after Brown.\n  Ten years after Brown, Congress expanded the logic of this great \ndecision to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 making segregation in \npublic places like restaurants illegal as well.\n  Reading and reviewing the dynamics of the Court at the time, one \nwonders what would have happened if there had been only eight members. \nHow history might have been different. Justice might have been delayed \nand perhaps history changed for the far worse, justice denied as a \nresult of that delay.\n  The group of Justices who unanimously issued the decision was no \nintellectual monolith; they were members nominated to the Court by \nPresidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower. Before the Court came an \nissue of major significance, which they came together to evaluate on \nprinciples of law that we all share, that discrimination is invidious \nand intolerable and violations of the Constitution will be held \nunacceptable in the Court.\n  Today, congressional Republicans, very frankly, hamper the ability of \nthe Supreme Court to answer important legal questions of our time by \nrefusing to hold even a hearing or a vote for Judge Merrick Garland. \nTheir doing so has left the bench of the Supreme Court with only eight \nJustices. That lack of a ninth Justice diminishes and in many respects \neven disables the Court, as we saw just yesterday in a decision that \nmight well have been decided otherwise if there had been nine Justices \nto give a majority to one point of view or another.\n  Justice Scalia warned against this very issue, stating that ``eight \njustices raise the possibility that, by reason of a tie vote, [the \nCourt] will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue \npresented by the case. . . . Even one unnecessary recusal impairs the \nfunctioning of the Court.''\n  Justice Scalia's foresight was prescient. In two recent cases, even \nbefore the one yesterday, the Court deadlocked, unable to reach a \ndefinitive pronouncement on the law, because of a 4-to-4 tie. \nUnnecessary circuit splits cause uncertainty, which in turn hampers the \nactivities of ordinary citizens, of small businesses wondering what \nrules will apply to them, whether it is banking rules or investment \nregulations, hampering their ability to plan and create jobs.\n  The Washington Post recently reported that the Court's acceptance of \nnew cases has slowed significantly, leaving crucial unresolved legal \nquestions without definitive answers. That is not how our system is \nsupposed to work. That is not how the Founders saw it. That is not how \nthe Supreme Court could resolve the Brown v. Board of Education \nchallenge. The Supreme Court must have a full complement of Justices to \neffectively address these complex, challenging, urgent issues faced by \nour Nation today.\n  I reject the notion that the Senate's refusal to act, as laid out in \nno uncertain terms by our Republican colleagues, fulfills our \nconstitutional obligation. It is our obligation to advise and consent \non the President's nominee. We ``shall'' do so. That is the \nconstitutional mandate--not when it is politically convenient, not when \nwe think it is advantageous, but when the President nominates, whoever \nthe President is, whether it is President Eisenhower nominating Earl \nWarren or Presidents Truman and Roosevelt, who nominated other Justices \non the Supreme Court who decided Brown v. Board of Education.\n  We cannot afford to weaken the Federal judiciary's credibility, the \ntrust and confidence of the American people in the authority of our \njudiciary. Its authority depends on it being above politics. Alas, what \nthe Senate is doing is dragging the U.S. Supreme Court into the muck of \npartisan bickering.\n\n  Brown v. Board of Education became the law of the land because of the \nU.S. Supreme Court's credibility. The Supreme Court had no police force \nto enforce it. It had no armies or mandatory physical force. It had its \ncredibility and its authority, its moral authority because it was above \npolitics in the minds of most Americans. That is the reason President \nEisenhower was able to do what he succeeded in enforcing at Little Rock \nand the Presidents afterward have done similarly.\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\n  Most importantly, I hope we all take time today to reflect on the \nimportance of the Brown decision and recognize the grit and courage of \nthe men and women who fought to end school segregation only 62 years \nago. The best way of honoring their legacy is to do our job and our \nduty constitutionally, to fulfill that duty and their legacy by \nconsidering Judge Garland's nomination without further delay.\n  I yield the floor and recognize my distinguished colleague from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise to discuss--along with my friends \nand colleagues on the Senate floor--what is a momentous anniversary for \nour country, the 62nd anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education \ndecision, its legacy, and the work that still remains before us.\n  I thank my colleagues for standing and speaking on this anniversary \nand understanding that it was 62 years ago today the Supreme Court \nunanimously affirmed that separate could never be equal, that under the \nlaw--at the very least--every child born in America, regardless of the \ncolor of their skin, had the right to pursue a quality education.\n  The Court found that separate schooling of children based on their \nrace was in direct violation of the 14th amendment of the Constitution. \nThe Court's finding is perhaps best summarized by this excerpt from \nJustice Warren's opinion when he said:\n\n       We come then to the question presented: Does segregation of \n     children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even \n     though the physical facilities and other ``tangible'' factors \n     may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of \n     equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.\n\n  Those were historical words. This not only made clear at the time \nthat the deep and profound illegality of segregation was real, but it \nset a legal standard for generations in posterity that reflects our \ndeepest held American values, that we as a nation believe in equality. \nWe as a nation believe in our interdependency to one another.\n  In the decades since the Brown ruling, the implementation of the \nCourt's decision has contributed to a lot of progress. Frankly, I stand \nhere today because of the progress and momentum that was exhibited by \nthat decision.\n  Right before Brown v. Board of Education, only about one in seven \nAfrican Americans, then compared with more than one in three Whites, \nheld a high school degree.\n  Today we have come so far the Census Bureau reports that 87 percent \nof Black adults have a high school degree, nearly equal to that of \nWhites, which are at 89 percent. Before Brown, only about 1 in 40 \nBlacks earned a college degree. Now, more than one in five Black \nstudents are going to college. This is extraordinary progress we have \nseen in our country, something we should all celebrate.\n  Under the law, at the very least, the Supreme Court clearly affirmed \nall Americans' right to a quality education and in doing so affirmed \nequal value, dignity, and worth of our kids.\n  However, it is also worth reflecting on the anniversary of Brown that \nour Nation has struggled to live up to these standards in full. Brown \nadvanced a civil rights movement that helped desegregate many parts of \nAmerican society, but we still have work to do. Let us take this \nanniversary to recognize not just our progress, to celebrate not just \nthat milestone, but to understand that the work of equality, the work \nof recognizing the value, the worth, and how much we need each other as \na community still goes on.\n  In fact, just yesterday, six decades after the Supreme Court in Brown \nstruck down the doctrine of ``separate but equal,'' a Federal judge \nruled that a school district in Mississippi was continuing to operate a \nsegregated, dual secondary school system: one set of schools for Whites \nand one set of schools for Blacks.\n  Across the country right now, about 40 percent of Black and Latino \nstudents attend intensely segregated schools--meaning more than 90 \npercent minority student body--and White students are similarly \nsegregated from their peers of color. Only 14 percent of Whites attend \nschools that one would consider multicultural, multiracial, and \nreflecting the diversity of our country, and too many of our schools \ncontinue to fall short of our low-income and minority students. In \nother words, too many of our students of color and of low-income \nstudents are concentrated in poor-performing schools.\n  More than 1.1 million American students are attending over 1,200 high \nschools in our Nation that fail to graduate one-third of their \nstudents. To me, this is an outrage. It is an immoral affront to whom \nwe are. We still have work to do.\n  Our Nation is still struggling to live up to the ideals and, indeed, \nthe judicial standards set by Brown in the realm of education in many \nways because of our failure to live up to this standard in so many \nother areas of our American life.\n  There still exists, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, that \n``Other America.'' Dr. King spoke of this in the year before I was \nborn--in 1968--about the ``Other America.'' He spoke of the duality \nthat persisted, the disparities in housing, education, employment, and \nin income. He spoke of what he referred to very pointedly as the myth \nof time, the misguided idea that only time can solve the problem of \nracial injustice, the idea that things will work out for themselves.\n\n  As happy as I am about the progress we have made as a country, I have \nto say that we still have so much work to do almost 50 years after King \nspoke those words. Time has not solved the problem. There remain \nchallenges in our country. This duality is more subtle in some ways \nthan it was in 1954, but there still exists injustice in America. From \nhousing to education, de facto segregation along socioeconomic and \nracial lines has blended together, in many ways replacing what was then \nde jure segregation.\n  Census data has shown that residential segregation by race has \ndeclined very slowly but that Whites still live largely in \nneighborhoods with low minority density. People of color still live in \nneighborhoods with high minority density. Many of these neighborhoods \nwere designed through policies that were discriminatory against \nminorities. We still are seeing the legacies of those policies from \nredlining to FHA policies, to HUD policies that were designed to create \nsegregation. The legacy of that still exists in segregated \nneighborhoods today.\n  While poverty rates among African Americans has fallen over the past \nhalf century--something we should be proud of--Black poverty rates are \nstill more than double that of Whites. That means the same for kids \ntoday. Children of color are often twice as likely to be poor as White \nchildren.\n  In fact, one out of the three Hispanic children growing up today are \ngrowing up in poverty. One in six African-American children live in \nwhat is called extreme poverty on less than $8 a day.\n  This is not who we are as a nation. Our children are our greatest \nnatural resource. In a global, knowledge-based economy, when we are \ncompeting against other nations from Germany to Japan, in this kind of \neconomy, the most valuable natural resource a nation has is not oil or \ncoal or gas, it is the genius of our children.\n  Many people think Brown was about achieving greater justice for Black \npeople, but what we really understand--especially in retrospect--as we \nsee African Americans now contributing in every area of life, the \nreality is this was about bringing justice to all of America.\n  Brown was saying that, hey, we as a country cannot stand if we are \napart because a house divided does fall. Brown was saying the truth is, \nwe do better when we are together, like the old African saying that \nsays: If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go \ntogether--because we as a country need each other. It is like those \nwords on the Jefferson Memorial, written in our Declaration of \nIndependence, when we knew--to make this country work--we needed one \nanother, so much so that those Founders pledged to each other their \nlives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.\n  In this competitive nature, we cannot afford to waste things. Worse \nthan the gulf coast oilspill, we are wasting the potential of our \nchildren when we leave so many floundering in poverty and lack of \neducational opportunities.\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nChildren growing up in poverty right now have dramatically negative \nlife outcomes compared to people who are not growing up in poverty. In \nfact, right now in America, where 20 percent of children live in \npoverty, only 9 out of every 100 kids born in poverty will make it to \ncollege, often an index of being able to be successful, manifesting \nyour genius, finding greater ways to contribute to the whole.\n  We have work to do. In particular, we have work to do in an area that \ndrives so much of the injustice in our country. One of the great ways \nwe are seeing injustice in my generation that was not the case in my \nparents' generation, that was not a reality in the 1950s, has been the \ncriminal justice system. Something has happened and exploded. Injustice \nin our country is growing like a cancer on the soul of our country.\n  The same Supreme Court where that great case was decided, where \nwritten above the wall is ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' we now see a \nnation that has a criminal justice system that is not affording equal \njustice to all Americans.\n  Unfortunately, we see that often falling among racial lines. We have \nthis explosive drug war, which has not been a War on Drugs, but it has \nbeen a war on people, particularly the most vulnerable people in our \nsociety, from people who are addicted to substances, from people who \nhave mental illnesses, from people who are poor, and, yes, \ndisproportionately directed toward minorities.\n  We now see a criminal justice system where we know, based upon data \nanalysis, there is no difference between Blacks and Whites in usage of \ndrugs. In fact, there is no difference in selling drugs between Blacks \nand Whites, but the reality is, if you are African American in this \ncountry, you are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for those drug \ncrimes.\n  If you are churned into the criminal justice system as a result of \nthose arrests, just one arrest for a nonviolent drug offense--something \nthat the last two Presidents have admitted to doing--and you are \narrested for that, then you find yourself in a world where, as the \nAmerican Bar Association says, you have literally 40,000-plus \ncollateral consequences, where you find it exceptionally difficult to \nfind employment when you finish with your sentence. You find it \nincredibly difficult to get a loan to perhaps start a business, to even \nattempt to get a business license or a Pell grant. If you can't feed \nyourself, in many cases, you find it hard to even get food stamps or to \nfind public housing assistance.\n  We now live in a nation where we have so overincarcerated \ndisproportionately some areas of our country, that today 1 in 13 Africa \nAmericans are prevented by law from even voting. They have lost their \nright to vote because of a felony conviction. In some States, the \noverincarceration for drug crimes is so great that we see, in places \nsuch as Florida, that one out of every five African Americans has lost \ntheir right to vote.\n  This isn't just affecting those people who are churned into the \nsystem, it is affecting their children as well.\n  Today in America, one in nine Black kids are growing up with a parent \nbehind bars, which means it affects their financial well-being and it \naffects their ability to rise up out of poverty because they are being \nthrust down into it. In fact, a recent study has shown that we as a \ncountry--as a whole--would have 20 percent less poverty if we had \nincarceration rates similar to those in other industrial nations.\n  So here we celebrate the anniversary of this momentous decision that \ntook a huge step for our Nation in the march toward justice and \nequality, but because of staggering injustices like we see in our \nbroken criminal justice system, kids often struggle more in school and \nare poorer and have fewer opportunities for success.\n  So 62 years after Brown, we know our schools don't exist in vacuums. \nThey exist because of the communities around them. When communities of \nprivilege have the same amount of violations of drug crimes as \ncommunities of poverty, yet the communities of poverty experience a \ncriminal justice system that has so much more incarceration, we are \noften condemning children to having greater hills to climb and greater \nmountains of injustice in front of them.\n  I stand here on this day to celebrate so much this great decision but \nalso to remind us that we have work to do in this country until we can \nbegin to live up to this ideal of patriotism, which is love of country \nand which to me necessitates that we love each other. We don't always \nhave to agree with one other. We don't always have to get along. But we \nhave to recognize that every one of us in this Nation has value, has \nworth. We need each other, and we need our children to do well because \nif my neighbor's child loses, I lose. If they go to prison, I pay. But \nif they succeed--if they become a teacher, an artist, a biologist, an \ninventor, a businesswoman--then they contribute to this country and my \nchildren benefit because your children succeeded. That is the story of \nAmerica.\n  We cannot afford to leave people behind as we, as a nation, strive \nfor excellence and greatness. We cannot be a nation that is truly \nreaching its potential if we are wasting so much of that potential on \nthe sidelines.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also speak to a process issue. While \nwe are still working to fulfill the vision of Brown, it is more urgent \nnow than ever that we have a fully functioning Supreme Court. We were \nfortunate to have had a functioning Supreme Court in 1954. There were \nnine Justices doing their job, a President willing to do his job, and a \nSenate--all working in a time of great tumultuous change in our Nation. \nPeople were focused and steadfast--in both parties--toward creating \ngreater justice. With people in their seats, in their jobs, I have \nfaith in America and in our ability to get it right.\n  We need to make sure that today we give every opportunity to get the \njob done, to do the work that is necessary. It is important that we \nfill positions and vacancies, and the one on the Supreme Court now is \nclearly needed.\n  So today is an important day of remembrance, but history shows that \nwe cannot simply get stuck applauding our past. The glory and greatness \nof ancestry is truly worthy of our reverence. But if we are to honor \nthose who struggled before, if we are to honor those milestones, if we \nare to celebrate the history that shows us at our best when we came \ntogether--Black American, White American, Latino American, Indian \nAmerican, Asian American--if we are to celebrate those great days of \nthe past, we must celebrate them not just with cheers and remembrances \nbut by redoubling our work in accordance with those values.\n  We must have a sense of urgency. Time is not neutral. We must use it. \nWe cannot just count the great days of the past. We must make this day \ncount as we continue the work of our Nation, as we continue to be the \ncountry that we say we are--a nation of liberty and justice for all.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                Honoring Police Detective Brad Lancaster\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise this afternoon in the middle of \nthis debate on an appropriations bill because of the timing of a \ntragedy in our State and the reality that this is a week of importance \nto reflect upon what happened in Kansas just a few days ago.\n  I wish to honor the life of Police Detective Brad Lancaster. He was a \nmember of the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department, and he was killed \nin the line of duty. On May 9 of this year, Detective Lancaster joined \nKansas City, KS, patrol officers in responding to a call about a \nsuspicious person. When law enforcement arrived, the suspicious person \nfled into a field where Detective Lancaster exchanged gunfire and was \nhit twice. Unfortunately, ultimately, he died from his injuries.\n  Detective Lancaster gave his life to keep his community safe, and he \ndeserves our highest respect and appreciation, our love and care for \nhis family, for his service, and for his sacrifice. His friends, \nfamily, and neighbors remember Brad Lancaster's commitment to his \ncommunity and its extension beyond his 9 years of service to the Kansas \nCity, Kansas Police Department.\n  Before joining the police department, Brad served in the U.S. Air \nForce and completed two tours of duty abroad, including one in Kuwait \nduring Desert Shield. Neighbors say Brad was a family man and one who \nwas always there to offer a helping hand.\n  Detective Lancaster is survived by his wife Jamie and two daughters,\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nBrianna and Jillian. I join the Kansas City community and law \nenforcement agencies across the country in our prayers for Detective \nLancaster and his family as we mourn his death.\n  This tragic loss occurred just prior to National Police Week, a time \nin which we celebrate those who leave their homes and families each day \nand put their lives on the line to keep our neighborhoods safe. So \ntoday, during this National Police Week, and especially in the wake of \nthis tragic death in Kansas City, I wish to express my sincere thanks \nand appreciation to American law enforcement officers and their \nfamilies and to thank them for working tirelessly amid dangerous \nconditions for the sake of others and for upholding the law and for the \nburdens they shoulder and the sacrifices they make on a daily basis. We \nowe so much to these everyday heroes.\n  Law enforcement officers perform some of the most difficult and \nhazardous jobs in America. A routine traffic stop can turn into deadly \ngunfire, a shootout without warning. Members of this legislative body \nand communities across America alike must do everything we possibly can \nto prioritize and protect the lives of those who protect us.\n  Federally, efforts like the Justice Assistance Grant Program and the \nbulletproof vest grant program help enhance the safety of our law \nenforcement officers, and Congress's continued support of these efforts \nis important. This body passed the Fallen Heroes Flag Act, which was \nsigned into law on Monday. This week, I hope the Senate will \nunanimously adopt a resolution to express appreciation to the police \nofficers and honor each of the 123 who were killed in the line of duty \nlast year.\n  Support and appreciation for law enforcement must be delivered not \nonly in the communities where officers have been killed but to every \nofficer every day. When we as Americans commit to the safety, training, \nand support of law enforcement, we can help to secure our streets, \nstrengthen our communities, and, hopefully, reduce the number of deaths \nin the line of duty.\n  May Kansas City, KS, police detective Brad Lancaster and each of \nthose fallen heroes rest in peace.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Eric Fanning\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am here with my good friend from \nKansas and dedicated Member of the U.S. Senate--an expert on national \nsecurity, a person who has served with honor in the U.S. Marine Corps, \nand has served in this body and in the other body honorably in \npositions of responsibility. Where we may have had a disagreement, my \nfriend has shown he is a man of conviction regarding the detainees from \nGuantanamo coming to the United States of America. But he also \nunderstands fully the importance of the position of the Secretary of \nthe Army.\n  Senator Roberts and I have worked closely together on this year's \nDefense Authorization Act to ensure the administration does not have \nthe authority to release or transfer detainees on the mainland. \nUnfortunately, the administration has failed for over 7 years to \npresent a substantive plan on how they intend to close Guantanamo Bay, \nto me, to the Congress, to my colleagues, or the American people.\n  Thanks to Senator Roberts' efforts, this year's bill extends the \nprohibition to any reprogramming request to transfer or release \ndetainees. These provisions confirm that President Obama will not be \nable to move detainees to the mainland of the United States of America \nin the coming year.\n  I want to point out that I understand Senator Roberts' emphasis and \nvalue that he places on Fort Leavenworth. Fort Leavenworth is the \nintellectual center of the United States Army. This is where General \nDavid Petraeus spent 2 years developing strategy for the surge--at Fort \nLeavenworth. This is where the up-and-coming leaders of the U.S. Army--\nand other services as well, but primarily the U.S. Army--go to get \ntheir training, their intellect, and their ability to lead. So I can \nfully understand why my friend from Kansas would be adamantly opposed \nto the transfer of detainees to Fort Leavenworth, which would change \nthe complexion and the makeup of that very important place in the past, \npresent, and future of the U.S. Army.\n  So I thank my colleague from Kansas for his agreement today. I would \nask him to say a few words before I ask consent that this nomination be \nconsidered.\n  Again, I appreciate my old friend whose passion, whose commitment to \nthe people of Kansas is without equal--which also accounts for the fact \nthat they have sent him here to represent them on several occasions.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I thank my colleague and my good friend \nfrom Arizona for enabling me to make a few remarks to address the \nnomination of Mr. Eric Fanning to serve as Secretary of the Army.\n  I have pledged to the people of Kansas that I would do everything in \nmy power to stop President Obama from moving terrorist detainees to \nFort Leavenworth, KS. The Senator from Arizona has certainly described \nthe situation very well: It is the intellectual center of the Army. I \nbelieve today that I can tell Kansans that the threat from this \nadministration will go unfulfilled.\n  Last week, in a private meeting with Deputy Defense Secretary Robert \nWork, I received the assurances I needed to hear to release my vote on \nMr. Fanning. Make no mistake. I think President Obama's threat to act \nby Executive order still remains. However, Secretary Work has assured \nme that, as the individual charged with executing a movement of \ndetainees to the mainland, he would be unable to fulfill such an order \nbefore the close of this administration. Practically speaking, the \nclock has run out for the President.\n  As I have stated on this floor and to my good friend and colleague, \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, my issue has never been--let me \nmake this very clear--with Mr. Fanning's character, his courage, or his \ncapability. He will be a tremendous leader as Army Secretary and will \ndo great by our soldiers at Fort Leavenworth, Fort Riley, and--let me \nemphasize--every soldier serving our Nation today.\n  I just talked to Mr. Fanning this afternoon and let him know I was \nreleasing this hold and wished him good luck on his speech to the \ngraduates of West Point. I look forward to voting for Mr. Fanning, who \nhas always had my support for this position.\n  I am happy to support his nomination today with these new assurances \nfrom the administration and from the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee to work with me to strengthen \nprovisions on funding for the transfer of detainees to the mainland in \nthis year's National Defense Authorization Act. I have worked closely \nwith Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed. I look forward to \ncompleting work on an authorizing bill shortly. Additionally, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee is committed to prohibiting funding for \nconstruction or modification to any facility in the United States for \nthe purpose of housing detainees in this year's MILCON funding bill \ncurrently on the floor.\n  With the clock running down on the last months of the Obama \nadministration, it is increasingly improbable that this administration \ncould bring high-value terrorists and their associated risks to an \nAmerican community like Fort Leavenworth, KS.\n  The bottom line is this: We have run out the clock, and Congress \nlooks to prohibit this administration from moving detainees to the \nmainland at every turn. As the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney \nGeneral have testified before Congress, moving detainees to the \nmainland is prohibited by law and will remain so through the end of \nthis President's term.\n  I again thank my friend and my colleague, Senator McCain, for working\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nwith me to work this out. My congratulations to Secretary Eric \nFanning--Army Secretary Eric Fanning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I again thank my old friend from Kansas \nfor his agreement to move forward. I look forward to continuing our \nlong, many years' effort together to keep this Nation safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2850-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe Lee amendment No. 3897. I wish to take a moment to thank Senator \nCollins and Senator Jack Reed for their terrific work on this bill and \nfor how they teamed up to manage this bill in pretty much the right \nway.\n  With this legislation, we are making critical investments in our \ntransportation, housing, and community development programs. In this \ncountry today, one in four families who rent spend more than half of \ntheir income on housing. We have been taught from young adulthood on \nthat you shouldn't spend more than 25, 30, or 35 percent at the most on \nhouse payments or rent, yet one-fourth of Americans are spending more \nthan half of their income on housing.\n  I recently read the book ``Evicted'' by Matthew Desmond. In that \nbook, one renter was quoted as saying that when her paycheck came in, \nher rent eats first. She had kids who were hungry. She had bus tokens \nto buy so she could get to work. With all of the challenges she had, \nshe said: My rent eats first. We know what that means.\n  In housing, whether it is in rural Maine or whether it is in urban or \nrural Ohio, we know that rental prices have continued to go up and up. \nEvictions are so much more common than they were a decade or, \nespecially, two decades ago. That has to change, and it makes clear why \nwe need to maintain our existing affordable housing resources.\n  This bill focuses on improving the quality of federally assisted \nhouses and removing lead paint hazards from homes. We know the effect \nthat has on us. We learned from Flint about water, but we know an even \nbigger problem is lead in paint. In 2007, in the city that I call home, \nthe city of Cleveland--the ZIP Code I live in, 44105--there were more \nforeclosures in my ZIP Code than any ZIP Code in the United States. We \nalso know in cities like Cleveland and rural areas like Appalachia, \nwhere most of the housing stock is World War II or older, almost all of \nthat housing stock has toxic levels of lead paint.\n  The bill pays particular attention to transit safety. The Banking \nCommittee oversees transit. Senator Mikulski has worked with Senator \nShelby and me, as well as our colleagues representing the local area--\nSenators Warner, Cardin, and Kaine--to make sure the FTA has the \nresources needed to oversee the Washington Metro. It is something we \nhave neglected for decades.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for working with us to ensure that \nyoung foster care alumni don't have to choose between getting the \neducation they need to be self-sufficient and having a roof over their \nheads. I wish more funds were available for these important \ninvestments--particularly, additional funding to address family \nhomelessness. But I thank my colleagues for their work within the \nsubcommittee's funding constraints and their attention to these \ncritical issues. I especially thank the chair, Susan Collins, for that.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Lee's amendment will undermine some of the \ngood we are doing with this legislation. It will prohibit the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development from carrying out a key \ncomponent of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. When Congress passed that \nbill in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., it \nmade housing discrimination illegal in every State in the Nation for \nthe first time.\n  For generations, redlining, restrictive covenants, and outright \ndiscrimination kept families of color locked out of entire \nneighborhoods and created segregated communities that linger to this \nday. These were tools of racial oppression as well as economic \noppression, and in far too many cases, they went hand in hand. The Fair \nHousing Act made these despicable practices illegal everywhere.\n  Congress included another important component in the Fair Housing \nAct: a requirement that HUD and its grantees administer their federal \nhousing and urban development grants in a way that would affirmatively \nfurther fair housing. State and local governments and public housing \nauthorities were required to use their Federal funds in ways that would \nreverse, rather than reinforce, segregation in these communities. But \ntoday, the outlines of decades-old discrimination are still too \nvisible.\n  I listened to a preacher on Martin Luther King Day on a cold \nCleveland January morning 2\\1/2\\ years ago. He said something we all \nknow but don't think enough about: Life expectancy is connected to your \nZIP Code. Whether you grow up on the east side of Cleveland, whether \nyou grow up in a wealthy suburb, whether you grow up in Appalachia, \nwhether you grow up in a prosperous small town, your ZIP Code \ndetermines whether you have access to good health care, to quality \neducation, to social support necessary to succeed. When where you live \nmatters this much, we all have a moral obligation to ensure that \nfamilies can live in the neighborhoods of their choice and to ensure \nthat communities are creating opportunity in every ZIP Code. \nUnfortunately, in the 50 years since our country passed the Fair \nHousing Act, HUD has not provided enough direction to help communities \nmeet this goal.\n  A 2010 GAO report recommended that HUD take action to improve its \nprocess for meeting its obligations, including three things: \nestablishing standards and a format for grantees to follow, requiring \ngrantees to establish timeframes for implementing their plans, and \nrequiring grantees to submit their analyses to HUD for review.\n  HUD developed a new rule that will finally help local governments \nacross the country support and foster fair housing policies that create \nvibrant and integrated communities. This rule was developed through a \n2-year public process. Twelve of my colleagues and I urged Secretary \nCastro to develop a\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nstrong rule after considering comments from stakeholders.\n  Senator Lee's amendment would stop HUD from responding to those GAO \nrecommendations. The updated rule will give communities the clarity and \nthe tools they need to meet their obligations and fulfill this duty \nthat this Senate has supported in a bipartisan way for going on five \ndecades now.\n  Some of the questions communities will ask during these assessments \nmay demand that they think in new ways about how to create housing \nopportunities for all the residents, regardless of race, religion, \ndisability, or the size of their families. These are the types of \nquestions this body told the country to ask when it enacted the Fair \nHousing Act in 1968.\n  We need to invest Federal resources in ways that provide access to \nopportunity to all citizens in every ZIP Code.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Lee amendment.\n\n\n                             Invictus Games\n\n  Madam President, last week athletes from around the world traveled to \nOrlando to compete in the second Invictus Games. Like all athletes, \nthey participate for many reasons--camaraderie, personal discipline, \nthe joy of the game. But the Invictus competitors are so much more: \nThey are veterans who fought for our country and our allies and were \nwounded or suffered mental injuries in service to a cause greater than \nthemselves.\n  The games were founded in 2014 by England's Prince Harry to bring \nActive-Duty servicemembers and veterans together to compete in an \ninternational sporting event and to recognize their achievements. These \nwarrior athletes have already given so much for our country. They have \nseen the horrors of combat, spent months and years away from their \nfamilies, and suffered injuries, both visible and not so visible. They \nhave been changed forever by the realities of war but, as Invictus \nshows, they have not been defeated.\n  The name of the games comes from the poem of the same name by the \n19th century British poet William Ernest Henley. ``Invictus'' means \n``unconquered.''\n  On a personal note, ``Invictus'' was my father's favorite poem, which \nwe shared at his funeral. I became even more interested in these games \nbecause it means ``unconquered.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the poem ``Invictus'' by William Ernest Henley.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              ``Invictus''\n\n                       (By William Ernest Henley)\n\n     Out of the night that covers me,\n     Black as the pit from pole to pole,\n     I thank whatever gods may be\n     For my unconquerable soul.\n\n     In the fell clutch of circumstance\n     I have not winced nor cried aloud.\n     Under the bludgeonings of chance\n     My head is bloody, but unbowed.\n\n     Beyond this place of wrath and tears\n     Looms but the Horror of the shade,\n     And yet the menace of the years\n     Finds and shall find me unafraid.\n\n     It matters not how strait the gate,\n     How charged with punishments the scroll,\n     I am the master of my fate,\n     I am the captain of my soul.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, the words of ``Invictus'' have inspired \nmen and women for generations, and the spirit is alive in the athletes \nwho represented their countries in Orlando.\n  Three people from my State competed on the U.S. team. Army CPT Kelly \nElmlinger is a mother, cancer survivor, and fierce competitor who grew \nup in Attica in Seneca County, which is in my part of the State. She \nbrought home the gold for our country in the women's 400-meter dash.\n  Team USA included Brian McPherson, a Marine Corps sergeant from \nNashport, just east of Columbus. Sergeant McPherson has battled a \ntraumatic brain injury sustained while deployed in Iraq when a suicide \nbomber walked into his unit. He competed in track and field and cycle \ncompetitions. He said:\n\n       I am a son, brother, uncle, professional, Marine, and \n     athlete who proudly stands before you after being ravaged by \n     war. I was and am changed from these events but they lead me \n     to what I now consider a greater path.\n       Those times have taught me much about myself, while giving \n     me the additional skills to leave the Marines and integrate \n     back into society.\n\n  Competitions like this have been so important to that journey.\n  He said:\n\n       Adaptive sports gave me the strength to be an example for \n     fellow servicemembers, civilians, and myself. I learned of a \n     passion I didn't know existed deep within me.\n       Sports have given me an outlet and time to sort through my \n     thoughts and emotions.\n\n  Lastly, Stephen Miller, a retired Navy officer from Cleveland, \ncompeted in indoor rowing in Orlando. He said:\n\n       Training helps to remind me that I am part of a team and \n     family. I get to share the experiences, recovery and memories \n     not only with US athletes, but also with our allies and \n     comrades.\n\n  He, Sergeant McPherson, Captain Elmlinger, and all of the Invictus \ncompetitors embody William Ernest Henley's words:\n\n       It matters not how strait the gate,\n       How charged with punishments the scroll,\n       I am the master of my fate,\n       I am the captain of my soul.\n\n  These athletes have mastered fate on the battlefield, the sports \nfield, and have overcome more trials than almost any of us could \nimagine. Their perseverance serves as a testament to the power of the \nhuman spirit. It isn't sympathy or charity that we owe these heroes; we \nowe them gratitude, respect, and the opportunity to live a life that \nbefits their service and sacrifice for our great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3900, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak in support of the Blunt-\nMurray-Graham-Leahy amendment, which provides $1.1 billion in emergency \nfunding to combat the Zika virus.\n  The map of the United States beside me beside me shows the Centers \nfor Disease Control's estimate of the range of the two types of \nmosquito that may spread Zika. As you can see, this public health \nemergency is not in some far-off land. It could easily end up in the \nbackyards of tens of millions of Americans. Before I discuss the \npending bill I want to mention that earlier this afternoon I voted for \nthe Nelson-Rubio Zika supplemental, which would have provided the full \n$1.9 billion requested by the President months ago.\n  It is mystifying to me that Republicans voted to defeat that \namendment, considering that Zika is spreading faster and in more ways \nthan predicted when the President first requested those funds. The \nexcuse we have heard for months, particularly from House Republican \nleaders, is that they don't have enough information about the proposed \nuses of the funds.\n  Have they bothered to attend any of the briefings, or if briefings \nweren't enough, to pick up the phone and call the head of the CDC, or \nthe Director of the National Institute of Health, or any of the other \nexperts who have been sounding alarm bells since last year?\n  In a little over a year the Zika virus has spread from Brazil to \nalmost every country and territory in this hemisphere. There is no \nquestion that it is spreading faster and is more dangerous than was \nanticipated just a few months ago.\n  As this map shows, more than half the continental United States, \nincluding my own state of Vermont, is now projected to be within the \nrange of Zika carrying mosquitos. The virus can have devastating \nconsequences for many of those who become infected, particularly \nchildren. We need to act, and if there is one area where politicians \nshould not second guess the medical experts, it is how to respond to \npublic health emergencies.\n  So what did the House of Representatives do? First, they don't treat \nthe Zika crisis as an emergency, even though it has spread to 36 \ncountries and territories in this hemisphere and has been declared a \npublic health emergency by the World Health Organization.\n  The House bill, introduced yesterday, would cut the amount requested \nby more than two-thirds, rob from other programs like the funds to \ncombat Ebola, and limit the availability of Zika funds to the remaining \n4 months of this fiscal year. More than half a billion dollars in Ebola \nfunds have already been reprogrammed to combat Zika because it would \nhave been irresponsible for the administration to wait any longer while \nCongress\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nfailed to act as the mosquitoes came north. But Ebola remains a deadly \nthreat. Cases of Ebola continue to be confirmed in West Africa, and we \nhave seen how one Ebola case today can become a dozen cases tomorrow \nand a hundred cases the next day. How quickly people here forget the \nfear that gripped this country after a single Ebola-related death in \nTexas 2 years ago. The funds we appropriated to combat Ebola are being \nput to good use, including to strengthen the capacity of African \ncountries to respond to future outbreaks of Ebola or something even \nworse.\n  The emergency funding in this bill includes $258 million for the \nDepartment of State and USAID to combat Zika in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. These funds will support efforts to control the spread of \nZika and other insect-borne diseases, including to protect maternal \nhealth, expand public education on prevention, and encourage private \nsector research for the development of vaccines and diagnostics. These \nfunds will provide contributions to international organizations, \nincluding the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health \nOrganization, to reduce the impact of the disease on infants and their \nfamilies, and accelerate diagnosis. Funds are also included for \nDepartment of State and USAID operations to implement programs in the \nfield, and provide medical support for U.S. citizens, State Department, \nUSAID, and other Federal Government employees stationed overseas.\n  If the Zika virus is not controlled in Latin America and the \nCaribbean, a year from now, it will likely be worse than projected and \nmore costly to control. And if we continue to rob Ebola funds, which \nare being used for the purposes Congress intended, we simply shift the \nrisk from one life-threatening disease to another. That makes no sense \nat all.\n  If there is one thing on which Republicans and Democrats, House and \nSenate, should agree it is doing whatever is necessary to protect the \nAmerican people from dangerous, contagious diseases. It is past time \nfor us to act, and I urge all Senators to support the Blunt-Murray-\nGraham-Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nPolice Week to honor and thank the men and women in uniform, law \nenforcement officers in our great State of New Hampshire who do a \nphenomenal job every single day keeping us safe.\n  When I worked as attorney general, I was honored to work directly \nwith our law enforcement officers at every level in our State. We have \nthe very finest law enforcement officers in the State of New Hampshire. \nDuring this week, I want to thank them for every single thing they have \ndone under the difficult circumstances they face every day in order to \nmake sure our communities are safe in the State of New Hampshire.\n  Tragically, just last week we had an example of the dangers our \npolice officers face every single day when two Manchester police \nofficers were shot in the line of duty early Friday morning.\n  Early Friday morning, Officer Ryan Hardy encountered a situation on \nSecond Street, where he noticed the description of someone who had \nrobbed a gas station the night before. As he was approaching this \nindividual, Officer Hardy was shot multiple times at close range. The \nindividual fled, and then this suspect fired into a group of police \nofficers, and when he did that, he unfortunately also shot Officer \nMatthew O'Connor in the leg. Both of these police officers acted with \ngreat heroism, tenacity, and courage in the work they do every single \nday on the streets of Manchester. All of the police officers who \nresponded that day did a phenomenal job, but that is an example of what \nour police officers are facing on a daily basis. They don't know \nwhether the next stop they make of someone is going to go bad. \nUnfortunately, early on Friday morning, it did go bad.\n\n  We are so grateful for their service, for the service of Officer \nHardy and the service of Officer O'Connor. We are grateful and blessed \nthat despite significant injuries, they are doing OK and they did not \nget killed in the line of duty.\n  I just want to say to them, I want to say to the Manchester Police \nDepartment, and I want to say to their wives, Amanda and Elise--because \nfamilies serve too. We worry about our police officers, but I know from \nhaving served as attorney general of New Hampshire that every time we \nare home on Thanksgiving or we are home on Christmas or we are home on \nsome other holiday or great occasion, guess what our police officers \nare out doing. They are out patrolling our streets and our highways, \nkeeping us safe, making sure we can enjoy that moment with our \nfamilies. But their families worry. They worry when they are out: Is my \nloved one going to come home?\n  So I say to the families of our law enforcement officers as we stand \nhere during National Police Week: Thank you. Thank you for what you do \nin allowing your loved ones to serve and for supporting our law \nenforcement officers because families serve too.\n  We are so grateful for what Officer Hardy and Officer O'Connor did on \nthat early Friday morning, and we are grateful to all of the officers \nwho responded to that call. I am grateful they are doing well in their \nrecovery. We wish them the very best. They continue to be in my prayers \nand in my family's prayers for a speedy recovery. All of the police \nofficers in our State are in my prayers.\n  When I was attorney general, two of the most difficult moments I had \nwere giving a eulogy at the funerals of two police officers who were \nkilled in the line of duty during my time as Attorney General. One of \nthem, Officer Bruce McKay, had served the Franconia Police Department \nfor 12 years, and he was brutally murdered in 2007 during a traffic \nstop. The other police officer was Officer Michael Briggs. In fact, on \nSunday I am going to the dedication of a community center in Manchester \nin honor of Officer Michael Briggs.\n  It is hard to believe it has been 10 years since he was killed in the \nline of duty, but the fact that they are naming a community center in \nhis honor there in the center of Manchester, where he helped so many \nyoung people and so many people in how he served the people of \nManchester, is a testament to the kind of person he was.\n  I got to know the family of Officer Michael Briggs very closely, \nincluding his parents Lee and Maryann and his wife Laura and his sons, \nBrian and Mitchell. I want them to know today--I know it has been \nalmost 10 years, but I will never forget--and we will never forget--\ntheir sacrifice and certainly what Officer Michael Briggs did for the \nState of New Hampshire, his heroism.\n  In fact, before he served as a Manchester police officer--as I think \nabout coming toward the 10th anniversary of his death--before he served \nas a police officer, he served as a marine, serving our country in the \nline of duty. He served as a corrections officer also and did an \nincredible job. In fact, he received awards for saving people's lives, \nrunning into burning buildings to save people in the line of duty. I \nwill never forget that he saved the life of the individual who murdered \nhim. He had saved his life before. Unfortunately, he was murdered by a \ncareer criminal in the line of duty. That is a true example of the \nheroism of our police officers, the service and sacrifice they make, as \nwell as their families. Unfortunately, that says it all right there.\n  So today as I stand on the Senate floor, I think about my time as \nattorney general, I certainly think about the families of the police \nofficers who have been killed in the line of duty in New Hampshire and \nthe sacrifices that every single day our men and women in uniform make \non our behalf.\n  On Friday in New Hampshire there will be a law enforcement memorial \nceremony. It is a ceremony I plan to attend. It is a ceremony where \neach year we read the names that are etched into the memorial of those \nlaw enforcement officers who have been killed in the line of duty in \nNew Hampshire. There have been far too many--far too many--who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice so the rest of us could live our lives in \nsafety and in happiness. One of the privileges I had as attorney \ngeneral was to read the names of our law enforcement officers who were \nkilled in the line of duty, to recognize their service and their \nsacrifice, with often many of their family members there--family \nmembers who would offer a\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nflower or a beautiful wreath to recognize the sacrifice of their family \nso we could remember their family member, the law enforcement officers \nwho were killed in the line of duty.\n  Today on the Senate floor I would like to read the names of these \npolice officers who were killed in the line of duty in New Hampshire. I \nknow we will recognize them in New Hampshire on Friday, but I want to \nrecognize them on the Senate floor. They are, from Cheshire County, \nDeputy Sheriff John Walker, Sr.; from Dover, Officer George Pray; from \nLaconia, Police Officer Charles H. Dolloff; from Strafford County, \nDeputy Sheriff Charles E. Smith; from Manchester, Sergeant Henry \nMcAllister; from Manchester, Inspector William M. Moher; from Exeter, \nOfficer Albert L. Colson; from Nashua, Patrolman James H. Roche; from \nCarroll County, Sheriff Harry M. Leavitt; from New Hampshire State \nPolice, Raymond Elliott; from Lancaster, Chief Andrew T. Malloy; from \nNew Hampshire State Police, Trooper Harold B. Johnson; from Colebrook, \nChief Fred T. Towle; from Nashua, Patrolman Michael Latvis; from New \nHampshire State Police, Lieutenant Ivan H. Hayes; from Northumberland, \nOfficer Joseph H. Platt; from Nashua, Patrolman Edward C. Graziano; \nfrom New Hampshire Fish and Game, Conservation Officer William Mooney; \nfrom New Hampshire Fish and Game, Conservation Officer Gary Waterhouse; \nfrom Farmington, Assistant Chief Louis A. Sheets; from Berlin, Officer \nRobert Devoid; from Berlin, Officer Dorman Wheelock; from Gorham, \nOfficer Jerome O. Piet; from Rockingham County, Department of \nCorrections Officer Robert Charles Prescott; from New Hampshire Fish \nand Game, Conservation Officer James Clark II; from Nashua, Acting \nChief Armand J. Roussel; from Seabrook, Chief Charles S. Knowles; from \nDurham, Lieutenant Robert Hollis, Jr.; from Berlin, Sergeant Paul G. \nBrodeur; from Manchester, Officer Ralph W. Miller; from New Hampshire \nState Police, Trooper Richard F. Champy; from Somersworth, Patrolman \nDonald R. Kowalski; from Jaffrey, Police Supervisor William E. O'Neil, \nSr.; from Hanover, Chief James H. Collins; from Derry, Sergeant Thomas \nC. Kelly; from New Hampshire State Police, Trooper Gary P. Parker; from \nNew Hampshire State Police, Trooper Joseph Edward Gearty; from Antrim, \nChief of Police Ralph C. Brooks; from New Hampshire State Police, \nSergeant James Stanwood Noyes; from East Kingston, Officer Melvin Alan \nKeddy; from Auburn, Lieutenant Donald Eaton; from New Hampshire State \nPolice, Trooper Leslie George Lord; from New Hampshire State Police, \nTrooper Scott Edward Phillips; from Epsom, Patrolman Jeremy T. Charron; \nfrom Manchester, Officer Michael Leland Briggs; from Franconia, \nCorporal N. Bruce McKay; from Greenland, Chief of Police Michael P. \nMaloney; and from Brentwood, Patrolman Stephen Arkell.\n  As I read those names, it obviously strikes me--it is shocking how \nmany names are on that wall in our State. Having met and worked with so \nmany of our law enforcement officers--they are incredibly brave. The \nsacrifices of their families are tremendous.\n  Most recently, I went to two community events to recognize--really \nmemorialize--these fallen heroes. The Maloney family and the Arkell \nfamily have started foundations to help other police families, to help \nhave scholarships in the names of these two decorated officers. \nUnfortunately, those are the two most recent additions to this wall.\n  Chief Maloney embodied the values of service, integrity, and honor. \nHis leadership in the Greenland Police Department will never be \nforgotten. He was admired by everyone in the community. This is another \nexample of the sacrifice our police officers make. He was only a few \ndays before his retirement. He could have stayed in the station, but he \nwent out to the call with his fellow officers and, when the situation \nescalated, Chief Maloney did what he always did. He put his life before \nhis fellow officers, and because of his sacrifices that day, other \nlives were saved. Unfortunately, we lost Chief Maloney in the line of \nduty just days before his retirement. If that is not a hero, I don't \nknow what is and who is.\n  When I think about his family, and having gotten to know his family, \nI know today, as we think about the importance of this week, I just \nwant to say thank you to them and just let them know they continue to \nbe in our prayers, and we will not forget Chief Maloney's service and \nhis sacrifice and his heroism.\n  Likewise, just like Chief Maloney, Officer Stephen Arkell was taken \nfrom us far too soon. He was an unsung hero. He went about his \nextraordinary work as a police officer very quietly and humbly, going \nabove and beyond the call of duty not only as a police officer but as a \ncoach in his community, as someone who has helped so many other people \nand made a difference in people's lives. During his 15-year career as a \npolice officer, he made a difference for the people of Brentwood. He \nmade us proud, and he was another true hero in his community.\n  Today, during National Police Week, I want to say to his family, who \nrecently had a 5K in his honor to provide scholarships for others in \nthe Brentwood community, thank you for your sacrifice. We will never \nforget the sacrifice of Officer Stephen Arkell.\n  During National Police Week, as I stand on the Senate floor, one of \nthe things that has bothered me is, too often the rhetoric we have been \nhearing about our police and our law enforcement officers out in the \npublic discussion has been negative. It has been negative. It has been \nsweeping. It has been basically stereotyping our police, and it has \nbeen wrong. So, today, during this important week, I want to say to our \nlaw enforcement officers in New Hampshire, I want to say to the law \nenforcement officers across this country who keep us safe: Thank you. \nWe stand with you. We are proud of you. We have your back because we \nknow you have our backs every single day, because we would not be a \nfree and safe society but for the sacrifices our law enforcement \nofficers make every single day in New Hampshire and in every State in \nthis country. They are the thin blue line between us and those who want \nto do us harm and threaten our way of life.\n  So when we hear people who are making sweeping generalizations about \nour police that are negative, I want the people of this country to \nthink about what it would be like if we didn't have the courageous law \nenforcement officers who patrol our streets every single day, who go \nout on nights and weekends and holidays when we are safely home \nsleeping, who are out making sure we are safe. We should stand up for \nour law enforcement officers.\n  This week, of all weeks, as we are here for National Police Week, we \nneed to honor our law enforcement officers. We need to thank our men \nand women in uniform who patrol our streets and our highways and in \nevery way protect us, whether as corrections officers or Fish and Game \nofficers or as State police--at every single level in the State of New \nHampshire, we say thank you. We stand with you. I thank you. I hope \nthat as we stand here this week, all of us will make sure that we thank \nalso the Capitol Police for the incredible work they do here keeping us \nsafe and defending this Capitol.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to speak about an amendment \nthat I am going to propose right away. It is about fidelity to the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights--specifically, fidelity to the \nSecond Amendment as it involves the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  There appears to be a troubling trend within the VA. As of December \n2015, almost 99 percent of the names listed on the ``mental defective'' \ncategory for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, \notherwise known as the national gun-ban list, are from the Veterans \nAdministration. Once a person's name is on that list, they are banned \nfrom owning or possessing a firearm. Their Second Amendment rights are \ncompletely null and void.\n  Now, why is this happening? Once the VA determines that a veteran \nrequires a fiduciary to administer benefit payments, the VA reports \nthat veteran to the gun-ban list, resulting in a total denial of a \nveteran's right to possess and own firearms. In other words, their \nSecond Amendment rights are being denied.\n  The VA has attempted to justify its actions by relying on regulations \nthat grant limited authority to determine incompetence only in the \ncontext of financial affairs. So I quote: ``Rating\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nagencies have sole authority to make official determinations of \ncompetency and incompetency for the purpose of insurance and \ndisbursement of benefits.''\n  It is clear, therefore, that the VA's core regulatory authority \napplies to matters of competency for financial purposes. Importantly, \nthis financial fiduciary standard has been employed since way back in \nthe 1970s. It has nothing to do with regulating firearms. Yet that is \nexactly what is happening. Firearms are being regulated. Federal law \nrequires that before a person is reported to a gun-ban list, they be \ndetermined a ``mental defective.''\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives created a \nregulation to define what ``mental defective'' means. It includes, \namong other requirements, that a person is a danger to self or others. \nGranted, the VA regulation at issue and the ATF regulation do share \nsome of the same language. But the intent and the purpose are totally \ndifferent. On the one hand, the VA regulation is designed to appoint a \nfiduciary. On the other hand, the ATF regulation is designed to \nregulate firearms.\n  Now, this is a huge distinction. The level of mental impairment that \njustifies taking away the right to possess and own firearms must rest \nat a severe and substantial level--a level where the mere possession of \na firearm constitutes a danger to self or others. That decision is \nnever made by the VA, or the Veterans Administration, before submitting \nnames to the gun-ban list.\n  As such, imposing a gun ban is a harsh result that could sweep up \nveterans that are fully capable of appropriately operating a firearm \nfor self-defense purposes. So how does this work, then, in practice? \nThe Daily Caller interviewed a veteran who had been a victim of this VA \nprocess for an April 21, 2015, article.\n  The veteran reportedly told a VA counselor, who asked about how he \nhandles his finances, that on the mere suggestion of his wife, he now \nuses auto debit for bills so he doesn't have to go to the post office. \nThe VA doctor put down that he doesn't pay his own bills, and his wife \nhandles his finances. The next thing he knew was that his wife was \nappointed as his fiduciary and his name was placed on the gun-ban list.\n  Whether or not he handles his own finances, what does that have to do \nwith talking away a veteran's right to self-defense? After all, this is \nthe core purpose of the Second Amendment--self-defense. Self-defense is \na natural right of all individuals. It is a God-given right. It is a \nright that existed before the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution were ever drafted. It is a sacred right.\n  The Supreme Court has held the Second Amendment to be a fundamental \nright. So, when the Federal Government erases that right for any given \nindividual, it better then have compelling justification to do so. \nAssigning a fiduciary is not a compelling justification. That is \nespecially so when the VA does not even determine whether veterans are \na danger to themselves or others before reporting the names to that \ngun-ban list.\n  Further, the VA fails to offer adequate constitutional due process \nprotections. The standard of review--clear and convincing evidence--is \nparticularly low in light of the fact that a constitutional right is \ninvolved. Hearsay is allowed in the hearing process, and the burden of \nproof is on the veteran to show that they are competent to manage their \nfinances. In essence, it is the veteran who has the burden of proof of \nshowing that they should maintain their Second Amendment rights, \nalthough, again, that is not even the purpose of the hearing. That \ncannot stand. When constitutional issues are at stake, the burden ought \nto be on the government.\n  Finally, the hearing that does take place is before VA employees, not \na neutral arbiter. With these significant flaws, it is clear that the \nVA regulatory scheme is inherently suspect. Importantly, these VA \nregulations have been in place since the 1970s, well before even the \nexistence of a gun-ban list. The Supreme Court held the Second \nAmendment to be a fundamental right in 2010. Associate Justice Alito, \nwho wrote the opinion of the Court, stated: ``It is clear that the \nFramers . . . counted the right to keep and bear arms among those \nfundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.''\n  It cannot be said that the VA's regulatory scheme adequately protects \nthe liberty interests of the veteran--quite the contrary. The VA \nregulatory scheme is an example of the Federal Government once again \ngoing too far. As government expands, liberty contracts. There are just \ntoo many flaws in the VA's regulatory scheme that result in a failure \nat ensuring constitutional demands are met.\n  There has been no update to the VA's protocols since the Supreme \nCourt's decision in 2010. During the course of my oversight of this \nissue, not even the Department of Justice can adequately explain why \nthere has been no substantive update to the gun-reporting system. That \nis why I have introduced this amendment.\n  My amendment is simple. It is straightforward. It makes perfect \nconstitutional sense. It simply requires that before the VA reports \nnames to the Department of Justice for eventual placement on the gun-\nban list, the Veterans Administration must first find that a veteran is \na danger to himself, herself, or others, and that finding must be done \nvia judicial order.\n  These requirements do three important things: First, it makes the \n``danger to self or others'' standard applicable to the VA. We all \nagree, don't we, that dangerous persons must not own or possess \nfirearms.\n  Second, it shifts the burden of proof from the veteran and onto the \ngovernment, where it ought to be. Third, it fixes the conditional due \nprocess issues by moving the hearing from the VA to the judicial \nsystem.\n  Like I said, these are commonsense constitutional fixes, but, more \nimportantly, it is what our Nation's veterans deserve. Our veteran \npopulation is sacred. They deserve the thanks of a grateful Nation, not \nthe iron fist of an out-of-control Federal Government.\n  Most importantly, the government must not unfairly target our veteran \npopulation simply because some may have challenges after returning home \nfrom war, like maybe having someone handle their finances. The fact \nthat almost 99 percent of the names in the gun-ban list of the category \nthat we call ``mental defective'' are from the VA raises suspicion that \nour government is unfairly targeting veterans.\n  That is why the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have \nexpressed strong support for my amendment. There is nothing more \noffensive to the principles of liberty than when the government takes \naway a person's constitutional rights when it has no right to take away \nthose constitutional rights. Moreover, I have heard from Iowa veterans \nthat some veterans are even reluctant to seek care from the VA for fear \nof losing their Second Amendment rights.\n  It is outrageous, then, that veterans are afraid to seek the care \nthey have actually earned by being in service to their country because \nthe VA might deprive them of a constitutionally protected right without \ndue process. This must stop.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Support it on \nconstitutional grounds, support it on fairness grounds, and support it \nfor the sake of veterans who may be wrongly targeted. To all of our \nNation's veterans, I say: God bless you, and thank you for your service \nto our great country. You deserve better than to have your rights \nviolated by the very agency that is supposed to fulfill our Nation's \ncommitment to you.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in making this very bad situation \nright--constitutionally right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na May 16, 2016, letter from the VFW supporting this approach.\n  I repeat for my colleagues that the American Legion supports it, but \nthey couldn't get a letter to us.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of the nearly 1.7 million \n     members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States \n     (VFW) and our Auxiliaries, I write in support of\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\n     your amendment to H.R. 2577, which would protect veterans' \n     rights under the Second Amendment of the United States \n     Constitution.\n       Currently, when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     makes the determination that a veteran would benefit from the \n     assistance of a fiduciary to handle his or her finances, VA \n     sends that veteran's name to the National Instant Check \n     System, preventing them from legally purchasing firearms. The \n     VFW has long opposed this practice, believing that veterans \n     who swore to support and defend the United States \n     Constitution should not lose their rights under the Second \n     Amendment simply because they need fiduciary assistance. The \n     need for a fiduciary in no way implies that they are a danger \n     to themselves or others. By ensuring that no veteran loses \n     his or her right to purchase firearms without order or \n     finding of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority \n     of competent jurisdiction, your amendment would put an end to \n     this objectionable VA practice.\n       The VFW thanks you for your leadership on this issue, and \n     your commitment to protecting veterans' constitutional rights \n     and liberties. We look forward to working with you and your \n     staff to pass this much needed amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Raymond C. Kelley,\n                       Director, VFW National Legislative Service.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3925.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the explanation of \nmy friend and colleague from Iowa. I hope there are several things we \ncan agree on at the outset. The first is that we don't want someone who \nis a convicted felon or is so mentally unstable that they cannot be \ntrusted to own or purchase a firearm. I hope we can agree on that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Good.\n  I hope the next thing we can agree on is that we want to make certain \nthat our veterans are treated fairly, that they are given every \nconsideration for having served our country, but we do not want to put \nthem in harm's way either by way of suicide or by committing a crime \nwith a gun, and we want to have a process that respects that goal. I \nhope my colleague and friend from Iowa would agree with that.\n  The problem we have is the Senator from Iowa is amending an \nappropriations bill. The difficulty you face when you amend \nappropriations bills, in most instances, if you are not authorizing and \nstrictly sticking within the four corners of an appropriations bill, \nyou can cut off funds--no funds shall be spent for--and that is what \nthe amendment of the Senator from Iowa does. No funds shall be spent at \nthe Veterans' Administration for--and he just described the process.\n  Here is the difficulty. This amendment as written doesn't solve the \nproblem; it creates a bigger problem.\n  I will concede at the outset to the Senator from Iowa that we should \nbe sitting down and resolving a very serious issue between the \ndefinition of ``mental defect'' and ``mental competency'' between the \nNICS law and the VA. There is plenty of room for us to sit down and \ncome up with a reasonable way to deal with the situation. But the \namendment offered by the Senator from Iowa just basically says, \nunfortunately, that we are going to weaken the law that prohibits \npeople with serious mental illnesses from buying guns.\n  Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs informs the FBI NICS \ngun background check database when a veteran has been found in a VA \nproceeding to be mentally incompetent because of injury or disease. I \nwant to make sure that is clear in the Record. This is what it says. In \nconnection with an award of veterans' benefits, the VA formally may \ndetermine as ``mentally incompetent'' a person who ``because of injury \nor disease lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or \nher own affairs, including disbursement of funds without limitation.'' \nThis is an adjudication, a hearing on mental competency which goes to \nthe question of whether the veteran is mentally incompetent because of \ninjury or disease.\n  Under the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa, VA mental \nhealth determinations would no longer count as prohibiting gun \npossession. Tens of thousands of names currently in the NICS system \nwould likely need to be purged, meaning these people could go out and \nbuy guns. Last year the VA told my staff they had supplied 174,000 \nnames to the NICS database because of diagnosed mental conditions.\n  I do not dispute what the Senator from Iowa suggested--that some of \nthese veterans may be suffering from a mental illness not serious \nenough to disqualify them from owning a firearm, but certainly many of \nthem do.\n  Last year the VA told us that this list of 174,000 names includes \n10,168 individuals diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, 3,981 \nindividuals with major depressive disorder, 2,835 individuals with \nbipolar disorder, and many others who have been found to have very \nserious mental illnesses.\n  Allowing people with these serious mental illnesses to buy guns \nraises the very serious risk of suicide and violence. Already we are \nseeing an average of 22 suicides by veterans every single day. That is \ndouble that of the civilian population. To hand guns over to people \nsuch as the 14 or 15,000 whom I have just described who have serious \nmental illness is dangerous--dangerous to them, members of their \nfamily, and to the public.\n  The VA's referral process is not haphazard. There are due process \nsafeguards to make sure the VA is not referring names inappropriately. \nThe VA has set up a relief program for a veteran to contest a finding \nof mental competency. If we need to revisit that process--and as I said \nat the outset, I am not arguing that we shouldn't--we need to do it in \nthe context of substantive legislation so that we treat the veterans \nfairly, treat their families fairly, and treat the public fairly in \ndealing with this constitutional protection. But simply invalidating \nthe mental health records of 170,000 people the VA has supplied to the \nFBI, as this amendment would do, is dangerous--dangerous to the \nveterans, dangerous to their families, and dangerous to the public.\n  Let's do this in a thoughtful, orderly way, not by an appropriations \nbill.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, we are not talking about \nconvicted felons here, like the first thing the Senator from Illinois \nstarted to say. What we are trying to do is protect the constitutional \nrights of veterans, Second Amendment rights, and we are preventing the \ngovernment from spending money to violate the constitutional rights.\n  As I just made clear, the main purpose of the VA regulation is to \nappoint a fiduciary, not to regulate firearms, but it has the effect of \nregulating firearms. This standard has been in place since the 1970s. \nIt has nothing to do with regulating firearms.\n  Don't you think that since the Supreme Court held the Second \nAmendment to be a fundamental right in 2010, there ought to be an \nupdate of this system?\n  Indeed, Federal law made clear that the regulations prescribed by the \nVA Secretary are limited to ``the nature and extent of proof and \nevidence and the method of taking and furnishing them in order to \nestablish the right to benefits under such laws,'' 38 USC 501. Again, \nthat provides no authority to regulate firearms, but it has that \nimpact.\n  Just like the Senator from Illinois, I don't want dangerous persons \nto have firearms, but the government must first prove a person is a \ndanger before taking away their constitutional rights.\n  I am somewhat disappointed that Members on the other side of the \naisle would object to even considering an amendment that simply \nprotects veterans from having a fundamental, constitutional right taken \naway and doing it without due process.\n  When we were in the minority, we were accused of being obstructionist \nbecause we wouldn't go along with the then-majority leader's efforts to \nblock Senators of both parties from offering amendments. Now that we \nare in a majority, Senator McConnell has tried to restore the tradition \nof having amendments considered from both sides of the aisle. Yet we \nhave these old\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\ntricks--still refusing to vote on amendments that show the American \npeople whose side they are on.\n  I think this is an opportunity to show you are on the side of the \nveterans--veterans who probably handled guns in Iraq and Afghanistan \nnot being able to do that here.\n  I don't understand what is so tough about voting on whether veterans' \nconstitutional rights should be protected. It should be clear to anyone \npaying attention who is obstructing. They tried to destroy the Senate \nas a deliberative body when they were in the majority. Now they are \nobstructing a vote on protecting the fundamental constitutional rights \nof those who have put their lives on the line for our country.\n  Shame on you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before my friend and colleague leaves, we \nhave worked together for years, and I respect very much his legislative \ncapability. He and I are working together on some very important \nlegislation.\n  I am not a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I don't know if \nthe Senator from Iowa is a member--he is not. This is a subject matter \nthat is in the jurisdiction of that committee.\n  Let me just concede at the outset that reporting 174,000 names to the \nFBI goes too far, but eliminating 174,000 names goes too far. We need \nto find a reasonable way to identify those suffering from serious \nmental illness who would endanger themselves, their families, or others \nand to sort out those who don't fit in that category. We can do that \nand we should do that in a reasonable way, so we are respectful of \nveterans and also respectful of the general public's right to be safe \nfrom the misuse of firearms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would just say a simple thing. I have \nalready said we don't want dangerous people to have guns. But the point \nis that the VA is not identifying the people who might be a danger to \nthemselves or a danger to society. As the Senator from Illinois says, \nthey are simply doing it because ``You can't handle your own \nfinances.'' That is where their constitutional rights are being denied. \nTheir constitutional rights are being denied by a VA employee--maybe \nsomebody who doesn't know anything about mental health--and that is \nwrong. That is what we are trying to prevent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

BOARD OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 62 years ago today, the Supreme Court \nissued its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down \nlaws permitting racially segregated schools in 17 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson, the notorious 1896 decision \nthat found racially segregated schools could be, ``separate but \nequal.'' The Court unanimously held that laws requiring racial \nsegregation in schools violate the Equal Protection clause of the 14th \nAmendment and recognized that equal access to education is a \nfundamental civil right. In the Brown v. Board opinion, Chief Justice \nEarl Warren wrote, ``in the field of public education, the doctrine of \n`separate but equal' has no\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\nplace. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''\n  As I have said before, this historic decision was the most important \nSupreme Court decision of the 20th century--and perhaps of all time. \nShortly after the decision, the New York Times published an editorial \nthat stated: ``The Supreme Court's historic decision in the school \ndesegregation cases brings the United States back into the mainstream \nof its own best traditions. Segregation is a hangover of slavery, and \nits ugliest manifestation has been in the schools.''\n  While the Brown decision was a historic victory for equality, this \nanniversary is bittersweet. We have made great progress in the last 62 \nyears, but there is much work that remains to be done to create ``the \nmore perfect union'' that our Constitution promises. Significant racial \ndisparities persist in our schools, as well as our economy and our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Just last week, following a five-decade legal battle, a Federal \ndistrict court judge ordered a school district in Mississippi to \ndesegregate. In her opinion, Judge Debra Brown wrote that: ``[the \nschool district's] delay in desegregation has deprived generations of \nstudents of the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an integrated \neducation. Although no court order can right these wrongs, it is the \nduty of the District to ensure that not one more student suffers under \nthis burden.''\n  It is shocking to consider that, six decades after the Brown \ndecision, there is still resistance to the Court's mandate to \ndesegregate our schools.\n  We also continue to see efforts to make it more difficult for African \nAmericans and other minorities to exercise the most fundamental \nconstitutional right, the right to vote. Three years after the Brown v. \nBoard of Education decision, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nspoke at the Lincoln Memorial during a prayer pilgrimage to Washington.\n  In a speech entitled ``Give Us the Ballot,'' Dr. King described the, \n``noble and sublime decision'' in Brown, as well as the massive \nresistance to enforcing the decision. Dr. King noted that: ``many \nstates have risen up in open defiance. The legislative halls of the \nSouth ring loud with such words as `interposition' and `nullification.' \nBut even more, all types of conniving methods are still being used to \nprevent [African-Americans] from becoming registered voters. The denial \nof this sacred right is a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of \nour democratic tradition.''\n  Dr. King knew that there was a vital connection between desegregation \nand the right to vote. Without Federal voting protections, African \nAmericans would not have a voice in government to ensure that the \nSupreme Court's decision in Brown was fully implemented. He went on to \nsay, ``our most urgent request to the President of the United States \nand every member of Congress is to give us the right to vote. . . . \nGive us the ballot.''\n  Eight years later, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. For \nyears, this landmark legislation was recognized as a great achievement. \nIt was repeatedly reauthorized by large, bipartisan majorities in \nCongress. However, 3 years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme \nCourt gutted the Voting Rights Act. In a divided 5-4 vote, the Court \nstruck down the provision that required certain jurisdictions with a \nhistory of discrimination to preclear changes to their voting laws with \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Since the decision, States like Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and \nMississippi have put in place restrictive state voting laws, which all \ntoo often have a disproportionate impact on lower-income and minority \nvoters.\n  Sixty-two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board \nof Education, it is clear there is much more work to do. We should \nremember Dr. King's words in 1957. We should restore the law he \nimplored Congress to enact. It is time to bring the bipartisan Voting \nRights Advancement Act to the floor and ensure that the Federal \nGovernment is once again able to fully protect the fundamental right to \nvote.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States stands just across the street \nfrom here. On the front of the Court four words are engraved: ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' Those words are a promise and a challenge to all \nof us. On this day, the anniversary of one of the Court's greatest \ntriumphs, let us rededicate ourselves to ensuring that those four \nwords--``Equal Justice Under Law''--ring true for this generation and \nfuture generations of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2869-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2870-S2872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 62nd anniversary of the \nSupreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which \nreaffirmed our Nation's commitment to justice and equality by ending \nracial segregation in our public schools. The unanimous Court overruled \none of its worst precedents in Plessy v. Ferguson and held that ``in \nthe field of public education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has \nno place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''\n  For generations, the Brown v. Board decision has been viewed as a \nturning point in the effort to eradicate the shameful legacy of Jim \nCrow and racial segregation. On this anniversary, we are reminded of \nthe significance of a strong and independent Supreme Court, as set \nforth in our Constitution. Americans respect the Court as our guardian \nof the Constitution and the rule of law. Each generation of Americans \nsince the Nation's founding has worked to bend the arc of the moral \nuniverse further toward justice, seeking to fulfill the Constitution's \nstated purpose of forming ``a more perfect Union.'' In Brown v. Board, \nthe Court's unanimous decision reflected that we are a nation of laws \nand that equal justice under law has meaning.\n  Unfortunately, while we commemorate this momentous Supreme Court \ndecision today, we find the Supreme Court today weakened by Senate \nRepublicans' current obstruction. It is an undisputable fact that the \nRepublicans' refusal to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland's \nnomination means that the Supreme Court will be without a full nine \njustices for more than one of its terms. The Republican argument \narticulated in February that they should delay all consideration \nbecause it is an election year has no precedent and is unprincipled. It \nshows contempt for the Court as an institution and as an independent \nand coequal branch of government.\n  The result of Republicans' sustained obstruction is that the Court is \ntaking on fewer cases, and even in the cases it does hear, it has \nrepeatedly been unable to definitively resolve the issue before it. A \nMay 1 article by Robert Barnes in the Washington Post notes that the \nnumber of cases that the Justices have accepted has fallen, and the \nexperts in that article attribute this to the Court being down one \nmember. As one expert noted in the article, ``there seem to be a number \nof `defensive denials,' meaning neither side of the ideologically split \ncourt wants to take some cases because of uncertainty about how it will \nturn out, or whether the court will be able to reach a decision.''\n  Another harmful effect of this Republican obstruction is that the \nCourt has been contorting itself to avoid 4-4 splits by leaving the key \nquestions of cases undecided. Just yesterday, in two different cases, \nthe Court was unable to make a final decision on the merits. In both \ncases, the appellate courts are split on the law, and the Supreme Court \nwas unable to live up to its name. One of the cases, Zubik v. Burwell, \ninvolved religiously affiliated employers' objections to their \nemployees' health insurance coverage for contraception. The Court had \nalready taken the unusual step of ordering supplemental briefing in the \ncase, seemingly to avoid a 4-4 split. Even with the extra briefing, the \nCourt was still unable to make a decision. Instead, it sent the issue \nback to the lower courts expressing ``no view on the merits of the \ncases.'' In the second case, Spokeo v. Robbins, the question at issue \nwas Congress's ability to statutorily create rights that confer \nstanding for plaintiffs to sue when those rights are violated. The case \ninvolves important privacy questions about Americans' power to take \naction when incorrect information is posted about them online. The \nCourt, however, failed to reach the key question at issue. The effect \nis that the current split among the Circuit Courts of Appeals remains \nunresolved. As yesterday's New York Times editorial\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\nnotes, ``Every day that passes without a ninth justice undermines the \nSupreme Court's ability to function, and leaves millions of Americans \nwaiting for justice or clarity as major legal questions are \nunresolved.''\n  In addition to these contortions, the Court has deadlocked in at \nleast three instances on significant legal issues before it. These 4-4 \nsplits have real, practical consequences. As a recent Economist article \nnoted, ``By letting lower-court decisions stand but not requiring other \ncourts to abide by the ruling, the stage is set for odd state-by-state \nor district-by-district distinctions when it comes to the meaning of \nlaws or the constitution.'' I ask unanimous consent that all three \narticles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Republicans' refusal to do their jobs and consider Chief Judge \nGarland's nomination diminishes the role of the Supreme Court. In \nnominating Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court, President Obama \nhas picked an eminently qualified judge who has more Federal judicial \nexperience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. This is an \nindividual who has received praise across the political spectrum. But \ninstead of delving into his lengthy public service record for \nthemselves, Republicans have decided to outsource their jobs to outside \ninterest groups who have spent millions of dollars to smear Chief Judge \nGarland. And worse, they continue to refuse to allow Chief Judge \nGarland a chance to respond at a public hearing.\n  As long as they stick to this unprincipled position, Republicans will \ncontinue to undermine the Court's ability to serve its role under our \nConstitution as the final arbiter of our Nation's laws. Republicans \nshould reverse course and treat the Court as the independent and \ncoequal branch of government that it is.\n  So today, let us not only celebrate the Court's historic decision in \nBrown, but also resolve to return this venerated institution to full \nstrength. It begins with giving Chief Judge Garland a fair public \nhearing and a vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 1, 2016]\n\n  Scalia's Death Affecting Next Term, Too? Pace of Accepted Cases at \n                          Supreme Court Slows\n\n                           (By Robert Barnes)\n\n       The ways in which Justice Antonin Scalia's sudden death are \n     altering the current Supreme Court term have been widely \n     chronicled.\n       But it appears the absence of Scalia will be felt on the \n     court's work next term, as well.\n       The number of cases the justices have accepted has fallen, \n     meaning that a docket that in recent years has been smaller \n     than what is traditional is shrinking still.\n       The court has accepted only six cases since Scalia died \n     Feb. 13. The number is low compared with the average, \n     Scotusblog.com editor Amy Howe said at an event last week \n     reviewing the Supreme Court's work.\n       And none of the cases that the court has accepted for the \n     term that begins in October approach the level of controversy \n     that have marked the dramatic rulings of recent years.\n       A panel of court experts assembled by the Constitutional \n     Accountability Center last week offered a number of reasons \n     for the reduced workload.\n       But they boiled down to a reluctance of the ideologically \n     divided eight-member court to take on an issue in which it \n     might not be able to provide a clear answer.\n       First, a reminder of the enormous leeway the justices have \n     in setting their agenda.\n       An outraged citizen's vow to fight an injustice ``all the \n     way to the Supreme Court'' comes to pass only if the Supreme \n     Court consents.\n       With a few exceptions of cases the court is mandated to \n     consider, justices are unencumbered as they cull through the \n     thousands of petitions seeking review. In recent years, only \n     about 70 or so cases receive writs of certiorari--``cert \n     grants''--signaling that the justices will review the \n     decision of the lower court.\n       It takes the approval of four justices to schedule a case \n     for full briefing and oral argument. The court makes those \n     decisions all year--it could announce on Monday that it has \n     accepted more cases--but generally those granted after \n     January are placed on the court's docket for the term that \n     begins the following October.\n       So there is plenty of time for the court to pick up the \n     pace. But based on what's in the pipeline, Howe suggested \n     that there could be plenty of lulls in the court's schedule.\n       If Senate Republicans hold true to their pledge not to hold \n     hearings or a vote on President Obama's nomination of U.S. \n     Circuit Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat before \n     the election, the court will enter the next term one justice \n     down. And if a lame-duck Senate after the election does not \n     consider him, it would be sometime in the spring, at the \n     earliest, before the court is back to full strength.\n       John P. Elwood, a Washington lawyer and Supreme Court \n     specialist, said ``having an extra member matters.''\n       He watches the Supreme Court's docket as closely as anyone, \n     writing a column for Scotusblog about the cases the court \n     considers at its private conferences and which seem likely to \n     be granted.\n       He said there seem to be a number of ``defensive denials,'' \n     meaning neither side of the ideologically split court wants \n     to take some cases because of uncertainty about how it will \n     turn out, or whether the court will be able to reach a \n     decision.\n       ``The court already is a defensive enough institution,'' \n     Elwood said. He said that Justices Clarence Thomas and \n     Stephen G. Breyer have noted that the court is cautious about \n     granting cert in the best of times.\n       They ``have said essentially, `You can't screw up by not \n     taking a case, you can only screw up by taking a case,' '' \n     Elwood said. ``And now there's one more reason not to take a \n     case: that the court may blow up and not be able to decide \n     the thing.''\n       Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the \n     NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the apparent \n     slowdown is another consequence of waiting to fill Scalia's \n     seat.\n       It is a rebuttal to ``all of these sanguine statements that \n     we can have eight justices and it just doesn't matter, we'll \n     just kick the can down the road,'' she said.\n       Ifill often disagrees with the decisions of the \n     conservative court but said that everyone agrees ``this is a \n     branch of government that actually gets the job done.'' She \n     added: ``I think the court is trying to be prudent and not be \n     a participant in its own demise by not taking these cases it \n     can't decide.''\n       Brianne J. Gorod, the Constitutional Accountability \n     Center's chief counsel, said justices ``know that if the \n     issue is an important one it will probably come back in a \n     year or two, when hopefully there will be a ninth justice.''\n       Andrew J. Pincus, another Washington lawyer who practices \n     before the court, agreed with this analysis but said it is \n     the wrong approach for the court to take.\n       ``This sounds a little self-interested,'' Pincus began, but \n     he said the court has a ``wrongheaded view'' about the \n     frequency with which issues appear before it, and a \n     ``complete misperception of the real world impact of lower-\n     court decisions that are out there for a long time that \n     people in the real world have to comply with.''\n       But if it is easy to detect a slowdown in the court's \n     grants, it is more difficult to identify which cases the \n     court might have taken if at full strength.\n       The court makes those decisions in secret. No vote total is \n     announced and rarely is an explanation given.\n       So there can only be speculation about which cases are \n     skipped because the court is divided, or which the justices \n     agreed the lower court got it right and there is no work for \n     them to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 2016]\n\n                       The Crippled Supreme Court\n\n       Every day that passes without a ninth justice undermines \n     the Supreme Court's ability to function, and leaves millions \n     of Americans waiting for justice or clarity as major legal \n     questions are unresolved.\n       On Monday, the eight-member court avoided issuing a ruling \n     on one of this term's biggest cases, Zubik v.

In an unsigned opinion, the court sent \n     the lawsuits back to the lower federal courts, with \n     instructions to try to craft a compromise that would be \n     acceptable to everyone.\n       This is the second time since Justice Antonin Scalia's \n     death in February that the court has failed to reach a \n     decision in a high-profile case; in March, the court split 4 \n     to 4 in a labor case involving the longstanding right of \n     public-sector unions, which represent millions of American \n     workers, to charge collective bargaining fees to nonmembers.\n       The Zubik litigation, which involves seven separate cases, \n     was brought by religiously affiliated nonprofit employers \n     like hospitals, colleges and social service organizations \n     that do not want any role in giving their employees access to \n     contraception.\n       The Obama administration, mindful of concerns over \n     religious freedom, has already provided a way out for these \n     employers: They must notify their insurer or the government, \n     in writing, of their objection, at which point the government \n     takes over and provides coverage for the contraceptives at no \n     cost to the employers.\n       This sensible arrangement was not enough for several \n     plaintiffs who said it still violated their religious freedom \n     under a federal law, because the act of notification itself \n     made them complicit in the provision of birth control.\n       Eight federal courts of appeals have already rejected this \n     claim, finding that such a minor requirement did not place a \n     substantial burden on the objectors' religious freedom. In \n     her opinion for the Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit, Judge Cornelia Pillard wrote that under \n     both federal law and the Constitution, ``freedom of religious \n     exercise is protected but not absolute.'' This was the right \n     answer, and should\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n     have easily guided the justices in resolving this case.\n       But in a highly unusual order issued days after oral \n     arguments, the justices asked both sides to consider a \n     potential compromise--having a religiously affiliated \n     employer tell an insurer of its objection to birth control \n     coverage, and then having the insurer separately notify \n     employees that it will provide cost-free contraceptives, \n     without any involvement by the employer.\n       In Monday's opinion, the court said both sides' responses \n     indicated that a compromise was possible. Without weighing in \n     on the merits of the litigation, the court sent the lawsuits \n     back to the federal appeals courts and told them to give the \n     parties ``an opportunity to arrive at an approach going \n     forward that accommodates petitioners' religious exercise \n     while at the same time ensuring that women covered by \n     petitioners' health plans receive full and equal health \n     coverage, including contraceptive coverage.'' '\n       This move solves nothing. Even if these plaintiffs can find \n     their way to an agreement with the government that satisfies \n     their religious objections, there are other employers with \n     different religious beliefs who will not be satisfied, and \n     more lawsuits are sure to follow.\n       The court could have avoided this by affirming the \n     appellate decisions that correctly ruled in the government's \n     favor. Unfortunately, the justices appear to be evenly split \n     on this issue, as they may be on other significant cases \n     pending before them.\n       The court's job is not to propose complicated compromises \n     for individual litigants; it is to provide the final word in \n     interpreting the Constitution and the nation's laws. Despite \n     what Senate Republicans may say about the lack of harm in the \n     delay in filling the vacancy, the court cannot do its job \n     without a full bench.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Economist, May 9, 2016]\n\n                 Why the Supreme Court Is Slowing Down\n\n       With five votes, the late Justice William Brennan liked to \n     tell his clerks, ``you can do anything around here''. Justice \n     Brennan's rule still applies after the death in February of \n     Antonin Scalia. But with only eight justices remaining, the \n     magic number of five is now harder to come by. Twice since \n     Mr. Scalia's death the Supreme Court has performed the \n     judicial equivalent of throwing up its hands. In a small case \n     concerning banking rules and in a hugely consequential case \n     challenging the future of public-sector unions, the justices \n     issued one-sentence per curiam (``by the court'') rulings: \n     ``The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.'' A \n     tie in the high court means that the ruling in the court \n     below stands. But a tie-induced affirmance does not bind \n     other lower courts, and the judgment has no value as a \n     precedent. A tie, in short, leaves everything as it was and \n     as it would have been had the justices never agreed to hear \n     the case in the first place.\n       That's a lot of wasted ink, paper, time and breath. And now \n     it seems the justices may be keen to reduce future futile \n     efforts as they contemplate a year or more with a missing \n     colleague. As Robert Barnes wrote in the Washington Post last \n     week, the Supreme Court's pace of ``grants''--cases it agrees \n     to take up--has slowed. Only 12 cases are now on the docket \n     for the October 2016 term that begins in the fall, and grants \n     are lagging below the average of recent years. The slow pace \n     is especially notable because it marks a slowdown from an \n     already highly attenuated docket. Seventy years ago, the \n     justices decided 200 or more cases a year; that number \n     declined to about 150 in the 1980s and then plummeted into \n     the 80s and, in recent years, the 70s. The justices will \n     grant more cases in dribs and drabs following their private \n     conferences in May and June and after the so-called ``long-\n     conference'' in September (followed by more conferences \n     throughout the autumn and winter), but early indications are \n     that the term starting in October may be one of the most \n     relaxed in recent memory.\n       The Obama administration continues to push Senate \n     Republicans to change their minds and hold confirmation \n     hearings for Merrick Garland, chief judge of the District of \n     Columbia circuit court. While a number of GOP senators have \n     agreed to meet Mr. Garland for lunch or tea, none have \n     endorsed him or said he should have a hearing. The fight to \n     fill Mr. Scalia's seat before the next president takes office \n     includes a new hashtag (#WeNeedNine) and a counter showing \n     the number of ``days of obstruction'' in the Senate since Mr. \n     Obama tapped Mr. Garland for the job. (That number is 51 and \n     counting.) But the Republican leadership isn't budging. \n     Charles Grassley, chair of the judiciary committee, admits \n     that leaving the appointment to the next president is a \n     ``gamble'' given that Donald Trump is now all-but certain to \n     be the Republican nominee, but he is sticking to his guns.\n       What's wrong with eight justices? The primary worry is that \n     tie votes will sow legal confusion and uncertainty. When \n     justices are split down the middle, they cannot resolve rival \n     views on crucial national issues--from affirmative action and \n     public unions to gay rights, birth control and abortion. By \n     letting lower-court decisions stand but not requiring other \n     courts to abide by the ruling, the stage is set for odd \n     state-by-state or district-by-district distinctions when it \n     comes to the meaning of laws or the constitution. This seems \n     to be the worry that prompted the justices to search for a \n     compromise after hearing arguments in March in the latest \n     fight over Obamacare and contraception. One federal district \n     court has said that the contraceptive mandate violates a 1993 \n     law banning the government from unduly interfering with other \n     people's religious scruples. A half dozen other appellate \n     courts have come to the opposite opinion. So if the justices \n     divide 4-4 in Zubik v Burwell, women across most of America \n     will have access to birth control through their employer's \n     health coverage, while women in seven midwestern states will \n     not. The justices' unprecedented effort to square the circle \n     by playing mediator does not look promising.\n       Some legal scholars argue that an eight-justice bench isn't \n     so bad after all and might actually be preferable. Eric \n     Segall, a professor of law at Georgia State University, \n     thinks the 4-4 ideological divide is pushing justices to \n     moderate their claims in an effort to win votes from their \n     colleagues on the other side. ``[T]o accomplish their \n     goals'', Mr. Segall writes, ``the Justices would simply have \n     to get along better''. This is a prescription, he says, to \n     ``more public confidence in the final outcomes'' of Supreme \n     Court decisions. We may have seen just such a compromise at \n     work in a recent voting-rights decision, Evenwel v Abbott. \n     After the oral argument in December, most pundits (including \n     your correspondent) were expecting a 5-4 decision upending \n     the common understanding of ``one person, one vote'' \n     (counting everybody) in favour of counting only eligible \n     voters, a scheme favouring whiter, wealthier, GOP-leaning \n     districts. But the justices came out 8-0 in the other \n     direction. The four liberals seem to have attracted the \n     conservatives' votes (though Justices Samuel Alito and \n     Clarence Thomas disagreed with the reasoning) by lowering the \n     temperature a bit: the constitution permits states to use \n     total population as the basis for drawing districts, Justice \n     Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for her colleagues, but the \n     question of whether it requires them to do so is off the \n     table until a case forces it back on.\n       But beyond the Evenwel surprise and the seemingly ill-fated \n     attempt to resolve the dicey dilemma in Zubik, it's very hard \n     to see how a denuded court is an appealing concept in the \n     medium or long-term. A patchwork quilt of legal realities may \n     have been fitting for America under the Articles of \n     Confederation, before the country had a political system that \n     made it something approximating a union, but America's \n     constitutional design is not consonant with deep confusion \n     about what the law means on controversial questions of public \n     life. While the bind they're in may lead to occasional \n     compromises, the justices will only bend so far. Whether the \n     divide manifests as 4-4 splits or a tendency to hear fewer \n     cases in which those splits seem likely, a curbed Supreme \n     Court is not a court that can possibly live up to its name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2870-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the week of May 15 \nthrough 21, 2016, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week.\n  As each Louisianian knows, the beginning of June marks the beginning \nof hurricane season, and we are acutely aware of how dangerous and \ndamaging these storms can be. As we recognize National Hurricane \nPreparedness Week, I want to emphasize the importance of making \nadequate preparations to keep our families and communities safe. While \nit is impossible to predict when a disaster will strike, being \ninformed, prepared, and having a plan can make all the difference in \nthe world.\n  The National Hurricane Center recommends that folks take specific \nsteps to prepare, such as creating a plan for your family, buying \nproper supplies\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\nahead of time, locating a safe room or the safest areas in your home \nfor each hurricane hazard, making a plan for your pets, and taking \nFirst Aid, CPR, or disaster preparedness classes.\n  On a Federal level, I have been working to implement precautionary \nmeasures. As chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nSubcommittee, I worked with my Republican and Democrat colleagues on \nthe critically important Water Resources Development Act of 2016, which \nrecently passed through the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. This bill would advance numerous hurricane protection efforts \nthat will make our communities safer and better prepared for such \ndisasters, most notably through the support it provides to coastal \nrestoration efforts in Louisiana. Passing WRDA 2016 is an absolute top \npriority, and I will continue working to bring it to the Senate floor \nfor a vote in the near future.\n  Regarding long-term preparedness, I am proud to announce that my \nbipartisan bill to reauthorize the National Estuary Program is on its \nway to the President's desk to be signed into law. Louisiana's \nestuaries create a natural buffer zone and have protected thousands of \nsquare miles of land along the coast, including some of the Nation's \nbusiest ports, high-yielding fisheries, and vast oil and mineral \ndeposits. My bill will make sure our critical estuaries are restored \nand preserved so that our coastal communities are better protected \nahead of future storms.\n  Hurricanes are part of life, especially in Louisiana, but diligence \nand preparation can help reduce their impact on your family, home, and \nbusiness. I urge you to take hurricane watches and warnings seriously. \nPlease plan ahead for your family's safety, and encourage your \nneighbors to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2872-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SELMER LELAND\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Selmer T. Leland, a \ndecorated World War I veteran and longtime resident of Kalispell, MT.\n  Unfortunately Selmer is no longer with us, so I will be presenting \nhis son, Orland Leland, with the medals he earned for his heroic \nservice during World War I.\n  Orland, on behalf of myself, my fellow Montanans, and my fellow \nAmericans, I would like to acknowledge your father's remarkable \nsacrifice and service to this Nation and thank you for your unwavering \ncommitment to keeping his legacy alive.\n  Selmer was born on April 30, 1894, in Abercrombie, ND, to Isak and \nSanna Leland.\n  He grew up alongside his seven siblings on their family farm in North \nDakota. When Selmer was 8, the family moved to Canada.\n  Later, when he grew old enough, Selmer ventured out on his own to \nMontana, becoming a farmer in Big Sandy, before enlisting in the army \nat the age of 23.\n  It was in October of 1917 when Selmer joined the American \nExpeditionary Forces in France as a private of Company G, 2nd \nBattalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Division.\n  Selmer was shipped off, and by May of 1918, he had earned his first \nPurple Heart, after enduring an onslaught of mustard gas in weeks \nleading up to the Battle of Cantigny.\n  The attack cost him a lung and resulted in lifelong respiratory \nissues.\n  Just 10 weeks later, Selmer took a bullet to the shoulder in the \nSecond Battle of Marne, earning him a bronze oakleaf cluster to adorn \nhis Purple Heart.\n  He also sustained shrapnel wounds to his chest and, as his son Orland \nproudly tells it, he died, more than 60 years later, with that bullet \nstill in his arm.\n  Despite these two devastating injuries, Selmer persevered, spending \nanother year overseas, even after the war had ended, as a member of the \nAmerican occupation forces in Germany.\n  When he finally returned to the States, in September of 1919, his \ncompany was invited to Washington, DC, to meet President Woodrow \nWilson, so he could thank them personally for their service.\n  Eventually, Selmer moved back to his family's homestead in Canada to \nfarm again. This is where he met the love of his life, Clara.\n  Clara was a Kalispell girl, born and raised, who was visiting family \nup in Canada when she met Selmer.\n  The two fell in love, and, in February of 1924, they returned to \nKalispell to get married.\n  By December, they had their first son, Robert Leland, who followed in \nhis father's footsteps by joining the Army during WWII and fighting in \nthe Battle of the Bulge.\n  Robert eventually had five kids: Marvin, Melvin, Shirley, Mark, and \nRobert, Jr., who went on to serve in Vietnam.\n  Both Robert and Robert, Jr., have since passed on, but their \ngenerations of service won't soon be forgotten.\n  After spending some time in the Pacific Northwest, the family \neventually settled down in Kalispell, where Selmer spent his career as \na sawmill worker until retiring at the age of 65, but his work was far \nfrom done.\n  After retiring from the sawmill, Selmer became a logger, heading to \nwork every day in the forests well into his seventies.\n  Twenty years after the birth of their first son, Clara and Selmer, \nnow 50, welcomed their second son, Orland, who I have the distinct \npleasure of being with today.\n  Both Orland and his wife, Janet, were born and raised in Kalispell \nand still reside here today.\n  Orland, who was a firefighter for 30 years, and Janet, who is the \nvolunteer director at the Kalispell Regional Medical Center, have both \ncontinued this family's legacy of dedicated public service.\n  They also have five children--Dianna, Kevin, Tammy, Sam, and Curt--\nsome of whom are here with us today.\n  Thank you all for being here to celebrate Selmer's life, legacy, and \nhistory.\n  I have the profound honor of presenting Selmer's son Orland Leland \nwith his father's WWI medals: Purple Heart with one bronze oakleaf \ncluster; World War I Victory Medal with Montdidier Noyon, Aisne-Marne, \nSt. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Battle Clasps and France Service Clasp; \nand World War I Victory Button--Silver.\n  Orland, these medals serve as a small token of our country's \nappreciation for your father's heroic service and profound sacrifice.\n  He is truly an American hero, and we have the utmost gratitude for \nhis service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2873-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2873-S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING FRED DE ROCHE\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

In fact, Fred had enlisted in the Army earlier \nthat year, alongside his cousin, Billy Wolftail.\n  In the ultimate act of patriotism, Fred deployed before his son, Art, \nwas born on February 11, 1943.\n  Fred was sent to Belgium, where he served as a private in the \nHeadquarters Company's 39th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division.\n  It was there that Fred earned his Bronze Star Medal on October 15, \n1944, for meritorious achievement in active ground combat.\n  A little more than 2 months later, on December 21, 1944, Fred fought \nhis last battle in courageous service to this great Nation.\n  He was awarded a Purple Heart for his valor and bravery.\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\n  On Memorial Day 2015, the Blackfeet Nation was honored at the Montana \nVeterans Memorial in Great Falls.\n  I was proud to be the main speaker at that event, where 162 tiles \nwere added to the walls of the memorial, in recognition of military \nveterans from the Blackfeet Nation.

Mr. President, Hawaii's traditional Polynesian voyaging \ncanoe Hokulea and her crew are in the Washington, DC, area this week as \npart of its Malama Honua Worldwide Voyage. I would like to congratulate \nand honor the Polynesian Voyaging Society for its work in bringing \nabout this significant endeavor to raise awareness of global \nsustainability while sharing traditional Polynesian navigation \npractices and creating global relationships through cultural exchanges. \nHokulea will voyage over 60,000 miles to 100 ports in 27 nations, \nincluding 12 Marine World Heritage sites identified by the United \nNations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.\n  Established in 1973, the Polynesian Voyaging Society developed a new \ngeneration of Polynesian navigators, perpetuating the teachings of \nMaster Navigator Mau Piailug from the island of Satawal in the \nFederated States of Micronesia. The Polynesian Voyaging Society is \nlargely credited with revolutionizing the perception of Polynesian-\nstyle voyaging as a sophisticated form of sailing and navigation.\n  In 1976, the Polynesian Voyaging Society completed construction of \nthe double-hulled voyaging canoe named Hokulea, which translates to \n``star of gladness.'' Hokulea is the first traditional voyaging canoe \nto be built in Hawaii in over 600 years and has since served as a \ncultural ambassador of Hawaii to the world.\n  Crew members observed patterns in the stars, sun, moon, wind, and \nocean swells to guide Hokulea to Tahiti on her inaugural journey. The \nvoyage demonstrated that Polynesian wayfinding methods could \nsuccessfully be used to travel on long-distance journeys and revived a \nnavigational method many assumed was lost.\n  In 2013, Hokulea and her sister canoe Hikianalia embarked on a \njourney around the State of Hawaii before commencing a 36-month \nworldwide voyage named Malama Honua, which means ``to care for our \nEarth.''\n  Since the journey began, Hokulea has visited 24 islands and six \ncountries across Polynesia, Mauritius, South Africa, Brazil, and the \nEast Coast of the United States, visiting States Florida, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New York, and Washington, DC.\n  I extend my deepest congratulations to the Polynesian Voyaging \nSociety and the crews of Hokulea and Hikianalia and wish them smooth \nsailing as they continue the Malama Honua Worldwide Voyage.\n  I look forward to hearing of their many adventures upon completion of \nthe voyage, and I encourage all of my colleagues to visit Hokulea while \nshe is docked in Washington, DC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2874-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2874-S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL PAUL J. TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to COL Paul J. Taylor \nfor his inspiring and honorable dedication to the U.S. Army and service \nto our Nation. Paul spent a year on Capitol Hill as an Army \nCongressional Fellow in the U.S. Senate where he learned valuable \nskills that prepared him for his service the last 3 years as a \nCongressional Budget Liaison for the Secretary of the Army. In this \ncapacity, I have found Paul to be a critical resource and trusted \nconfidant on all matters related to supporting our Army.\n  Colonel Taylor was nominated to attend the U.S. Military Academy from \nhis home State of Connecticut and was commissioned an armor officer in \n1993.\n  Colonel Taylor has served in a broad range of armor and cavalry \nassignments during his 23 years of service. As a junior officer, he \nserved as a tank platoon leader, executive officer, and battalion \nmaintenance officer in the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, in my \nown State of Kansas. During his time with the Big Red One, he met the \nformer Amy S. Boydston, from Centerville, KS. The two were married at \nFort Riley and have experienced more than 20 years of Army life \ntogether, along with their three daughters: Lauren, Abigail, and Ella \nKate.\n  Following his time at Fort Riley, Colonel Taylor attended advanced \ntraining at Fort Knox, KY, and stayed to command two armor companies in \nthe 1st Armored Training Brigade. Upon completion of command, Colonel \nTaylor was stationed in Doha, Qatar, as the operations officer \nresponsible for one of the Army's forward positioned headquarters in \nthe Middle East.\n  After returning from Qatar, Colonel Taylor was assigned to the \nNational Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA, the Army's premier training \ncenter, where he helped train units for deployment for 4 years. Colonel \nTaylor was next assigned to Fort Hood, TX, where he served as a brigade \nand battalion operations officer and executive officer in 4th Infantry \nDivision, including a deployment to Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.\n  Following his assignment at Fort Hood, Colonel Taylor was selected \nthrough a highly competitive process to serve as an Army Congressional \nFellow on the personal staff of my colleague Senator John Cornyn of \nTexas. Following his fellowship, he was assigned to the Army's Office \nof the Chief of Legislative Liaison, where he served for 2 years as the \nArmy's primary liaison for personnel issues to the U.S. Congress and \nthe Armed Services Committees.\n  During this assignment, Colonel Taylor was selected for command of \n1st Squadron, 32d Cavalry, in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort \nCampbell, KY. Following command, he returned to the Pentagon, where he \nserved for 3 years as a congressional budget liaison officer in the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management \nand Comptroller. He expertly managed the Army's procurement and \nresearch, development, test, and evaluation portfolios, liaising with \nthe House and Senate Appropriations Committees to provide critical \nresources for Army warfighters. His most recent assignment was the \noffice's senior budget liaison, providing day-to-day leadership to 15 \nother budget liaisons who greatly benefited from his guidance and \nmentorship.\n  Over the last several years, Colonel Taylor has developed a close \nworking relationship with my office. As much as his Kansas ties mean to \nme and my staff, equally valued is Paul's strength of character and \nhumble approach in serving others. He represents the best in our Army, \nand he will always be welcome in my office and as part of our Kansas \ncommunity. I wish Paul, his wife Amy, and his daughters Lauren, \nAbigail, and Ella Kate the very best as they transition from Army life \nand move home to Kansas.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in \nrecognizing and commending COL Paul Taylor for more than 23 years of \nservice to his country. Paul's leadership throughout his career has \npositively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors. We wish Paul, \nhis wife Amy, and their children all the best as they continue their \njourney of service.\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2874-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         SAMSUNG SOLVE FOR TOMORROW STEM EDUCATION COMPETITION\n\n Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a \ngroup of eighth-grade students at Horizon Middle School in Aurora, CO. \nRecently I met with Simon-Peter Frimpong and Grayson Fast who \nparticipated in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow STEM Education \nCompetition. Grayson, Simon-Peter, and their classmates were among just \nfive grand prize winners out of more than 4,000 contestants nationwide. \nThis competition brings together schools from across the country to \nencourage the use of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, \nSTEM, to solve complicated problems. As a national winner of this \ncompetition, Horizon Middle School will receive funds to purchase \ncutting-edge technology for their school.\n  To win this competition, the students at Horizon Middle School \ncreated a more comfortable and versatile prosthetic limb for a local \nveteran. Along with providing more comfortable everyday use, the \nstudents designed multiple attachments, including an attachment for a \nlongboard, to allow him to participate in various activities. This \nproject required enormous amounts of time and dedication, as well as an \nin-depth study of STEM disciplines. Along this journey, the students \nhad the unending support of their teacher Melinda Possehl and the \nschool's principal, Nichole Bell.\n  Congratulations again to the students of Horizon Middle School on \nyour outstanding accomplishment. I look forward to what the future has \nin store for these tremendously bright students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2875-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALWAYS FREE HONOR FLIGHT\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, with immense pride, I wish to \nrecognize the 25 heroic veterans who have traveled to Washington from \nWest Virginia on this year's Always Free Honor Flight this week. This \ntruly moving event serves as a unique opportunity for us to honor and \nshare our deepest gratitude for these individuals who have sacrificed \nso much in the service of our great Nation.\n  With one of our country's highest per capita rates of military \nservicemembers and veterans, West Virginia is undoubtedly one of our \nNation's most patriotic States. Throughout the history of the Mountain \nState, our citizens have demonstrated the bravery and selflessness time \nand again in making tremendous sacrifices to keep our homeland safe and \nfree. According to the Department of Defense, West Virginia had the \nhighest casualty rate in the Nation during the Vietnam war, and I am so \nproud that the honor flight will allow these West Virginia veterans to \npay homage to their brethren at the Vietnam wall. As these veterans \ntour the monuments that have been constructed in their honor, I offer \nmy sincerest thanks to them on behalf of our Nation for their service.\n  The veterans joining us in Washington hail from across West Virginia, \nfrom Scott Depot and Princeton to Rainelle and Lewisburg. They have \nserved in World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, during the \nCold War prior to the Berlin Wall's collapse, and the wars in the \nMiddle East. They have participated in decisive overseas battles and \nwon myriad accolades for their accomplishments in uniform.\n  First and foremost, I wish to remember PO3 Earnest McKenzie, an \nAthens, WV, native, who joined the U.S. Navy in 1955 and served on the \nUSS Brownson in the Vietnam war. He was supposed to attend this week's \nhonor flight to visit the memorials made in his honor, but he sadly \npassed away on Friday at the age of 75. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith his family during this sad time, and I sincerely thank him for his \nservice and sacrifice.\n  I especially wish to recognize our World War II veterans who will be \non this honor flight. Ninety-four year old former SN William ``Ray'' \nCalvin Sexton from Tazewell, joined the Navy in Bramwell, WV, in 1943 \nand was a gunner stationed in Panama and the Galapagos Islands. We will \nalso be joined by Machinist Mate Third Class Marion Grey Noel, who \njoined the Navy in the 1940s and bravely fought at the battle of Iwo \nJima and Okinawa.\n  These men truly represent the sacrifices made by our Nation's \n``greatest generation'' and embody American patriotism and valor. They \nfearlessly fought in such a pivotal war in an era that threatened our \nexistence as a nation. We are losing so many of our World War II \nveterans every day, and the time to show our utmost gratitude to them \nis here and now.\n  I also wish to highlight the tremendous achievements of two Vietnam \nwar veterans who will be on this honor flight. Mabscott, WV, native, \nformer SPC Raymond C. Palmer joined the Army in 1967 and fought in the \n1968 Tet Offensive when the Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces \nlaunched a series of attacks on scores of towns and cities through \nSouth Vietnam. Another Vietnam veteran participating in this week's \nhonor flight is SSG Michael A. Hudnall of Rainelle, WV, who joined the \nArmy in 1969. Staff Sergeant Hudnall served in the 1st Air Cavalry \nstationed in Bien Hoa and earned two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars, \nand two Air Medals. Their dedication to our Nation knows no bounds, and \nI thank them for their service.\n  I also wish to recognize Army SFC Paul W. Dorsey of Bluefield, WV, \nwho joined the Army in 1978. Sergeant First Class Dorsey served the \nUnited States for 10 years in Germany, more than 3 of which he was \nstationed in Berlin prior to the Wall's collapse. Following his return \nhome, Sergeant First Class Dorsey went on to serve an additional decade \nstateside and continues to give back to his community. He is a JROTC \ninstructor at Montcalm High School in Mercer City and serves as vice \npresident of the Always Free Honor Flight network. Thank you, Sergeant \nFirst Class Dorsey, for your lifelong commitment to the U.S. military \nand our veterans.\n  The veterans participating in this week's honor flight range in age \nfrom 54 to 94 and have fought for our freedom in many historic events. \nThis week, as we celebrate these incredible veterans and their \nanswering our Nation's call of duty, we must remember that the men and \nwomen who have given so much to ensure America's safety deserve the \nutmost care and support upon their return home.\n  We must continue to fight for a Department of Veterans Affairs that \nprovides our veterans with the services they very much need and \ndeserve.\n  This week's honor flight and the continued support of our veterans \nwould not be possible without the dedication of so many volunteers and \ncaregivers. I wish to thank the JROTC cadets from Princeton, Montcalm, \nBluefield, and Pikeview high schools, as well as the military spouses \nserving as the guardians on this year's honor flight. The care and love \nyou provide for our veterans is invaluable and deeply appreciated.\n  I also commend those in the Always Free Honor Flight network for \ntheir dedication to providing our veterans with such a unique and \nmeaningful experience. My gratitude especially goes out to Dreama \nDenver, president of Always Free Honor Flight network and owner Little \nBuddy Radio of Princeton, WV, as well as Pam Coulbourne, the \ncoordinator of these flights. Dreama and Pam launched the Always Free \nHonor Flight in 2012 and have been making the dreams of West Virginia's \nveterans a reality every year since. They, along with Sergeant First \nClass Dorsey and board member and official photographer Steve Coleman, \nhave done a tremendous job of ensuring that our veterans receive the \nrecognition they deserve. Dreama, Pam, and Steve have also dedicated \nthemselves to the Denver Foundation, serving as incredible examples of \nhow individuals can give back to their communities.\n  Our Nation would not enjoy the freedom and liberty we do today \nwithout the commitment and sacrifice of the veterans who have served \nthroughout our history. Their bravery and sacrifice know no bounds, and \nfor this, we are forever grateful. With this week's Always Free Honor \nFlight, we celebrate and give thanks for these veterans and all they \nhave done for our country.\n  God bless our many servicemembers and veterans, the great State of \nWest Virginia, and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2875-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2875-S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TAD FELTS\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in a rural State like my own, where \nmany\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nKansans live more than half an hour from the nearest neighboring town, \ncommunities are stitched together by what they hear on the radio.\n  For more than 40 years, Tad Felts has been broadcasting high school \nathletics and reporting north central Kansas news for KKAN-KQMA radio \nin Phillipsburg, but after several decades chronicling hundreds--or \nmore likely thousands--of sporting events, Tad decided a couple years \nback it was time to watch a few more games from the bleachers rather \nthan the press box. Now, this month, he will retire from radio \naltogether.\n  Tad first started his radio career in Garden City at KIUL as a high \nschool sophomore in 1948, working after school and at night for free. \nDuring his time at KIUL, his main duties were cleaning the floors and \nplaying records. While he was a student at Fort Hays State University \nin 1951, Tad worked at KAYS radio station in Hays and upon graduation \nat KLOE in Goodland. Tad found his eventual home with the team at KKAN-\nKQMA in Phillipsburg in 1972.\n  Given his decades of experience in broadcasting, Tad knows the \nbusiness well and takes great joy in teaching others. Gerard Wellbrock, \nthe sports director of KAYS radio in Hays and the voice of the Fort \nHays State University Tigers said this about Tad: ``He was a good \nmentor, I learned so much from him. The work ethic, how to deal with \npeople, the relations you build with athletic directors and coaches. \nIt's hard not to like Tad. And you learned a lot about work, and life, \njust by being around him.''\n  In gyms across north central Kansas, the KKAN-KQMA banner can be seen \nat high school basketball games, wrestling tournaments, and State \nchampionships. In fact, it is because of Tad's dedication that the \nradio station is so often present. Families who can't make the game in \nperson, often because they are working long hours on the farm, \nespecially appreciate local radio hosts being there because they can \nstill catch the details of the game.\n  In rural America, entire communities revolve around how the high \nschool sports team is doing. It is a common topic of conversation while \nstanding in the checkout line at the grocery store or while dining at a \nneighborhood restaurant.\n  By no means is Tad a one-trick pony, though. Cherished equal to his \nsports reporting are his updates from the field during wheat harvest \nseason, in which Tad will drive straight up to a farmer in his combine \nand record an interview from the cab. This is in addition to the full \nslate of city council and school board meetings, county fairs, and \nannual parades.\n  For years, Tad's knowledge and sunny disposition has greeted folks \ntuning in to local radio. One former peer of Tad's said this about the \nsignificant impact he has made: ``KKAN-KQMA Radio has played an \nintegral role in the lives of people in the Phillipsburg area, and Tad \nhas always been a driving force behind that station's programming and \nits scope of community service.''\n  His professionalism was recognized by his peers when Tad was inducted \ninto the Kansas Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2010. \nInductees to the hall of fame are selected based upon their \ncontributions to the broadcasting profession, their broadcast career, \nand their recognition and awards received, and Tad is an extremely \ndeserving recipient.\n  Today I want to express my gratitude to Tad Felts for helping to \nstrengthen the close bonds of rural communities through his years of \nfaithful service. I want to congratulate him on a job well done for the \npast nearly six decades. Tad's been a tremendous friend to me over the \nyears, and his work has served as a bedrock for many of the communities \nI grew up in and care deeply about.\n  Tad, I wish you all the best and thank you for everything you have \ndone to improve the lives of so many in our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2875-3"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2876-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997, WITH \n                        RESPECT TO BURMA--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to Burma that was \ndeclared on May 20, 1997, is to continue in effect beyond May 20, 2016.\n  The Government of Burma has made significant progress across a number \nof important areas since 2011, including the release of over 1,300 \npolitical prisoners, a peaceful and competitive election, the signing \nof a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with eight ethnic armed groups, the \ndischarge of hundreds of child soldiers from the military, steps to \nimprove labor standards, and expanding political space for civil \nsociety to have a greater voice in shaping issues critical to Burma's \nfuture. In addition, Burma has become a signatory of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol and ratified the Biological \nWeapons Convention, significant steps towards supporting global non-\nproliferation. Despite these strides, the situation in the country \ncontinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States.\n  Concerns persist regarding continued obstacles to full civilian \ncontrol of the government, the ongoing conflict and human rights abuses \nin the country, particularly in ethnic minority areas, and military \ntrade with North Korea. In addition, Burma's security forces, operating \nwith little oversight from the civilian government, often act with \nimpunity. We are further concerned that prisoners remain detained and \nthat police continue to arrest critics of the government for peacefully \nexpressing their views. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma.\n  Despite this action, the United States remains committed to working \nwith both the new government and the people of Burma to ensure that the \ndemocratic transition is irreversible.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 17, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2876-2"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2876-S2877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1492.

Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n     leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, provides the proper legal framework for how \n     such liability should function in the context of chapter 113B \n     of title 18, United States Code.\n       (6) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n     recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n     or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n     significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \n     threaten the security of nationals of the United States or \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States, necessarily direct their conduct at the United \n     States, and should reasonably anticipate being brought to \n     court in the United States to answer for such activities.\n       (7) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n     persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n     committed within the United States with full access to the \n     court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, \n     entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly \n     provided material support or resources, directly or \n     indirectly, to the persons or organizations responsible for \n     their injuries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil \n     litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with \n     the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against \n     persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and \n     wherever they may be found, that have provided material \n     support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or \n     persons that engage in terrorist activities against the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

If the violations \n     remain, the Secretary shall develop a Compliance, Disposition \n     and Enforcement Plan within 60 days and must provide the \n     owner with a Notice of Default with a specified timetable, \n     determined by the Secretary, for correcting all deficiencies. \n     The Secretary must also provide a copy of the Notice of \n     Default to the tenants, the local government, any mortgagees, \n     and any contract administrator. If the owner's appeal results \n     in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Secretary may withdraw \n     the Notice of Default.\n       (2) At the end of the time period for correcting all \n     deficiencies specified in the Notice of Default, if the owner \n     fails to fully correct such deficiencies, the Secretary may--\n       (A) require immediate replacement of project management \n     with a management agent approved by the Secretary;\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n       (B) impose civil money penalties, which shall be used \n     solely for the purpose of supporting safe and sanitary \n     conditions at applicable properties, as designated by the \n     Secretary, with priority given to the tenants of the property \n     affected by the penalty;\n       (C) abate the section 8 contract, including partial \n     abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all \n     deficiencies have been corrected;\n       (D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, approved by \n     the Secretary under established procedures, which will be \n     obligated to promptly make all required repairs and to accept \n     renewal of the assistance contract as long as such renewal is \n     offered;\n       (E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to another \n     project or projects and owner or owners;\n       (F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including suspensions or \n     debarments from Federal programs;\n       (G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to manage the \n     property and cure all project deficiencies or seek a judicial \n     order of specific performance requiring the owner to cure all \n     project deficiencies;\n       (H) work with the owner, lender, or other related party to \n     stabilize the property in an attempt to preserve the property \n     through compliance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of \n     capital provided by a third-party that requires time to \n     effectuate; or\n       (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies \n     available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to \n     ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject \n     to the exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist \n     relocation of tenants for major threats to health and safety \n     after written notice to and informed consent of the affected \n     tenants and use of other remedies set forth above. To the \n     extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with the \n     tenants and the local government, that the property is not \n     feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such \n     section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of (1) \n     the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and \n     all available Federal, State, and local resources, including \n     rent adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily \n     Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 \n     (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be \n     remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in \n     consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for \n     project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or \n     owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other \n     rental assistance.\n       (e) The Secretary shall report quarterly on all properties \n     covered by this section that are assessed through the Real \n     Estate Assessment Center and have UPCS physical inspection \n     scores of less than 60 or have received an unsatisfactory \n     management and occupancy review within the past 36 months. \n     The report shall include--\n       (1) the enforcement actions being taken to address such \n     conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and \n     termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have \n     such conditions multiple times;\n       (2) actions that the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified \n     properties; and\n       (3) any administrative or legislative recommendations to \n     further improve the living conditions at properties covered \n     under a housing assistance payment contract.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2882-1"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman for giving me \nthis time at the end of the day and congratulate her on the progress \nthat has been made with my senior Senator, Jack Reed, on this bill.\n  This is the 137th time that I have addressed this body, asking us to \nwake up to the threat of climate change. While we sleepwalk, our \natmosphere and oceans continue to suffer the damage caused by carbon \npollution. As we do nothing, more and more Americans demand action. \nLook at the new findings from Yale and George Mason Universities. \nDespite years of industry climate denial propaganda, 75 percent of all \nregistered voters--88 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of Independents, \nand 61 percent of Republicans--support regulating carbon dioxide as a \npollutant; 74 percent of registered voters--88 percent of Democrats, 74 \npercent of Independents, and 56 percent of Republicans--say \ncorporations and industry should do more to address global warming, and \n68 percent of all registered voters--86 percent of Democrats, 66 \npercent of Independents, and 47 percent even of Republicans--believe \nfossil fuel companies should be required to pay a carbon tax and the \nmoney should be used to reduce other taxes, such as income taxes, by an \nequal amount.\n  So why does this Chamber sit idly by and not even have that \nconversation? Take the fossil fuel industry. For years Big Oil and its \nallies funded outright denial of man-made climate change. Now they have \nshifted strategies, from denial to dissembling--saying one thing but \ndoing another.\n  Take ExxonMobil. In 2007, the oil giant committed to stop funding the \nfront groups that promote science denial. Here is what they said: ``In \n2008, we will discontinue contributions to several public policy \nresearch groups whose positions on climate change could divert \nattention from the important discussion on how the world will secure \nthe energy required for economic growth in an environmentally \nresponsible manner.''\n  This sounds like a step toward responsible corporate behavior. A \ncasual reader might believe that ExxonMobil would in fact stop funding \ngroups with anti-scientific climate positions. One might think that, \nbut one would be wrong.\n  According to publicly available company documents, in 2014, \nExxonMobil funded several organizations that promote climate science \ndisinformation, including the American Legislative Exchange Council, \nwhich peddled legislation to State legislatures that include a finding \nthat human-induced global warming ``may lead to . . . possibly \nbeneficial climactic changes''; the Hoover Institution, whose senior \nfellow is not a climate scientist, argued that climate data since 1880 \nsupports a conclusion that it would take as long as long as 500 years \nto reach 4 degrees centigrade of global warming; the Manhattan \nInstitute of Policy Research, where a senior fellow writing about \nclimate change said: ``The science is not settled, not by a long shot. \n. . . Furthermore, even if we accept that carbon dioxide is bad, it's \nnot clear exactly what we should do about it''; the so-called National \nBlack Chamber of Commerce, whose President and CEO, Harry Alford, \nplayed the debunked denier card, that ``there has been no global \nwarming detected for the last 18 years. That is over 216 months in a \nrow that there has been no detected global warming.'' By the way, NASA \njust reported that April was the hottest April ever recorded, just like \nevery one of the past 7 months was the hottest ever recorded for that \nmonth. Let's not forget our friends at the Pacific Legal Foundation, \nwhose senior attorney attacked EPA's authority to even regulate \nCO2, in part, because it is a ``ubiquitous natural substance \nessential to life on Earth.''\n  Saying one thing and doing another--ExxonMobil is publicly saying it \nis separated from the climate denial outfits, but it is still \nsubsidizing their work to undermine public understanding of climate \nchange. This doesn't even count whatever they may be doing behind the \ndark money curtain that wretched Citizens United decision gave them.\n  The hypocrisy turns even worse in fossil fuel industry lobbying. An \nExxonMobil executive recently stated: ``When governments are \nconsidering policy options, ExxonMobil believes a revenue-neutral \ncarbon tax is the most effective way to manage carbon emissions.''\n  I have a revenue-neutral carbon tax bill, along with Senator Schatz, \nand I can assure this body that ExxonMobil is not lobbying in support \nof it. Every Member of Congress knows that all the massive political \ninfrastructure of the fossil fuel industry is adamantly opposed to any \nmeaningful action.\n  Shell Oil issued a report just last week that states: ``Economy-wide \ncarbon pricing--whether through carbon trading, carbon taxes or \nmandated carbon-emissions standards--provides an efficient and cost-\neffective way of aligning incentives and motivating action across the \neconomy to reduce carbon emissions.''\n  Top executives of six large European oil and gas companies, including \nShell, BP and Statoil, issued a joint letter calling on governments \n``to introduce carbon pricing systems where they do not yet exist at \nthe national or regional levels. . . . [W]e and our senior staff will \nseek to engage and share our companies' perspectives on the role of \ncarbon pricing in several important settings,'' which includes ``in our \nmeetings with Ministers and government representatives.''\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The question is, Has any Member of the Senate ever seen Shell or BP \nor Statoil or any other oil and gas company or any of their lobbying \nentities even once lobby Members of Congress on carbon pricing--other \nthan, of course, to say, hell, no.\n  My bill with Senator Schatz, the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, \nprovides a market-based, revenue-neutral carbon fee--just like these \ncompanies say they support. It is built on principles espoused by \nleading Republican economists and by Republican former officeholders.\n  Despite the industry's claims, I have seen exactly zero evidence that \nany of these companies--or their sizable trade associations--are using \nany of their lobbying muscle to advance carbon pricing legislation. \nInstead, ExxonMobil and Shell and the trade associations that represent \nthem continue to pump millions of dollars into political machinery \ndesigned to lobby against any action on climate change. They say one \nthing, but they do another.\n  This chart from the nonprofit research organization InfluenceMap \nshows the streams of money flowing from ExxonMobil and from Shell, as \nwell as from the American Petroleum Institute, the Western States \nPetroleum Association, and even the Australian Petroleum Production and \nExploration Association. In 2015 alone, ExxonMobil spent $27 million, \nShell spent $22 million, and the American Petroleum Institute spent $65 \nmillion on obstructive climate lobbying. This money deluge includes \nadvertising and public relations, direct lobbying in Congress and at \nstatehouses, and political contributions and electioneering. They say \none thing but do another--to the tune of $100 million a year.\n  As late as 2014, ExxonMobil gave the U.S. Chamber of Commerce $1 \nmillion for the chamber to propagate its climate message, delivered \nloud and clear not only here in Congress but in the courts, of absolute \nintransigence against any serious climate action. The U.S. Chamber is \npowerful, and in Congress we all see everywhere around us its \nimplacable hostility against serious climate legislation.\n  The gap between ExxonMobil's stated support for a revenue-neutral \ncarbon tax and its lobbying activities in Congress against any such \nthing is why Representative Ted Lieu of California and I recently asked \nthe American Geophysical Union, a topnotch scientific society, to \nreexamine its financial support from ExxonMobil. The American \nGeophysical Union is made up of honest scientists. In their world, they \nlikely expect that when people say something, it is true. Sadly, in \nCongress we don't enjoy the same experience. The good-hearted folks at \nthe American Geophysical Union appear to have been taken in by \nExxonMobil's false claims of support for a carbon price. Since we \nactually see the fossil fuel industry's lobbying presence, we wanted to \ncorrect any false impression.\n\n       What we see in Congress is that their lobbying efforts are \n     100 percent opposed to any action on Climate. . . . Whatever \n     position AGU chooses to take, you should not take it based on \n     self-serving representations by ExxonMobil.\n\n  POLITICO reported that in November ExxonMobil sent executives to \nCapitol Hill to try and convince congressional critics that ExxonMobil \nis a conscientious corporation that supports ``sound climate policy.'' \nWho did they think they were kidding? Do they think we don't know how \nthey lobby? We are the targets of their lobbying. We know how they \nlobby. Unsurprisingly, the ExxonMobil executives left DC ``empty-handed \n. . . after refusing to directly answer questions about whether \n[ExxonMobil] had suppressed internal research that underscored the \nthreat of climate change while publicly sowing doubt about climate \nscience.''\n  Given the fossil fuel industry's massive conflict of interest on \ncarbon pollution, there is every reason for them to play a double game: \ntrying to buy a little credibility for themselves with their public \ncomments, while at the same time using all their lobbying muscle to \ncrush any threat of bipartisan action on the carbon pricing they claim \nto espouse.\n  Sadly, in this double game they play, the fossil fuel industry has \nessentially no corporate opposition in Congress. Across the private \nsector, there are great corporate leaders on climate change, but from \nwhat I see, corporate climate lobbying from the good guys nets to zero. \nThe good guys have given up the field and let the fossil fuel industry \nto have its way with Congress unopposed, and the result is predictable: \nMany good Members of Congress are frozen in place, often against their \nbetter judgment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article I \nrecently wrote for Harvard Business Review explaining this reality.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Harvard Business Review, Feb. 25, 2016]\n\n          The Climate Movement Needs More Corporate Lobbyists\n\n                        (By Sheldon Whitehouse)\n\n       Across corporate America, there is broad support for action \n     on climate change.

Many \n     companies have committed themselves to getting onto a \n     sustainable path, and many are pushing their commitment out \n     through their supply chains. This is good, and it's \n     important.\n       But it makes us in Congress feel a little left out. The \n     corporate lobbying presence in Congress is immense. But in my \n     experience, exactly zero of it is dedicated to lobbying for a \n     good, bipartisan climate bill.\n       Dante wrote that above the Inferno was a sign: ``Abandon \n     hope all ye who enter here.'' But there is hope in Congress. \n     Many of my Republican colleagues are eager for some political \n     support, to counter the fossil fuel industry's relentless \n     onslaught.\n       Despite the statements emitted from oil companies' \n     executive suites about taking climate change seriously and \n     supporting a price on carbon, their lobbying presence in \n     Congress is 100% opposed to any action. In particular, the \n     American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade \n     association, is an implacable foe. Given the industry's \n     massive conflict of interest, there is every reason to \n     believe they are playing a double game: trying to buy a \n     little credibility with these public comments while using all \n     their quiet lobbying muscle to crush any threat of bipartisan \n     action on the carbon pricing they claim to espouse.\n       I am a sponsor of a Senate carbon fee bill, so I know this \n     firsthand. I see their destructive handiwork all around me--\n     and they have no corporate opposition.\n       Let me use the example of two good guys: Coca-Cola and \n     PepsiCo. I believe they care about climate change. They have \n     no conflict of interest like fossil fuel companies do. Both \n     signed a public letter urging strong action on climate in \n     Paris. Pepsi signed two major business climate action \n     pledges, the Ceres BICEP Climate Declaration in the United \n     States and the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group \n     Trillion Tonne Communique in the UK.\n       Coca-Cola's website says it will reduce CO2 \n     emissions by 25% by ``making comprehensive carbon footprint \n     reductions across its manufacturing processes, packaging \n     formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment, and \n     ingredient sourcing.'' Coca-Cola says, ``We . . . encourag[e] \n     progress in response to climate change.'' Indra Nooyi, chair \n     and CEO of PepsiCo says: ``Combating climate change is \n     absolutely critical to the future of our company, customers, \n     consumers--and our world. I believe all of us need to take \n     action now.''\n       And they are taking action. Their effort puts Coke and \n     Pepsi at the forefront of corporate climate responsibility. \n     But they lobby Congress through a trade association, the \n     American Beverage Association, and through the business \n     lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The American \n     Beverage Association sits on the board of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce and contributes a lot of money to it.\n       The American Beverage Association, as far as I can tell, \n     has never lobbied on climate change. When the Association \n     thought Congress might impose a soda tax to fund health care, \n     they lobbied like crazy--nearly $30 million dollars' worth. \n     They know how to lobby, when they want to. But on climate, \n     I've never seen it.\n       Everyone in Congress knows that the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce is dead set against Congress doing anything serious \n     about climate change. The U.S. Chamber is very powerful, and \n     its power in Congress is fully dedicated to stopping any \n     serious climate legislation. We see their hostility \n     everywhere.\n       The result is that Coke and Pepsi take great positions on \n     climate change in their public materials and private actions, \n     but here in Congress their lobbying agencies don't support \n     their position.\n       No corporate lobbying force is exerted for good on climate \n     change. Mars, maker of the iconic M, is going fully carbon \n     neutral. Its climate performance is spectacular. No lobbying. \n     WalMart, America's biggest retailer, is spending tens of \n     millions of dollars to become sustainable. No lobbying. Apple \n     and Google and Facebook are forward-looking, cutting-edge \n     companies of the future, and they lead in sustainability. No \n     lobbying.\n       The reasoning I am given is always the same. People fear \n     retribution, so embedded is the fossil fuel industry in \n     Congress. The\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\n     result is the good guys abandoning the field to the worst \n     climate actors in America: the fossil fuel industry and its \n     array of front groups. They don't just lobby. The roughest of \n     these, Americans for Prosperity, boasts loudly that it will \n     spend $750 million in this election (it's already through \n     $400 million and climbing) and that any effort to address \n     climate change will put candidates in ``political peril,'' \n     that they'll be ``at a severe disadvantage.'' Subtle like a \n     brick.\n       My response is twofold.\n       Climate change is not just any other issue. It's so big an \n     issue that the world's leaders just gathered in Paris to \n     address it. It's so big an issue that it has its own page on \n     most corporate websites. It's so big an issue that our former \n     Pacific commander, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, said it was \n     the biggest national security threat we face in the Pacific \n     Theater. To use his words, climate change ``is probably the \n     most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will \n     cripple the security environment, probably more likely than \n     the other scenarios we all often talk about.'' So it's big \n     enough for corporations to treat it as more than just another \n     issue in Congress.\n       Second, they can't hurt you if you organize. An antelope \n     alone may fall to the hyenas, but the herd will protect \n     itself. The fossil fuel industry can't punish Coke and Pepsi \n     and WalMart and Apple and Google and Mars and all the other \n     100-plus companies who rallied publicly around a strong Paris \n     agreement. You have to stand together.\n       Around Congress, the bullying menace of the fossil fuel \n     industry is a constant. If the good guys cede the field to \n     them, the result is predictable: members of Congress frozen \n     in place, often against their better judgment. It doesn't \n     have to be this way. I'm in Congress, and I'm writing here to \n     say: we need you guys to show up.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is time not just for us to wake up \nbut for the good guys to show up. Fossil fuel folks for years outright \ndenied climate change and happily funded their array of denial front \ngroups. That failed the tests of truth and decency, but at least it was \nconsistent. This new hypocrisy, to say one thing and do another, is \nplaying with fire. First, it poses a legal risk. It is never good to \nsay things you can't truthfully say under oath, which may be one reason \nwe see such histrionics from the climate denial front groups about \ninvestigations where fossil fuel executives may have to tell the truth \nunder oath. Second, it is a real reputation risk, especially among \nyounger consumers who aren't going to love an industry that lies. It is \nhard to say that you are not lying when what you are saying and what \nyou are doing are opposite.\n  It is time for the fossil fuel industry to end this new double game. \nEither put your money where your mouth is and start working with \nCongress to enact a price on carbon, as you say you wish, or go back to \nyour climate denial and your creepy front groups and see how that works \nout for you, but saying one thing while you are doing the exact \nopposite is just not sustainable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 29, 2015.\n     Her Excellency, Ms. Christiana Figueres,\n     Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,\n     Bonn, Germany.\n     His Excellency, Mr. Laurent Fabius President of COP21,\n     Paris, France.\n       Dear Excellencies: Climate change is a critical challenge \n     for our world. As major companies from the oil & gas sector, \n     we recognize both the importance of the climate challenge and \n     the importance of energy to human life and well-being. We \n     acknowledge that the current trend of greenhouse gas \n     emissions is in excess of what the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change (IPCC) says is needed to limit the temperature \n     rise to no more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. \n     The challenge is how to meet greater energy demand with less \n     CO2. We stand ready to play our part.\n       Our companies are already taking a number of actions to \n     help limit emissions, such as growing the share of gas in our \n     production, making energy efficiency improvements in our \n     operations and products, providing renewable energy, \n     investing in carbon capture and storage, and exploring new \n     low-carbon technologies and business models. These actions \n     are a key part of our mission to provide the greatest number \n     of people with access to sustainable and secure energy.\n       For us to do more, we need governments across the world to \n     provide us with clear, stable, long-term, ambitious policy \n     frameworks. This would reduce uncertainty and help stimulate \n     investments in the right low carbon technologies and the \n     right resources at the right pace.\n       We believe that a price on carbon should be a key element \n     of these frameworks. If governments act to price carbon, this \n     discourages high carbon options and encourages the most \n     efficient ways of reducing emissions widely, including \n     reduced demand for the most carbon intensive fossil fuels, \n     greater energy efficiency, the use of natural gas in place of \n     coal, increased investment in carbon capture and storage, \n     renewable energy, smart buildings and grids, off-grid access \n     to energy, cleaner cars and new mobility business models and \n     behaviors.\n       Our companies are already exposed to a price on carbon \n     emissions by participating in existing carbon markets and \n     applying `shadow' carbon prices in our own businesses to test \n     whether investments will be viable in a world where carbon \n     has a higher price.\n       Yet, whatever we do to implement carbon pricing ourselves \n     will not be sufficient or commercially sustainable unless \n     national governments introduce carbon pricing even-handedly \n     and eventually enable global linkage between national \n     systems. Some economies have not yet taken this step, and \n     this could create uncertainty about investment and \n     disparities in the impact of policy on businesses.\n       Therefore, we call on governments, including at the UNFCCC \n     negotiations in Paris and beyond--to:\n       Introduce carbon pricing systems where they do not yet \n     exist at the national or regional levels.\n       Create an international framework that could eventually \n     connect national systems.\n       To support progress towards these outcomes, our companies \n     would like to open direct dialogue with the UN and willing \n     governments. We have important areas of interest in and \n     contributions to make to creating and implementing a workable \n     approach to carbon pricing, including:\n       1. Experience. For more than a century we have provided \n     energy to the world. We are global in reach, closely familiar \n     with managing major projects and risks of many kinds, and \n     well-versed in trading and logistics. As we are already users \n     of carbon pricing systems across the world, exchange of \n     information at international scale could help to identify the \n     best solutions.\n       2. Motivation. We want to be a part of the solution and \n     deliver energy to society sustainably for many decades to \n     come. Like our counterparts in other industry sectors we will \n     play a key role in implementing the measures and deploying \n     the technologies that will lead to a lower carbon future. Low \n     carbon business models and solutions are fragile until they \n     reach critical size, but with linked carbon pricing systems \n     worldwide, uncertainty would be reduced and such solutions \n     will start to create value for business more rapidly.\n       3. Pragmatism. We believe our presence at the table could \n     be helpful in designing an approach to carbon pricing that \n     would be both practical and deliverable, as well as \n     ambitious, efficient and effective.\n       4. A forum for discussion. Our companies and others have \n     come together under the auspices of the World Economic Forum \n     to form the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative, or are members of \n     the International Emissions Trading Association, the World \n     Bank or the UN Global Compact Carbon Pricing initiatives. We \n     believe these forums may offer an appropriate ground for \n     public-private dialogue on how to price carbon into energy.\n       Practically, we and our senior staff will seek to engage \n     and share our companies' perspectives on the role of carbon \n     pricing in several important settings:\n       In our meetings with Ministers and Government \n     representatives.\n       As we attend and address conferences.\n       As we hold engagements with our investors.\n       As we conduct meetings with other stakeholders including \n     partners, suppliers, academics and researchers.\n       As we hold meetings for management and staff within our \n     businesses.\n       Pricing carbon obviously adds a cost to our production and \n     our products--but carbon pricing policy frameworks will \n     contribute to provide our businesses and their many \n     stakeholders with a clear roadmap for future investment, a \n     level playing field for all energy sources across geographies \n     and a clear role in securing a more sustainable future.\n       We acknowledge the long-term challenge and appreciate that \n     this will be transformative across the energy sector. Over \n     many decades, our industry has been innovative and has been \n     at the forefront of change. We are confident that we can \n     build on our trajectory of innovation to meet the challenges \n     of the future.\n       Each of us will copy this letter personally to key contacts \n     among investors, governments, civil society and our staff.\n       Yours sincerely,\n     Helge Lund,\n       BG Group.\n     Bob Dudley,\n       BP.\n     Claudio Descalzi,\n       Eni S.p.A.\n     Ben van Beurden,\n       Royal Dutch Shell.\n     Eldar Saetre,\n       Statoil ASA.\n     Patrick Pouyanne,\n       Total S.A.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/senate-section/article/S2911-4"}, {"day": "17", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2913-S2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
