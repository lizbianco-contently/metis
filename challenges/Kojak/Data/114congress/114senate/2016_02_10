Mr. President, I was disappointed last night to learn that \nthe Supreme Court temporarily halted the implementation of President \nObama's Clean Power Plan program. This was an especially stunning move \nby the Supreme Court, given that just weeks ago the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals categorically rejected a halt in the Clean Power Plan and \nStates do not need to start implementing the plan until 2022.\n  This shortsighted decision by the Court's five conservative Justices \nis an unfortunate setback. It unnecessarily puts into question a major \npart of our country's effort to address climate change and protect our \nenvironment. Notwithstanding my amazement, I remain confident that the \nObama administration's carbon rules are legally sound and will prevail \nin the courts.\n  In the landmark case Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Supreme Court itself directed the Environmental Protection \nAgency to address climate change if carbon pollution was found to be a \ndanger to human health. Based on enormous scientific evidence, the EPA \ndid make that finding and the Agency is required by law to regulate \ncarbon pollution. I can't imagine that the Supreme Court would take \nsuch an unprecedented and drastic step at this time. But the \nunparalleled nature of the Supreme Court's decisions show why Congress \nmust play a role in addressing climate change.\n  Climate-denying Republicans in the House and Senate might applaud \nthis decision, but their refusal to protect Americans from the impact \nof climate change is the real loss for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S759-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S759-S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no nation on this planet more \ndedicated to fear and intimidation than North Korea. Its leader Kim \nJong Un is a brutal dictator. He will stop at nothing to keep his power \nintact and his people isolated. That has been proven.\n  To accomplish these objectives, the North Korean Government relies on \nthreats to Japan and other neighbors and, of course, the United States. \nRecently, the number of alarming developments out of North Korea has \naccelerated. These acts of aggression are extremely concerning to the \nAmerican community, as they should be.\n  Last Saturday, North Korea defied international warnings and launched \na rocket using ballistic missile technology. This was a flagrant \nviolation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. This \ncame less than a month after North Korea detonated a nuclear device, \nalso in clear violation of international law.\n  That brings us to yesterday, when the U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence, James Clapper, confirmed that North Korea has restarted a \nplutonium reactor. The Director estimated that North Korea would be \nable to recover fuel from its reactor within a matter of weeks or \nmonths.\n  The international community quickly condemned these incidents, as it \nshould have. President Obama has been a leader in pushing back against \nthe saber-rattling from North Korea. He has worked to galvanize the \nworld in opposing North Korea's provocative and destabilizing behavior. \nUnder the President's leadership, the United States has built a global \ncoalition, including China and Russia, to impose sanctions against \nNorth Korea.\n  There is an international consensus that North Korea's actions \nviolate international law and threaten our allies and partners in the \nregion. Here in the Capitol there is also broad bipartisan agreement \nthat there must be consequences for North Korea's provocations. The \nHouse of Representatives overwhelmingly passed new sanctions \nlegislation. Now the Senate must act. We need to do it today. Two weeks \nago the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the \nsanctions bill that is now before this body.\n  This legislation would require the President to investigate and \nsanction any person who knowingly imports into North Korea certain \ngoods, technologies, service, training or advice\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\nconcerning weapons of mass destruction. It also directs the President \nto investigate and sanction people who engage in human rights abuses, \nmoney laundering and related activities, and cyber terrorism or other \ncyber vandalism.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes $15 million to transmit radio \nbroadcasts to North Korea for the next 5 years. These are commonsense \nsteps that Congress should take in response to North Korea's \nunwarranted provocation. Everyone in the Senate agrees that North \nKorea's aggression cannot go unanswered. Its actions threaten the peace \nand security of the region and, actually, the world. I hope my \ncolleagues will join with me in passing this legislation today to send \na message to Kim Jong Un that his reckless behavior will not go \nunanswered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S760-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ED PESCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I so admire the family we have here in the \nSenate. Many people work ceaselessly to make sure the Senate runs well. \nIn the Senate Periodical Press Gallery, a small group of nonpartisan \nstaffers helps the congressional press office to work together with the \ncommunications staff of Senators and their committees. Their \nfingerprints can be found on nearly every part of the Senate's \nbusiness.\n  The Senate Periodical Press Gallery facilitates key parts of Senate \nbusiness, including press access, print and digital media planning, \nsecurity protocols, and communications across hundreds of thousands of \nmedia platforms. For over 15 years, one man has been at the helm of \nthis exceptionally fine team. His name is Ed Pesce. After graduating \nfrom Loyola University in 1990, Ed began working in the Senate \nPeriodical Press Gallery. During his 26 years of service, Ed has always \nacted with warmth and professionalism.\n  As the news industry transitioned from sole dependence on print and \ntraditional mediums to a thriving combination of print and digital \nmedia, Ed ensured the Senate Periodical Press Gallery was not left \nbehind. He created the first Web site for the Senate Periodical Press \nGallery way back in 1999 and developed a social media communications \nprogram since then.\n  Ed has been a trailblazer in the news industry and a principal leader \nhere in the Senate. He has served under 11 Sergeants at Arms. During \ncountless historic achievements here in the Senate, he has seen so \nmuch. When asked what they will miss most, Ed's coworkers recall his \ninfectious laughter and dedication to team building.\n  Last year, Ed announced that he would retire after more than two \ndecades of service. I congratulate him for his many dedicated years of \nremarkable service. I wish Ed and John, his husband, all the best in \nthe years to come. On behalf of my colleagues, our staff, and the \nentire congressional community, I extend my gratitude to Ed for his \ntireless commitment to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S760-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I too wish to say a few words about Ed \nPesce, who today, after 25 years of Federal service, is retiring as the \ndirector of the Senate Periodical Press Gallery. Ed has been a fixture \naround here for years. You could usually find him right outside the \nChamber, behind the saloon swinging doors of the Senate Periodical \nPress Gallery.\n  When George Mitchell was the majority leader, that is where you found \nhim. When Bob Dole had the job, that is where you found him. It has \nbeen true ever since. But you can sometimes find Ed in other places \ntoo. Some mornings you can spot Ed at the gym on a spin cycle. Later in \nthe evening, you might see Ed queuing for the premiere of a Star Wars \nsequel, maybe even a prequel.\n  At almost any other time, you likely would find Ed buried in a book. \nFiction is one of his favorite genres; history is the other. He \ncertainly witnessed plenty of it firsthand. He oversaw media planning \nand execution for six Presidential inaugurations, for half a dozen \nRepublican Conventions, and for just as many Democratic ones, not to \nmention hundreds of congressional hearings and press conferences.\n  Ed is a Baltimore native who came to the Senate Periodical Press \nGallery shortly after graduating from Loyola. He diligently worked his \nway through the ranks, and after a decade spent learning the tricks of \nthe trade, he assumed his current role back in 2000. The job has \nbrought Ed in contact with thousands of Senate staffers and \ncongressional reporters. It necessitated many long hours and plenty of \nlate nights. It presented ample amounts of tense situations as well.\n  But Ed never lost his good attitude or his boisterous laugh. Just ask \nhis staff. ``Funloving,'' ``thoughtful,'' ``tough, but fair''--that is \nhow people who work closest with Ed describe him.\n  At 6 feet 2 inches, Ed Pesce is hard to miss, but I know he will be \nmissed here in the Senate when he leaves. He took on a tough job with a \ngreat attitude. He gained a lot of fans. It is a legacy that anyone \ncould be proud of. I think I can speak for my colleagues when I say \nthat we thank Ed for his many years of service. We send him our best, \nand we look forward to seeing what he will be able to accomplish in the \nnext chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S760-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate has an opportunity to \npass bipartisan legislation that would add to our Nation's ability to \nhold North Korea accountable for its growing aggression. North Korea \nthreatens regional stability and our own national security. It \nthreatens allies in the region, especially South Korea and Japan.\n  As General Clapper stated yesterday, it is a country that will \ncontinue to advance its nuclear program. I would urge my colleagues to \nvote yes to the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act today \nso we can work toward keeping our Nation and our allies safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S760-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S760-S761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CLEAN POWER PLAN REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, now on yet another matter, a few years \nago the Obama administration rolled out a massive regulatory scheme \nthey dubbed a ``Clean Power Plan,'' an odd choice, given that it would \nnot have a meaningful impact on global emissions or the health of our \nplanet. Here is what those massive regulations likely would do, though: \nship middle-class jobs overseas, punish the poor, impose more pain on \nKentucky coal families who just want to put food on the table--all for \nthe sake, one must assume, of letting well-off folks on the left feel \nbetter about themselves for ``doing something.''\n  It is pretty clear that the administration's energy regulations \nthreaten a lot of middle-class pain for hardly any substantive \nenvironmental gain. There is another huge problem too. These \nregulations are, in my view, likely illegal. Yesterday's Supreme Court \norder is just the latest sign of that. If nothing else, it shows we \nwere right to let Governors know their options. We thought Governors \nshould know they could take a wait-and-see approach before locking \ntheir States into some massive regulatory scheme. We thought Governors \nshould know the economic jeopardy they would place their States in by \nmoving ahead without a clearer understanding first of what might be \nlegally required. We thought Governors should not feel bullied by the \nheavy hand of this administration. That cautious approach was the most \nresponsible one, in my view. Yesterday's decision shows it was a \nprudent one as well. We will see what the Supreme Court ultimately \ndecides, but we are going to keep fighting against these regressive \nregulations regardless.\n\n  It is worth remembering how we got here in the first place. President \nObama tried to push a regressive, anti-middle class energy tax through \na Democratic-controlled Congress, and his own party said no. That was \nin 2010 when Democrats controlled the Senate. They said no. He simply \nwent around Congress to impose a similarly regressive plan anyway.\n  Kentuckians in the eastern part of my State are experiencing a severe \ndepression--a depression that policies\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\nsuch as these are only making worse. I have repeatedly invited Gina \nMcCarthy and the President to my home State to see the devastation \nfirsthand. They have yet to accept. But even if they won't come to us, \nwe have brought the concerns of Kentuckians directly to them. For \nexample, we have brought constituents to administration hearings in \nWashington to try to make people here listen.\n  I put myself on the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior so \nthat I could have a stronger influence in the oversight of the EPA \nbudget. It has given me the opportunity to shed light on the struggles \nof my home State and question officials like Gina McCarthy. It has \ngiven me the chance to push for policy riders in legislation that would \nundermine or overturn these regulations in their entirety. I have \nrepeatedly done so and will continue to do so. I have also worked \nsuccessfully with Members of both parties to pass measures through \nCongress that would also overturn these anti-middle class regulations \nin their entirety.\n  President Obama pulled out all the stops to defeat previous attempts \nto pass riders. He vetoed the bipartisan measures we passed through \nCongress. But he cannot stop the Supreme Court from making the right \ndecision, as we hope it ultimately will. He also cannot stop the \nAmerican people from electing a successor who is ready to support the \nmiddle class.\n  Here is the bottom line. I think we owe it to the people under attack \nto represent them and to stand up on their behalf. The Americans whom \nthese regulations attack have committed no crime. They have done \nnothing wrong. They are human beings with families. It is about time we \nhad an administration that treated them that way. Until then, we will \nkeep fighting and we will celebrate important progress along the way, \njust as we did with yesterday's Supreme Court action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S761-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (ii) the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce \n     new currency with improved security features to protect \n     against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea.\n       (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental \n     body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and \n     international policies to combat money laundering and \n     terrorist financing, has repeatedly--\n       (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North Korea's \n     regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing;\n       (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to address \n     significant deficiencies in those regimes and the serious \n     threat those deficiencies pose to the integrity of the \n     international financial system;\n       (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to \n     protect the international financial system from ongoing and \n     substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks \n     emanating from North Korea;\n       (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial \n     institutions to give special attention to business \n     relationships and transactions with North Korea, including \n     North Korean companies and financial institutions; and\n       (E) called on all jurisdictions--\n       (i) to protect against correspondent relationships being \n     used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation \n     practices; and\n       (ii) to take into account money laundering and terrorist \n     financing risks when considering requests by North Korean \n     financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in \n     their respective jurisdictions.\n       (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council \n     unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which--\n       (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's--\n       (i) recommendation on financial sanctions related to \n     proliferation; and\n       (ii) guidance on the implementation of such sanctions;\n       (B) decided that United Nations member states should apply \n     enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the \n     provision of financial services or the transfer of property \n     that\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\n     could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions; and\n       (C) called upon United Nations member states to prohibit \n     North Korean financial institutions from establishing or \n     maintaining correspondent relationships with financial \n     institutions in their respective jurisdictions to prevent the \n     provision of financial services if such member states have \n     information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that \n     such activities could contribute to--\n       (i) activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations \n     Security Council resolution; or\n       (ii) the evasion of such prohibitions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North \n     Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering \n     Concern.--Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security \n     Council to impose limitations on, and to require the enhanced \n     monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial \n     institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities;\n       (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms--\n       (A) to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction \n     of primary money laundering concern; and\n       (B) to adopt stringent special measures to safeguard the \n     financial system against the risks posed by North Korea's \n     willful evasion of sanctions and its illicit activities; and\n       (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation \n     by other countries of enhanced monitoring and due diligence \n     to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international \n     financial system, including by sharing information about \n     activities, transactions, and property that could contribute \n     to--\n       (A) activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions;

ENSURING THE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED \n                   NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND \n                   FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS ON NORTH KOREA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All member states of the United Nations are obligated \n     to implement and enforce applicable United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions fully and promptly, including by blocking \n     the property of, and ensuring that any property is prevented \n     from being made available to, persons designated for the \n     blocking of property by the Security Council under applicable \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       (2) As of May 2015, 158 of the 193 member states of the \n     United Nations had not submitted reports on measures taken to \n     implement North Korea-specific United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions 1718, 1874, and 2094.\n       (3) A recent report by the Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO-15-485)--\n       (A) finds that officials of the United States and \n     representatives of the United Nations Panel of Experts \n     established pursuant to United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1874 (2009), which monitors and facilitates \n     implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea, \n     ``agree that the lack of detailed reports from all member \n     states is an impediment to the UN's effective implementation \n     of its sanctions''; and\n       (B) notes that ``many member states lack the technical \n     capacity to enforce sanctions and prepare reports'' on the \n     implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea.\n       (4) All member states share a common interest in protecting \n     the international financial system from the risks of money \n     laundering and illicit transactions emanating from North \n     Korea.\n       (5) The United States dollar and the euro are the world's \n     principal reserve currencies, and the United States and the \n     European Union are primarily responsible for the protection \n     of the international financial system from the risks \n     described in paragraph (4).\n       (6) The cooperation of the People's Republic of China, as \n     North Korea's principal trading partner, is essential to--\n       (A) the enforcement of applicable United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions; and\n       (B) the protection of the international financial system.\n       (7) The report of the Panel of Experts expressed concern \n     about the ability of banks to detect and prevent illicit \n     transfers involving North Korea if such banks are located in \n     member states with less effective regulators or member states \n     that are unable to afford effective compliance.\n       (8) North Korea has historically exploited inconsistencies \n     between jurisdictions in the interpretation and enforcement \n     of financial regulations and applicable United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions to circumvent sanctions and \n     launder the proceeds of illicit activities.\n       (9) Amroggang Development Bank, Bank of East Land, and \n     Tanchon Commercial Bank have been designated by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, the United Nations Security Council, and the \n     European Union as having materially contributed to the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (10) Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking \n     Corporation have been designated by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and the European Union as having materially \n     contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (11) The Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea has been \n     designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for facilitating \n     transactions on behalf of persons linked to its proliferation \n     network and for serving as ``a key financial node''.\n       (12) Daedong Credit Bank has been designated by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury for activities prohibited by \n     applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, \n     including the use of deceptive financial practices to \n     facilitate transactions on behalf of persons linked to North \n     Korea's proliferation network.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should intensify diplomatic efforts in \n     appropriate international fora, such as the United Nations, \n     and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated, \n     consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global \n     financial system against risks emanating from North Korea, \n     including--\n       (1) the cessation of any financial services the \n     continuation of which is inconsistent with applicable United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, \n     including financial institutions, that present unacceptable \n     risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity \n     by the Government of North Korea;\n       (3) the blocking by all member states, in accordance with \n     the legal process of the state in which the property is held, \n     of any property required to be blocked under applicable \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit \n     activity, or from the misappropriation, theft, or \n     embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of, \n     officials of the Government of North Korea;\n       (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant \n     activities undermining cybersecurity by the Government of \n     North Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States \n     persons, or the theft of intellectual property by the \n     Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly from United \n     States persons; and\n       (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or \n     indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by \n     the Government of North Korea.\n       (c) Strategy to Improve International Implementation and \n     Enforcement of United Nations North Korea-specific \n     Sanctions.--The President shall direct the Secretary of \n     State, in coordination with other Federal departments and \n     agencies, as appropriate, to develop a strategy to improve \n     international implementation and enforcement of United \n     Nations North Korea-specific sanctions. The strategy should \n     include elements--\n       (1) to increase the number of countries submitting reports \n     to the United Nations Panel of Experts established pursuant \n     to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 (2009), \n     including developing a list of targeted countries where \n     effective implementation and enforcement of United Nations \n     sanctions would reduce the threat from North Korea;\n       (2) to encourage member states of the United Nations to \n     cooperate and share information with the panel in order to \n     help facilitate investigations;\n       (3) to expand cooperation with the Panel of Experts;\n       (4) to provide technical assistance to member states to \n     implement United Nations sanctions, including developing the \n     capacity to enforce sanctions through improved export control \n     regulations, border security, and customs systems;\n       (5) to harness existing United States Government \n     initiatives and assistance programs, as appropriate, to \n     improve sanctions implementation and enforcement; and\n       (6) to increase outreach to the people of North Korea, and \n     to support the engagement of independent, non-governmental \n     journalistic, humanitarian, and other institutions in North \n     Korea.\n       (d) Report Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report that describes the actions \n     undertaken to implement the strategy required by subsection \n     (c).\n\n     SEC. 203.

Under the previous order, there will be up to \n7 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I start by thanking the leader for \nbringing to the floor today the bipartisan North Korea Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act.\n  This legislation passed unanimously out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee to address a critical national security issue--the \nnuclear and ballistic missile threat from North Korea.\n  We know all too well that the past two decades of North Korean \npolicy, including both Republican and Democratic administrations, have \nbeen an abject failure. While there is no silver bullet solution, it is \nclear that Congress must play a proactive role in providing a more \nrobust policy tool to the executive branch to confront this threat.\n  There has been a lot of attention on North Korea in the weeks \nfollowing North Korea's fourth nuclear test, but Senators Cory Gardner \nand Bob Menendez demonstrated leadership on North Korea long before \nrecent events, and I thank them personally--Senator Gardner chairing \nthe subcommittee that looks after policy relative to North Korea and \nSenator Menendez coming together with a robust piece of legislation. I \nthank Senator Gardner for his leadership. He is new to the committee \nbut certainly not new to addressing problems our Nation faces, and I \nthank him for that. I thank them for their efforts over many months to \nfocus attention on the threat posed by North Korea and to work with \nSenator Cardin and myself to develop a bipartisan Senate bill.\n  I want to single out Senator Cardin and his staff for the \ncollaborative and constructive manner in which they worked with my team \non this important bipartisan piece of legislation. Senators Shaheen and \nMarkey also made important contributions as well.\n  Senator Cardin just arrived late, but I want the Senator to know I \nwas just boasting about his tremendous efforts. If he would please know \nthat has occurred.\n  This was truly an all-hands-on-deck bipartisan committee effort to \nensure a piece of legislation that the Senate, the Congress, and the \ncountry can be proud of.\n  Over the past decade, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \nconvened every couple of years at the full committee level to assess \nthe state of U.S. policy toward North Korea. There has been \nsurprisingly little variation in their overall descriptions of the \ndanger and recommended policy prescriptions. Former U.S. officials have \nall characterized North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile \nactivities as posing serious and unacceptable risk to U.S. national \ninterests. These same officials also all stressed the importance of \nstanding with our close regional allies, South Korea and Japan, in the \nface of destabilizing North Korean provocations. In addition, they all \ncited the necessity of cooperating with the international community to \ndeter further North Korean provocations and prevent the spread of \nsensitive technologies to and from North Korea. They all noted the \nimportance of enforcing U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea, \nspecifically the need for China to exercise greater influence over \nPyongyang.\n  Let me say this. I am personally very disappointed at the way the \nU.N. Security Council is functioning--whether it is Iran, where we had \ntwo ballistic missile tests and yet nothing has been done at the U.N. \nSecurity Council level. Most recently, China sent a delegation to meet \nwith North Korea right before this last test in order to try to \ninfluence them, and the country of China was embarrassed by the fact \nthat\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nNorth Korea went ahead with this ballistic test. Yet, in spite of that \nembarrassment, in spite of the fact it is their neighbor on their \nborder that is conducting these provocations, they still have not \nagreed to U.N. Security Council resolutions to put into place sanctions \nagainst North Korea. That is very disappointing.\n  In the recent years, U.S. officials have spoken increasingly of the \ndeplorable human rights situation in North Korea, including \nhighlighting North Korea's notorious prison camps. Of course, there \nhave been some differences in approaches toward North Korea over the \nyears, particularly with respect to the tactics of engaging North Korea \nand the appropriate balance of carrots and sticks. Yet it is apparent \nthat the past several decades of U.S. policy are not working. North \nKorea continues to advance their nuclear and ballistic missile \ncapabilities unchecked. They have orchestrated malicious cyber attacks \nthat threaten our allies as well as our own national security. \nMeanwhile, the North Korean people remain impoverished and subject to \nbrutal treatment at the hands of the Kim regime.\n  I appreciate the complexity of risks posed by North Korea and our \nlimited options. However, there is certainly more we can and should be \ndoing in addressing this issue. Our bill sets precedent and puts in \nplace strong mandatory sanctions and establishes for the first time a \nstatutory framework for sanctions in response to North Korean cyber \nthreats. The President will be required to investigate a wide range of \nsanctionable conduct, including proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, arms-related materials, luxury goods which affect the \nelite in that country, human rights abuses, activities undermining \ncyber security, and provision of industrial inputs such as precious \nmetals or coal for use in a tailored set of activities, including WMD, \nproliferation activities, and prison and labor camps. Penalties include \nthe seizure of assets, visa bans, and denial of government contracts.\n  I am also pleased this bill goes beyond just these sanctions--which, \nby the way, are very strong--and I want to underline the word \n``mandatory.'' It establishes a more robust policy framework, including \ntools to improve enforcement, and shines a brighter spotlight on North \nKorea's abhorrent human rights record, such as their forced labor \npractices. The bill requires a strategy to promote improved \nimplementation and enforcement of multilateral sanctions, a strategy to \ncombat North Korean cyber activities, and a strategy to promote and \nencourage international engagement on North Korean human rights issues. \nThere are reporting requirements related to these strategies as well as \na report on political prison camps and a feasibility study on providing \ncommunications equipment to the people of North Korea.\n  After the careful work over many months by a bipartisan coalition in \nCongress, we have a piece of legislation that I believe will begin to \nallow our country, working with our allies, to begin seizing the \ninitiative in constraining North Korea's ability to threaten its \nneighbors and the world with nuclear weapons while also continuing to \nfocus world attention on the plight of the North Korean people.\n  I look forward to hearing the perspectives of my colleagues on the \nsignificance of this legislation that I expect will receive wide \nbipartisan support and eventually become law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished friend and the \nranking member, Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first start by thanking Chairman \nCorker.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a proud tradition of \nworking on national security and foreign policy issues in the best \ninterest of our country and putting partisan differences aside so we \ncan speak with a strong voice. Chairman Corker has carried out that \ntradition and has elevated it to a level that I think has been not only \nin the best interest of the Senate but the best interests of our \ncountry. That is particularly true in the North Korea Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act of 2016. So I thank him for the manner in which \nhe brought different views together. We all had the same objectives, \nbut as the Presiding Officer knows, when dealing with 100 Members of \nthe Senate and the 19 Members of our committee, we each have different \nviews, and to try to harmonize that so we can get legislation done in a \ntimely way takes a great deal of talent and patience. Senator Corker \nhas both talent and patience, and I thank him very much for the way he \nled our committee to bring a bill to the floor of the Senate that I \nthink will get overwhelming support, will become law, and will advance \nU.S. national security interests.\n  I have my two chairmen here. Senator Gardner is the chairman of the \nEast Asia and Pacific Subcommittee in the Foreign Relations Committee. \nHe understood the importance of North Korea, its nuclear weapon \nprogram, its weaponization program, and the impact it has globally. \nThat is for sure, but East Asia is a particular concern, and Senator \nGardner understood that, working with our allies in East Asia to \ndevelop the right U.S. leadership so we will have an international \ncoalition isolating North Korea because of its conduct. So I thank \nSenator Gardner for introducing the original bill in the Senate and \nworking with Senator Menendez particularly--who introduced it on our \nside--to bring together legislation that is a proper role for Congress.\n  I want to underscore that. This legislation represents what Congress \nneeds to do. We are the policymakers of America. We pass the laws. Then \nthe executive branch, which is critically important to foreign policy--\ndon't get me wrong--but we enable the tools to be able to carry out \nthis foreign policy. What this legislation shows is Congress speaks \nwith a very clear voice, that we will not tolerate North Korea's \nproliferation of weaponry, its intimidation of its neighbors, its human \nrights violations, and that we will use the strongest possible measures \nto ensure that we contain that type of nefarious conduct.\n  Quite frankly, the legislation we have before us is similar to the \napproach we took with Iran and the congressionally mandated sanctions \nwe had on Iran that made it clear we were going to isolate Iran until \nthey changed course on their nuclear weapons program. What this \nlegislation does is take the product that came over from the House of \nRepresentatives--it was a good bill that came over from the House of \nRepresentatives, but we strengthened it. We made it more effective \nthrough the input of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. So it is a strong message--unified, bipartisan, working with \nthe administration to produce a strong policy.\n  North Korea's foreign policy challenges are known by all. It has been \nknown by every American President since the start of the Korean war. \nThey have tested four nuclear weapons and they tested a long-range \nballistic missile in defiance of numerous international obligations.\n  U.S. leadership is absolutely critical in standing up to North \nKorea's activities. We must isolate North Korea to prevent it from \ngetting international help to further its illegal weapons program. That \nis the basic point of sanctions. We want to prevent commercial \ninterests anywhere in the world from trying to help North Korea get the \ntype of weapons, equipment, and resources it needs in order to further \nits illegal weapon program. The United States must lead in effective \ndiplomacy to provide incentives and disincentives toward North Korea's \nconduct. We need to form strong alliances and partnerships in the \nregion. We have to work in close coordination with our allies, and \nquite frankly our goal is a peaceful and reunified peninsula. We think \nthat is in the best interest of all the Korean people.\n  Over the last two decades, the North Korean regime has moved steadily \nforward in their nuclear weapons development program and in the \nproduction of nuclear material. They have continued to develop this \nballistic missile program, they possess hundreds of short- and medium-\nrange missiles, and they are seeking ICBM capabilities. They have \nactive uranium and plutonium programs that pose a proliferation threat. \nThey have tried in the past to help Syria build a nuclear reactor and \nhave been a source of nuclear material\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\nmissile technology to rogue states, including terrorists. It is not \njust about one country-state. It is about what they are doing in \nhelping other countries that support terrorism and terrorist groups \nitself. It is critically important we act.\n  North Korea represents a grave and growing threat to the United \nStates, the region, and the international community. To respond to \nNorth Korea's continued belligerence, the legislation we have before us \nincludes mandatory sanctions--and the chairman mentioned that these are \nmandatory sanctions--directed against specific entities that violate \nU.S. law and United Nations Security Council resolutions, including \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms-related materials, \nhuman rights violations--and we will get to that because it is an \nimportant part of this legislation--and activities that undermine cyber \nsecurity.\n  Our legislation targets for investigation those who support these \nactivities by providing the regime with industrial inputs, such as coal \nthat provides economic support for North Korea's illicit activities or \nluxury goods that allow the regime to continue to exercise its control.\n  We are going after the source of their financing of their illegal \nweapons program. It is not always the direct equipment that goes into \nbuilding the weapons; in many cases, it is the mineral wealth of the \ncountry that they are using in order to finance that. This legislation \ntargets those sectors. The President is mandated to sanction any person \nwho has contributed to or engaged in or helped to facilitate these \nactions.\n  Even isolated regimes like North Korea are nonetheless tied to the \nglobal financial order in ways that provide the international community \nwith leverage to seek changes in North Korea's behavior.\n  This legislation also codifies existing cyber security sanctions in \nresponse to North Korea's increasing capability and provocations in the \ncyber domain, including the attack on Sony. This is an important step \nin building and enforcing international norms when it comes to cyber \nspace. One of the areas that we have strengthened in the House bill is \nto make it clear that our concerns about North Korea go well beyond \ntheir nuclear weapons tests but also to their cyber attack activities.\n  The vast majority of North Koreans endure systematic violations of \ntheir most basic human rights. Chairman Corker talked about this. Many \nof these violations constitute crimes against humanity. It is a fact \nthat is well-documented by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry. \nWidespread malnutrition, torture, and fear have made North Korea one of \nthe most egregious human rights violators, unparalleled in the \ncontemporary world. They are the worst.\n  These crimes by the North Korean regime should shock the conscience \nof humanity. Building on the important work of the U.N. Commission of \nInquiry, the United Nations Human Rights Commission and General \nAssembly adopted by overwhelming margins resolutions calling for \naccountability for North Korea's human rights abuses. Just last year, \nthe United Nations Security Council took up the DPRK's grave human \nrights injustices on their standing agenda for the very first time. \nThese multilateral resolutions need to be backed up by appropriate \naction, and that is exactly what we are doing.\n  It is well past time to hold North Korea responsible for its human \nrights violations, and this legislation does just that. In response, \nthis legislation imposes sanctions not just for North Korea's nuclear \nprograms and continued provocative behavior but for the severe human \nrights abuses committed in North Korea as well. This is new and \nnecessary policy ground for the United States with regard to North \nKorea.\n  Although tough sanctions have worked on North Korea when applied in \nthe past--and I think it is important to point out that sanctions do \nwork. In 2005 the United States designated Banco Delta Asia, BDA, as a \nmoney laundering concern for facilitating North Korean illicit \nactivities and banned all U.S. financial institutions from dealing with \nthat bank. It worked. It had a major impact on North Korea. The problem \nis, that was 2005 and we let up. We didn't keep the pressure on. This \nlegislation will correct that oversight and remedy the reasons why \nthese sanctions are not effective today.\n  This legislation acknowledges that sanctions and diplomacy are the \nmost effective way when integrated into a comprehensive strategy that \nengages all of our instruments of national policy. The North Korea \nSanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 includes instruments to \nimprove the enforcement of multilateral sanctions, an overall strategy \nto combat North Korea's cyber activities, and other efforts to address \nhuman rights abuses. The legislation also protects important \nhumanitarian assistance programs.\n  This is another point I want to underscore: We have no problem with \nthe people of North Korea. It is the government. It is the government \nthat is not only threatening its neighbors, it has damaged, threatened, \nand killed its own people. This legislation makes it clear that we will \ncontinue to try to get humanitarian assistance to the people of North \nKorea.\n  Finally, effectively enforcing sanctions against North Korea is not \nsomething the United States can do alone. It requires our allies, our \npartners, and the rest of the international community to join us in \nthis effort. This legislation seeks to create the policy environment \nthat makes such a multilateral effort at the United Nations Security \nCouncil possible.\n  The onus is now on China. Chairman Corker is actually right in what \nhe said. China is as much a threat as any country in the world as a \nresult of North Korea's activities. China can make a huge difference in \nisolating North Korea and changing their behavior to denuclearize the \nKorean Peninsula. That is their objective. China has told us that. They \nneed to take action. They shouldn't be blocking U.N. Security Council \naction. They should not only be supporting that, they should be using \ntheir influence over North Korea to bring about a change of behavior of \nNorth Korea as it relates to proliferation of weapons. So it is on \nChina.\n  The United States will do what it must do to safeguard our interests \nand that of our allies. And that, we will do. But we hope China, which \nclaims to share our same goals on the denuclearization of the Korean \nPeninsula, will agree on the meaningful steps necessary so that we can \nachieve that goal.\n  Let me be clear. The United States and Republic of Korea alliance \nremains as firm and resilient as ever and stands ready to support the \nKorean people against any and all provocations by North Korea. Just \nthis weekend, the alliance made a decision to begin formal \nconsultations regarding improvements to the THAAD missile defense \nsystem operated by U.S. Forces Korea. I support this decision, as it is \nboth an important element of our extended deterrence architecture and \nit sends the right signal of U.S. resolve to protect our allies and \npartners in the region. We will look for new defense systems to help \nthe Republic of Korea and our friends in the Korean Peninsula.\n  I also wish to commend President Park for her leadership in \nresponding to this growing threat. She has demonstrated the necessary \npolitical will to strengthen cooperation and consultations within the \nalliance and with partners in the region to forge a united and strong \ninternational response to North Korea's reckless behavior.\n  We must also continue to look for opportunities to enhance trilateral \ncooperation between the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Japan \nand South Korea are our most important allies in the region, and as we \napproach North Korea, to be most effective, we need to act together.\n  Strong, clear-eyed, forward-looking leadership will be necessary if \nwe hope to pursue eventual denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. It \ncalls for close coordination with our regional allies, South Korea and \nJapan, particularly in the areas of missile defense and information \nsharing. And it calls for U.S. leadership to strengthen the existing \ncounterproliferation regime, to ensure that North Korea's most \ndangerous weapons are contained as we work toward their elimination. \nThis legislation does that. It strengthens U.S. policy and allows us to \nensure that North Korea will pay a price for its continued nuclear \nambitions, while providing the administration with the toolkit it needs \nto develop and implement a more\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\neffective approach to North Korea. I urge all my colleagues to join us \nin supporting this very important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I want to add to the comments made by \nChairman Corker, my colleague from Tennessee and chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, as well as Senator Cardin, my colleague on \nthe Subcommittee on East Asia, about the work we have done over the \npast year to put this before the Senate today.\n  One of the first meetings we held in the office of Chairman Corker \nwas to speak with my colleagues on the concern we shared about North \nKorea, the concern that while we have rightfully focused on the Middle \nEast and the conflicts that have arisen in Syria and in various places \naround the country, at the same time we cannot take our eyes off of \nNorth Korea.\n  Of course, Senator Cardin from Maryland and I have worked together on \na variety of committee hearings. The first series of committee hearings \nwe held on the East Asia Subcommittee were to address cyber security \nissues, the cyber attacks from North Korea, and the situation in regard \nto security on the North Korean Peninsula. I think the work we have \nlaid out over the past year is setting ground for this strong sanctions \nbill today.\n  I rise to speak in support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act, as amended by the unanimous amendment that came \nout of the Foreign Relations Committee on January 28. This legislation \nis a momentous achievement, and I thank the members of the committee \nand particularly Senator Menendez for working closely with me as we \ncame together with a strong bipartisan solution to what is the problem \nwith North Korea. I also thank House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman \nEd Royce, the sponsor of the underlying House legislation, for his \nyears of tireless work and dedication on this issue. Having served with \nChairman Royce in the House for a number of years, I know his passion \nand his dedication and his commitment to bringing peace to the \npeninsula.\n  This legislation comes at a critical time. Those of you who had a \nchance to see the news this morning woke up to a story in Reuters where \nyet another top military official in the Kim Jong Un regime was \nassassinated by Kim Jong Un, following a long list of others in his \nadministration who have been killed, assassinated, tortured, including \nhis own uncle, including those who have been killed by anti-aircraft \nguns.\n  North Korea poses a serious and growing threat to its neighbors, our \nallies, South Korea, Japan, and others. It poses a threat to our \nhomeland, the United States, and to global security. While the threat \nis growing daily, our policies are failing to deter the forgotten \nmaniac in Pyongyang, Kim Jong Un.\n  This past weekend, on February 7, North Korea conducted a satellite \nlaunch, which is essentially a test of an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile that would be capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Last \nmonth, on January 6, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, \nwhich is the third such test during the Obama administration. Moreover, \nNorth Korea has claimed that this test was a test of a thermonuclear \ndevice, also known as a hydrogen bomb--a vastly more powerful weapon \nthan the atomic devices the regime has tested in the past. Regardless \nof whether the claim that it was a hydrogen bomb is true, this test \nrepresents a significant advancement in North Korea's nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  North Korea has violated a series of United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, including Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094--all \nwhile the regime's stockpile of nuclear weapons continues to grow \nexponentially. Most recently, nuclear experts have reported that North \nKorea may currently have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, with potential \nfor over 100 in the next few years.\n  Yesterday James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that North Korea \nhas restarted its plutonium reactor at Yongbyon and ``could begin to \nrecover plutonium from the reactor's spent fuel within a matter of \nweeks to months.'' The regime's ballistic missile capabilities are \nrapidly advancing. DNI Clapper stated that ``North Korea has also \nexpanded the size and sophistication of its ballistic missiles forces--\nfrom close-range ballistic missiles to intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles [ICBMs]--and continues to conduct missile test launches. . . . \nPyongyang is also committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed \nmissile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United \nStates.''\n  ADM Bill Gortney, the head of U.S. Northern Command, NORTHCOM, which \nis based in my home State of Colorado, at Peterson Air Force Base in \nColorado Springs, has publicly stated that North Korea may have already \ndeveloped the ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, mount it on \ntheir own intercontinental ballistic missile--something called the KN-\n08--and ``shoot it at the homeland.'' Those are not the words of a \ncommittee chairman or the words of a subcommittee chairman; those are \nthe words of our commander of NORTHCOM, who believes that they may have \ndeveloped the ability to shoot it at the homeland.\n  North Korea has demonstrated time and time again that it is an \naggressive, ruthless regime that is not afraid to kill innocent people. \nOn March 26, 2010, North Korean missiles sank a South Korean ship, \nkilling 46 of her own crew, and several months later, North Korea \nshelled a South Korean island, killing 4 more South Korean citizens.\n  Pyongyang is also quickly developing its cyber capabilities as \nanother dangerous tool of intimidation, as demonstrated by the attack \non the South Korean financial institutions and communication systems in \nMarch of 2013 or the Sony Pictures hack attack in November of 2014.\n  According to a November 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, ``North Korea is emerging as a significant actor \nin cyberspace with both its military and clandestine organizations \ngaining the capability to conduct cyber operations.''\n  According to the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       Contrary to perceptions of North Korea as a technically \n     backward nation, the regime has a very robust and active \n     cyber warfare capability. The Reconnaissance General Bureau, \n     North Korea's intelligence agency, oversees 3,000 ``cyber-\n     warriors'' dedicated to attacking Pyongyang's enemies. A \n     South Korean cyber expert assessed that North Korea's \n     electronic warfare capabilities were surpassed only by the \n     United States and Russia.\n\n  We should also never forget that this regime remains one of the \nworld's foremost abusers of human rights. The North Korean regime \nmaintains a vast network of political prison camps where as many as \n200,000 men, women, and children are confined to atrocious living \nconditions and are tortured, maimed, and killed.\n\n  On February 7, 2014, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on \nHuman Rights released a groundbreaking report detailing North Korea's \nhorrendous record on human rights. The Commission found that North \nKorea's constituted a crime against humanity.\n  What then has been this administration's policy to counter the North \nKorean threat? Our policy is something called ``strategic patience,'' \nwhich started in 2009 under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \nThe main idea behind strategic patience, it seems, is to patiently wait \nuntil Kim Jong Un peacefully surrenders.\n  The latest developments show that we are reaping the rewards of this \nill-conceived policy, and it can no longer be allowed to remain in \neffect. The simple fact is that strategic patience has been a strategic \nfailure. All that our so-called ``patience'' has done is to allow the \nNorth Korean regime to continue to test nuclear weapons, to expand its \ntesting of intercontinental ballistic missiles, to grow its military \npower, and to develop cyber warfare technologies while systematically \ncontinuing to torture its own people. We have neither militarily \ndeterred this regime nor effectively used our punitive tools.\n  Our sanctions policy toward North Korea has been weak. This was noted \nin that same CSIS report:\n\n       The sanctions against North Korea pale in comparison to the \n     level of sanctioning\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\n     against Iran. . . . The number of individuals and entities \n     sanctioned by the U.S. and UN are 843 (U.S.) and 121 (UN) for \n     Iran, but only 100 (U.S.) and 31 (UN) for North Korea.\n\n  When we do impose sanctions against North Korea, they are often \nrepetitive or ineffectual. Again, I quote from the Heritage Foundation \nreport:\n\n       In response to the North Korean cyberattack on Sony, \n     President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13687, which, \n     though expansive in legal breadth, was only weakly \n     implemented. The Administration targeted 13 North Korean \n     entities, three organizations already on the U.S. sanctions \n     list, and 10 individuals not involved in cyber warfare.\n\n  That was our response to North Korea. To date, we have not imposed \nspecific human rights sanctions on a single North Korean individual. \nThere are 200,000 men, women, and children in political gulags in North \nKorea, and the United States has not imposed a specific human rights \nsanction on a single North Korean leader. It is a disgrace given the \ngravity of the abuses that have been perpetrated by this regime.\n  These policy failures are why a year ago I began working on the \nlegislation that is before us today that would reverse course and apply \nthe pressure necessary to stop the forgotten maniac in Pyongyang.\n  Last August, I had an opportunity to visit South Korea and meet with \nSouth Korean President Park. We talked about the situation on the \npeninsula, and we agreed that the status quo with North Korea is no \nlonger sustainable. To witness the proximity of the threat for our \nSouth Korean allies, I visited the demilitarized zone, or the DMZ. Only \ndays after I departed, North Korea fired artillery across the border, \nfurther illustrating the danger that South Koreans live under each and \nevery day and the danger of armed escalation of this conflict.\n  I also traveled to China and met with Foreign Minister Wang as well \nas high-ranking officials of the People's Liberation Army to discuss \nNorth Korea. From my conversations, however, it became evident that \nalthough they are growing exasperated with the North Korean regime, \nBeijing has done little with the intention of undertaking meaningful \naction to stop Kim Jong Un.\n  Last October, I introduced S. 2144, the North Korea Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act. I thank 17 of my colleagues in this Senate for \ncosponsoring this legislation. The substitute before us today \nrepresents a slightly modified version of S. 2144. In particular, this \nlegislation mandates and not simply authorizes that the President \nimpose sanctions against persons who materially contribute to North \nKorea's nuclear and ballistic missile development and who import luxury \ngoods into North Korea; mandatory sanctions against perpetrators who \nenable its censorship and human rights abuses, who engage in money \nlaundering and manufacture of counterfeit goods and narcotics \ntrafficking, who engage in activities undermining cyber security or \nhave sold, supplied or transferred to or from North Korea precious \nmetals or raw metals, including aluminum, steel, and coal for the \nbenefit of North Korea's regime and its illicit activities.\n  These sanctions are tough, and we know that a significant portion of \nthe foreign currency that North Korea receives is for trade in its \nprecious metals, raw materials, aluminum, steel, and coal. We know that \nabout 90 percent of North Korea's economy is through its relationship \nwith China.\n  Senator Cardin previously mentioned that nobody faces a greater \nthreat than South Korea's neighbors Japan and China, which border a \nregime that is killing its own people and testing ballistic missiles in \nviolation of China's determinations, the United States' determinations, \nand certainly the United Nations determinations.\n  I will note that the mandatory sanctions on North Korea's cyber \nactivities and the mandatory sanctions on the minerals are unique to \nthe Senate legislation. This bill also codifies the Executive orders \nthat the President issued last year, 13687 and 13694, regarding cyber \nsecurity as they applied to North Korea, which were enacted last year \nin the wake of the Sony Pictures hack and other cyber incidents. That \nis also a unique feature of the Senate bill.\n  Lastly, if enacted and signed into law, the mandatory sanctions on \ncyber violators will break new ground for Congress. It is something \nthat we can take as a model and apply to other nations that perpetrate \nagainst the United States. We need to look for every way to deprive \nPyongyang of income to build it weapons programs, strengthen its cyber \ncapabilities, and abuse its own people.\n  We have to send a strong message to China, North Korea's diplomatic \nprotector and largest trading partner, that the United States will use \nevery economic tool at its disposal to stop Pyongyang.\n  Finally, I would like to quote the Washington Post editorial board \nfrom this past Monday, February 8:\n\n       President Obama's policy since 2009, ``strategic \n     patience,'' has failed. The policy has mostly consisted of \n     ignoring North Korea while mildly cajoling China to pressure \n     the regime.\n\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       Both China and North Korea must see that they will pay a \n     mounting price for what, to the United States, should be Mr. \n     Kim's intolerable steps toward a nuclear arsenal. ``Strategic \n     patience'' is no longer a viable option.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2016]\n\nNorth Korea's Rocket Launch Shows That Mr. Obama's `Strategic Patience' \n                               Has Failed\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       Assessing the behavior of North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is \n     necessarily a matter of guesswork In light of North Korea's \n     launch Sunday of another long-range rocket, however, our \n     favorite theory is a simple one: Mr. Kim is responding \n     rationally, even shrewdly, to the outside world. The 30-\n     something dictator no doubt noticed that after the regime's \n     latest nuclear test, on Jan. 6, there was no response other \n     than rhetoric from the U.N. Security Council, China and the \n     United States. Moreover, he surely observed that his \n     provocation served to widen a rift between Washington and \n     Beijing over how to handle him. So why not double down?\n       The three-stage rocket launched Sunday, which supposedly \n     put a satellite into Earth's orbit, could also serve as an \n     intercontinental missile. If North Korea has succeeded, as it \n     claims it has, in miniaturizing a nuclear warhead, Mr. Kim \n     could target Hawaii and Alaska, or perhaps even the western \n     U.S. mainland. The threat is not imminent--and yet it is \n     likely to become so if the United States does not devise a \n     more effective strategy for containing and deterring the Kim \n     regime.\n       President Obama's policy since 2009, ``strategic \n     patience,'' has failed. The policy has mostly consisted of \n     ignoring North Korea while mildly cajoling China to pressure \n     the regime. As the supplier of most of the isolated country's \n     energy and food, Beijing has enormous leverage. But Chinese \n     President Xi Jinping appears even more committed than his \n     predecessors to the doctrine that it is preferable to \n     tolerate the Kim regime--and its nuclear proliferation--than \n     do anything that might destabilize it.\n       Since the nuclear test, China has been saying that it will \n     support another U.N. resolution on North Korea, but it is \n     balking at significant new sanctions. Instead it calls for \n     ``dialogue,'' by which it means negotiations between North \n     Korea and the United States. This sounds reasonable; the \n     problem is that talks on curbing North Korea's nuclear \n     program and missiles have failed repeatedly, and Mr. Kim is \n     now insisting that the regime be accepted as a nuclear power.\n       What is needed is a return to the only non-military \n     strategy that brought results: sanctions that strike at the \n     regime's inner circle. Mr. Kim and his cronies are still \n     managing to import luxury goods from China, in spite of a \n     U.N. ban; they still use Chinese banks to do business with \n     the rest of the world. Those links could be curtailed if \n     China, like Iran before it, were designated as a money \n     launderer and U.S. sanctions were slapped on Chinese banks \n     and other businesses that supply weapons and luxury goods.\n       Pending U.S. sanctions legislation, already passed by the \n     House and scheduled for a Senate floor vote this week, would \n     mandate these steps, while providing the administration with \n     some flexibility. It should pass, and Mr. Obama should sign \n     it. The administration and South Korea have taken one \n     positive step, by announcing formal consultations on \n     deploying an advanced missile defense system in South Korea \n     as quickly as possible. That sensible step had been on hold \n     because of China's objections.\n       Both China and North Korea must see that they will pay a \n     mounting price for what, to the United States, should be Mr. \n     Kim's intolerable steps toward a nuclear arsenal. ``Strategic \n     patience'' is no longer a viable option.\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. This legislation begins the process of reversing course\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nfrom these failed policies toward building the strong policies that we \nneed to stop the forgotten maniac.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill--this amendment--which \npassed with unanimous support out of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nWe can make a difference today. We can strengthen our partnership among \nSouth Korea, Japan, and the United States. We can stop the torture of \nthe people of North Korea, and we can lift the threat of a nuclearized \nNorth Korea, which threatens to harm not just its neighbors or our \nallies but the people of this country, our homeland.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know we have a number of speakers who \nare interested in this legislation. I think they will be coming to the \nfloor between now and vote time. I ask that the other Members who wish \nto speak on this legislation come to the floor so we can fill in the \ngaps.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gardner and Senator Menendez for their efforts \non the front end of this legislation. I think this is a meaningful \npiece of legislation. I was with the Presiding Officer yesterday during \na lunch meeting, and I think he is OK with my sharing the fact that the \nSenate is playing a role in really projecting our strength. We continue \nto do so both through the Armed Services Committee that he serves on \nand also through the Foreign Relations Committee. I think this is a \nvery strong piece of legislation.\n  A lot of times it is difficult for us to make a difference. Let's \nface it. The Commander in Chief has such powers and such staff at their \ndisposal. However this is one of those pieces of legislation where I am \ncertain we are going to make a difference.\n  Will it end North Korea's activities? It will take collective efforts \nto make that happen, but I think this begins the process of moving that \nalong.\n  I have to say that I am so disappointed in the way the U.N. Security \nCouncil is behaving. Again, I don't want to rehash old discussions, but \nI know when we looked at the snapback provisions that were a part of \nthe Iran nuclear agreement--when you are dealing with partners like \nChina, which wants to buy oil from Iran, and Russia, which wants to \nsell them arms, I hate to say it, but our European friends are just \ndying to do business in the different ways that they are--mean nothing. \nThey mean nothing.\n  It is the fact that Iran had two ballistic tests that have taken \nplace, violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, and nothing has \nhappened because Russia and China have blocked those. In many ways that \nmeans that for us to continue the project to cause change to occur, \nthis body itself has to be even more proactive.\n  Senator Gardner has visited the DMZ, just as I have, and has seen the \n28,500 troops that we have there. I know Senator Sullivan has done the \nsame thing. We understand the constant danger that South Korea and \nJapan face, as well as others. North Korea is right on the border of \nChina, and China is the entity that can make the biggest difference. \nYet China--again, after being embarrassed when North Korea paid no \nattention whatsoever to their reach-out when they tried to keep this \nlast test, in particular, from occurring--was unwilling to listen.\n  So when we have ``partners'' on the U.N. Security Council unwilling \nto take steps, it means even more so that this body, of probably the \ngreatest Nation on Earth, has to be proactive.\n  I commend the Senator from Colorado. I commend the Members of this \nbody who I think are certainly interested and will pass this piece of \nlegislation overwhelmingly.\n  Again, I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Reid for allowing this \nlegislation to come up in this manner. I too thank Chairman Royce and \nRanking Member Engle. They have worked well together to cause us to \nproject strength in this regard. They sent the base bill over, and it \nis a very good bill and a strong piece of legislation that the Senate, \nby passage later today, will strengthen.\n  This is a collaborative effort. I hate to even use words like that, \nbut it is a collaborative effort by two bodies of Congress and two \ncommittees. Ultimately, at the end of the day, I think the two bodies \nwill fully pass this legislation and it will become law. This is going \nto begin to make a difference in the way North Korea is behaving.\n  What is happening there is important. It is one of the greatest \nhumanitarian crises, and this bill also addresses that.\n  I thank Senator Gardner for his comments on the floor. More \nimportantly, I thank him for his efforts in helping to bring this piece \nof legislation to the floor and for his leadership in the committee in \nhelping to design this bill.\n  I look forward to our having a successful day in the Senate.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. The Senator from Tennessee talked about his \ndisappointment with the United Nations. I want to go back over some of \nthe points we talked about earlier today.\n  Senator Cardin, our colleague from Maryland, mentioned the fact that \nthe United States has very similar approaches to our sanctions that \nbrought Iran to the negotiation table in the first place--\nsanctions that we levied against Iran brought them to the negotiating \ntable--and the fact that the United States has levied almost eight \ntimes more sanctions against Iran than we have a regime that does \npossess a nuclear weapon.\n\n  I think we have more work to do in the United States. This bill is a \ngreat step, but also the United Nations--and your expression of \ndisappointment with the United Nations is well stated.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I think it is good that the Senator from \nColorado brings up the fact that when we began putting these sanctions \nin place, there was a lot of push back because, in essence, for these \nthings to work properly or make the biggest difference in outcomes, we \nneed to have an international effort that takes place. When we began \nthe Iran sanctions process, it was unilateral. And while we stressed on \nthe front end--I know we passed an amendment in the Banking Committee \nwhere that one originated--to really put in place efforts to make it \nmultilateral, over time it did and, because of that, the world \ncommunity obviously is joining us, so we were able to force a behavior \nchange.\n  I would have liked to have had a better outcome when they got to the \ntable, and I think most people in this body would have. But this bill, \nI would point out, does seek and does push the administration not only \nto implement these by mandatory statements, but it also, again, \nencourages them to work with others.\n  I had those same conversations in China that the Senator from \nColorado had years ago. The Chinese, with such emphasis on stability--\nand I understand it is right on their border which, to me, should make \nthese provocations even more infuriating and more important, relative \nto the security of their own country. But it just seems that they, too, \nhave exercised the patience the Senator spoke about earlier that our \ncountry has exercised.\n  I really do believe that passage of this bill today, and an ultimate \nsignature by the President, has the potential to unleash the same chain \nof events that occurred relative to Iran, hopefully with a better \noutcome.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time spent in a \nquorum call before the vote in relation to H.R. 757 be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \nNorth Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act.\n  This legislation serves as a critical component of the U.S. response \nto the North Korean regime's dangerous and destabilizing acts. These \nacts are just\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\nthe latest in a series of flagrant violations of the U.N. Security \nCouncil's resolutions against North Korea's use of ballistic missiles \nand nuclear technology.\n  North Korea's unpredictable behavior, combined with their commitment \nto advancing their nuclear and missile capability, present a serious \nthreat to our country and our allies.\n  My support of this bill is grounded in my belief that the United \nStates must stand with our allies and lead an international response \nthat condemns North Korea's actions and reassures our allies, \nespecially Japan and South Korea. Strengthening and expanding sanctions \ndemonstrate that North Korea's behavior is unacceptable and that there \nwill be consequences.\n  The Gardner-Menendez substitute amendment codifies and makes \nmandatory important cyber security sanctions on North Korea that were \nenacted in Executive orders in the wake of the Sony Pictures hacking \nincident. The amendment also requires the President to target \nPyongyang's trade in key industrial commodities that are used to fund \nits weapons program.\n  The bill requires a strategy to promote improved implementation and \nenforcement of multilateral sanctions, a strategy to combat North \nKorea's cyber activities, and a strategy to promote and encourage \ninternational engagement on North Korean human rights-related issues, \nincluding forced labor and repatriation.\n  While passing this legislation is a critical part of the U.S. \nresponse, we also must work with our allies, as I mentioned before, to \nstand as a united international community.\n  Today, our allies Japan and South Korea took additional measures \nagainst Pyongyang. Japan declared that all North Korean ships, \nincluding those for humanitarian purposes, would be banned from coming \nto Japanese ports. Third-country ships that visited North Korea would \nalso be banned from entering. South Korea announced it would pull out \nof a joint industrial complex that it ran with North Korea at Kaesong.\n  I agree with Secretary Kerry that the U.N. Security Council must act \nswiftly to impose penalties for North Korea's violations of U.N. \nresolutions. China needs to join the international community in \nsupporting sanctions against Pyongyang and should use its leverage as \nNorth Korea's largest trading partner to expand U.S. sanctions.\n  This is an opportunity for the U.S. and China to work together toward \na common goal--a denuclearized Korean peninsula.\n  While our country is engaged in the campaign to destroy ISIL, North \nKorea's serious provocations demonstrate that we cannot take our \nattention away from the Asia-Pacific region. The United States has \nlongstanding strategic interests and commitments to the security of the \nAsia-Pacific area. It is a priority to maintain stability in the region \nwhere the United States has five treaty allies and many security \npartnerships. We must ensure that our solid commitment to defend South \nKorea and Japan remains firm.\n  While passing this sanctions bill is important to demonstrate our \nresolve and leadership, clearly this is not enough in the face of North \nKorea's provocations. We need to cooperate with our allies on missile \ndefense. As the north continues its provocative missile launches, our \nalliance with South Korea means that we must enhance our defenses \nagainst these threats. Pyongyang's missile capabilities threaten not \nonly our allies and our servicemembers stationed in South Korea and \nJapan, but also the U.S. territory of Guam, my home State of Hawaii, \nAlaska, and much of the west coast.\n  South Korea's decision yesterday to begin formal talks with the \nUnited States to deploy a THAAD missile defense system is a major step \ntoward this kind of missile defense cooperation. THAAD can target \nshort, medium, and intermediate ballistic missiles in flight.\n  Again, stability in the Asia-Pacific area with key allies, largest \nand fastest growing economies, and provocative actors like North Korea \nand China, is critical to our national security. We must continue our \ncommitment to an all-of-government Asia-Pacific rebalance with \nmilitary, economic, and diplomatic attention and resource priorities to \nthis part of the world.\n  Since my election to the Senate, I have made it a priority to visit \nthis region every year. Most recently, this past summer, I visited \nJapan and Guam. I traveled to South Korea in 2013, and I know that our \nallies are counting on us to keep our focus on the Asia-Pacific and \nwork with them to maintain stability and prosperity in this part of the \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a strong message to North Korea and our \nallies by not only supporting the North Korean Sanctions Enforcement \nAct, but also by supporting the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, many of my colleagues, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, have taken to the floor today in support of the North Korea \nSanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. It is a bill that I, too, am \npleased to support.\n  This bill was developed in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nthrough the same spirit of collaboration and collegiality in America's \nbest interests that we have seen in this committee time and again. \nSenators Gardner and Menendez deserve real praise for their work \ntogether drafting this bill, and I thank and commend Chairman Corker \nand Ranking Member Cardin for leading an open amendment process within \nthe committee that strengthened the bill with truly constructive \nchanges-- among them an amendment from Senator Markey to crack down on \ntransfers of conventional weapons to and from North Korea, and another \nfrom Senator Shaheen, which makes sure these new sanctions will not \nimpede our ability to recover the remains of any lost American \nservicemember in North Korea.\n\n  I want to thank Senators Corker and Cardin not only for advancing \nthis bill but, just as importantly, for leading the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in a bipartisan spirit that reflects the best of the Senate \nin an uncertain world. This is a strong bill, and I am confident it \nwill enhance sanctions against North Korea in response to the regime's \nnuclear test last month and its dangerous nuclear missile launch last \nweekend. It is a clear, direct response that sends an unmistakable \nsignal to North Korea and the world that we intend to continue to be \nactively engaged.\n  Frankly, the floor debate this week at some moments has not always \nreflected that same bipartisan spirit and the same spirit in which the \nHouse overwhelmingly passed a similar bill last month. Somehow the \ndebate has at times shifted from questions of how best to punish North \nKorea for its illegal actions and how we can pull together in that \neffort to questions about President Obama's broader policy goals and \nmotives. Suggestions that the President somehow enabled North Korea to \nengage in this provocative behavior by pursuing a separate nuclear \nagreement with Iran only distract from our shared goal that serves as \nthe foundation and bipartisan purpose of this legislation.\n  I urge a more constructive course. We should apply the same \nbipartisan spirit in which we developed the North Korea Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act toward passage of the Iran Policy Oversight Act, \nwhich was led by Ranking Member Cardin and which will ensure that \nCongress can exercise effective oversight of the nuclear agreement with \nIran.\n  Just as members of the Foreign Relations Committee worked together to \ndevelop a sanctions bill on North Korea, Republicans and Democrats in \nthis body should come together to enforce the terms of the nuclear deal \nwith Iran and to push back on Iran's support for terrorism in the \nMiddle East, its ongoing human rights violations, and its illegal \nballistic missile tests. The Iran Policy Oversight Act offers us an \nincredible way to accomplish all of these goals.\n  When it comes to the recent nuclear agreement with Iran, also known \nas\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or the JCPOA, too often we find \nourselves distracted from the core question as to whether that deal has \nmade Iran less able to pursue development of a nuclear weapon. We are \nseeing the same tendency play out today as some of my colleagues have \npromoted a false comparison between the JCPOA and the 1994 agreed \nframework, which the United States negotiated with North Korea with the \ngoal of stopping North Korea from developing a nuclear weapon. These \ncomparisons make a false implication that just because the 1994 \nframework utterly failed to keep North Korea from pursuing an illicit \nnuclear weapons program, the JCPOA is destined to similarly fail with \nregard to Iran. I will take a moment to explain why this comparison is \ninaccurate at best and dangerously misleading at worst.\n  First the 1994 framework with North Korea was just that--a brief \nframework or outline, its text just three pages long. The nuclear \nagreement with Iran, on the other hand, is nearly 160 pages--thorough, \ndetailed, and comprehensive, outlining the international community's \nexpectations, specifying deadlines of deliverables, and laying out in \nclear terms the consequences for violations of the deal.\n  The second difference between the two is just as fundamental. The \n1994 agreed framework with North Korea did not seek to block North \nKorea's plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon. Not only does it \neliminate its ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium, but \ninternational inspectors have recently certified Iran actually did so \nby filling the core of the Arak heavy water reactor with concrete.\n  The importance of including this provision in the JCPOA was made even \nclearer yesterday when James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence, confirmed that North Korea has restarted its plutonium \nproduction reactor and may begin recovering spent plutonium fuel in a \nmatter of weeks. If Iran even attempted to do the same, the \ninternational community would now know and would be able to take action \nlong before it could achieve its objective.\n  The third key difference is this. The JCPOA allows the IAEA, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, full access to monitor Iran's \nentire nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mines to mills, to centrifuge \nproduction workshops, to enrichment facilities. Never before--including \nback in 1994 with North Korea--has a nuclear agreement given \ninternational inspectors such comprehensive access to monitor and \ninspect compliance. In fact, when I recently visited the IAEA \nheadquarters in Vienna, Austria, the head of the agency said the access \nthey have gotten to Iran's entire range of nuclear activities goes well \nbeyond the access it had in North Korea in the 1990s.\n  The fourth difference is just as crucial. The JCPOA requires Iran to \nabide by the so-called Additional Protocol and other additional \nmeasures, which guarantee the IAEA can seek access to suspicious \nundeclared locations. This Additional Protocol, a key deterrent to \ncheating, didn't even exist in 1994. The nuclear deal with Iran \ncontains defined timelines for access to suspect potential nuclear \nsites and a dispute resolution mechanism that will resolve differences \nbetween Iran and the international community in favor of accessing \ninspection. The 1994 agreed framework didn't include any of these \nprotections.\n  Fifth, the JCPOA is an agreement between Iran and the international \ncommunity. While the United States maintains its ability to snap back \ninternational sanctions to punish Iran, the strength of the deal is not \njust from U.S. support but from buy-in from our P5+1 partners--the \nUnited Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China--and we have to \ncontinue to work together tirelessly on a bipartisan basis to ensure \nthat those partners remain partners in enforcement of the deal.\n  Sixth, the JCPOA puts incentives in the right place, halting any \nsanctions relief for Iran until after the international community \nverified it had complied with the core terms of the deal. The 1994 \nframework allowed North Korea compensation and sanctions relief simply \nfor signing up before the agreement was even implemented--clearly a \nfatal flaw.\n  Finally, and in some ways most importantly, although Iran and North \nKorea are dangerous, radical regimes--revolutionary regimes--and they \nare both ostensibly led by Supreme Leaders, they exist in different \nregions, have different goals, and exist in different contexts. I do \nthink that Iran, rightly or wrongly, seeks and needs integration with \nthe world economy, and North Korea continues to be a rogue regime \nisolated from the rest of the world.\n  The seven differences this Senator has just briefly outlined show the \nfundamental differences between the 1994 agreed framework with North \nKorea, which failed, and the JCPOA with Iran, which I hope and pray \nwill still prove to be successful. We must focus on enforcing \nrigorously the terms of the JCPOA and pushing back on Iran's bad \nbehavior in a bipartisan fashion and in the same spirit in which my \ncolleagues in the Foreign Relations Committee developed this vital and \nimportant North Korea bill.\n  One way we could do so is to pass the Iran Policy Oversight Act, a \nbill led and developed by Senator Cardin and the members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee who were both supporters and opponents of the \nJCPOA. The Iran Policy Oversight Act would clarify ambiguous provisions \nin the JCPOA, establish in statute our commitment to enforcing the \ndeal, engage in comprehensive efforts to counter Iranian activities in \nthe Middle East, and provide increased support to our allies in the \nregion, especially our vital ally, Israel.\n  I commend Senator Cardin for his leadership in drafting a bill strong \nenough to earn the cosponsorship of both supporters and opponents of \nthat nuclear deal.\n  Even in a dysfunctional Congress, today's debate and passage of the \nNorth Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act shows that we can come \ntogether to make our country safer in the face of a dangerous world. \nCongress did the same last May when we came together to enact the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act, which gave Congress a clear and focused \nopportunity to review the terms of the JCPOA before it was finalized. \nWe can and must do similar things again.\n  We should work together, Republicans and Democrats, in the spirit of \nthe North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act and the Iran \nNuclear Review Act to introduce, debate, and pass legislation to show \nIran and our allies that the United States is serious about continuing \nto hold them accountable for their bad behavior and to continue to \ndemonstrate our leadership in the Pacific region and our determination \nto contain North Korea's dangerous nuclear activities.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I \nsubmitted to the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act. This bill we \nare considering today will provide a more robust set of tools to \nconfront the nuclear threat from Pyongyang by expanding and tightening \nenforcement on North Korea.\n  This bill goes beyond sanctions and calls for a more forceful \nresponse to North Korea's cyber attacks and human rights abuses. We now \nhave an opportunity to highlight North Korea's cooperation with Iran on \nnuclear weapons and ballistic missile development. North Korea's \nnuclear cooperation with Iran is widely suspected, and yet the Obama \nadministration has been reluctant to disclose what it knows to \nCongress.\n  Last month, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test. \nIranian officials reportedly traveled to North Korea to witness its \nthree previous nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, and 2013. Given this trend, \nit would not be surprising at all if Iranians were actually present in \nNorth Korea's test just last month. Just before North Korea's 2013 \ntest, a senior American official was quoted as saying ``it's very \npossible that the North Koreans are testing for two countries.''\n  Yesterday, the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, \nprovided written testimony to Congress, which stated that Pyongyang's \n``export of ballistic missiles and associated materials to several \ncountries, including Iran and Syria, and its assistance to\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\nSyria's construction of a nuclear reactor . . . illustrate its \nwillingness to proliferate dangerous technologies.''\n  We have known that Iran and North Korea have been cooperating on \nballistic missile technology, and it has been suspected for over a \ndecade that they are also working together on nuclear weapons \ndevelopment as well as ballistic technology. In the wake of the nuclear \nagreement with Iran, Iran is starting to see a flow of funds from \nsanctions relief of potentially over $100 billion. As Iran gets this \nflow of cash, this Senator is concerned that we will see this illicit \ncooperation increase and that Iran will use some of these funds to pay \nNorth Korea for further testing and technology.\n  This amendment No. 3294 would require a semiannual report to \nCongress; that is all. This report would cover North Korea's \ncooperation with Iran on nuclear weapon and ballistic missile testing, \ndevelopment, and research. We have been asking for this information and \nhave not received it in a timely fashion.\n  The administration would also be required to disclose to Congress the \nidentity of individuals who have knowingly engaged in or directed \nmaterial support for or exchanged information between the governments \nof Iran and North Korea for their nuclear programs in this semiannual \nreport. In order for us to tackle this problem head-on and to take \nsteps to halt this illicit cooperation, we need a full report from the \nadministration. It is as simple as that. That is all this amendment \ndoes.\n  I am glad to see this body moving so swiftly to enact punitive \nsanctions on North Korea for its recent actions, and this amendment \nwill help further strengthen efforts to punish rogue regimes.\n  I would also like to applaud the efforts of my colleagues on the \nForeign Relations Committee--Senator Gardner, Chairman Corker, and \nSenator Menendez--for their work on getting this bill through committee \nand to the floor. Their leadership on this issue has been tremendous, \nand I look forward to working with them on the floor to see its \npassage.\n  Thank you, and I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, while we are waiting on Senator Peters to \nbe here, I wanted to go through some of the history relative to the \nNorth Korean program. I think sometimes there has been so much focus on \nother countries' programs--I know Senator Gardner alluded to some \naspects of it in his comments--but North Korea's nuclear program \nactually dates back to the 1950s, when they pursued nuclear energy \ncooperation with the Soviet Union.\n  In ensuing years, North Korea acquired a full nuclear fuel cycle, \nincluding plutonium, reprocessing, and uranium enrichment capabilities. \nSo this goes back to the 1950s, but in 2003 North Korea announced its \nwithdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and conducted four \nnuclear weapons tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2016.\n  Experts believe the first two nuclear tests were plutonium based, and \nanalysts assess the third nuclear test may have used highly enriched \nuranium. So they are on a two-track route. On January 6, 2016, North \nKorea announced that it successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb. We \ndon't have verification of that. We don't have intelligence back that \nwould verify that was the type of test that took place.\n  Today North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, a longstanding plutonium \nnuclear program at Yougbyon, and a uranium enrichment capability which \nit revealed in 2010 after years of denials. Open-source estimates of \nNorth Korea's nuclear arsenal vary from 10 devices to nearly 100 \nweapons, but most experts believe North Korea's nuclear arsenal is \nsomewhere in the range of 10 to 20 devices that are made of both \nplutonium and highly enriched uranium.\n  North Korea's weapons of mass destruction extend beyond its nuclear \ncapabilities to include biological and chemical weapons programs. It \nalso maintains an extensive long-range ballistic missile program which \nposes a direct threat to allies, U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific, and \nthe United States.\n  The Presiding Officer lives in a part of the world that is most \ndirectly certainly at threat. North Korea's nuclear program dates back \nto the 1970s. In 1984, North Korea conducted its first ballistic \nmissile test of a Scud-B ballistic missile. North Korea's ballistic \nmissile arsenal includes shorter range Scud missiles that can travel \nnearly 300 miles, No Dong missiles that can travel upward of 800 miles, \nand several longer range missiles that can travel from 4,000 upward to \n6,000 miles.\n  In April 2012, North Korea displayed at a military parade a new long-\nrange missile variant known as KN-08. The missile was displayed on a \nChinese-made transporter erector launcher. In the fall of 2015, North \nKorea again displayed, at a military parade, the same missile on a \nChinese TEL. In December 2012, North Korea successfully launched the \nUnha-3 launch vehicle, placed a satellite into orbit, representing a \nsignificant advancement in North Korea's missile technology \ncapabilities.\n  On February 7, 2016, North Korea announced it had successfully \nlaunched another satellite into orbit using the Unha-3 launch vehicle. \nAlthough the KN-08 missile has not been tested, it is believed that the \nspace launch vehicle technology has some similar technological features \nof an ICBM. The head of the U.S. Northern Command, ADM William Gortney, \nhas stated our government assesses that North Korea could miniaturize a \nnuclear weapon and place it on the KN-08, which would reach the U.S. \nhomeland. Pretty amazing, really, to think about the progress that has \noccurred without any real actions taking place.\n  Again, this has gone through multiple administrations. North Korea \nstands as one of the most foremost proliferators of WMD-related \nmaterials and ballistic missile technologies. North Korea has engaged \nin WMD-related and missile cooperation with several states, including \nIran, Pakistan, and Libya.\n  North Korea also assisted Syria in the construction of a plutonium-\nbased nuclear reactor at al-Kibar, until Israel destroyed that facility \nin 2007. In addition, it has been reported that North Korea assisted \nboth Iran and Pakistan with nuclear weapons design activities. Again, I \nthink it is very timely that we are taking this up--actually beyond \ntime--with the most recent activities that have taken place. This is \ntimely.\n  Obviously, the policy--again, through multiple administrations, \nmultiple Congresses--has really been left untouched in a significant \nway. I truly do believe the legislation that hopefully will pass this \nbody today with overwhelming support will be the beginning of a \nprocess. We just have seen, by the way, with it being known that the \nU.S. House and Senate were probably going to pass a very strong piece \nof legislation--we are now seeing other countries in the region \nstepping up.\n  Again, it speaks to the power of us speaking in one voice and again \npushing, as we did on Iran years ago, pushing the international \ncommunity to join in with us. Again, as I said earlier, I am still \ndisappointed that the U.N. Security Council cannot function--cannot \nfunction--in a way to speak more collectively in that way, but I am \nglad to see that countries in the region, as a result of certainly the \nstances being taken here and as a result of their own concerns about \nwhat is happening with North Korea--I am glad to see it looks as though \nwe are beginning to push toward more international efforts against \nNorth Korea.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, one of the things that I think we have to \ncontinue to reiterate during today's debate is that this debate is not \nabout the people of North Korea. It is about the dictator of the \nregime, the forgotten maniac, Kim Jung Un, and his\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\nreign of terror in North Korea, not only with the 200,000 people who \nare subject to imprisonment in political camps--200,000 men, women, and \nchildren who have been tortured and maimed--but it is about his \nleadership that seems to go along with him, a leadership that would aid \nand abet in the torture and maiming of innocent people.\n  I think perhaps this chart, this picture, this satellite image of the \nKorean Peninsula, best illustrates what the people of North Korea are \nsubjected to each and every day. You can see North Korea right here, a \nbig vast, empty space at night, very little light, maybe Pyongyang, the \nbrightest light point compared to Seoul, compared to South Korea, \ncompared to their neighbors in the south, their family members in the \nsouth because they have been deprived of an economy, because they have \nbeen deprived of an opportunity, and because the people of North Korea \nhave been deprived of the freedoms their South Korean neighbors have \nenjoyed.\n  Standing on the DMZ--and I know the Presiding Officer has been there \nas well--standing on the DMZ, you can see the differences between the \ndevelopment of North Korea and South Korean. In just a few moments--I \nnotice my colleague from Michigan is here and is scheduled to speak. In \njust a few minutes I will go into this chart a little bit more about \nhow this bill not only creates mandatory sanctions but also will give \nus tolls to help the people of North Korea.\n  With that, I will yield the floor to my colleague Senator Peters from \nMichigan, whom I have had great opportunities to work with before on \nlegislation from telecommunications to cars that communicate with each \nother. I am grateful he is here to speak on this bill as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation currently \nbefore the Senate to crack down on the North Korean regime's repeated \nnuclear provocations. I would certainly like to thank my colleague \nSenator Gardner for his leadership on this issue as well.\n  Four days ago, on February 6, the world watched North Korea launch a \nrocket into space, in what was clearly an effort to test its advanced \nballistic missile technology. The North Korean satellite is now \ntumbling in orbit and incapable of functioning in any useful way. Last \nmonth, the regime announced it had successfully detonated a nuclear \ndevice as part of its rogue nuclear program, the fourth test we have \ndetected in North Korea since 2006.\n  This combination of incompetence, aggression, and defiance of the \ninternational community is dangerous and simply cannot stand.\n  Just yesterday, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \ntestified it is likely North Korea has restarted the plutonium reactor \nthat has been shuttered since 2007 and could begin to recover fissile \nmaterial within weeks.\n  These defiant acts fly in the face of existing international \nsanctions and must be met with a strong and unified response from the \nworld community. It is a step in the right direction that the U.N. \nSecurity Council has strongly condemned North Korea's actions and vowed \nto adopt significant new punitive measures against the regime.\n  However, the dangerous path North Korea continues down poses a direct \nthreat to the United States and our allies, particularly South Korea \nand Japan. We must go further and take action to punish the North \nKorean regime and those who aid and abet in its provocative actions.\n  The legislation before us today would significantly enhance our \nability to curb the North Korean nuclear program. The bill requires the \nPresident to sanction anyone who knowingly supports the North Korean \nregime, whether by furnishing materials for North Korean weapons \nprograms or by selling luxury goods to corrupt government officials \nwhile so many North Koreans live in poverty.\n  The bill also provides exemptions for humanitarian organizations that \nwork to relieve the suffering of millions of North Koreans. We must \ncontinue to let the people under the rule of this brutal regime know \nthat we stand with them in their democratic aspirations, even as their \ngovernment continues to threaten the international community. I commend \nthe efforts of the Foreign Relations Committee and particularly \nSenators Menendez and Gardner for their work on this important \nlegislation.\n  The United States has long led the world in working to curb the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation. We lead through sustained commitments \nto securing fissile material, such as spearheading the effort to secure \nloose nukes after the fall of the Soviet Union. We lead through \nprecedence set in the bilateral 123 agreements, agreeing to share \ncivilian nuclear technology so partner countries can diversify their \nenergy mix while explicitly preventing them from enriching uranium on \ntheir own soil.\n  In the years to come, our leadership is necessary to raise this \nglobal standard even higher for every country regarding the enrichment \nof uranium. We do not aim to deny peaceful nuclear energy to nations \nthat seek it, but we must make clear that there is no universal right \nto enrichment. The United States has moral authority on this issue \nbecause we have led by example, committing to reductions in our own \nnuclear arsenal in the interest of a safer world. We must continue to \nwork with unity of purpose and act to stem the spread of nuclear \nmaterials to rogue states and terrorist organizations.\n  Nowhere is American leadership more necessary than in the case of the \nIranian nuclear program. I was proud to cosponsor the initial effort to \npass sanctions against Iran in 2009 and help pass additional sanctions \nin the years since. I firmly believe crippling sanctions are what \nbrought Iran to the negotiating table and the threat of additional \nsanctions enhanced our bargaining position during the painstaking \nnegotiations that led to the JCPOA. Our work to unite world powers \nbehind this effort led to an agreement that curbs Iran's nuclear \nprogram in the short term, but in the longer term we need to stand \nready to act swiftly and decisively against any Iranian violations of \nthe JCPOA, large or small.\n  The JCPOA is not the end of our multilateral efforts against Iran and \nits illicit behavior, just as the legislation before us today is not \nthe end of our multilateral efforts against the North Korean regime and \nits repeated affronts to international security. We will continue to \npunish regimes that support terrorism, violate human rights, and \nillegally seek nuclear weapons. Surely our response to the North Korean \nprovocations will be watched closely by the Iranian regime, which is \nwhy we must respond swiftly and why we must respond strongly.\n  The sanctions bill before us today is not a Democratic issue, it is \nnot a Republican issue. The goal of preventing nuclear proliferation \nhas been a uniting principle of the American foreign policy for \ndecades, and it must continue to be so. We must come together today to \npass this bill quickly and without opposition to demonstrate in no \nuncertain terms our unity of purpose in preventing the spread of \nnuclear weapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nGardner, for his leadership on this issue--together with the chairman \nof the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Corker--for bringing us to \nthis moment. This is a rare bipartisan moment, where the Senate has \ncome together and agreed to debate, vote, and pass an important bill \nthat imposes sanctions on one of the most dangerous regimes in the \nworld.\n  Recently, I was in Hawaii at the Pacific Command and we asked Admiral \nHarris, a four-star U.S. Navy admiral who heads Pacific Command, to \nrank the areas of the world that he was most concerned about, the \nregimes that he thought represented the biggest danger to peace. He \nlisted North Korea as No. 1.\n  That may be because of the proximity of his area of responsibility to \nNorth Korea, but there is no question an unstable leader with nuclear \nweapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles is a threat not only to \nthe region but to the United States as well.\n  We know over the weekend North Korea successfully launched a long-\nrange rocket and put a satellite into orbit. This was done in defiance \nof sanctions and represents a dangerous\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\ntrend of an increasingly hostile and unstable North Korea. It was \nparticularly alarming for several reasons.\n  First, the same technology that put that satellite in orbit can be \nused to deliver a nuclear weapon. Long-range ballistic missiles have \nthe potential to hit the U.S. homeland. That is why North Korea has \nbeen considered a serious threat to our country, not just the region \nbut our country as well. The timing of this launch was also very \nconcerning because just last month North Korea claimed it had tested \nthe components of a hydrogen bomb, a thermonuclear weapon that is more \npowerful than an atomic bomb--which we knew they had, but this \nrepresented an escalation, if it is true.\n  The idea that North Korea could soon develop advanced nuclear \nweapons, along with intercontinental ballistic missiles, and deliver \nthem to our shores is a frightening proposition. Unfortunately, every \nday we grow closer to that reality.\n  I will just pause for a minute to say this is another reason why our \nmissile defense systems are so important, not just to the safety of our \nfriends and allies but also increasingly to the United States. I know \nin Colorado a lot of those efforts are headed up to provide that \neffective deterrent and missile defense system to the threat of the \nintercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  I have to be honest with you and say I am puzzled why the President \nhasn't done more on this issue to date, but while the President sits on \nthe sidelines--I think somebody called it strategic patience--it has \nbeen a failure, not just patience. Patience I think of as a virtue but \ncertainly not in this context.\n  Nevertheless, the Senate will do its part to make sure the regime in \nNorth Korea feels some consequences for its belligerent, illegal \nactions. Today we will vote on the North Korea Sanctions and Policy \nEnhancement Act. This bill mandates new sanctions on North Korea's \nnuclear and ballistic missile program, and, importantly, it will \nprovide an overall strategy to help address North Korea's human rights \nabuses and combat its cyber activities. I don't think most people \nrealize that in addition to its belligerence and its violating \ninternational norms, North Korea is a serial human rights abuser. \nLiterally, because of its focus on its finances on military arms and \nits standing army, North Korea has seen many, many, many of its people \nstarve to death for lack of an adequate food supply. So this is a rogue \nregime, it is a dangerous regime, and one we need to make sure feels \nthe consequences of its actions.\n  This bill will help hold North Korea accountable, which is more than \nwe have seen from the administration. I want to point out that North \nKorea's provocative actions are just another symptom of the Obama \ndoctrine gone wrong. I mentioned strategic patience, which is hardly a \nstrategy for keeping the world safe.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Through his words \nand deeds, the President continues to discredit and undercut American \nleadership around the world. As a result, the world is even more \nunstable and conflict-ridden than when he assumed office. It is \nabsolutely the fact that in the absence of American leadership, \ntyrants, thugs, and bullies feel emboldened, and our friends and allies \nquestion our loyalty and whether they can rely on us or whether they \nhave to go it alone and build the capacity to defend themselves in the \nabsence of a strong America.\n  Many recall that when he ran for office, the President heavily \ncriticized the foreign policy choices of his predecessor, particularly \nthe surge in Iraq. I happened to be in the Senate during that time. I \nremember those debates. The Democratic leader, Senator Reid, said the \nsurge would never work, and many were skeptical because frankly it \nrepresented a bold dramatic move.\n  Well, not only did President Obama's decision to hastily withdraw in \nIraq after the successful surge--not only did his decision to hastily \nwithdraw from Iraq squander the hard-won progress achieved by the \nsurge, that country is now one of a number of countries in the Middle \nEast in shambles. We are seeing our friends and our allies--together \nwith American advisers on the ground, special operations forces in a \ntrain-and-assist mission--trying to regain control of cities such as \nRamadi that were won as a result of the blood and the treasure of the \nUnited States.\n  Let's look at a few things where they stand today. Over the past 2 \nyears, ISIS has captured city after city where American troops shed \nthat blood, sweat, and tears to bring relative peace. The border that \nused to exist between Syria and Iraq is gone. It has literally been \nerased. In spite of President Obama's misguided nuclear deal with Iran, \nIranian influence in Iraq has grown, not waned. I do find it \ninteresting that speaker after speaker--even though we are talking \nabout North Korea--is trying to come to the floor and speak about Iran \nafter having allowed the President's ill-advised nuclear deal to go \nthrough, which guarantees a pathway for Iran to acquire nuclear \nweapons.\n  As a result of the administration's paralysis, Syria, too, has \nplunged deeper and deeper into chaos. Now we not only have a security \nproblem on our hands, we have millions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees \ninternally displaced or flooding across international borders into \nplaces such as Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and Europe. I have visited some \nof those refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan. These people are doing \nwhat we all would do. They are fleeing for their survival because \nfrankly, once the President drew that red line in Syria, when it came \nto the use of illegal weapons, the President never did anything to \nenforce it or make sure that Bashar al-Assad felt or suffered any \nconsequences. So the President's inaction, time after time, place after \nplace, has real consequences. The vacuum left as a result of the U.S. \nretreat in the Middle East has provided an open door for other \ncountries to expand their influence there, as we have seen and as we \ncontinue to see on a daily basis.\n  Russia is the prime example. It continues to extend its influence \nthrough indiscriminate bombing campaigns that yield little regard for \ncivilian lives. The Russian bombing campaign doesn't distinguish \nbetween combatants and civilians. Russian forces are even actively \nfighting against American-backed groups and working to undermine them \nat every turn.\n  Of course this doesn't even touch on Russia's aggressive actions \nalong its own border with respect to Ukraine in NATO's \nbackyard. Unfortunately, Russia has no reason to believe that the \nUnited States, under the current leadership of the Commander in Chief, \nwill challenge it anywhere--not in the Middle East, not in Europe.\n\n  I could go on and on about other countries that are feeling \nemboldened, like a belligerent China in the South China Sea, or, as I \nmentioned a moment ago, a newly financed and emboldened Iran, the No. 1 \nstate sponsor of international terrorism. When the administration \nbasically wrote a check for $50 billion to Iran, that Secretary Kerry, \nVice President Biden, and others acknowledged could be used to finance \ninternational terrorism, it seemed to have no impact whatsoever because \nthey were so determined to cut this bad deal with Iran.\n  The point is that our retreat and our lack of leadership around the \nworld only underscore the President's lack of a larger foreign policy \nstrategy. We have asked him time and again: Please tell us what your \nstrategy is. The President sends over a proposed authorization for the \nuse of military force against ISIS, and we find out the real reason he \ndid that is not because he thinks he lacks authority to do what he is \ndoing now but because they want to tie the hands of future Presidents \nin terms of what that President could do under that authorization for \nthe use of military force. But we keep asking, and all we hear is \ncrickets--silence. We keep asking for a serious, comprehensive strategy \nto guide the foreign policy and national security efforts of the United \nStates, and the President simply doesn't feel like it is his obligation \nto deliver one, opting instead for tactics that are guaranteed not to \nwin, saying: Well, we bombed ISIS.\n  Well, that is all well and fine. But at some point, once you bomb \nISIS, unless you have somebody who can occupy that territory, the \nterrorists are going to come right back in. We have friends and allies, \nsuch as the Kurds and other countries in the Middle East that have \nsaid: Well, we will help be the boots on the ground if you will help \nsupply us,\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\nto which they are not provided any sort of answer.\n  I believe the American people do deserve better, and the men and \nwomen in uniform who have put their lives on the line deserve better. \nThey deserve a strategy. They deserve the support to be able to \naccomplish the mission their country has asked them to accomplish.\n  So I am glad that in the absence of leadership from the White House, \nthe Congress has decided to take up some of the slack here to fill the \ngap left by the President's inattention to this important issue. If the \nPresident won't step up to the plate and take these threats seriously \nenough to come up with a strategy to actually defeat them, the American \npeople can trust the Senate to address it, and we will do so today on a \nbipartisan basis, insofar as it applies to the threat in North Korea.\n  So it is my hope that we will send a strong bipartisan message to \nNorth Korea that their repeated provocations will not go unanswered.\n\n\n             Mental Health and Our Criminal Justice System\n\n  Mr. President, I just came from a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, \nwhich was one of the most unusual hearings I have attended since the \ntime I have been in the Senate--certainly on the Judiciary Committee. \nUsually on the Judiciary Committee the habit is for the majority to \nselect witnesses and then the minority gets to select witnesses, and \nthen witnesses come out and are proxy fighters for the particular \npolicy differences that members of the committee have--not today. \nToday, thanks to Chairman Grassley, the senior Senator from Iowa, the \nJudiciary Committee had a consensus panel on the subject of mental \nhealth and its intersection with our criminal justice system.\n  What we heard was that, increasingly, our jails and our prisons, our \ncriminal justice system, and the homeless that we see on our streets \nare a product of a failed policy--one that said: Yes, we need to move \npeople out of institutions and out of hospitals. But, of course, there \nis the promise--or at least it was the hope--that they would have \nsomewhere else to go to get treatment and housing and the like.\n  Today what we heard reaffirmed from the sheriff of Bexar County, TX--\nSan Antonio, my hometown--and from so many of the other witnesses from \nacross the country is that now our jails, our prisons, and the criminal \njustice systems have become de facto warehouses for the mentally ill, \ncompletely ill-suited to deal with what they need, which is treatment, \nsupervision, and help--and the families, too, who need additional tools \navailable for them to turn to when they need help with a loved one who \nhas become mentally ill.\n  So I have introduced legislation that we talked about during the \nhearing today called the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act, \nmodeled off of successful experiments and programs in places like North \nCarolina, which we heard from before, San Antonio, Virginia, and \nelsewhere. I am sure there are a number of good stories.\n  This is the way I think Congress ought to legislate, rather than to \ndream up here behind closed doors some grand scheme--the masters of the \nuniverse trying to decide what is good for all 320 million of us in a \none-size-fits-all approach. We have seen the disastrous consequences of \nthat sort of thinking. Rather than that, let's look at what has \nactually proven to work in our cities, counties, and our States, and \nthen scale that up, where appropriate, to apply more broadly after we \nhave proven that it actually works. That is what my legislation, the \nMental Health and Safe Communities Act, is designed to do.\n  As we will look--I believe tomorrow--in the Judiciary Committee at \nthe opioid and heroin crisis that is being experienced in so many parts \nof our country and as we look, as we have, at reforming our prison \nsystems to provide more incentives for people who are low-risk and mid-\nlevel offenders, if they will accept the opportunity to help themselves \nto deal with their underlying drug or alcohol problem, to learn a \nskill, to get a GED, to better prepare for life on the outside based on \nthe experiences in Texas and elsewhere, we can actually lower crime \nrates, lower recidivism rates, and save taxpayers a lot of money.\n  So whether it is dealing with the mental health issue and its \nintersection with the criminal justice system or dealing with our \nprison system, which used to believe that rehabilitation was an \nimportant part of what their obligation was, or dealing with this \nopioid and heroin abuse, we have a lot to do to make sure that our \ncriminal justice system is brought into the 21st century and that we no \nlonger punish people who mainly need help.\n  As somebody who is a recovering member of the Texas judiciary for 13 \nyears, I certainly believe there are some people whom you can't help \nand whom you must punish. But there is a large segment of people--\nwhether it is drug or alcohol related, or whether it is mental health \nissues--who will accept our help and will turn their lives around if \ngiven that opportunity.\n  I just wanted to say a few words about that because I feel so \nstrongly about the importance of what we talked about at that hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas for the work \nhe is doing on the Judiciary Committee. I hope we can continue in that \nbipartisan spirit to deal with addiction and, I hope, improvements in \nour criminal justice system, providing resources to people who have \naddiction needs. I know there is a strong bipartisan effort to deal \nwith community mental health so we can get services in our community. \nThis is not a partisan issue. I am glad to see that the work by the \nJudiciary Committee is productive in trying to lead to those \nconclusions.\n  I do want to, though, comment a little bit on what was said in \nregards to the Obama administration. We are here together with a bill \non North Korea that is not partisan at all. Democrats and Republicans \nare working together. There is no division between Congress and the \nWhite House. We all believe we have to isolate North Korea and its \nconduct. The administration has been very strong in actions in the \nUnited Nations, keeping us closely informed, and we very much want to \nwork with a strong, united voice. That is how we keep our country the \nstrongest, and that is what we should do on national security. So let \nme just try to fill in the record a little bit from the previous \ncomments made about the Obama administration.\n  Let us remember that the Obama administration took over after, I \nwould say, a failed policy in the Middle East in which we went into \nAfghanistan--as we should have because of the attack on our country. \nBut before completing Afghanistan, the previous administration went \ninto Iraq, using our military first rather than looking for a solution \nthat would provide the type of stability in that region to prevent the \nspread of radicalization. Instead, governments were formed that didn't \nrepresent all of the communities, and we saw splinter groups formed and \nthe recruitment for extreme elements.\n  President Obama was able to develop international coalitions to work \ntogether. I think America is always best when we lead and we can be \njoined by the international community. The President also understood \nthat it shouldn't be up to America's military to solve all of the \nproblems, that there is not a military solution to the spread of \nradicalization, that internal support in the countries must come from \nthe countries themselves, that we do not want to be seen as a \nconquering power, and that it is for the region to defend itself. Yes, \nwe will help, but we are not going to put our ground troops in a \nsituation where they are used as a recruitment for radical forces. We \nalso understand that America leads best when we can get our ideals of \ngood governance with governments that represent all the communities so \nthere is no void. President Obama and his administration have been very \nstrong in those areas.\n  With regard to dealing with ISIL, the radical forces that exist \ntoday, a policy is well understood: Cut off their support. Cut off \ntheir support in regards to recruitment by having representative \ngovernments. Cut off their support by dealing with their oil supplies \nand their looting and extortion. Cut off their support by taking back \nterritory in a way that we can control that territory. That is what we \nhave seen happening, certainly in the last several months, as territory \nthat was formally\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nheld by ISIL is now being held by the Government of Iraq, particularly, \nbut also Syria.\n  So I just wanted to correct on this day when we are bringing up the \nNorth Korea bill, that every President since the Korean War has had \nchallenges in dealing with the problems in North Korea and that we are \ntogether on this issue as a Congress and as a Nation to isolate North \nKorea. It is not just their nuclear weapon program. As I pointed out \nearlier, it is their cyber attacks, their human rights violations, and \nall those issues to which we are speaking with a very strong voice \ntoday. I hope that as Democrats and Republicans, the House and Senate, \nthe President and Congress speak with a strong, unified voice, \nAmerica's national security interests will be better served.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, throughout this debate we continue to \nremind the people around America that this North Korea Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act is not intended to bow to the people of North \nKorea. Rather, our efforts are to try to help ensure that we are doing \neverything we can to help stand up for the people of North Korea, to \ngive them the kinds of economic opportunities and freedoms from which \nthey have been deprived by this regime under Kim Jong Un.\n  Today's sanctions act and the mandatory sanctions that will be levied \nhere today by this act, if adopted and signed by the President--which I \nbelieve it will be with the overwhelming bipartisan support that it \nhas--are about the Kim Jong Un regime itself. This is about a forgotten \nmaniac in North Korea who has deprived his people of economic \nopportunity, who has imprisoned 200,000 men, women, and children, who \nhas tortured his people, and who has assassinated members of his own \ninner circle and leadership. Today in the morning papers, an article \noutlined the death of his chief of staff of the army--again, the \ncontinued purge of top-level officials under the Kim Jong Un regime.\n  You can see the situation the people of North Korea are facing each \nand every day. This is a satellite image of the Korean Peninsula at \nnighttime. You can see the developments in South Korea, and you can see \nSeoul, Korea. There are millions of people who live right across the \nDMZ. And you can see the conditions the people of North Korea are \nsuffering under--an economy that has failed, an economy that has failed \nto develop to give them the same kinds of opportunities other people in \nthe Korean Peninsula are sharing.\n  This bill also promotes human rights. I want to point out section \n301. This section requires the President to study the feasibility of \nbringing unmonitored and inexpensive cellular and Internet \ncommunications to the people of North Korea and trying to break through \nthe emptiness of North Korea--the communication barriers, the \nfirewalls--to try to get around the North Korean regime that doesn't \nwant the people of North Korea to understand they can live better \nlives.\n  Section 302 directs the Secretary of State to develop a comprehensive \nstrategy to promote human rights in North Korea and combat its forced \nlabor practices, including a diplomatic outreach plan and a public \ndiplomacy awareness campaign, what we can do together to try to bring \nawareness to North Koreans. Let them know that if they have family \nmembers in South Korea--what kind of opportunities people in South \nKorea are sharing.\n  It wasn't that long ago--a few decades ago--that North Korea had a \nmore vibrant economy than South Korea, but that is certainly not the \ncase today. If you stand on this line, if you stand on the DMZ and you \nlook north into North Korea, you see the hillsides that have been \ncompletely deforested and all of the vegetation removed because people \nlacked food in North Korea, so they cut down the trees and created wood \nsoup so they would have something to fill their stomachs because the \nNorth Korean regime of Kim Jong Un failed do so. You look at the south, \nand you can see the hills, vegetation, development, prosperity. We can \nhelp bring peace to the peninsula with the passage of this act today.\n  I know my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, is coming to \nthe floor today. He has been a great leader when it comes to North \nKorea, a great leader when it comes to the issue of human rights, and \nhe has worked with me on this legislation. I worked with him to make \nsure we created a bipartisan solution to this great challenge that is \nNorth Korea today. I commend Senator Menendez for the work and the \nopportunity to present the bipartisan solution before the Senate today.\n  I yield back and will listen to the words of Senator Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me first start off by thanking the \nleadership of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Chairman Corker \nand Ranking Member Cardin, for creating the environment to have strong \nbipartisan legislation on a critical issue that affects the national \ninterests and security of the United States and beyond that, in \ngeneral, creating a strong bipartisan environment that I think is \ncritical to U.S. foreign policy. It is a tone I tried to set when I had \nthe privilege of being the chairman and Senator Corker was the ranking \nmember, and I appreciate his leadership in continuing in the same \nspirit, and, of course, Senator Cardin, who worked very hard on \nmaintaining that environment. I appreciate that they created the \nwherewithal to bring us here today.\n  I also thank Senator Gardner, the East Asia Subcommittee chairman, \nfor working with me to bring legislation in which we can come together \nin a strong bipartisan voice because when the Nation speaks with one \nvoice, it speaks most powerfully to both friends and foes across the \nworld. It has been a privilege to work with Senator Gardner and to see \nhis vision of how we deal with this and merge my vision of how we deal \nwith it, and together I think we have come up with the most \ncomprehensive strategic effort to deal with North Korea. I want to \nsalute him, and I thank him for working with me.\n  Given the North Korean regime's recent test of what most agree is a \nballistic missile--what U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon \ncharacterized as ``deeply deplorable'' and in violation of Security \nCouncil resolutions--one thing is abundantly clear when you look at \nthis photograph: It is time to take North Korea seriously.\n  For too many years, the standard response of Republican and \nDemocratic administrations alike whenever North Korea stages a \nprovocation has been to dismiss the seriousness of the threat. We tend \nto see it as a strange regime seemingly disconnected from geopolitical \nreality, something of a parallel universe that doesn't function in the \nsame way as the rest of the international community, a strange regime \nrun by crazy leaders and certain to collapse any day, that there is no \nneed to worry, it will not and it can't survive.\n  Well, four nuclear tests, three Kims, two violations of U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions, and one attempt by North Korea to transfer nuclear \ntechnology to Syria later, it is clearly time for the United States to \nstart taking the North Korea challenge seriously.\n  In fact, today it is estimated that North Korea has accumulated \nenough fissile material for more than a dozen nuclear weapons. It has \nnow conducted four nuclear explosive tests, as you can see from this \nchart, starting in October of 2006, and with it, the quake magnitude \nhas risen with virtually every test. It has developed a modern gas \ncentrifuge uranium enrichment program to go along with its plutonium \nstockpile. It has tested ballistic missiles. It is seeking to develop \nthe capability to match a nuclear warhead to an intercontinental \nballistic missile.\n  Kim Jong Un has consolidated his grip on power, and he seems \ndetermined to proceed on a course of ``byungjin,'' Kim Jong Un's policy \nthat strengthens both his military and his economy as opposed to \nstrengthening one or the other.\n  Taken together, these developments present a growing danger that \ncould set North Korea on a path to becoming a small nuclear power. It \nis a scenario which could lead other nations in the region to \nreconsider their own commitments to nonproliferation, and it could \nembolden North Korea in its relations with other bad actors such as \nSyria and Iran.\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\n  I know it has been referenced, but I think it is worthy that when the \nDirector of National Intelligence--the person in charge of amassing all \nof our intelligence as a country--James Clapper, in testimony before \nthe Armed Services Committee, says the following, it is worth \nrepeating:\n\n       North Korea's export of ballistic missiles and associated \n     materials to several countries, including Iran and Syria, and \n     its assistance to Syria's construction of a nuclear reactor, \n     destroyed in 2007, illustrates its willingness to proliferate \n     dangerous technologies.\n\n  Director Clapper went on to say that following North Korea's third \nnuclear test, Pyongyang said it would ``refurbish and restart'' its \nnuclear facilities, to include the uranium enrichment facility at \nYongbyon--shut down in 2007--and that it has followed through by \nexpanding its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restarting the plutonium \nproduction reactor which has been online long enough to begin \nrecovering plutonium from spent fuels within weeks or maybe months.\n  He told the committee:\n\n       Pyongyang is also committed to developing a long-range, \n     nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct \n     threat to the United States; it has publicly displayed its \n     KN08 road-mobile ICBM on multiple occasions. We assess that \n     North Korea has already taken initial steps toward fielding \n     this system.\n\n  Finally, according to the Director of National Intelligence:\n\n       North Korea probably remains capable and willing to launch \n     disruptive or destructive cyberattacks to support its \n     political objectives.\n\n  Although it hasn't received the attention it deserved during today's \ndebate, the Gardner-Menendez substitute addresses the cyber security \nthreat with robust sanctions against those who control North Korea's \ncyber warfare apparatus. The adoption of the Gardner-Menendez \nlegislation creates a new policy framework that combines effective \nsanctions and effective military countermeasures that can stop North \nKorea's nuclear ambitions, address cyber security issues, and bring \nsome sanity back to the political calculus--a new policy framework that \nleaves no doubt about our determination to neutralize any threat North \nKorea may present, with robust, realistic diplomacy toward the clear \ngoal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\n  This bipartisan bill, approved unanimously by the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee in January, expands and tightens enforcement of \nsanctions from North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development \nand other destructive activities of the Kim regime. It requires the \nPresident to investigate sanctionable conduct, including proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, arms-related materials, luxury goods, \nhuman rights abuses, activities undermining cyber security, and the \nprovision of industrial materials, such as precious metals or coal, for \nuse in a tailored set of activities, including weapons of mass \ndestruction proliferation activities or for use in prison and labor \ncamps.\n  Under our substitute, the President is mandated to sanction any \nperson found to have materially contributed to, engaged in, or \nfacilitated any of those above activities. Penalties would include the \nseizure of assets, visa bans, and denial of government contracts.\n  To provide some flexibility, we have ensured that this and future \nadministrations retain the discretionary authority to sanction any \nentity or person transferring or facilitating the transfer of financial \nassets and property of the North Korean regime.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to determine \nwhether North Korea is a primary money laundering concern, and if such \na determination is made, assets may be blocked and special measures \napplied against those involved.\n  From a strategic perspective, the bill would promote a strategy to \nimprove implementation and enforcement of multilateral sanctions, a \nstrategy to combat North Korean cyber activities, and a strategy to \npromote and encourage international engagement on North Korean human \nrights-related issues. There are reporting requirements relating to \nthese strategies as well as a report on political prison camps and a \nfeasibility study on providing communications equipment to the people \nof North Korea so we can permeate the opportunity for information to \nflow to the people of North Korea.\n  Last but not least, under the Gardner-Menendez substitute, the State \nDepartment is required to expand the scope and frequency of travel \nwarnings for North Korea.\n  That is what we think about most of the time when we think about \nNorth Korea, but there is another dimension beyond nuclear challenges, \nmissile challenges, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nthat is the concern that there remain serious, unanswered questions \nabout human rights and the lot of the North Korean people. We need only \nread headlines like the ones on this chart: ``Life in a North Korean \nLabor Camp: `No Thinking . . . Just Fear' ''; ``Kim's former bodyguard \ntells of beatings, starvation in North Korean prison camp''; ``North \nKorean prison camp is one of the most evil places on earth--home to \n20,000.''\n  Under the rule of Kim Jong Un, North Korea is one of the most harshly \nrepressive countries in the world. All basic freedoms have been \nseverely restricted under the Kim family's political dynasty. A 2014 \nU.N. Commission of Inquiry found that abuses in North Korea were \nwithout parallel in any other country. Extermination, murder, \nenslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions, and \nunspeakable sexual violence are part of the ongoing story of this \nbizarre regime.\n  We know that North Korea operates a series of secretive prison camps \nwhere opponents of the government are sent and are tortured and abused, \nstarved on insufficient rations, and forced into hard labor. Collective \npunishment is used to silence dissent and instill fear in the North \nKorean people that they could be next. The country has no independent \nmedia. It has no functioning civil society, and there is, of course, \nnot even a hint of religious freedom except for the bizarre worship of \nthe line from which Kim Jong Un hails. That is the reality, making it \nabundantly clear that, though security concerns may be our most \nimportant priority on the Peninsula, they are not and should not be our \nonly priority.\n\n  The legislation we are proposing creates for the first time the basis \nin law to designate and sanction North Korea for its human rights \nviolations. Such sanctions would elevate human rights and the \nfundamental issue of human dignity to be as important as nuclear \nweapons and ballistic missiles.\n  At the end of the day, there is no basis for successfully dealing \nwith the North, absent a solid foundation for a policy that is rooted \nin the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In President Park we have an \nimportant partner. I have visited South Korea and met with President \nPark. He is someone we can easily consult with and work closely with to \nchart out a future course in dealing with North Korea. Our partnership \nwith Japan presents new opportunities for building a more effective \napproach to dealing with Pyongyang.\n  Whatever one's views on the various U.S. policy efforts of the past 2 \ndecades--what has worked, what has not worked, and why--there can be \nlittle question that these efforts have failed to end North Korea's \nnuclear ambitions or end its missile programs. They have failed to \nreduce the threat posed by North Korea to our allies, failed to \nalleviate the suffering of North Korea's people, and failed to lead to \ngreater security in the region.\n  Let me be clear. I have no illusions that there are easy answers when \nit comes to dealing with a regime like North Korea. With the passage of \nthis legislation, we have acted in concert not only in a bipartisan \neffort but with our values, and we will have established a policy for \ndealing with an unpredictable, rogue regime equal to the challenge. I \nurge this body to have a unanimous vote. It is not enough to condemn \nNorth Korea's provocation, which is, by all accounts, a violation of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions and international will. It is not \nenough to convene the United Nations Security Council for another round \nof hollow rhetoric that does nothing to the Kim regime but signal a \nlack of international commitment to enforcing international will. It is \nnot enough to do what we have always done and minimize the obvious \nthreat from a rogue state living in its own false reality.\n  As the coauthor of the sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable, I know that the sanctions regime we are structuring here can \nhave a real effect.\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\nThose who want to deal with North Korea and North Korea's pursuit of \nmissile technology and nuclear weapons will see a consequence to them \nfar beyond North Korea. With this bipartisan legislation, we have \nbefore us a series of meaningful steps that speak the only language \nNorth Korea's regime can understand: aggressive, material consequences \nfor aggressive, reckless provocations.\n  This legislation is the most comprehensive strategy to deal with the \nchallenge that North Korea presents. The launch over the weekend and \nrecent nuclear tests makes it clear that when I introduced this bill \nlast year, it was timely then. We didn't get to act on it then, but we \ncan do so now.\n  I urge the Senate, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, to unanimously pass the North Korea Sanctions and Policy \nEnhancement Act. I urge my colleagues in the other Chamber to concur, \nand I look forward to the President quickly signing this legislation \ninto law.\n  If the international community is serious about meeting the threat \nthat North Korea poses, we should see measures like this act adopted by \nthe United Nations and implemented by all of its member states. The \ninternational community should stand together with a single voice and \none clear message: Any provocation will be met with consequences that \nwill shake the Kim regime to its foundation. That is the opportunity we \nhave to set the course here today in the Senate. I think one of the \nmost powerful moments is when the Senate acts in a strong, bipartisan \nfashion that sends a message that will create a ripple effect not only \nhere but across the world.\n  I look forward to what I hope will be an incredibly robust, if not \nunanimous, vote on this legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gardner and Chairman Corker \nfor their leadership and tireless efforts within the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in dealing with the national security challenges posed by \nNorth Korea.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I periodically \nreceive intelligence briefings on North Korea's military capacity and \nthe political will of North Korea's leaders to threaten the United \nStates and our interests abroad. Based on these briefings and the \nextensive intelligence in forming them, I believe we need to embrace an \n``all of the above'' approach to confront North Korea's continued \ndevelopment of ballistic missile, nuclear, and cyber technologies. \nThese threats have become too serious to ignore and far too complex to \nconfront with anything short of a coordinated strategy that is prepared \nto employ the full force of the United States Government, including all \nof our diplomatic, intelligence, economic, and military resources.\n  As Americans, it can be easy for us to forget just how lucky we are \nto live in a free and open society. Most of us, myself included, simply \nhave no idea of what it is like to live under a totalitarian regime \nlike the one that has kept North Koreans in a state of impoverished \nservitude, cut off from the rest of the world for generations. But \nevery so often the mask slips, and there is an event that gives the \nworld a clue about what can happen when a nation-state operates and \nthrives behind a veil of mystery and secrecy. For me, and many of my \nfellow Utahans, one of these clues came nearly 12 years ago when a \nyoung man from Utah suddenly went missing in southern China.\n  In August 2004, David Louis Sneddon disappeared while hiking in the \nYunnan Province of China. He was 24 years old at the time and a student \nat Brigham Young University in Provo, UT. Having spent his summer \nstudying Mandarin in Beijing, David wrote to his family about his plans \nto hike the scenic Tiger Leaping Gorge along the Jinsha River in \nsouthern China. That was the last time David's family would ever hear \nfrom him. His passport and credit cards were never used again; they \nwere never seen again. David Sneddon was never seen again.\n  What happened to David Sneddon? To my knowledge he is the first \nAmerican since the 1970s to go missing in China without an explanation. \nWhat happened to him? How can a young man, who is skilled in a \ncountry's language and knowledgeable of their culture, simply vanish \nwithout a trace?\n  These questions have answers. For more than a decade, David's family \nmembers, friends, and loved ones, as well as regional experts, \nreporters, and embassy personnel have searched for those answers in \nvain. For their part, local authorities point to the Jinsha River for \nanswers. They contend that the lack of physical evidence surrounding \nDavid's disappearance could indicate that he fell and was swept away by \nthe river, despite the fact that his body was never found. Well, it is \ncertainly possible for that to happen to an unsuspecting tourist hiking \non unfamiliar terrain, but David was not a novice outdoorsman by any \nstretch of the word. He was an Eagle Scout and an avid hiker who had \nyears of experience trekking over rugged landscapes across the American \nWest.\n  In recent years investigational reporters and regional experts have \nsuggested an alternative explanation of David's disappearance. For \ninstance, on April 25, 2013, Melanie Kirkpatrick, a senior fellow at \nthe Hudson Institute and a well-regarded expert on North Korea, wrote \nan excellent article in the Wall Street Journal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the The Wall Street Journal, April 25, 2013]\n\n         North Korea's Kidnappers and the Fate of David Sneddon\n\n                        (By Melanie Kirkpatrick)\n\n       North Korea's recent bellicosity seems to have subsided for \n     the moment, but the regime's malign practices continue. The \n     United Nations Human Rights Council last month established an \n     international commission of inquiry into what it describes as \n     North Korea's ``systematic, widespread and grave violations \n     of human rights.'' The commission's mandate includes \n     examining North Korea's abductions of foreigners and the \n     likelihood that some victims are imprisoned in the North. \n     Pyongyang is believed to have kidnapped nationals of at least \n     12 countries.\n       One such victim may be an American citizen. David Sneddon \n     disappeared in China in August 2004, when he was a 24-year-\n     old student at Brigham Young University. He was vacationing \n     in Yunnan Province after completing several months of study \n     at Beijing International University and before returning to \n     the U.S. for his senior year. Speaking in Tokyo last month \n     about Mr. Sneddon's disappearance, Keiji Furuya, Japanese \n     minister of state for the abduction issue, told me: ``It is \n     most probable that a U.S. national has been abducted to North \n     Korea.''\n       The charge that an American citizen was likely kidnapped by \n     North Korea is noteworthy in and of itself. It is even more \n     so coming from a cabinet-rank member of the Japanese \n     government about a citizen of another country. The minister \n     added: ``I would not like to speak further about it because \n     it would be an intervention in the domestic affairs of the \n     United States.''\n       Japan is in a unique position to evaluate North Korea's \n     kidnapping operation, having investigated it for more than 30 \n     years. North Korean agents infiltrated Japan in the 1970s and \n     1980s, snatched Japanese citizens and took them back to North \n     Korea. Japanese traveling in Europe were also kidnapped. \n     North Korea forced the abductees to teach Japanese language \n     and customs at its spy schools so that its agents could \n     travel the world posing as Japanese nationals.\n       In 2002, the late dictator Kim Jong II admitted to the \n     visiting Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, that \n     North Korea had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens. Kim did so in \n     the expectation that his confession would pave the way for \n     the normalization of relations with Japan. The move could \n     have had the salutary effect for North Korea of attracting \n     Japanese investment and reducing North Korea's economic \n     dependence on China. Instead, Kim's confession inflamed \n     Japanese public opinion and made normalization impossible.\n       North Korea allowed five of the abductees to go home. It \n     said the other eight victims had died, but the death \n     certificates supplied by Pyongyang were found to be fake. \n     Japan believes those eight victims--as well as others whom \n     Kim Jong II did not acknowledge--are alive in North Korea.\n       In recent years, Pyongyang's kidnappers have turned their \n     attention to China, where they have abducted South Korean \n     humanitarian workers. The South Koreans were targeted because \n     of their work helping North Koreans escape on an underground \n     railroad across China to eventual sanctuary in Seoul.\n       This brings us back to David Sneddon. In addition to \n     speaking Chinese, Mr. Sneddon is fluent in Korean, having \n     spent two years in South Korea as a Mormon missionary. This \n     unusual linguistic ability may have thrown suspicion on him. \n     The Sneddon family believes that David was kidnapped by North \n     Korean agents who mistakenly thought he was helping North \n     Korean defectors. Yunnan\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\n     Province, which borders Laos, Burma and Vietnam, is along the \n     underground railroad's usual route out of China. North Korean \n     security agents are known to operate there, apparently with \n     Beijing's permission.\n       At the time of David's disappearance in August 2004, China \n     told the Sneddon family that its investigation had concluded \n     that the young man likely had a fatal mishap while hiking \n     through Tiger Leap Gorge. That theory was disproved by facts \n     uncovered by David's father and two of his brothers three \n     weeks after he went missing. The three Sneddons retraced the \n     young man's steps in Yunnan and found witnesses who reported \n     seeing him during and after his hike through the gorge.\n       The Sneddons have had their share of frustrations in \n     dealing with the U.S. State Department. A senior diplomat \n     wrote the family last year that ``Under the Privacy Act, we \n     are not permitted to release any information about David's \n     case unless we have his written consent to do so.'' The \n     diplomat noted a health-or-safety exception but only if the \n     family ``has convincing information as to where the U.S. \n     citizen is located or what his/her condition may be.''\n       ``We're living a Catch-22,'' says David's brother, Michael \n     Sneddon. ``If our family had `convincing information' as to \n     David's whereabouts, David would no longer be missing. It's \n     absurd.'' The Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in \n     North Korea plans to file a Freedom of Information Act \n     request for information on actions the State Department has \n     taken on the Sneddon case, says executive director Greg \n     Scarlatoiu.\n       The Sneddons refute speculation that David may have \n     disappeared voluntarily. He had purchased a plane ticket \n     home, put a down payment on his student housing for the fall \n     semester, and made arrangements to take the LSAT exam for \n     entry to law school. His Beijing roommate, who traveled with \n     him until a few days before his disappearance, says David was \n     planning to go home.\n       Last year, a Tokyo-based research organization published a \n     report citing new evidence that North Korea kidnapped Mr. \n     Sneddon. A source in China told the National Association for \n     the Rescue of Japanese Abducted by North Korea that in August \n     2004--the date of his disappearance--Yunnan provincial police \n     arrested an American university student who was helping North \n     Korean refugees. A second Chinese source told the Japanese \n     researchers that the Yunnan police handed over the American \n     to North Korean security agents. In both cases, personal \n     details about the unnamed student correspond with facts known \n     about David Sneddon. Seven Japanese parliamentarians traveled \n     to Washington last May to present this evidence to the State \n     Department and Congress.\n       For one former Japanese intelligence official, the Sneddon \n     disappearance is a case of deja vu. The official, who asked \n     not to be identified by name, compares it to the abduction \n     cases he tracked in the 1970s and 1980s. ``The evidence is \n     always fragmented and isolated,'' he says. Until Kim Jong II \n     confessed to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens, he notes, some \n     in the Japanese government refused to acknowledge the \n     abductions for fear of alienating Pyongyang. The former \n     intelligence official has looked at the Sneddon evidence and \n     believes there is a strong possibility that North Korea \n     kidnapped the American.\n       The U.N. commission of inquiry will spend one year \n     gathering and evaluating information on North Korea's \n     abductions. Let's hope it discovers what happened to all \n     those who disappeared--including the American David Sneddon.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Kirkpatrick's research shows that David's \ndisappearance in China fits the pattern of foreign national kidnappings \nby North Korea in East Asia since the 1970s. While this might sound \nstrange to Americans--because it is indeed strange to us as Americans--\nit is an issue with which the people of Japan and South Korea are \ntragically all too familiar.\n  The circumstances of David's disappearance add a level of credibility \nto this theory. For instance, the area where David was traveling is a \nwell-known thoroughfare on an underground railroad for North Korean \ndissidents trying to escape to Southeast Asia. As a result, this area \nis monitored and patrolled by North Korean Government agents who were \ninvolved in the capture of a high-level North Korean defector and his \nfamily in the area only months before August 2004.\n  David was fluent in Korean, thanks to having spent 2 years serving a \nmission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South \nKorea. He matched the profile of activists in this area who were \nthought to be assisting North Korean escapees.\n  In a coincidental twist of fate, David disappeared only a month after \nCharles Robert Jenkins, an Army deserter, was released by the North \nKorean Government after having spent nearly 40 years imprisoned in the \ntotalitarian state, forced to teach English to North Korean \nintelligence agents. An American who spoke fluent Korean would be an \nattractive replacement for Charles Jenkins.\n  Three weeks after his disappearance, David's father and two of his \nfour brothers traveled to China and retraced David's planned steps \nthrough the Tiger Leaping Gorge. The results of their factfinding \nmission, including their conversations with local residents, \nbusinesses, tour guides, and travelers have been shared with the State \nDepartment and detailed in an excellent piece by Chris Vogel published \nin Outside Magazine in 2014.\n  One of the most compelling pieces of evidence discovered by David's \nfather and brothers is that several people, including a trail guide who \nhad been hiking the Tiger Leaping Gorge around the time of his \ndisappearance, remember interacting with a young man fitting David \nSneddon's description. David's family also met with the owner of a \nsmall Korean restaurant in the city of Shangri-La, a bustling tourist \noutpost with a convenient access to the Tiger Leaping Gorge. When she \nsaw a photograph of David, the young restaurant owner lit up. She \nimmediately remembered David, and for good reason. Not only did David \nstand out because of his fluency in Korean, but he reportedly visited \nthe restaurant on three separate occasions over the course of 2 days \nwhile he was in that city.\n  Indeed, according to the Outside Magazine article, the last time \nanyone saw David, which was on August 14, 2004, he was reportedly \nleaving a Korean restaurant. At first glance, this may seem like a \nminor detail, but seen in the right light, it is, in fact, an ominous \nclue.\n  According to many regional experts, there is a historical pattern of \nNorth Korean agents using Korean-run restaurants in China, Japan, and \nelsewhere to prey on their targets for kidnapping and abduction. \nDespite these reports, there have been no further or more fruitful \nleads regarding David's whereabouts. People move away or change their \nstories. Embassy and State Department staff move to different \nassignments, and the trail grows cold.\n  For nearly 12 years, along with his family, we have been looking for \nDavid. There are many people who deserve credit for the contributions \nthey made to this effort. In particular, I wish to thank Ambassador \nRobert King, the special envoy for North Korean human rights issues and \na longtime personal friend of mine, as well as his office, for the \nattention they have given to David's case and the good-faith efforts \nthey have made over the years to try to find answers. I commend \nAmbassador King for his work on this complex, sensitive, and very \nimportant issue.\n  There is still work yet to be done. An upstanding American citizen is \nstill missing, and an aggrieved family--indeed, an entire community--\ncontinues to wait and pray for a resolution, which is what brings us \nhere today.\n  The first and most important responsibility of the United States \nGovernment is to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people \nat home and abroad. When American citizens travel overseas, the State \nDepartment plays a critical role in fulfilling this core constitutional \nduty.\n\n  The amendment I am filing today--which I plan to submit as a stand-\nalone resolution with Senators Hatch, Fischer, and Sasse--gives the \nsense of the Senate that the State Department, in conjunction with the \nintelligence community, should continue to fulfill that obligation to \nDavid Sneddon and his family. A companion bill will be introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by my friend Congressman Chris Stewart and \nthe rest of the Utah delegation.\n  The State Department's responsibilities in this matter include \ninvestigating all plausible explanations behind David's disappearance \nand leaving no stone unturned in trying to return one of our brothers \nto his family.\n  At the time of his disappearance, David had his whole life ahead of \nhim. In fact, he was already planning for it. Before setting out to \nhike the Tiger Leaping Gorge on that fateful day in August of 2004, \nDavid had signed up to take the law school admissions test--the first \nstep toward applying to law school, he had arranged business meetings \nback home in Utah to get an early start on pursuing his dreams of \nentrepreneurship, and, eager to get back to\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nBYU's beautiful campus, he had already paid for his student housing for \nthe upcoming fall semester, but he never had the chance to do any of \nthose things, and the Sneddon family deserves to know why.\n  The greatest threat to totalitarian regimes in any part of the world \nis the truth; that the world may learn of the horrors they perpetrate \nevery day against their own people and that their people may learn that \nthere is a world full of freedom and opportunity beyond the ironclad \nborders of their enslaved homeland.\n  It is in pursuit of the truth--about David Sneddon's whereabouts--\nthat I file this amendment today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Customs and Trade Enforcement Legislation\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about a \nmatter that will come before the Senate tomorrow when the Senate votes \non whether to invoke cloture on the customs and trade enforcement \nconference report.\n  Last year, Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers of the Congress \ncame together and said it was time for a fresh policy on international \ntrade--a fresh, modern policy that I describe as trade done right. At \nthe heart of trade done right is a tougher, smarter plan to fight the \ntrade cheats who are ripping off American jobs.\n  Now, the inventiveness of these ripoff artists takes our breath away. \nIt is something I know a fair amount about because a few years back, as \nchairman of the Trade Subcommittee, we put together a sting operation \nand in effect invited those ripoff artists from around the world to \ncheat, and we were just flooded--flooded with those who were interested \nin skirting the laws. They have extraordinarily inventive ways of \nmoving their operations, concealing their identities, and shipping \ntheir products into our country through shadowy, untraceable routes. \nSometimes sneaking illegal imports into this country is as simple as \nslapping a new label on a box. We call it merchandise laundering, and \nwe saw it again and again and again as we conducted this sting \noperation.\n  So it is long past time to come up with a new and tough approach to \nenforcing our trade laws. In my view that is what this debate is about \nand that is what the vote will be about tomorrow.\n  The lingo of trade policy, as we call it, TPA--the trade promotion \nauthority--what are the rules for trade and then the various agreements \nand what, of course, is being considered now, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--it is hard to keep track of this lingo under the best of \ncircumstances. I think in beginning this discussion, what I want to \nnote for the Senate is this is not--not--about the consideration of a \nnew trade agreement. No trade agreement--no new trade agreement--is \ngoing to be considered by the Senate this week. What this debate is \nabout is whether the Senate is going to put in place tougher, smarter, \nmore modern trade enforcement policies, and when we have these \npolicies, actually follow up on them and stand up to anybody around the \nworld who is trying to figure out a way to get around them. My view is \nthat tough, smart trade enforcement ought to be a priority for every \nSenator, no matter how they choose to vote on a particular new trade \nagreement.\n  My bottom line is that past trade policies were too old, too slow or \ntoo weak to keep up with the trade cheats, but that is what this \nlegislation is going to change. This legislation says those days are \nover.\n  I wish to take just a few minutes to describe why I believe this \npackage we will vote on is the strongest set of trade enforcement \npolicies the Congress has considered in decades.\n  At its core, what trade law enforcement is all about is rooting out \nthe universe of scofflaw tactics that the cheats rely on. They use \nfraudulent records and shell games and sophisticated schemes to evade \nduties and undercut our American producers. Foreign governments bully \nAmerican businesses into relocating factories and jobs are turning over \nlucrative intellectual property. They spy on American companies and \ntrade enforcers, steal secrets, and then they lie about it in the \naftermath, and they try to undercut American industries so quickly that \nour Nation has been unable to act before the economic damage is done.\n  With the vote we are going to cast this week, we have an opportunity \nto say strongly and loudly that we are done sitting back and just \nwatching our companies get their clock cleaned by trade cheats. This \ncountry is going to take trade enforcement to a new level to protect \nworkers and businesses in Oregon and nationwide.\n  In my view, the center of this effort is the ENFORCE Act, which goes \nafter what I consider to be one of the biggest of the trade loopholes; \nthat is, merchandise laundering. This is a proposal that a number of \nSenators have worked for years to get enacted. What it will do is put a \nstop to the evasion of duties that are put in place to protect our \nworkers, protect our manufacturers, and particularly when it comes to \nthe steel industry, a pillar of American industry. The ENFORCE Act \nought to be understood to be clearly a priority matter for those who \nwork in the steel industry and the companies for which they work.\n  Second, the legislation, once and for all, closes a truly offensive \nloophole that allowed products made with slave and child labor to be \nimported to the United States. My friend Senator Brown has championed \nthis issue. He and I believe that in 2016 and beyond, the Congress \ncannot allow for the perpetrators of slave or child labor to have any \nplace in the American economy. So the old system that leaves the door \nopen to child or slave labor, if it is used to make a product that \nisn't made in the United States, that system has to end and with this \nlegislation it will. The old system essentially said that when it came \nto child labor, in the past, economics would trump human rights. \nEconomics just mattered more than protecting vulnerable children. \nSenator Brown said: No way. That is a grotesque set of priorities. And \nwe closed that loophole. It is closed, once and for all.\n  Another major upgrade in this trade package is what I call an unfair \ntrade alert. I have heard for years and years from union leaders, from \ncompanies and others that the trade cheats often try to exploit the \nfact that trade law enforcement moves along at a snail's pace. What \nhappens is that the rip-off artists break the rules. They hope the \ndamage is going to be done before anybody in Washington catches on. \nThat way the factory lights go out at the plant, and the plant is \nshuttered before our country does anything about it. What we have done \nwith this new unfair trade alert system is to ensure that there are \ngoing to be warning bells going off long before the damage is done.\n\n  Next, the package includes an important initiative from Senator \nStabenow to mobilize the institutions of government into a permanent \nongoing enforcement center so that we have all hands on deck to fight \nthe trade cheats. With Senator Stabenow's proposal we are going to make \nsure that when it comes to fighting the trade cheats, the left hand and \nright hand are working in Congress.\n  The package creates a new trust fund for trade enforcement developed \nby Senator Cantwell to drive America's investment in fresh ideas and do \nit in a way that will help protect our workers and businesses.\n  The proposal also ensures small businesses and their employees are \ngoing to be able to find an easier path into the winners' circle on \ninternational trade. It is going to lower the cost for a lot of small \nbusinesses in Oregon and nationwide that import products into our \ncountry. For my home State, this effort led by Senator Shaheen, who has \ndone great work on the Small Business Committee, is hugely important \nbecause in my State, when you are done\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\ncounting a handful of big businesses, you have covered the big \nemployers in our State. We are overwhelmingly about small business, and \nbecause of the good work of Senator Shaheen, we are going to give small \nbusinesses more tools they can use to reach new markets overseas. It is \ngoing to help guarantee that all our trade agencies are looking for \nopportunities to help small businesses grow.\n  I could go on with others. I think Senator Feinstein has done very \nimportant work. For example, we have been looking for a model for \ntrade-based humanitarian assistance. Senator Feinstein's contribution \nhas helped us secure that goal, and I appreciate greatly her \nleadership.\n  When it comes to trade policies, environmental protections are a \nspecial priority for me and for Oregonians and for the American people. \nI want one judgment about this bill to be very clear as we start this \ndebate. This legislation cannot and will not in any way prevent the \nUnited States from negotiating a climate agreement. Not only that, the \npackage tackles some particularly important environmental issues head-\non. It directs our trade negotiators to act against illegal fishing and \nfishing subsidies that destroy our oceans. It is going to help \nguarantee that the Customs personnel are better trained to fight the \ntrade of stolen timber from places like the Amazon. These are big \nimprovements over the old playbook of trade enforcement.\n  Many Senators on both sides of the aisle are very concerned about \ncurrency manipulation. In the process of bringing this bipartisan, \nbicameral package together, it was clear that there were some \ndifferences between the Senate and the other body on this legislation \nand that the other body was willing to go only so far on currency \nquestions. When Senators vote--and I know currency is important to \nthem--I hope that they will reflect on the view that I am going to \narticulate. This legislation goes further than ever before to fight the \ncurrency manipulators. One of the major reasons it does is because of \nour colleague Senator Bennet. Senator Bennet has been working with all \nsides diligently on this issue. He has clearly given us a policy that \nwe can build on in the years and days ahead. I intend to work with \nSenator Bennet and all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle at \nevery opportunity to head off the currency manipulators, to stop them \nfrom undercutting American jobs and American businesses. There is no \nquestion in my mind that this legislation goes significantly further \nthan ever before to fight currency abuse and manipulation.\n  Now, it has been my judgment for years that a more progressive \napproach to trade and stronger trade enforcement are two sides of the \nsame coin. Last year, the Senate said loudly and clearly that future \ntrade deals have to raise the bar for American priorities such as labor \nrights and environmental protection. Because of Senator Cardin, we will \nnow have a new focus on human rights. Now the Senate has an opportunity \nto stand up for workers and businesses in Oregon and across the country \nby kicking the enforcement of trade law into high gear. This landmark \ntrade enforcement proposal ought to have strong bipartisan support.\n  Also included in the conference report is a permanent extension of \none of the most popular economic policies on the books today, the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. Former Congressman Chris Cox and I introduced \nthis bill back in 1998. For nearly two decades, this legislation \nprotected working families, especially against regressive taxes on \nInternet access.\n  Working families are the focus of this bill. Working families who use \nthe Internet, for example, get information about employment \nopportunities and educational opportunities. They shouldn't face a wave \nof new regressive taxes. Clearly, ensuring that they don't get hit by \nthese regressive taxes has saved our working families and our small \nbusinesses hundreds of dollars a year.\n  But for all that time, this has been a kind of temporary stop-and-go \npolicy that required its being renewed again and again. My hope is \nthat, as Senators look at this bill, which in my view is the toughest \ntrade enforcement law in decades, and move to the very new approach \nthat I call ``trade done right,'' I hope Senators will see that this \nlegislation also ensures that working families, senior citizens, and \nothers of modest means don't get hit by this big regressive tax simply \nwhen they want to access the Internet for the kind of information so \nimportant to them, given a modest income and their desire to get ahead.\n  With this legislation and its extension running out this year, it is \nimportant for the Senate to act now so that you don't have a situation \nagain at the end of the year with the prospect of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act expiring and working families getting hit with these \nregressive taxes.\n  I urge Senators to support this proposal. There has been an awful lot \nof work done by Senators on both sides of the aisle to advance this \nlegislation. I am particularly grateful to our colleagues on the \nFinance Committee with whom I have the honor to serve.\n  I will close simply by saying to colleagues that this is not about a \nnew trade agreement. It is not exactly an atomic secret. There are \npretty strong differences of opinion about new trade agreements here in \nthis body. This is about whether we are going to get tough with the \ntrade cheats who are ripping off American jobs. This legislation gives \nus the opportunity to do it, and I urge your support.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                    Our ``We the People'' Democracy\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important words in our \nConstitution are the first three words of that document: ``We the \nPeople.'' These are words that the authors put in supersized print to \ntell us that this is what our government is all about--and also, what \nit is not about.\n  They did not start out this document by saying that we are a \ngovernment to serve the ruling elites. They did not establish this \nConstitution to serve the titans of industry and commerce. And they did \nnot write our Constitution to serve the best off, the richest in our \nsociety--quite the contrary. The genius of America was a government \ndesigned, as President Lincoln so eloquently summarized, to be ``of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people.''\n  This Senator will be rising periodically to address issues that \naffect Americans across our Nation. It is important to a government of, \nby, and for the people to address issues that we should be addressing \nin this Chamber.\n  Today I will use this time to talk about the challenge we face in \nclimate change. Last month, scientists reported that 2015 was the \nsingle hottest year on record. NASA says that this past year was a full \n0.9 degrees centigrade. That is well over 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter \nthan the average during the 20th Century. Moreover, it rose \nsignificantly warmer from 2014, which was the previous hottest year on \nrecord--0.23 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than 2014. That is an \nunexpectedly massive increase in the challenge of global warming.\n  These numbers come from the best scientific analysis. They take the \ncombined temperatures from the land, water, and air to get a \ncomprehensive picture of what is going on in our beautiful blue green \nplanet. In total, 15 of the hottest years our planet has experienced \nwhile humans have tread this Earth have been in the last 16 years.\n  These temperature records send a strong message to us, but there is \nalso a message coming from what is happening on the ground--the facts \non the ground. We see the impact of global warming on our own \ncommunities. We see the impacts in terms of the pine beetle expansion \nbecause the winters are not cold enough to kill them off. We see it in \nterms of the red zone that comes from that. We see it in terms of the \nlonger fire season--60 days longer in the last 40 years in my home \nState of Oregon. On the Oregon coast we are having trouble with oysters \nreproducing because the first few days it is difficult to form a shell \nwith waters 30 percent more acidic than they were before the Industrial \nRevolution. We see it in the Cascade Mountains, where the snowpack has \nbeen smaller. It affects our winter sports, and it certainly affects \nthe runoff that serves our farms. We have had massive, difficult \ndroughts in southern Oregon in the Klamath Basin.\n  These changes are not just happening in Oregon. They are happening \nacross\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\nour Nation. They are happening across the world. This change is driving \nhuge costs that can be measured in lost lives, lost homes, lost farms, \nlost businesses, burnt forests, and billions of dollars in disaster \nrelief.\n  Scientists agree that we must keep the warming of our planet under 2 \ndegrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic impacts. We are seeing severe \nimpacts now, but these will be nothing compared to what is anticipated \nif we allow global warming to continue. At this stage below 2 degrees \nCelsius or 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, we must pivot off of the fossil \nfuels to a clean energy economy. That means pursuing energy efficiency \nin our vehicles, in our freight transportation, and in our homes. It \ndoes mean investing in renewable energy, noncarbon electrical energy \nproduced by sunlight and by wind.\n\n  The simple, sobering fact is this: Energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy will not be enough to stop the warming of our planet unless we \nleave 80 percent of the currently known fossil fuel reserves in the \nground. That is a powerful statement because there are enormous \nfinancial forces that seek to extract those proven reserves, to burn \nthose proven preserves, and in doing so will destroy our planet.\n  You and I, fellow citizens, are owners together of a vast amount of \nfossil fuels, of coal, of natural gas, of oil. This is the oil and gas \nand coal that is underneath our public lands and water. We should use \nour ``We the People'' power to manage these fossil fuel reserves for \nthe public good, and the public good is to move away from an era where \nthe U.S. Government facilitates the extraction and burning of our \ncitizen-owned fossil fuels to a new era where the Federal Government, \ntogether our ``We the People'' government, leads the transition from \nfossil fuels to a clean energy economy. As we face the threat of \ncatastrophic climate change, the public good in regard to these fossil \nfuels is to keep them in the ground.\n  When we do a new lease for the extraction of our citizen-owned fossil \nfuels, we lock in carbon extraction for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, \neven 50 years into the future. That is unacceptable. That is morally \nwrong because that extraction, decades into the future, will do \nenormous damage to our planet, to our forests, to our farming, and to \nour fishing. This is an assault, first and foremost, on rural America, \nand it is our responsibility to stop it.\n  That is why I introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act. This \nlegislation ends new leases for coal and oil and gas on public lands \nand waters, and it would drive a transition from fossil fuel extraction \nand combustion toward a renewable energy economy.\n  Critics might argue that we cannot simply end consumption of fossil \nfuels tomorrow. They might point out that society still depends on \nfossil fuels for electricity and for transportation, and they might \nknow the leases that have already been put out there provide extraction \nopportunities decades after this bill is enacted. That being said, it \nis all the more important that we not do new leases, that we not do new \nleases that empower more extraction decades into the future. Time is \nshort and public lands and waters are citizen owned. Public lands and \nwaters are the right place to start, and it is critical to the future \nof our planet.\n  The success of this moment, the ``keep it in the ground'' movement, \nwill depend on grassroots organizing. The grassroots stopped the \nKeystone Pipeline, which would have turned on the tap for some of the \ndirtiest fossil fuels in the world. Grassroots organizing has driven \nthe administration to suspend and possibly to stop drilling in the \nArctic waters--drilling, which is the height of irresponsibility in the \nfragile Arctic region, and just recently grassroots organizing and \nenergy has encouraged the President to put a pause on coal leasing to \nevaluate its climatic impacts.\n  While these are important steps in the right direction, I want to \nencourage our President to go further. Just as he has suspended new \nleases for coal, President Obama has authority to do the same for oil \nand gas. Last week I joined with nine other colleagues in calling on \nthe Department of the Interior to strengthen its climate commitments by \ndropping all new fossil fuel leases from the 5-year Outer Continental \nShelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.\n  I emphasize grassroots organizing as critical because this building \non Capitol Hill is full of individuals, such as I, who have been \nelected, and in our elections vast funds from the fossil fuel industry \nare holding sway. So it is going to take citizens and a ``We the \nPeople'' government--of, by, and for the people--to be able to continue \nto drive what we all know is right. It will be essential to sustain and \nexpand the ``keep it in the ground'' movement.\n  Not so long ago, when individuals outside of this building were \ntalking about ``keep it in the ground,'' and then inside this building \nwe started to have that conversation, many said: It is just too much of \na stretch. It is just too much of a paradigm change from the past, when \nwe sought to lease out our fossil fuels, that this wouldn't work.\n  Where are we now? Not only did we have success in the Keystone, not \nonly did we have success in the Arctic, not only did we have success in \nterms of suspension of coal leases, but we have a broader conversation \nabout ending all of these new leases in each of these areas of fossil \nfuels on our citizen-owned property.\n  Senator Bernie Sanders, who is a cosponsor of my keep it in the \nground bill, said in November:\n\n       We cannot continue to extract fossil fuels from Federally \n     owned land.\n\n  He continued and said:\n\n       You can't talk the talk and say I'm concerned about climate \n     change. And at the same time, say we're going to extract a \n     huge amount of oil, coal, and gas from federal land.\n\n  Last Friday Secretary Clinton called for banning fossil fuels or \nbanning fossil fuels on public land a ``done deal,'' and she went on to \nsay: ``No future extractions, I agree with that.'' That is what she \nsaid. So we have come a long way in a short period, from action in \nthree specific areas to the leading Presidential contenders on the \nDemocratic side calling for moral action to take on this threat.\n  Moving forward, there are two options before us. Our Federal \nGovernment can be a government of, by, and for the titans, and it can \nbe complicit in digging our carbon hole even deeper and doing more \ndamage to the land we love or our Federal Government can be the ``We \nthe People'' government that was laid out by our Constitution, and it \ncan lead this effort to manage our fossil fuels on public lands for the \npublic good and work with our partners around the globe to save our \nplanet.\n  It has been said we are the first generation to see the impacts of \nglobal warming and that we are the last generation that can do \nsomething about it. So the choice is simple. Let's move aggressively \naway from a fossil fuel economy to a clean energy economy. Let's work \nin partnership with the world to take on this worldwide challenge and \nlet's do the smart thing. When it comes to our publicly owned fossil \nfuels, let's keep it in the ground.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President I rise to join my colleagues in condemning \nNorth Korea's belligerence in East Asia.\n  For decades North Korea has starved its people, sponsored criminal \nmisconduct and cyber attacks, and bullied South Korea. In the last \nmonth it has violated numerous U.N. resolutions regarding development \nof nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. DNI Clapper recently stated \nthat the regime is expanding its Yongbyon enrichment facility and \nrestarting the plutonium production reactor. These actions are a threat \nto the United States, our allies, to their regional stability, and they \nremind us that the Kim regime has no interest in abiding by \ninternational rules.\n  The continued development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles \nthreatens our military forces in Japan and South Korea and poses a risk \nto Seoul, Tokyo, and other major cities in the region. While North \nKorea regularly exaggerates its capabilities, it is clear that its \nbelligerence is unending and its technology is improving.\n  This legislation will strengthen and expand the U.S. sanctions \nagainst North Korea. We should use every tool we have to increase \npressure on the regime so it dismantles its nuclear weapons and \nballistic missile programs, but it is not at all clear that they are \nresponding to direct pressure from our\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\nown country. If there is going to be meaningful change in the security \nsituation on the Korean Peninsula, then China is going to have to exert \nmore leverage over its neighbor.\n  While we certainly do not see eye-to-eye with China on many things, \nwe can and must work together to address our shared concerns. China has \na tremendous amount at stake too. Unfortunately, Chinese efforts to \nrein in North Korea have so far been underwhelming. In response to \nChina's diplomatic overtures to stop the missile launch last Saturday, \nNorth Korea actually accelerated its plans and launched its missile on \nthe eve of the Lunar New Year celebrations in China. If that is how \nNorth Korea treats its only ally, then we face an uphill battle, \nespecially without China recalibrating its approach and increasing its \npressure.\n  China must step up to the plate and recognize that dealing with the \nKim regime now is better than dealing with it later. China ought to \ncommunicate to its ally that it is fed up with its belligerence and \nsupports stronger U.N. sanctions. This is the way China will \ndemonstrate its commitment to international peace and security.\n  The goal of this sanctions legislation is not to target the North \nKorean people. They are the victims of the Kim regime. They have borne \nthe cost of these ballistic missile launches. One estimate is that it \ncost $1 billion for the most recent launch, which would have fed the \nentire country for a year. Our goal is to convince North Korea that \nworking with the international community is preferable to being \nisolated from it.\n  Since President Obama took office, the U.N. has adopted three major \nresolutions on North Korea's nuclear program. President Obama has \nsigned three major Executive orders, further sanctioning North Korea's \nactivities.\n  I support these efforts, and we must do more. This sanctions bill \nwill give the administration additional tools to squeeze North Korea to \nchange its behavior, but sanctions are not going to be enough. We need \nto reassure our allies in the region and provide the necessary \nresources to protect our forces in South Korea and Japan. After all, \ndiplomacy is advanced when it is backed up by a strong defense.\n  To that end, we need to do three things. First, we must continue \nserious discussions with South Korea about deploying the Terminal High \nAltitude Defense System, or THAAD, to defend against the missile \nthreat. This has probably become a necessity because of North Korea's \nrecent actions. If it is deployed, we will have to reassure countries \nin the region that THAAD is intended to defend solely against the North \nKorean missile threat to avoid any misperceptions. Second, we need to \npass a well-funded defense budget that provides for the readiness of \nthe forces under Admiral Harris's command at PACOM, through which \nGeneral Scaparrotti at United States Forces Korea can keep our men and \nwomen ready to ``fight tonight.'' Third, we ought to explore new \nopportunities to strengthen our ballistic missile defense, including \nincreasing the protection of our forces in Hawaii and the Western \nPacific by turning the Aegis Ashore Test Complex on Kauai into an \noperational site, a proposal Representatives Gabbard and Takai are \nworking on with the Department of Defense.\n  These are preliminary steps we can take to reassure our allies and \nforces in the region that we are committed to their security, and we \nshould refine our thinking as the threat evolves. The sanctions bill \nreinforces that commitment and sends a clear message that it is time to \nstep up all levels of pressure on North Korea to end its belligerence \nin the region.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, recent developments in North Korea should \nhave raised serious concern. As we have heard over and over again in \nthe Senate from Members of both parties, they have raised serious \nconcerns.\n  This weekend North Korea launched its latest so-called satellite into \norbit. We know this was nothing but an attempt to conceal their \ndevelopment of ballistic missile programs that would actually check \nlaunch capability, not really launching a satellite.\n  On January 6, North Korea claims to have tested a hydrogen bomb, \nwhich, if true, would significantly increase and advance its nuclear \ncapabilities. Even if not true, they have significant weapons in what \neveryone in the world would understand to be dangerous and even \nunstable hands.\n  In October 2014, the senior U.S. commander on the Korean Peninsula \ntold reporters that North Korea has the capabilities to put together a \nminiaturized nuclear warhead that can be mounted on a ballistic \nmissile. Now we see them continuing to check that launch and missile \ncapability. They already tested atomic nuclear weapons in 2006, 2009, \nand in 2013, in all cases in violation of multiple U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions and, frankly, in violation of the agreements they \nhad made in the early part of 2003 and 2004.\n  Nuclear experts have reported that North Korea may currently have as \nmany as 20 nuclear warheads and that the capital, Pyongyang, has the \npotential to possess as many as 100 warheads within the next 5 years.\n  Combined with what appears to be growing sophistication in their \nmissile technology, they have been seeking a way to represent a direct \nthreat--something potentially disastrous in a nuclear way--to the \nUnited States and certainly to our allies in the region.\n  They have shown capacity to proliferate nuclear weapons and \ntechnology to other dangerous regimes and, we have every reason to \nbelieve, dangerous individuals. U.S. officials recently connected \nIranian officials to North Korea and specifically mentioned two \nIranians who, according to the report, ``have been critical to the \ndevelopment of the 80-ton rocket booster, and both traveled to \nPyongyang'' to work on this. According to reports, Iran might \ncoincidentally conduct a nuclear launch later this month. Now we see \nIran doing what it is doing, and we see Korea with the capacity to do \nwhat it is doing.\n  Frankly, what we see in both cases, as well as Russia, are economies \nthat are faltering, and people have every reason to wonder about those \nin charge of their government. The more that occurs, the more dangerous \na government might be in an unstable country, trying to do everything \nthey can to enemies they feel they need to defend themselves against \nand people they need to advance against.\n  We also know they have significantly increased their cyber \ncapabilities. We continually hear from our intelligence community that \na cyber threat is one of the greatest threats we face. We saw North \nKorea launch a cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, which did \nincredible damage in many ways, including their ability to disrupt the \ncritical infrastructure of our country in the same way they were able \nto get involved in the cyber world of one major company.\n  According to a November 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, ``North Korea is emerging as a significant actor \nin cyberspace with both its military and clandestine organizations \ngaining the ability to conduct cyber operations.'' When we look at \nNorth Korea's attempts to increase and/or exaggerate the potential they \nhave with the weapons they have or their ability to develop those \nweapons and when we look at what North Korea is doing with their cyber \nactivities, we see a continually growing threat.\n  The bill brought to the floor from Senator Gardner's and Senator \nCorker's committee, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement \nAct, takes steps by providing the tools necessary to hold North Korea \nand its enablers accountable for what they do. The bill's overall goal \nis to peacefully disarm North Korea through mandatory sanctions that \nwould deprive the regime of the means to build its nuclear and \nballistic missile program and advance its malicious cyber activities. \nSpecifically, it mandates sanctions against individuals who have \nmaterially contributed to North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile \ndevelopment; individuals who have engaged in money laundering, the \nmanufacture of counterfeit goods, or narcotics trafficking that would \nbenefit those programs; and individuals who have engaged in significant \nactivities undermining cyber security against the United States or \nforeign individuals.\n  In addition to these sanctions, the legislation targets additional \nareas that would deny North Korea the resources it needs to continue \nits malicious activities. For example, the bill\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\nmandates sanctions on individuals involved in trading minerals and \nmetals that could be part of a nuclear program.\n  This section would send a strong message, certainly to China, North \nKorea's chief diplomatic protector and largest trading partner. The \nthings that could be used as sanctions would surely make China think \ntwice about what they are doing with North Korea but also think twice \nabout what North Korea is doing with the world. China purports to have \na significant influence in North Korea. China purports to not want to \nsee nuclear destabilization occur. This bill would be an incentive for \nChina to live up to those claims. It has consistently failed to \nleverage its political or economic influence up until now. If China is \ngetting serious about getting North Korea to change its behavior, we \nwould like to see that happen.\n  In a new view of sanctions, there is a waiver in this bill, as there \nhas traditionally been. The President of the United States will have a \nwaiver of these penalties. But this waiver is much stronger from the \nlegislative perspective in that the President can only use the waiver \non a specific basis and has to report, as I understand it, what that \nbasis is.\n  This measure also goes beyond the traditional sanctions regime \nbecause it requires the administration to put forth a comprehensive \nstrategy to promote improved implementation and enforcement of how \nthese sanctions would work and what they would do to combat North \nKorea's cyber activities, to promote and encourage international \nengagement on North Korean human rights violations, and to report back \nto Congress on what they found.\n  There can be no doubt that other would-be nuclear regimes are going \nto be watching this carefully. We saw the lack of appreciation for U.S. \ncommitment in the early weeks and months of the unfortunate Iranian \ndeal. Frankly, the Iranians should and will look back at 2003 and 2004 \nand wonder why the agreements with North Korea didn't work and wonder \nif we are committed to those agreements and wonder if we still are \ndetermined to stop North Korea when we see the kind of activities we \nsee today. This begins to send that message, but the required \nimplementation and reports will send that message in more aggressive \nways than the Congress and consequently the country have before.\n  Finally, we need to ensure that all U.S. forces deployed in the \nregion are appropriately equipped with the most up-to-date surveillance \nand counterballistic missile platforms. Our regional allies--\nparticularly South Korea and Japan--need to be assured that the United \nStates is committed to both the stability and defense of all our \npartners and interests in the region. South Korea and Japan should also \nbe encouraged to undertake any self-defense measures that are necessary \nto augment American forces already in the region.\n  North Korea remains a serious threat to peace and stability in the \nregion and the world. North Korea continues to be a bad example of what \nhappens when the United States makes agreements and isn't prepared to \nfollow through on those agreements.\n  The world is watching. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending a \nclear message that North Korea's provocations are not acceptable and \nthat its continuing pursuit of illicit nuclear weapons will not be \ntolerated. We will get a chance to vote on that issue today. I hope we \nsend a strong message. I hope the administration becomes a stronger \npartner in this message than the messages we are failing to send right \nnow on Iran. I think this is an important moment for the country and \nthe world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of great discussion \nand debate today about the sanctions bill on North Korea. Of course, \none of the issues that continue to come up is the lack of response from \nthe United Nations. As they are considering and deliberating what \nexactly to do with North Korea, I hope they will hear not only the \nwords being discussed here on the floor of the Senate but also the \nactions that are taking place around the globe and particularly in \nSouth Korea.\n  We have long been aware of the Kaesong industrial complex. This is a \nlook at it, somewhere just north of Seoul, basically right on the DMZ \nline, right in between North Korea and South Korea. It is actually \ninside North Korea, where this industrial complex is a joint venture, \nso to speak, a number of efforts from South Korea where they are \nfunding manufacturing facilities using labor from North Korea.\n  The purpose of this manufacturing center, the Kaesong industrial \ncomplex, was to create additional opportunities for North Korea and \nSouth Korea to come together economically and for them to perhaps join \ntogether in unification efforts as they continue to see that they can \nwork together economically.\n  Earlier this year, in one of the first committee hearings I held in \nthe East Asia Subcommittee, we heard testimony from Dr. Victor Cha, a \nprofessor of government at Georgetown University. He is the senior \nadviser and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies. We had testimony on North Korea several months ago--at the \nbeginning of the year--as we focused on how we were going to address \nthis challenge and the Kim Jong Un regime.\n  In his testimony in the House of Representatives a few weeks ago, Dr. \nCha talked about some of the steps that could be taken by the United \nStates and South Korea to address this North Korea threat. He talked \nabout asymmetric pressure points that we have which we can apply to try \nto bring peace to the peninsula.\n  In his statement, he said, ``A new approach to North Korea must focus \non those asymmetric pressure points.'' Then he talked a little bit \nabout the Kaesong industrial complex:\n\n       Another useful asymmetric pressure point is the Kaesong \n     Industrial Complex. A legacy of the sunshine policy, this \n     project now provides $90 million in annual wages (around \n     $245.7 million from December 2004 to July 2012) of hard \n     currency to North Korean authorities with little wages \n     actually going to the factory workers. The South Korean \n     government will be opposed to shutting this down, as even \n     conservative governments in South Korea have grown attached \n     to the project as symbolic of the future potential of a \n     unified Korea, but difficult times call for difficult \n     measures.\n\n  Again, this is Dr. Cha's testimony before the House of \nRepresentatives just a few weeks ago saying that this is an asymmetric \npressure point and that if we were to address something to Kaesong, \nperhaps that could apply pressure to the North Korea regime to change \nits behavior. But because of the investments, because of the amount of \nwork and the opportunities there, closing that wouldn't happen. It is \nnot supported by the government.\n\n  This shows you how serious North Korea's recent behavior has become. \nThe testing of a fourth nuclear weapon--they claim it is a \nthermonuclear bomb. We don't have evidence yet whether hydrogen was \nthere or not, but either way, as we stated before, it significantly \nincreases their technical capability, nonetheless, whether it is \nhydrogen based or not.\n  We saw recently a missile launch, a satellite launch that they used \nto disguise a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. South \nKorea believes this is such a serious situation that South Korea has \nnow shut down the Joint Factory Park at Kaesong over the nuclear test \nand the rocket. Just a few weeks ago, experts said this wouldn't \nhappen, but the severity of North Korea's actions, violations, \ncontinued infringements on any number of U.S. sanctions and U.N. \nsanctions has forced South Korea to take the very dramatic step of \nclosing this facility that they hoped could bring and be a symbol of \nfurther unification.\n  Kim Jong Un and his reckless activities, forgotten maniac of North \nKorea, is now responsible for the loss of employment of 45,000 people \nin North Korea, and we wonder why there is no economic development \ntaking place in North Korea. We wonder why there are limited \nactivities. Because this regime is willing to put his own totalitarian \nregime ahead of the people of North Korea, placing them in political \nprison camps, torturing them, maiming them--hundreds of thousands of \nmen, women, and children.\n  So South Korea has taken a very serious step to express their \ndispleasure with the actions of North Korea. The United Nations and the \nUnited States\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nboth continue to discuss and impose sanctions. The U.N. delay is \ndisturbing.\n  We talk about China. We talk about the impact China could have on \nNorth Korea and their willingness to change their behavior and to \ndenuclearize North Korea. We know China is responsible for somewhere \naround 90 percent of the economic activity of North Korea--right around \n90 percent of the economic activity. We know trade, precious metals, \ncoal, and raw metals have resulted in about 70 percent of foreign \ncurrency in North Korea.\n  That is another step this bill takes, a step to assure we are \naddressing any activity such as exports, coal, precious metals if the \nmoney derived from that goes to the illicit activities. That is why \nKaesong was closed. That is why it was closed by South Korea, because \nthey traced the money back from this industrial facility. The 45,000 \nemployees who weren't making all the wages they were paying, a lot of \nthat money was being siphoned off from the hard-working people of North \nKorea and given to the government and then used to fund weapons of mass \ndestruction, nuclear proliferation. This effort that was used to try to \nunify the peninsula, to employ people, to find economic partnerships \nand opportunities was instead used by Kim Jong Un to further the \nbuilding of billion-dollar rockets while his people starved, to further \nthe efforts of nuclear tests while his people are tortured.\n  This bill attempts to break through that curtain of silence in North \nKorea, providing ways to effectively communicate with the people of \nNorth Korea, to show them what the outside world has to offer in \nfreedom and opportunity if they were to escape the regime in the reign \nof Kim Jung Un. I think the closure of the industrial complex in \nKaesong is one further example of the steps South Korea is being forced \nto take as a result of these militant activities and provocative \nactivities out of North Korea.\n  I see Senator Shaheen of the Foreign Relations Committee is joining \nus in this debate today. She was an active member of the sanctions \ndebate on North Korea. I thank the Senator for being on the floor \ntoday, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague, also \nfrom the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Cory Gardner from \nColorado, in support of the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act. This \nis legislation that will help hold North Korea accountable for its \ndangerous weapons programs.\n  I know Senator Gardner talked about today's news, North and South \nKorea, and in the past month we have witnessed a string of actions by \nthe North Korean leadership that has demonstrated their determination \nto advance the country's nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic \nmissile programs. On January 6, North Korea conducted its fourth \nnuclear test, and just this weekend the country launched another long-\nrange rocket. North Korea's goal could not be clearer or more serious. \nIt is to place a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile capable of reaching the United States. Since North Korea's \nnuclear program was first uncovered in the mid-1980s, the United States \nhas led the international effort to pressure the regime to abandon its \nnuclear activity. In large part, this pressure has come from the United \nStates and United Nations sanctions. Although these sanctions have \neffectively halted most financial transactions between North Korea and \nthe rest of the world, the North Korean regime and its benefactors \ncontinue to obtain hard currency to advance their illicit weapons \nprograms.\n  One way the North Korean Government finances its nuclear program is \nby laundering money in banks outside of North Korea--banks that until \nthis legislation have not been subject to secondary U.S. sanctions. \nThis bill will change that situation. It gives the Obama administration \nthe ability to effectively cut off offending banks from the \ninternational financial system. When faced with this prospect, I \nbelieve prudent actors in China and other parts of the world will cast \naside those in North Korea who have supported its nuclear activity. I \ncertainly hope so.\n  Let me also mention a provision I have added during the Foreign \nRelations Committee's consideration of the bill. It is an amendment \nthat makes clear that the new and powerful sanctions this bill \nauthorizes will not come at the expense of those American families \nstill searching for their loved ones who served in the Korean war and \nwho have never come home.\n  I especially want to thank a New Hampshire advocacy organization--the \nCoalition of Families of Korean and Cold War POW/MIAs--for working with \nme on this important provision. The coalition, led by Portsmouth's Rick \nDownes, expressed concerns that the new sanctions in this legislation \ncould inadvertently hinder efforts to find the more than 7,800 \nAmericans still unaccounted for from the Korean war. Obviously, no one \nhere wants to interfere with this mission, and I am happy this final \nbill explicitly exempts POW/MIA accounting efforts from these new \nsanctions.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Adam Szubin\n\n  Mr. President, I want to raise one concern that I do have as we are \nheading into a vote on this bill; that is, the ability of the Treasury \nDepartment to identify and target those who should be subject to these \nnew sanctions because that is crucial to the success of this \nlegislation and to our overall North Korea strategy.\n  The debate we are having today provides yet another illustration of \nwhy it is so essential to confirm Adam Szubin to be Under Secretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Crimes at the Treasury Department. As the Under \nSecretary, Mr. Szubin would lead the Department in identifying and \ndisrupting financial support to a range of actors that threaten our \nnational security--North Korea as well as ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, \nand others. Not only would Mr. Szubin be responsible for directly \nimplementing a significant portion of the legislation we are expected \nto pass today, but he would also lead the Treasury Department's efforts \nto rally international support for these sanctions.\n  I think this last point is critical and sometimes doesn't get a lot \nof attention. Enforcing sanctions requires cooperation. It requires \noften nudging other foreign governments and financial institutions to \nwork within the sanctions regime. The lack of a Senate-confirmed \nappointee in this position undermines the Treasury Department and our \nefforts to build international coalitions to target terrorism and \nfinancial crimes.\n  I am pleased the Senate is poised to pass the North Korea Sanctions \nEnforcement Act and increase the pressure on the North Korean regime, \nbut I think it would make sense at the same time to confirm the person, \nAdam Szubin, who will be responsible for enforcing those very \nsanctions. Wouldn't it make sense for the Senate to strengthen \nTreasury's hand as they work to make the sanctions as effective as \npossible?\n  Adam Szubin was nominated on April 16, 2015--301 days ago. Although \nthe Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on his nomination back in \nSeptember, the committee still has not advanced that nomination to the \nSenate floor. No one doubts Mr. Szubin's qualifications for the \nposition. At his nomination hearing, Chairman Shelby called him \neminently qualified.\n  Mr. Szubin has served in both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. He has bipartisan support in this body. When we are \nall here--Republicans and Democrats--talking about the need to increase \nthe pressure on North Korea in order to deny Pyongyang the resources it \nis using to develop nuclear weapons and the missiles it needs to target \nthe United States, shouldn't we be supporting a nominee whose job it is \nto do this exact work?\n  I think the Senate needs to vote on Mr. Szubin's nomination without \nfurther delay. I know he has the support of the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. As I said, he has bipartisan support in \nthis body, and it is very disappointing that we can't move him at the \nsame time we are moving this bill. I hope the committee will change \ntheir minds and they will decide to take up his nomination and move it \nso we can ensure that the important tenets that are in this bill to \nhelp address what North Korea is doing will actually be enforced.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, for some time now power has been gravitating \nfrom the legislature to the President. Many in Congress, including \nmyself, have been critical of the President's overreach. However, \nCongress bears some of the responsibility and some of the blame in that \nthis body continues to abdicate and transfer our power to the \nPresident. Nowhere is this more obvious than in foreign policy.\n  During the debate over the Iranian agreement to end sanctions, many \ncongressional voices lamented that these sanctions were enacted by \nCongress and should not be unilaterally ended by the President without \ncongressional approval. As many observers noted, Congress has only \nitself to blame. For decades now, Congress has granted the President \nnational security waivers to just about anything. These allow the \nExecutive to do what they want, to terminate sanctions or continue \nspending without any new vote of Congress.\n  A good example was when Egypt was overtaken by a military regime. \nThis was not a democratic government. This became a military junta. Our \nlaws on foreign aid said Egypt should no longer receive foreign aid if \nthey are not a democratically elected government. Yet the President \ncontinues to give foreign aid to Egypt because he simply uses a waiver \nwe wrote into the legislation.\n  It is a mistake to continue to grant so much power to the Presidency, \nand by doing so, we have abdicated our own power. For decades now, \nCongress has granted the President national security waivers on just \nabout everything. The waivers are so flimsy and open-ended that all he \nhas to do is write a report, claim that it affects national security, \nand then he can do whatever he wants. Congress then complains that the \nPresident is overreaching. Yet we give him that very power.\n  Looking back at the North Korean sanctions, we find that President \nClinton removed sanctions by using the national security waiver that \nCongress provided him. Furthermore, about a decade later, President \nGeorge W. Bush did the same thing, relieving sanctions against North \nKorea by taking advantage of national security waivers.\n  When we jump ahead to the Iran agreement, we find President Obama \nusing national security waivers provided by Congress to unilaterally \nrepeal Iranian sanctions without congressional authority. In fact, \nPresident Obama has utilized congressionally provided loopholes 40 \ntimes to remove Iranian sanctions. Everybody complains, and now we are \ngoing to do the same thing. We are going to write a sanction bill with \nthe exact same boilerplate language that we had in previous sanctions \nbills, which will allow the President the leeway to end the sanctions \nif he desires.\n  When we fast-forward to these new North Korean sanctions before us, \nthe new sanctions bill does exactly what previous sanction bills have \ndone; namely, provide the President with the power to simply claim any \nnonspecific national security claim to waive sanctions.\n  Congressional critics of the President's use of national security \nwaivers to end Iranian sanctions should decide now that they have no \nleg to stand on should a future President do the exact same thing with \nNorth Korean sanctions and decide to remove them without congressional \napproval. There are two examples of that--Clinton has already done \nthis, and so did George W. Bush.\n  I propose that Congress take back their power. I propose that \nCongress not cede power to the Presidency, so I therefore ask unanimous \nconsent to call up my amendment numbered 3301, which is at the desk. My \namendment would remove national security waivers and give Congress its \npower back where it belongs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Is there objection?\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis passion on this issue. We took great care in making sure we devised \na sanctions bill that was strong in terms of its effect on North Korea \nand that it eliminated any of the shortcomings of the sanctions we \nfaced when dealing with Iran.\n  I certainly agree with the Senator from Kentucky when he said that we \nfaced a President willing to grant broad relief from sanctions in terms \nof national security waivers, and that is why we were very careful in \nmaking sure we constructed case-by-case waivers in this act, the North \nKorea act. The President must investigate and explain to Congress that \nthere are no broad grants or wide swaths of discretionary ability to \nwaive the sanctions. As I said, there are mandatory investigations with \nmandatory reporting requirements, and so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, today I rise to honor 37 tribal \ncolleges and universities operating across 16 States on more than 85 \ncampuses, 5 of which are located in North Dakota. Thank you to the more \nthan 20 bipartisan Senators, including Indian Affairs Committee \nChairman Barrasso and Vice Chairman Tester, who joined me in \nintroducing a Senate resolution designating this week as National \nTribal Colleges and Universities Week.\n  This resolution received unanimous support in the Senate last week, \nas it should. It shows that Native American issues and the support for \neducation are part of this country's treaty and trust responsibilities, \nand it continues to be a bipartisan issue. While we too often hear \nabout the hardships Native communities face due to the geographic \nisolation and insufficient access to resources, we should also \nhighlight those who are doing great work to build future leaders and a \nfuture generation of leaders across Indian Country. We see so much of \nthat happening today at tribal colleges and universities.\n  Tribal colleges and universities act as unique community institutions \nthat work to strengthen tribal nations and make lasting differences in \nthe lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The tribal community \ncolleges, technical schools, and 4-year institutions plant resilient \nseeds of hope by sustaining Native languages and building trusting and \nimportant tribal economies.\n  Supporting tribal colleges and universities both upholds our trust \nresponsibility and provides much needed resources for students. Signed \ninto law in 1978, the Tribally Controlled Community Colleges Assistance \nAct supported tribally chartered institutions of higher education to \nhelp uphold the Federal Government's unique relationship with federally \nrecognized Indian tribes. Today, TCUs like Turtle Mountain Community \nCollege and Sitting Bull College in my State of North Dakota provide \neducational resources to Native students who otherwise surely would go \nwithout.\n  But tribal colleges and universities don't simply educate Native \nstudents. The American Indian Higher Education Consortium, a national \nnetwork of this country's TCUs, estimates that because of the schools' \noften rural locations, more than 15 percent of the students attending \nthese tribal colleges and universities are also non-Indian.\n  Tribal colleges and universities offer students access to a well-\nrounded education from an accredited institution that provides \nknowledge and skills grounded in cultural traditions and values, \nincluding the all-important education in indigenous languages. This \nenhances Native communities and enriches both tribes and the United \nStates by preparing students to succeed in their academic pursuits as \nwell as to enter a global competitive workforce.\n  The results have been telling. In the 2012-2013 school year, 75 \npercent of graduates earned degrees, with 22 percent earning \ncertificates. But while\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\nthis success is admirable, the tribal colleges and universities have \nbeen hindered by chronic underfunding. Although the Federal Government \nprovides funding to some minority-serving institutions at levels equal \nto $30,000 per student, tribal colleges receive literally a third of \nthat. When we look at average numbers, it is around $6,700 per student. \nTribes and tribal colleges and universities have consistently figured \nout how to do more with less, but Congress should not shy away from its \nFederal responsibility.\n  I wish to speak about my experience this morning meeting with a \nnumber of tribal students. We can give all of these numbers and the \ncritical importance of making this kind of education accessible, but \nwhat we will never see is the hope and the opportunity in the eyes of \nthese students. I can't do that for my colleagues here. I can only tell \ntheir stories.\n  I met a young woman who served our country in the military and after \n10 years went home and discovered the opportunity to learn more about \nher culture and the opportunity to get an education at the tribal \ncolleges. She said she wished she had known earlier. She probably would \nhave gone to college at the tribal college at Sitting Bull first before \nshe joined the armed services.\n  I met another young woman who told me of her early life of abuse and \nneglect. She said that after having two children and really no hope, \nshe found a tribal college. In that tribal college she found not only \nan opportunity for advancement and the dream and the hope of becoming a \nlawyer someday, but she found a family. She described the faculty and \nthe staff and the other students as the family she had never had.\n  I talked to another young woman, who is 18 years old and literally \nhomeless. She sleeps on a friend's couch. The only family she has to \nnurture her is her tribe and the tribal college. She tells me--her \nwords were this: I will be great. She would not have that hope, she \nwould not have that belief, and she would not have that vision if she \ndidn't have access to education. She is going to be a nurse. And I can \ntell you she is already great, from what I have heard.\n  So the stories go on and on and on.\n  Because of the involvement in the tribal college at Spirit Lake \nReservation, we have a student now, who, for the first time, graduated \nwith an engineering degree from one of our 4-year institutions. He \nstarted out at a tribal college--first engineer ever from that tribe.\n  These are messages of hope in a world that all too often is a world \nof despair, a world of neglect, a world of abuse, a world of challenges \nfor young people. But a tribal college gave them the foundation, the \nconnection to their culture, the connection to a family and a group of \npeople who cared about them, and an opportunity for something better--\nan opportunity to be great, as the young woman I spoke with earlier \nsaid.\n  So I am very proud of the work we have done to support the tribal \ncolleges. We need to do more. If we truly want to change the outcome \nand the paradigm for Indian people and for Indian children, we must \ninvest in Indian education, and that goes all the way from our Head \nStart programs all the way up to our programs for higher education.\n  I want to give one last story. This past summer I attended the STEM \neducation program for Native Americans at the University of North \nDakota, and I met with a group of young people who talked about the \ndifficulty of transitioning from the reservation into a major \nuniversity--talking not so much about the challenges academically but \nabout the challenges of loneliness, the challenges of the first time \nleaving what they knew and being the first generation in their families \nto actually attend a 4-year college. One young man said that he was so \nhomesick and so shocked by the change in culture that he wanted to go \nhome. I said: Well, did you? He said: No, I called my mom to tell her \nthat I wanted to go, and she told me she would knock me upside the head \nif I came back. A brave mother--so he said he did what his mother asked \nhim to do, and he was graduating with a degree in, I think, geology or \nsome applied science.\n  That young man had a mother who kept him in that school. Many young \npeople in Indian Country today do not have that kind of inspiration, \nand the great distrust people have for the outside world gets embedded. \nSo these tribal colleges help prepare these students for the next step. \nThey are critical for maintaining the cultural significance, critical \nfor maintaining the pride that people have in who they are as a people, \nand then building on that for self-awareness, building on that for \nself-economic opportunity.\n  I am proud to represent five great institutions of higher learning in \nmy State that are representative of the tribal colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about the wonderful men and women who run \nthose institutions and what they do. These are people with Ph.D.s. \nThese are people with amazing degrees who could go anywhere, and they \ncontinue to provide leadership to their people. Without their \nleadership and their support, these children would not have these \nopportunities. These returning vets would not have these opportunities, \nand these older-than-average students, with the challenges in their \nlives, would not have these opportunities.\n  So please join with me in recognizing tribal colleges and \nuniversities but also to take a look at the disparities in terms of \nreimbursements that these tribal colleges and universities incur, and \nlet's make this investment. This is an investment in the lives and the \nchanges we need to see in Indian Country.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to comment on the statements \nthat have been made by my colleague and friend from North Dakota, who \nhas been an amazing leader, a very strong leader here in the Senate \nsince she came, trying to shine a spotlight on issues particularly \nsurrounding our Native American and Alaska Native children.\n  We are working together on a mission that really does help to drill \ndown--to find those best supports that we possibly can for these \nchildren who in so many instances have been left behind.\n  The Senator from North Dakota spoke about our tribal institutions and \nour tribal colleges as that next step to launch our young people \nsuccessfully, while recognizing that we have opportunities to grow and \ndo better by our tribal colleges. I had an opportunity just yesterday \nto be visited by some students from Ilisagvik College, a small facility \nlocated in Barrow, AK. I had a chance to meet with two students, Olive \nand Jillian, from a very small village called Atqasuk. One described \nwhat it was like as a young student who wants that education--but just \nthe idea that one would go hundreds of miles away to the big city in \nFairbanks or Anchorage to pursue an education was simply not possible--\nand how these students have been given opportunities in ways that \nperhaps they and their families never dreamed possible.\n  So I stand with my colleague, as we have stood shoulder to shoulder \non so many of these issues that impact our Native children, our young \npeople, their futures, and their opportunities, and recognizing that \neducation can be that key to a better life and a better path forward.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Certainly.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, there is no better partner for me in \nthis quest than the great Senator from the State of Alaska. We have \nspent so much time relating and recounting our experiences in visiting \nwith Native Alaskans or, in my case, American Indians, talking about \nthe challenges and talking about what needs to happen and how we need \nto shed a light on not only the despair, so that we all are motivated \nfor change, but how we need to shed a light on the gratefulness and the \ngreat spirit that is happening. I know that my great friend has had \nthose situations where you just wonder how resilient a young girl can \nbe who experiences these kinds of challenges and this kind of abuse to \ncome back and say: This is going to be a great future.\n  So I wanted to thank the Senator from Alaska for her strong and \nabiding\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\nand great commitment to all the people of Alaska, and I want to thank \nher for her partnership.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I certainly appreciate the value of \nour partnership, and I know that we have a great deal of work ahead of \nus.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor today to express my support for \nthe North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act and the substitute that we \nwill be voting on later this afternoon.\n  It is fair to say that the people of Alaska take great interest in \nthis legislation, and it is not simply an intellectual interest. It \nstems from our geography, quite simply. At its closest point, Alaska is \n3,100 miles from North Korea. Let me put that in context with where we \nare here. The distance between Washington, DC, and my hometown of \nAnchorage is 3,370 miles. So Alaska is actually closer to North Korea \nthan I am to my home when I am working here in Washington, DC.\n  We are talking about the main population center in Anchorage and in \nthe Mat-Su Valley area in south central Alaska, which is about 3,600 \nmiles from Pyongyang. Perhaps it is a little longer than a North Korean \nmissile can travel today or even in the near future, but it seems to me \nthat North Korea is committed to advancing its nuclear capabilities. \nIts covert nuclear tests and the so-called satellite launch that we saw \nover the weekend appear to be purposeful steps in that direction.\n  Just to give a little vignette about how Alaskans pay attention to \nNorth Korea--we all go around and visit schools around our respective \nStates--I was at a middle school and I had an eighth grader ask me a \nquestion. When asked what was on anybody's mind, what do you want me to \nknow about, and how can I be a better representative for you back in \nWashington, DC, the first eighth grader that raised his hand said to \nme: Senator Murkowski, what are you doing in Washington about this Kim \nJong Un guy? This is an eighth grader.\n  I am not going to suggest to you that perhaps Alaskan eighth graders \nare more attuned to politics around the world. The reason I raise this \nis because around the dinner tables back home, people are talking about \nNorth Korea because our geography puts us within that range of sight, \nif you will. I use that term loosely, but when looking at the maps and \nunderstanding where Alaska is and where North Korea is and reading the \nnews about what is happening with North Korea's nuclear intentions, it \ncauses Alaskans to be worried enough to be discussing it at the dinner \ntable, and eighth graders are saying: What is going on? It is real for \nus.\n  North Korea's actions demand decisive action here in Washington, DC, \nin Beijing, and at the United Nations. The Washington Post editorial \njust yesterday noted that the Obama doctrine of strategic patience is \nno longer an option. Mr. Kim seems to view that as a sign of weakness. \nHe seems to fancy playing Washington off against Beijing, and neither \ncapital can afford him that luxury, lest North Korea make fools of \nboth.\n  China has a major role to play in showing Mr. Kim the light. Mr. Kim \nwants the world to believe that he is smarter than all of us, and I \nwould suggest that it is not in Beijing's interest to offer him a \nporous border. The United States and our allies have been patient \nenough with the carrot. We talk a lot about the carrot and stick when \nit comes to engagement. But this Senator suggests that we have been \npatient enough with the carrot, and now it is time to try the stick.\n  The sanctions bill that we are considering today is intended as a \nserious wake-up call to Mr. Kim's government. The sanctions are severe \nand they are targeted at those who enable Mr. Kim's regime to conduct \nbusiness abroad. They are also intended as a wake-up call to Mr. Kim's \nadvisers, who enjoy a pretty comfortable status quo, thanks to their \nleadership positions. But life is going to be a little bit tougher \nunder our sanctions regime, if we advance this--no more luxury goods, \nno more creature comforts, and, if we are successful, no more access to \nhard currency--no exceptions.\n  This is an important shift for our government with regards to North \nKorea. As I mentioned, out of geographic necessity I follow \ndevelopments in North Korea very closely, and I have since I came to \nthe Senate. I have had the opportunity over the years to spend time \nwith U.S. officials who have assumed the very difficult role of trying \nto conduct diplomacy with North Korea. Almost without exception, they \nhave advised, when talking about North Korea, to choose respectful \nlanguage, to avoid threats, to find ways to allow one's words and one's \nsincerity to penetrate. We are now at that point where some are saying \nquite strongly that this respectful approach hasn't really gotten us \nanywhere with this regime. This Senator would suggest that we can be \nand must be very firm while at the same time respectful.\n  Let me share a couple examples of some things that many of my \ncolleagues may not have been aware of. I had an opportunity this past \nSeptember to travel with a couple of my Senate colleagues to Svalbard, \nNorway. Svalbard is where one of the world's global seed vaults is \nlocated. The seed vault is intended to preserve a wide variety of plant \nseeds from around the world in the event there might be some kind of \nwidespread regional or worldwide crisis that would wipe out local crops \nand seed. It is nicknamed ``the doomsday vault.''\n  I had an opportunity to go into this vault and just observe what \nvarious nations have sent to the top of the world up there. In that \nvault we saw one of the few instances of North Korean international \ncooperation. We saw boxes of seeds from North Korea. There was a box \nthat came in with over 5,700 plant crop seeds from that hermit kingdom. \nJust last month, North Korea signed the Svalbard Treaty, giving North \nKorea access to the Svalbard Islands.\n  We have also heard that North Korea has made use of the Northern Sea \nRoute to assist with shipments to Russia. I put this out there because \nwhatever reason there may be that North Korea signed on to this \nSvalbard Treaty and whatever the reason may be for its newfound \ninterest in the Arctic, the point is that when the regime in North \nKorea sees that it is in its best interests to cooperate \ninternationally, there is a willingness to engage. But to this point, \nthey have not shown a willingness to engage when it comes to their \nnuclear and ballistic missile programs--at least not to any reasonable \nlevel of engagement where the terms are not dictated by the North \nKorean regime.\n  Here we are today. We have a bill on the floor directed to North \nKorean economic sanctions. It is not about an invasion or the use of \noffensive weapons against the people of North Korea. It is about \nbringing about peaceful change, firmly and respectfully.\n  In that vein, let me acknowledge that the people of North Korea are a \nproud, nationalistic people. Like all of the world's peoples, they wish \nto be respected by others. Yet they are governed by an intolerant and a \nvery perplexing regime that tolerates hunger and poverty when it is \nclear that there are other choices.\n  If the people of North Korea were allowed to look across the border \nthey would see an example of prosperity. They would see a strong \ncommitment to traditional values. They would see family members with \nwhom someday they would hope to reunify.\n  None of the world's nations are out to deny North Korea the \nopportunities for that prosperity, traditional values, and the \nreuniting of families. But we do rightly demand--and it is legitimate \nthat we demand--that North Korea be a part of the community of nations. \nThat means that Mr. Kim must abandon these nuclear ambitions.\n  I believe that it is important that our Nation be prepared for \nanything that may come our way. My home State of Alaska is host to our \nNation's ground-based missile defense capabilities. I was pleased to \nread in yesterday's budget announcement plans to make a $1 billion \ninvestment in the ground-based missile defense system. Significant \ninvestments are also made in the Long Range Discrimination Radar, or \nLRDR, which is slated for completion at Clear Air Force Station by the \nyear 2020. That radar is exactly what the words imply--a radar that \nwill enable our missile defenders to take a really good long look and \nbetter discriminate between threats and junk. I am also pleased to know \nthat the United States is working through the\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\nplacement of missile defense batteries in South Korea.\n  These investments provide an increment of protection, but the truth \nis that they are second-best to a change in attitude coming out of \nPyongyang. That is truly what I hope we will achieve through this \nsanctions vote today.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I wish to steadfastly support the \nNorth Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016.\n  Before I discuss the merits of this critical legislation, however, I \nwish to congratulate the author of the Senate version of this act, the \njunior Senator from Colorado. The bill he crafted will reinvigorate our \nNation's efforts to thwart North Korea's continued development of \nnuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology. In addition, it seeks \nto further protect our Nation from cyber attack and begin to hold \nresponsible those who have committed human rights abuses against the \npeople of North Korea.\n  I also wish to commend the chairman and the ranking member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee for working together to shepherd \nthis bill through their committee with strong bipartisan support.\n  Once again the Senate turns its attention to confront one of the most \natrocious regimes of the modern era: the so-called Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea--or North Korea. Instead of working to create the \nworkers' paradise, which is purported to be one of the autocratic \nregime's primary objectives, millions have starved as part of North \nKorea's policy of placing the military first.\n  But make no mistake, the threat posed by North Korea is not an \ninconsequential concern about the domestic affairs of a distant land. \nOn January 6, the regime conducted a subterranean nuclear weapons test, \nclaiming to have detonated a hydrogen bomb for the first time. Even \nRussia decried the test as ``a flagrant violation of international law \nand existing UN Security Council resolutions.''\n  Then, this past weekend, the North Korean satellite launched on \nSunday passed almost directly over the stadium where the Super Bowl was \nplayed an hour after the game, according to press reports. This hostile \nact is even more disconcerting when we remember that the technology to \nlaunch such a satellite into orbit is virtually identical to what is \nrequired to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile with a \nwarhead.\n  Unfortunately, these provocative acts are only part of a recurring \npattern orchestrated by North Korea over the past several years.\n  The pattern of closely pairing a nuclear test with rocket launches \nbegan in 2006, when the regime fired seven ballistic missiles, \nincluding the long-range Taepo Dong-2. Three months later, North Korea \nconducted its first underground nuclear test.\n  These hostile acts prompted the U.N. Security Council to adopt, under \nChapter VII, Resolution 1695--condemning the missile launch--and \nResolution 1718--demanding that North Korea refrain from further \nnuclear tests and imposing sanctions on the regime.\n  Once again, in 2009, North Korea carried out a virtually identical \npairing of rocket and nuclear tests. In April of that year, the rogue \nstate launched a three-stage Unha-2 rocket. One month later, Pyongyang \nconducted another underground nuclear test. This second round of \nnuclear and rocket tests elicited U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1874, which expanded sanctions, intensified inspections to prevent \nproliferation, and barred further missile tests.\n  Unfortunately, Pyongyang was not deterred and repeated its weapon and \nrocket pairing in late 2012 and early 2013. Specifically, in December \n2012, the newly installed Kim Jung-un ordered the launch of another \nUnha-3 rocket. Two months later, North Korea conducted another \nunderground nuclear test. The U.N. Security Council responded in kind \nwith Resolution 2087--strengthening sanctions related to the missile \nlaunch--and Resolution 2094--tweaking sanctions related to North \nKorea's nuclear program.\n  In addition to the now-cyclical pairing of rocket launches and \nnuclear tests, North Korea has assumed the role of a petulant child in \na variety of other areas. For example, North Korea has directly \nviolated both the Korean Armistice Agreement and article 2 of the U.N. \nCharter by taking kinetic military action against South Korea.\n  In 2010 alone, North Korean forces sunk a South Korean patrol ship--\naccording to a multinational commission that investigated the \nincident--and separately fired artillery rounds at a South Korean \nisland, killing two Korean Marines and injuring 17 others.\n  North Korea has also been guilty of repeated acts of proliferation to \nrogue states around the world. The Washington Post and the New York \nTimes reported that, in 2004, Libya received uranium hexafluoride of \nsuspected North Korean origin. Similarly, the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence revealed that North Korea assisted the Assad \nregime in constructing a nuclear reactor in northern Syria that Israeli \nforces destroyed in 2007.\n  I recite this partial history so that there is no misunderstanding. \nNorth Korea earned international condemnation not merely for its recent \ntransgressions, but for countless bad dealings over the last decade. \nUnfortunately, previous U.N. resolutions and the sanctions imposed by \nour own government have not achieved the desired result of terminating \nNorth Korea's recalcitrant activity.\n  That is why the junior Senator of Colorado's legislation is so \nimportant. It provides our sanctions with greater teeth. It mandates \nsanctions on individuals who have materially contributed to North \nKorea's nuclear and ballistic missile program.\n  I also think it is important to pause here to notice that, unlike \nNorth Korean autocrats who have imposed their will on the North Korean \npeople by sending vast numbers to forced labor camps and early graves, \nthe United States' sanctions are directed only at those who facilitate \nviolations of international law.\n  In sum, North Korea's repression is indiscriminate. Our sanctions are \nfocused on punishing the guilty. Accordingly, the junior Senator's \nlegislation requires the administration to identify human rights \nabusers in North Korea and direct sanctions against them.\n  The bill also addresses one of the growing threats to our nation: \ncyber attack. Therefore, the administration is tasked to devise a \nstrategy to confront and counter North Korea's cyber attacks against \nthe United States. It also directs the executive branch to designate \nsanctions against those responsible for these belligerent acts.\n  This is an important piece of legislation which tightens the ring of \ndeterrence against a regime that continues to defy international law. \nThis bill's objective is not to needlessly interfere in the affairs of \na foreign nation; rather, it is to provide a tool to force an aggressor \ninto compliance with international law and to deter North Korea from \ncommitting hostile acts not only against the United States and its \nallies, but also against the North Korean people. I urge the prompt \npassage of this legislation.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, today I join my colleagues in supporting \nthe North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. This \nlegislation will send a strong message to the North Korean regime that \nthere are consequences to its dangerous and destabilizing activities on \nthe Korean peninsula. Just in the past month, North Korea has conducted \nits fourth nuclear weapon test and launched a satellite into orbit, \nboth of which violate several United Nations Security Council \nresolutions. The bipartisan bill before us makes clear that Congress \nwill not tolerate the North Korean regime's continuing and flagrant \nviolations of international law.\n  This bill is comprehensive and addresses a number of important \nconcerns. First, it prohibits defense exports to North Korea and \nwithholds foreign assistance to those governments that provide lethal \nmilitary equipment to the government of North Korea. Second, it \ncodifies and makes mandatory important cyber security sanctions under \nExecutive Orders 13681 and 13694 that are essential to countering North \nKorea's dangerous cyber attacks, like the one perpetrated against Sony \nPictures Entertainment in November 2014. Third, it includes sanctions \non individuals who knowingly engage in the serious human rights abuses \nthat are perpetuated by the regime against its own people.\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\n  I would like to commend my colleagues from the Banking and Foreign \nRelations Committees who have worked to move this legislation forward. \nIt is critical that we use all of our diplomatic and legal resources to \nfurther restrict North Korea's ability to fund its nuclear weapons and \nballistic missile programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support adoption of this important \nlegislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I wish to speak in support of the North \nKorea Sanctions Enforcement Act.\n  Last week, North Korea launched a space satellite into orbit in \ndirect violation of U.N. sanctions. Last month, North Korea tested its \nfourth nuclear bomb since 2006. North Korea's steady march toward \nexpanding its nuclear arsenal continues unabated. Even more troubling \nis North Korea's willingness to sell its nuclear and ballistic missile \ntechnology to the highest bidder, as demonstrated by its previous \ncooperation with Iran.\n  The North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act is an appropriate and \ntimely measure to expand U.S. sanctions against not only North Korea, \nbut also those that facilitate North Korea's illicit and nefarious \nactivities. In doing so, this legislation will deliver the message to \nthe North Korean regime that its continued development and \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, material, and delivery systems will \nnot be tolerated.\n  At the same time, the United Nations Security Council must address \nthis issue with the same sense of urgency, unity, and commitment that \nthe House has shown and the Senate will demonstrate in passing this \nbill later today.\n  First, U.N. member countries must fully understand and implement the \nmany existing sanctions against North Korea already on the books. \nUnless they do, the sanctions will never work. The United States has \nminimal trade with North Korea, whereas China, a permanent member of \nthe U.N. Security Council, accounts for 70 percent of all of North \nKorea's economic trade.\n  Yesterday, a new report released by a panel of U.N. experts found \nthat North Korea continues to evade international sanctions because the \nsanctions have been seldom implemented, and some countries do not fully \nunderstand their obligations under the relevant U.N. Security Council \nresolutions. In other instances, there is simply a lack of political \nwill to enforce the sanctions. This has to stop for sanctions to be \neffective against North Korea.\n  Second, the U.N. Security Council must adopt new sanctions to \ndemonstrate to the North Korean regime that further violations of U.N. \nsanctions will not be tolerated. Even though North Korea has continued \nto evade sanctions for the past decade, the response at the United \nNations should be to identify the ways to make sanctions more effective \nand targeted rather than to walk away from sanctions entirely.\n  We know sanctions can work because they have before. In 2005, the \nU.S. Treasury Department froze $24 million in North Korean accounts \nimportant to the regime at the Banco Delta Asia bank. As a result of \nthis action, which was taken pursuant to authority Congress provided in \nthe USA PATRIOT Act, the North Koreans returned to the six-party \nnuclear talks. They stayed at the talks until the frozen assets were \nreleased 2 years later.\n  The bill we are considering today requires the Department of the \nTreasury to reevaluate whether North Korea should be considered a \nprimary money-laundering concern, which would permit the President to \nenact the same type of sanctions that brought the North Koreans back to \nthe negotiating table 10 years ago. I urge the Treasury Department to \ncomplete this review as quickly as possible so that the President has \nat his disposal the full array of options to persuade, coerce, and \neffectively contain the dangerous North Korean regime.\n  I thank Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin for bringing this \nmeasure to the floor, and I thank Senator Gardner and Senator Menendez \nas well for their extensive work on this legislation to address the \nnuclear threat posed by the erratic and unstable North Korean regime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital, bipartisan legislation.\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, the totalitarian state of North \nKorea is becoming more belligerent by the day. In January, the country \ndetonated its fourth nuclear bomb since 2006--which the North Korean \nmilitary claims was a small hydrogen bomb. Just last week, the country \nlaunched a rocket carrying a satellite into space, foreshadowing the \npossible development of a long-range ballistic missile capable of \ndelivering a nuclear payload. According to National Intelligence \nDirector James Clapper, North Korea recently expanded a uranium \nenrichment facility and restarted a plutonium reactor that could start \nrecovering material for nuclear weapons within months or even weeks. I \nam deeply concerned by these actions.\n  We must exhaust every diplomatic option we have to pressure North \nKorea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, halt its aggressive \nmilitary posturing with South Korea, and adhere to the tenets of \ninternational human rights law. That is why I strongly support the \nbipartisan effort to strengthen sanctions on the rogue North Korean \nregime.\n  These sanctions are an important tool in resolving the growing threat \nfrom Pyongyang. The legislation before the Senate would help prevent \nNorth Korea from obtaining goods or technology related to nuclear \nweapons, ban foreign assistance to any country that provides lethal \nmilitary equipment to North Korea, and target the country's trade in \nkey industrial commodities. These steps are absolutely essential if we \nare to achieve our longstanding mission to end the North's nuclear \nweapons program. Certainly, sanctions are far preferable to preemptive \nmilitary force, which I strongly oppose.\n  In addition to sanctions, the U.S. must work with the few nations \nthat have diplomatic and economic relationships with North Korea--\nnamely China--to pressure Kim Jong Un to stop threatening the stability \nof the region and join the community of nations. While China may have \nbeen a steadfast ally of North Korea's in the past, China now has far \nmore shared interests with the U.S. than with Pyongyang. It is time to \nmake resolving the Korean peninsula conflict a top diplomatic goal in \nterms of our own relationship with China.\n  I am pleased to see that the sanctions bill includes a waiver to \nallow humanitarian organizations to deliver much needed relief to \nordinary North Korean citizens and authorizes $2 million for \nhumanitarian assistance. Sanctions come at a cost, and we must do \neverything possible to make sure the North Korean people--who already \nsuffer so much under Kim Jong Un--do not pay an even greater price.\n  While I will be necessarily absent for the expected bipartisan \npassage of the bill, I strongly support the North Korea sanctions \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on the \nNorth Korean Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, a bill I am proud to \ncosponsor with my colleague from Colorado, Senator Cory Gardner. This \nlegislation mandates new sanctions on North Korea's ballistic missile \nand nuclear program, targets cyber criminals and officials involved in \ncensorship, and addresses the regime's long history of human rights \nabuses.\n  The recent rocket launch and the fourth nuclear test by North Korea \nlast month is a stark reminder that it is a rogue state, under unstable \nleadership that will stop at nothing until it fully realizes its \nnuclear ambitions. The current policy of ``strategic patience'' has \nyielded nothing more than a flagrant testing of American resolve around \nthe globe and a weakening of our Nation's credibility. North Korea's \nrecent provocations have acknowledged that reality. Congress must act \nand do so loudly. Now, more than ever, we need to send a message to \nNorth Korea that reassures our allies, forewarns our adversaries, and \nputs the world on notice. This legislation accomplishes that.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have a very significant vote coming \nup,\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nand people are not talking about it as much as they should. We had a \nhearing, and, of course, the Chair was there at the hearing, where we \nhad James Clapper talking about the threat that we are faced with here \nin the United States.\n  James Clapper--just to remind people--has been around as the chief \nintelligence director or involved with intelligence in hearings in \nWashington for 43 years. This guy knows what he is talking about. He \nmade a statement yesterday that we have never been in as high of a \nthreat position in all of the 43 years that he has been there.\n  In fact, there was an article released yesterday where it was stated \nthat ``North Korea had expanded its production of weapons-grade nuclear \nfuel, making clear that the Obama administration now regarded the \nreclusive government in Pyongyang, rather than Iran, as the world's \nmost worrisome nuclear threat.''\n  That threat is real. We all recall when Kim Jong Un replaced his \nfather, and as bad as his father was, he was at least a little more \ndependable in terms of predictability than Kim Jong Un.\n  Just yesterday it was reported that he killed the chief of his \ngeneral staff. It was a year ago that he did the same thing. So if \nsomeone disagrees with him, they execute him.\n  Under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, North Korea has repeatedly \nviolated Security Council resolutions regarding weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them. Since assuming power in \n2012, his regime has conducted satellite launches in December 2012, and \nin February 2016 continues to develop it's ballistic missile \nprogram. It has conducted missile tests from several launched \nlocations, and he has conducted nuclear tests in February of 2013 and \nJanuary 2016, so he just continued all the way through it. All of these \nthings are in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\n  North Korea also continues to be involved in criminal activities \naround the world to include cyber attacks against organizations and \ngovernments. This bill that we are going to be considering--the passage \nof the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act that we will be \nvoting on--toughens the sanctions against North Korea by authorizing \ncomprehensive sanctions against countries, companies, and individuals \nwho engage in certain trade with North Korea.\n  This is something that is a fairly recent attempt to get compliance \nwith the arrangements that are being made by saying to a country: If \nyou continue to do business in North Korea, then we will have sanctions \nagainst your country.\n  This is something that has worked to a degree in Iran. It is a system \nthat should be set up, and we will have the opportunity to do that this \nafternoon.\n  If anyone engages in trade with North Korea, as well as those \ndetermined to be responsible for human rights abuses, money laundering, \ncounterfeiting, or undermining cyber security, this bill demonstrates \nAmerica's resolve in holding North Korea responsible for its actions, \nalong with those countries, organizations, and individuals who are \nassisting them.\n  Of course, it is very significant that we go ahead and move forward \nwith this, get this passed today, and send a very clear message, not \njust to North Korea but to all of those countries who might be tempted \nto be trading with them that they could be subject to the same \nsanctions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know we have a little shift taking \nplace, but I thank Senator Inhofe for his staunch national security \nsupport and certainly support of this legislation. I appreciate his \ncomments, and I think we are going to have a successful day today in \ndoing something that is important.\n  I think you know the administration has tried to work with the U.N. \nSecurity Council to get them to impose sanctions, as you would think \nthey would wish to do. China has been the holdup there. You would think \nas a next-door neighbor they would be most apt to want sanctions and \nother actions to be put in place to push back against North Korea.\n  This is something that is important that we are doing in a proactive \nway, and hopefully it will spur other actions down the road.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORKER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It was January 7 of 2013 that I was there on the DMZ. \nThat is the largest active DMZ that is out there now--160 miles long, 2 \nmiles wide. Even at that time, we were talking about the necessity of \nimmediately getting sanctions in there to stop the threats. Because our \nintelligence--while it can be good and it cannot be so good, still \nthere is speculation that they had that capability, and that capability \nhas to be stopped.\n  I applaud the Senator and his team for moving forward with this \nissue.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank Senator Inhofe. I think most Americans, unlike my \ncolleague, don't realize we still have 28,500 troops there. It is an \narea where easily something can get out of hand. So, again, I thank him \nfor his support and for being here today.\n  I know Senator Feinstein now has the floor. I yield to our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman very much. I want \nSenator Corker to know that I fully support his committee's \nrecommendation and believe the time has come to enforce and place some \nsanctions against North Korea.\n  I think we all judge the world's leaders based on their actions and \ntheir stated intentions. To me there is no question that Mr. Kim's \nintentions are adverse to the well-being of our country. As a citizen \nof the western United States and a Senator representing nearly 40 \nmillion people in California, this is all very alarming, and it should \nalarm the world.\n  If you take stock of North Korea's recent actions and their \ncapabilities, the cause for concern is apparent. On January 6 of this \nyear, North Korea detonated its fourth nuclear device. Regardless of \nwhether it was a hydrogen bomb or not, Mr. Kim's intention is clear: he \nseeks a nuclear arsenal.\n  Unfortunately, the measures the international community have adopted \nto date have been insufficient to stop him. In October of 2006, the \nNorth Koreans first detonated a device which had an estimated yield of \nless than 1 kiloton. In May of 2009, they detonated a second device, \nroughly 2 kilotons. In February 2013, they detonated a third device, 6 \nkilotons to 7 kilotons, and the one this year was the fourth. I would \nnot be surprised if their most recent test had a greater yield than the \nlast.\n  Not only have North Korean weapons become more lethal, but their \nstockpile has likely increased over time. According to a February 2015 \nanalysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, North \nKorea has between 15 and 22 nuclear weapons. By the end of 2014, and \nthey could have 20 to 100 nuclear weapons. That is deeply troubling, \nespecially as North Korea continues to make advances in their missile \nprogram.\n  Again, experts at the Institute for Science and International \nSecurity have warned that North Korea likely has the capability to \nmount a nuclear warhead on its medium-range missiles.\n  Most of Japan and all of South Korea, each of which hosts tens of \nthousands of U.S. military and civilian personnel, are easily in range. \nAnd just this past weekend, they again tested an ICBM under the guise \nof placing a satellite in space. According to various reports, North \nKorea tested a three-stage likely Taepodong-2 rocket, which, in fact, \ndid place a satellite into orbit.\n  Again, to me, the intention is clear. They want to build a missile \ncapable of reaching the United States.\n  An ICBM on a launch pad is vulnerable to attack. So to evade this \nvulnerability, North Korea appears also to be developing a road-mobile \nICBM, the KN-08, which it is estimated can reach the United States.\n  In April of this past year, ADM Bill Gortney, the head of the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, said: ``We assess that it [the KN-\n08] is operational today'' and that the mobile nature of the KN-08 \nmakes it a difficult target.\n  Gortney also said: ``Our assessment is that they [the North Koreans] \nhave the ability to put a nuclear weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the \n[U.S.] homeland.''\n  It is not just the nuclear weapons and missile program that give me \npause. In\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\nthe last several years, North Korea has committed highly provocative \nacts. North Korea chose to sink a South Korean naval vessel in 2010, \nkilling 46 soldiers. It has shelled South Korean islands and planted \nmines along the DMZ that maimed South Korean soldiers. It has \nundertaken sophisticated cyber attacks against U.S. companies, Sony \nPictures, and South Korean banks.\n  Previously, North Korea walked away from the 1994 Agreed Framework \nand withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Most recently, \nit has repeatedly flouted U.N. Security Council resolutions and \nproliferated weapons of mass destruction technologies.\n  With respect to its own human rights record, a 2014 United Nations \nHuman Rights Council report makes clear that North Korea's leaders \nshould be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. The United Nations \nhas found that North Korea is committing systematic, widespread and \ngross human rights violations against its own people. The regime \nselectively distributes food to privileged individuals and routinely \nuses starvation to punish dissent. Torture, forced disappearances, and \ninhumane detention conditions are routine. In the past, the regime even \njailed three generations of dissidents on the concept of guilt by \nassociation. In its prison camps alone, the United Nations estimates \nthat hundreds of thousands of dissidents have died.\n  One anecdote from the U.N.'s report demonstrates the total and \ndiabolical suffering put upon the North Korean people under this \nregime. Ordinary Koreans must go to extraordinary lengths to survive, \nincluding prostitution, theft, and smuggling.\n  A U.N. investigator was told of an instance when a woman was pulled \noff a train, and a dead, small child--no more than 2 years old--was \nstrapped to her back. State security suspected the woman was smuggling \ncopper but could find no evidence. After interrogating the woman for \nsome time, they asked her to place her child on a desk before them. The \nwoman then broke down and began to cry.\n  When she finally placed the quiet, dead child on the desk, the \nofficials noticed its stomach was red. They then opened the child's \nstomach and found about 2 kilograms of copper inside. To survive, this \nwoman was forced to smuggle copper in her own dead child's stomach. No \nmother anywhere on Earth should be forced to such extremes.\n  When it comes to the international response to North Korea and its \nprovocative behavior, I very much regret that China has not seen fit to \ndo more. In my view, China, in its size and capability, has the ability \nto rein in North Korea and is probably the only country in the region \nthat can do so.\n  North Korea's nuclear test facilities are close to China's border. \nJust like Japan and South Korea, China's security is threatened by an \nunstable nuclear power in its neighborhood. Yet China continues to \nprovide the fuel, food, trade, and international protection that \nsustains Mr. Kim's government.\n  In my meetings with China's Ambassador Cui in Washington, DC, I have \nexpressed to him that China can and must do more. I have tried to \nimpress upon him that a nuclear-armed North Korea, with ever-increasing \nweapons, is not in China's security interests.\n  The United States cannot sit in silence in the face of North Korea's \never-advancing nuclear and missile programs. For some, Iran has been a \nbig threat. For me, reading the intelligence and seeing the progress \nover the years of North Korea's nuclear arsenal, I believe North Korea \nis a very serious threat to the well-being of this country. We must \nprotect and reassure our allies in the region. That may include placing \nmore advanced missile defenses, both in South Korea and Japan, as well \nas closer trilateral military cooperation with these countries.\n  The fact that the North Korean Government has resisted international \novertures and condemnation leaves us little choice. So I come to the \nfloor today to support the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enforcement \nAct of 2016. This bill will impose mandatory sanctions against North \nKorean persons and entities involved in weapons of mass destruction \ndevelopment, delivery, and proliferation; serious human rights abuses; \ntrade in luxury goods; money laundering; smuggling; and narcotics \ntrafficking. This legislation alone, though, will not cease North \nKorea's illegal activities. However, it is the beginning of a more \ncomprehensive response to North Korea's increasingly dangerous \nbehavior.\n\n  I thank the chairman and his committee for bringing forward this \nlegislation. I certainly intend to support it. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to take one moment to thank Senator \nFeinstein, who knows so much about the intelligence around this and has \nspent a great deal of her Senate career making sure she does, and she \nunderstands China probably as much as any Senator here. She has been \ninvolved in all kinds of bilateral meetings and discussions and has led \nthe Senate in many ways in understanding what is happening within the \ncountry. So her comments--especially today with this important piece of \nlegislation--are certainly well-received and appreciated. Again, we \nthank her for what she does to help keep our country safe and for her \ndiligent efforts on the Intelligence Committee.\n  I know Senator Markey is next in line to speak. Before he does, I \nwish to thank him for his contributions to making this bill better. He \namended the bill. I think he has other amendments he would like to see \nhappen at some time.\n  I would say that there is probably no one here who focuses more on \nproliferation and ensuring that rogue countries--and actually some that \naren't even so rogue but that have rogue constituents within their \ncountries--don't continue to proliferate by sharing information, \nsharing technology, and sharing assets with other countries. So I thank \nhim for his contribution in bringing this bill to the floor today, and \nI look forward to his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, the gentleman from Tennessee, for the \nfocus he has brought to these issues of nuclear proliferation and for \nhis great service to our country, having all of our people understand \nthe threats that can come from Iran, from North Korea, and from other \nplaces across our planet. It is the ultimate issue. If we get it wrong, \nthe consequences will be catastrophic. So I thank the chairman for \ncontinuing to have the hearings and continuing to develop legislation \nthat focuses our people on this issue. We are the global leader. We \nhave to set the example for the rest of the world to follow. I thank \nhim for his great leadership on these issues.\n  The sanctions in this bill represent a firm response to North Korea's \nlatest nuclear test on January 6 and to its launch of a long-range \nrocket last weekend. These brazen actions remind us of the serious \nthreat Pyongyang poses to global and regional security and underscore \nthe urgency of ending North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n  Together with our international partners, we must be vigilant against \nNorth Korea's development of boosted nuclear bombs which would allow \nKim Jong Un's regime to shrink its weapons and load them onto missiles. \nAnd we must unequivocally convey to North Korea that any proliferation \nof nuclear technologies to other countries will lead to the gravest of \nconsequences.\n  North Korea's nuclear and missile programs violate numerous U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions. Those include Resolution 2094, which \nrequired North Korea to abandon ``all nuclear weapons and existing \nnuclear programs'' and imposed sanctions to pressure Kim to return to \ndisarmament negotiations. These measures have not yet persuaded Kim to \nabandon his nuclear ambitions, in part because major gaps remain in the \nsanctions regime, particularly its enforcement by China.\n  In 2009 the Security Council imposed a conventional arms embargo on \nNorth Korea, but China insisted on a loophole allowing North Korea to \nimport ``small arms and light weapons.'' North Korea has exploited this \nloophole to continue its lucrative international trade in conventional \narms. According to the U.N.'s own council of experts on North Korea, \nthis trade remains ``one of the\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\ncountry's most profitable revenue sources.'' North Korea is especially \nwell known for purchasing light weapons from China, which it then sells \nto other countries for cash.\n  Although North Korea's arms exports violate U.N. sanctions, the \nChinese companies that sell the arms in the first place get off scot-\nfree. The involvement of Chinese companies in North Korean arms \nsmuggling is part of a larger pattern of China's lax enforcement of \nnonproliferation sanctions against North Korea.\n  As Assistant Secretary of State Tom Countryman acknowledged in a \nForeign Relations Committee hearing last May and again in December, \nChinese entities continue to sell technologies to North Korea that \ncould assist in its development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. \nChina's efforts to clamp down on these activities remain feeble at \nbest.\n  If the United States is to continue to provide extensive assistance \nto China's nuclear power industry, China must in return crack down on \nthose who enable North Korea's nuclear provocations and its weapons-\nsmuggling networks.\n  The United States must also take action on our own. That is why I \nworked to include an amendment in this bill that will impose sanctions \non anyone who facilitates North Korea's arms trade, including Chinese \ncorporations. My provision will further reduce North Korea's access to \nrevenue, undermine its international arms smuggling, and put pressure \non Kim to return to negotiations.\n  We must also put financial pressure on North Korea by designating the \ncountry as a ``primary money laundering concern.'' This would allow the \nTreasury Department to exclude North Korea from using the dollar-based \nfinancial system. The use of this designation in 2005 against the Banco \nDelta Asia in Macao disrupted North Korea's access to revenue and led \none North Korean negotiator to admit that ``you finally found a way to \nhurt us.''\n  North Korea is one of the leading counterfeiters of U.S. currency. It \nuses front companies to hide its illicit earnings from trade in \nnarcotics, weapons, and proliferation technologies. Although the \nTreasury has designated 18 financial institutions and 4 countries--\nincluding Iran--as primary money laundering concerns, it has never \ndesignated North Korea. For this reason, I filed an amendment in the \nForeign Relations Committee--which I will work to include in the final \nversion of this bill--that would require the Treasury Secretary to \ndetermine on an annual basis whether North Korea is a primary money \nlaundering concern and to provide Congress with information about that \ndetermination, as well as any financial restrictions that result from \nit.\n  Just as we protect the international financial system from North \nKorea's counterfeit currency and money laundering, we must protect \nAmerican investors who may unknowingly invest their money in companies \nthat do business with North Korea. The prospect of American companies \ninvesting in North Korea is quite real. One American company, Firebird \nManagement, has publicly declared its intention to invest in North \nKorea's oil industry.\n  That is why I introduced another amendment in committee that would \nrequire companies that issue securities in the United States to \nannually disclose any investments in North Korea to the Securities and \nExchange Commission. This requirement would not impose any regulatory \nburden on companies that do not invest in North Korea, but those \ncompanies that do should have that information made public because the \nAmerican people deserve to know which American companies are investing \nin North Korea. Again, I hope to strengthen this bill down the line by \nincorporating that requirement.\n  We know that sanctions are not an end in and of themselves; rather, \nthey are meant to pressure the Kim regime to return to disarmament \nnegotiations. But at the same time, as we pursue that critical goal, we \nmust work to reduce the risk that North Korea will use its nuclear \nweapon, whether deliberately or through miscalculation.\n  First and foremost, we must make clear to Kim that his regime will \nnot survive any use of nuclear weapons. We must also reduce the risk of \nKim lashing out in desperation. If he comes to believe that we intend \nto destroy his nuclear weapons in a preventive war, he will face \npressure to ``use them or lose them.'' Thus, even as we work to deter \nKim, we must establish a means of communicating during crises to avoid \nthe risk of accidental nuclear war. Ensuring deescalation at the same \ntime as we pursue deterrence and denuclearization will not be easy. \nNevertheless, given the devastating consequences of nuclear war, it is \ncritical that we take a comprehensive approach.\n  Without additional sanctions, Kim will never disarm, but without a \nmeans of controlling escalation, we could one day wake up to a nuclear \ndisaster that no one wants and everyone would lament. We should work on \na continuous basis to make sure that--in the same way the Soviet \nPresident and the President of the United States were able to \ncommunicate to reduce the likelihood that we would have an accidental \nnuclear war, we have to make sure we have done everything in our power \nto accomplish the same goal with the North Korean Government, whether \nwe like them or not.\n  I want to compliment the chairman, the Senator from Colorado, and the \nSenator from New Jersey for their great work on this legislation. It is \ngoing to be a long struggle to ultimately deal with that regime. I \nthink we will have to return to it over and over again, but I think, as \nwe are going forward, it is critical--through the Chinese or through \nothers--to make sure we have maximum communication. We could have an \naccidental nuclear war. It could happen. We have to make sure that is \navoided.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I think Senator Capito is on her way down \nand is the next speaker. While we have a moment, I want to thank \nSenator Gardner in his presence. And on an issue that is important to \nnot just our security but the world's security, I thank Senator \nMenendez for taking leadership in the way that he has and for working \nwith Senator Gardner, Senator Cardin, and me to make sure we ended up \nwith something that I believe is going to receive warm support. These \nare issues he has been concerned about for a long time. He has not only \nbeen concerned about them, he has shown leadership in putting together \npolicies to combat them. Senator Gardner knows and said earlier that \neven though this is a step--we all know it is a big step, really, \nespecially with the U.N. Security Council unwilling to take actions in \nlight of the violations that have occurred. There is going to be a lot \nof diligence that will be necessary to get in what we want to get in, \nbut this is certainly a significant step, and I thank him for his \nefforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. Earlier when the \nchairman couldn't be on the floor, I thanked him for his leadership in \nthe committee, for creating an environment that is bipartisan. At a \ntime in which bipartisanship in the Senate is a continuing challenge, \nit is particularly important in foreign relations--something that I \ntried to set out when I was a chairman. I appreciate the way his \nleadership has led the committee so that we could have moments like \nthis and of course Senator Gardner, who has very graciously worked \ntogether with me to bring a moment of what I hope will be an \noverwhelmingly, maybe unanimous vote in the Senate, because when we do \nthat we send an incredibly strong message throughout the world. We \ngenerate leadership, where we may not see the will at the United \nNations, particularly because of the Security Council's structure and \nthe vetoes that exist on things like sanctions. Inevitably, when we \nhave led as a country, we often get the world to join us and follow it, \nbut sometimes it needs you to lead.\n\n  That is what I believe the Senate is doing today with an incredibly \nstrong piece of legislation that, as I said earlier, was the most \ncomprehensive strategy set to try to deal with the challenge that is \nNorth Korea itself. I appreciate the chairman's words and his \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\nspeak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Bill\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to an \nupcoming cloture vote on the conference report for the Trade \nFacilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, commonly known as the Customs \nconference report. This vote is expected tomorrow.\n  While I am supportive of the conference report as it relates to the \nCustoms legislation, added to the bill at the last minute is a measure \nknown as the Internet Tax Freedom Act or ITFA for short. ITFA would put \nin place a moratorium to permanently prevent State and local entities \nfrom imposing existing sales and use taxes on Internet services.\n  In the past, I have expressed my support for ITFA as long as it was \ntied to the Marketplace Fairness Act, or MFA, which would allow State \nand local governments to collect sales and use taxes from online \nretailers without a physical presence within their State.\n  In South Dakota, this is a matter of fairness to the families who own \nsmall businesses and support our local communities. They collect sales \ntaxes on their products and on their services. Internet sales providers \nare not required to provide a collection service for those States for \nservices or products that are being delivered into those States. It \nrequires congressional action in order to allow them to accomplish \nthis.\n  Pairing these plans would have been a net benefit for States, local \ngovernments, and small business owners who are already required to \ncollect sales and use taxes on their products and services. Together \nthey would represent sound tax policy, but that is not what we are \ndoing with the Customs conference report by including ITFA and not \nincluding the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  ITFA, enacted by itself, would put in place a moratorium to \npermanently promote State and local entities from imposing taxes on \nInternet services at the State and local level with no consideration or \noffset for the tax revenue lost by States or local governments that \nalready collect many of these taxes.\n  I am all for cutting taxes, but I am also a strong proponent for the \nTenth Amendment and local control and tax fairness for South Dakota \nbusinesses. In places like South Dakota, we are actually pretty good at \nbalancing budgets. In fact, we are required do it every single year. \nWashington has no business telling States or city commissioners how to \nrun their books.\n  ITFA has zero impact on the Federal budget, but it really impacts \nStates and local communities. I believe ITFA paired with the \nMarketplace Fairness Act continues to make sense. One without the other \ndoes not.\n  My opposition is not based on disagreement over Internet access. We \nneed it. We should make it available. My opposition is based on the \nprinciple that we are taking away important revenue sources for State \nand local governments without any means for them to recoup their losses \nso they can continue to provide essential services to our communities.\n  Let me explain why sound and comprehensive tax policy is so important \nand why ITFA and MFA should continue to be a package deal. If the \nPresident signs a Customs conference report into law in its current \nform with ITFA attached to it, municipalities in my home State, South \nDakota, will lose $4.3 million in revenue annually. That is a revenue \nthey rely on to fund essential services, such as training for \nfirefighters and police officers, maintenance for parks, upkeep of \ncommunity centers and libraries, and repairs to critical roads and \nbridges.\n  Without any way of recouping the loss, local leaders will be forced \nto make a tough decision to cut those important services to the \ncommunity or to raise other taxes. Why is Washington making this \ndecision?\n  In addition to municipalities losing out on important funds, the \nState of South Dakota would also lose out to the tune of $9.3 million \nannually. Maybe in Washington DC we don't care about $9.3 million, but \nin South Dakota they do. Well, we don't balance our budget, but every \nsingle State out there or just about every State does.\n  When we step back in and we tell them we are going to unilaterally \ntake away one source of revenue, but we still expect them to provide \nthe services, it seems to me we are moving in the wrong direction. We \ndon't have the luxury of South Dakota punting. We are required to \nbalance our books every year. At the State and local level, every \nsingle dollar counts.\n  Singled out, it is not right for the Federal Government to dictate \nState and local budgets, as the ITFA part of the conference reports \nattempts to do, to cut a State and local revenue source.\n  It is unfair to States like ours, which operate under tight budgets \nand stretch every dollar to the maximum. In fact, in South Dakota we \naren't overtaxing. Our State burden is the second lowest in the Nation. \nWe don't have an income tax. We rely on a very broad sales tax. That is \nthe way our people have wanted to do it. That is why conventional \nwisdom in this body and elsewhere has always been the ITFA, which would \nstop taxing the cost of Internet services, would be paired with the \nMFA--the Marketplace Fairness Act--because MFA lets State and local \ngovernments recover the losses from ITFA.\n  MFA would make certain that Main Street businesses aren't at a \ncompetitive disadvantage to companies that have no physical presence, \nemployees or investments in States such as South Dakota because right \nnow they don't have to collect that sales tax or the use tax for \nproducts that are being delivered into the State. Brick-and-mortar \nbusinesses have that requirement.\n  Right now Main Street businesses are operating under a disadvantage. \nMFA would level the playing field. These brick-and-mortar stores are \nthe businesses that provide good-paying jobs in South Dakota, pay local \nproperty taxes, sponsor community baseball leagues, and send their kids \nand grandkids to South Dakota schools and invest in the future of our \nState.\n  We have an opportunity to level the playing field for them, rather \nthan picking winners and losers so they can continue to be successful \nand enrich the lives of South Dakotans. Let's let the States and local \ngovernments decide how to manage their finances.\n  Under MFA, South Dakota would bring in approximately $25 million in \nnew tax revenue, which would more than make up for the losses under \nITFA. If we pass ITFA without MFA, it dramatically decreases the chance \nof MFA being passed in the years to come, which is a huge blow to the \nmom-and-pop businesses who are struggling to compete with online \nvendors.\n  MFA passing the Senate without ITFA is unlikely dead on arrival in \nthe House. ITFA would see a similar fate if not dumped into the Customs \nconference report. It would not pass the Senate alone. There is simply \nno evidence to suggest that either measure would pass as stand-alone \nlegislation, but together sound tax policy would move.\n  That is why it is so important that ITFA not be implemented without \nalso implementing the Marketplace Fairness Act. Together the two can \nmake a real impact on the lives of South Dakotans and all Americans by \nproviding permanent tax relief to South Dakota families, leveling the \nfield of play for brick-and-mortar businesses that are contending with \nan increasingly competitive online marketplace and at the same time \nassure State and local governments can continue to provide essential \nservices to their constituents while balancing their budgets. That is \nsomething we could learn a lot about. Because the Customs conference \nreport includes only ITFA and fails to address MFA, I will open oppose \ncloture on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to join me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on \nlegislation to significantly expand sanctions against North Korea in \nresponse to the country's dangerous provocations in recent months. This \nlegislation has my strong support. In light of North Korea's recent \nactions, it is time we act decisively and call on the international \ncommunity, particularly the U.N. Security Council in China, to do the \nsame.\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\n  On January 6, North Korea conducted a nuclear test involving the \nunderground detonation of a nuclear weapon. One month later, on \nFebruary 7, they effectively conducted a long-range missile test under \nthe guise of a satellite launch. Just yesterday in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \ntestified that North Korea has expanded a uranium enrichment facility \nand restarted a plutonium reactor capable of providing fissile material \nfor nuclear weapons.\n  Together these actions point to a dangerous trend of advancing and \nexpanding North Korea's nuclear weapons program. While the antics of \nKim Jong Un and his cronies may seem outlandish, the threat posed by \nNorth Korea should be taken seriously. Though open-source assessments \ncast doubt on Kim Jong Un's claim that he detonated a hydrogen bomb in \nJanuary, the fact remains North Korea tested a nuclear weapon that \ncaused a magnitude 5.1 earthquake.\n  Though the satellite North Korea fired into space spent yesterday \ntumbling in orbit and it may be unusable, the fact remains that \naccording to South Korean officials, if the rocket launched by North \nKorea on Sunday were successfully reconfigured as a missile, it could \nfly more than 7,400 miles. That is far enough to reach the shores of \nthe United States.\n  Although North Korea has never tested a long-range ballistic missile \ncapable of delivering a nuclear warhead, there can be no question that \nKim Jong Un is intent on building up a nuclear arsenal capable of \nstriking the United States.\n  In my role as ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I \nwas in South Korea last July. I listened to the input of General \nScaparrotti, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea. I heard from our \nservicemembers at Yongsan and Osan, and I sat with South Korea's \nDefense Minister to discuss our shared interests and the importance of \nthis critical alliance. I then traveled directly to Beijing to meet \nwith Rear Admiral Li Ji of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense. We \nhad a frank and meaningful conversation about these topics. Despite our \nmany differences, it is not in the interest of either the United States \nor China to have a nuclear-armed North Korea destabilizing Asia and \ndestabilizing the globe with irresponsible rhetoric and dangerous \nactions.\n  It is my sincere hope that the U.N. Security Council and our \ninternational partners will follow our lead to expand international \nsanctions against North Korea, applying the lessons we learned in \nblocking Iran's nuclear program. In the meantime, we must continue to \nenhance our missile defense systems both at home and abroad.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Sessions to continue our \nbipartisan work on the Armed Services Committee, to provide necessary \nresources to the Missile Defense Agency, and to fulfill our commitment \nto key allies. We must continue to advance MDA's efforts to deploy \nadditional sensors and to improve the reliability and effectiveness of \nground-based interceptors.\n  This has the potential to be a pivotal moment for the international \neffort to counter North Korea's nuclear program, but the United States \nmust lead the way. Strategic patience has worn thin, and it is time to \nact, by expanding tough sanctions, by strengthening our missile defense \nprograms, and by calling on the international community--and especially \nChina--to act responsibly and decisively in the face of the threat Kim \nJong Un poses to global security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the pending legislation to enact tougher \nsanctions on North Korea is a welcome development as Congress once \nagain begins to assert its role in defending national security and \ncurtailing the growing number of nuclear weapons around the globe.\n  In the decade since North Korea's first successful nuclear test, the \nthreat of nuclear proliferation has not diminished. The United States \nconcluded an agreement with Iran that leaves its nuclear infrastructure \nin place, causing others in the region to declare their own interest in \nobtaining nuclear weapons.\n  Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is the fastest growing in the world, and \nit continues to destabilize the region through its ties to terrorist \norganizations. North Korea continues to build its nuclear stockpile and \nits ability to deliver future weapons.\n  In all three of these circumstances, Congress has been the source of \npressure on these nations by enacting tougher sanctions on Iran, \nplacing a hold on security funding for Pakistan, and now this \nlegislation today builds on those previous efforts. The results may \nvary, but as I see it, my colleagues in this Chamber and in the House \nhave been much more proactive than the administration in imposing costs \nfor failing to adhere to international norms.\n  President Obama's approach of strategic patience has failed to \naccomplish the objective of bringing North Korea back to the \nnegotiating table, and there is certainly no agreement by them to \ndismantle their nuclear arsenal and their nuclear program. North Korea \nhas tested three nuclear weapons on the President's watch, and some \nexperts believe its stockpile could grow to 100 weapons by 2020--from \n10 to 15 weapons today. In addition to nuclear weapons, the regime is \nbelieved to possess chemical and biological weapons.\n  North Korea is advancing in missile technology and has engaged in \ncyber attacks against South Korea, Japan, and American entities. North \nKorean missiles might not yet be able to reach the continental United \nStates, but American servicemembers stationed in South Korea and Japan \nand tens of millions of innocent lives are menaced by the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction in the possession of an aggressive regime \nwith little regard for what the world thinks of it.\n  The Arms Control Association notes: ``North Korea has been a key \nsupplier of missiles and missile technology to countries in the \ndeveloping world, particularly in politically unstable regions such as \nthe Middle East and South Asia.'' The recipients of such expertise are \nsaid to be Pakistan and Iran, among others. In fact, American \nintelligence judged the Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by the Israeli \nAir Force in 2007 to have been constructed with North Korean \nassistance.\n  Equally worthy of attention is the brutal treatment by Kim Jong Un's \nregime of its own people. Just 2 years ago, the U.N. Human Rights \nCouncil published a report concluding that ``the gravity, scale, and \nnature of these violations reveal a State that does not have any \nparallel in the contemporary world.''\n  It would be disingenuous to stand here and place all the blame on the \nPresident or the administration. North Korea is one of the most \ndifficult nations in the world to understand and regional complexities \nmake it difficult to find a solution.\n  North Korea took advantage of lapses in American resolve during both \nthe Clinton and Bush administrations by conducting its first nuclear \ntest in 2006. Nevertheless, it is obvious to me that a change in \napproach is necessary. ``Strategic patience'' has been exhausted. \nStronger measures are necessary. While the ideal approach is to work in \nconcert with the U.N. Security Council, we cannot afford to wait for \nconsensus on punitive measures from the U.N. that may never come.\n  The legislation that the Senate will pass today in a strong, \nbipartisan fashion seeks to compel Kim Jong Un to return to \nnegotiations. My colleagues have written legislation that ensures \nsanctions are mandatory--to be waived only on a case-by-case basis that \nrequires a written explanation justifying the waiver.\n  The secondary sanctions will penalize those outside of North Korea \nwho assist in the regime's nefarious behavior. Without China's support \nin restricting North Korea's ambition, America and the world face an \nuphill battle. Up to this point, China has believed that an unstable \nNorth Korea is more dangerous than a North Korea with an advanced \nnuclear program; therefore, the enforcement of secondary sanctions is a \nnecessary step to seek cooperation in dismantling their nuclear \nprogram.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes language to deter and punish \ncyber attacks by codifying sanctions as well as requiring the President \nto offer a counterstrategy to North Korea's cyber\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\ncapabilities. The ongoing cyber activities are damaging to our security \nand our economy as well as the economy and security of our friends. The \nbill also attempts to address the deplorable treatment of the North \nKorean people by their own government.\n  This legislation is certainly not without risk. China may retaliate \nin some manner, North Korea may become even more bellicose, and it \ncould very well fail to pressure Kim's regime to surrender its nuclear \nprogram. Yet it is painfully clear that the status quo is not working \nand that global security is imperiled as our government stands by.\n  Fear of risk and failure will not stop us from exhausting all \npeaceful options to curb nuclear proliferation. Every effort must be \nmade to convince North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons. Congress \nis once again doing its part in the fight against proliferation.\n  Chairman Corker, Senator Gardner, and the members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee ought to be commended for their leadership on this \nissue, and I look forward to joining them in passing legislation later \ntoday that will put teeth to American diplomacy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nlegislation to sanction the regime of North Korea for its belligerent \nbehavior toward the United States and its neighbors. Today the Senate \ntakes up a bill to increase sanctions on North Korea.\n  Most Americans would be surprised, I think, to learn it is still \npossible to increase and strengthen sanctions on North Korea. In fact, \nwhile we have had certain sanctions on North Korea in place for many \nyears, these sanctions have never been as strong as they could be and \nshould be, and that is why we are here today.\n  We are now dealing with a third generation of dictators in Kim Jong \nUn, who is proving to be as disastrous as his infamous father and \ngrandfather, Kim Il-sung, the founder of the Kim regime. The Kim family \nhas done whatever it thought necessary to stay in power, including use \nof criminal enterprise to raise revenues and engage in systematic human \nrights abuses against its own people.\n  The legislation before us today requires the President to sanction \nanyone contributing to North Korea's weapons program, money laundering \nactivities, and human rights abuses. It also requires sanctions on \nanyone helping North Korea raise hard currency through the sale of \nminerals and precious metals.\n  Additionally, the bill requires sanctions on anyone engaging in \nactivities that would threaten cyber security. Perhaps most \nimportantly, the legislation urges the administration to designate \nNorth Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern--a \nstep that would block links between North Korea and the U.S. banking \nsystem. This is a very powerful sanction. If someone is doing business \nwith the Kim regime, they should not be doing business with the United \nStates banking system.\n  We need to pass this bill and push the administration to leverage the \npower of the Treasury Department to cut North Korea from the \ninternational banking system. As I have said, this is a very strong and \npowerful sanction. It needs to be put in place and then fully enforced \nby the administration.\n  The imposition of sanctions, however, cannot be the end of our North \nKorea policy. As we have seen over the past few months, the Kim regime \nis intent upon disrupting the East Asian security environment, \nthreatening both the United States and our allies with ballistic \nmissiles and nuclear weapons.\n  Sanctions can work, but they must be enforced and they will take \ntime. In addition, we need to augment these sanctions with other steps \nto limit the North Korean threat.\n  First, we should accelerate efforts to develop missile defenses both \nin East Asia and in the United States. Sanctions can curtail progress \nin North Korea's nuclear and missile programs; however, we must deal \nwith the capabilities North Korea already has. We must ensure we are \nprepared for any further advancements North Korea might make before the \nsanctions take hold.\n  Second, we need to ensure that we have a credible and reliable \nnuclear force available to deter North Korea and reassure our South \nKorean and Japanese allies. In 2014, and again earlier this year, a \nnuclear-capable B-52 flew over the Korean Peninsula to perform this \nvital deterrence and assurance mission. But to maintain strategic \ncredibility, we must modernize our bomber fleet and our nuclear cruise \nmissiles.\n  To bring the Nation's bombers up to date, the Air Force is embarking \non plans to develop a new Long Range Strike Bomber capable of \npenetrating advanced enemy air defenses. North Korea's increasingly \nprovocative behavior underscores our need for a bomber that can fly \nover any North Korean target. Now is the time to get to work on the \nLong Range Strike Bomber program.\n  Similarly, we need to upgrade the nuclear cruise missile carried on \nthe B-52 bomber. Cruise missiles fired from a distance allow us the \noption of threatening North Korean targets without flying over North \nKorean airspace. This standoff capability is tremendously important, \nbut the existing nuclear cruise missile is based on 1970's technology \nand is well beyond its intended service life. We need to ensure that \nthe Air Force has the resources necessary to develop a new cruise \nmissile that can defeat modern air defense systems for decades to come.\n  We also need to ensure that the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration has the resources it needs to refurbish the warhead that \nflies on the cruise missile. Letting our bomber and cruise missile \ncapabilities become obsolete would send a disastrous signal to the Kim \nregime that its nuclear program has yielded strategic benefits. On the \nother hand, modernizing our forces shows Mr. Kim that he will never get \na nuclear upper hand in East Asia.\n  The bottom line is that we need a holistic approach to North Korea. \nWe need the sanctions that we are considering here today in the Senate. \nWe need a strong, strategic deterrent, as I have described.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the sanctions in front of us to put \npressure on North Korea financially. This needs to be a comprehensive, \nongoing, sustained effort. We have to stand strong against our \nadversaries and stand strong with our allies, we have to do it \nconsistently, we have to do it over time, and we have to be steadfast. \nThat is the type of foreign policy that can be effective. That is the \nkind of foreign policy we need to undertake. That is what we are trying \nto accomplish with this legislation.\n  I commend the sponsors of this legislation who are here on the floor \ntoday.\n  I further hope that my colleagues will support not only this \nlegislation but critical investments in our nuclear bombers and cruise \nmissile forces when we consider the annual Defense bills later this \nyear. I am very familiar with these systems as the B-52s are based on \nMinot Air Force Base in my State. They provide a tremendous deterrent \nand a very important part of the nuclear triad, but we have to continue \nto invest in that nuclear triad--in the bombers, in the ICBM missiles, \nand in our submarine fleet.\n  I believe that both sanctions and a strong military are critical to \nour national security and that of our allies, as well as maintaining \nstability in this potentially volatile part of the world. As we have \nsaid before, the United States is the world's best hope for freedom, \nfor peace, and for security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, we have heard from a number of \ncolleagues who have come to the floor in support of the legislation \nbefore us today, the North Korea sanctions legislation. Members of both \nsides of the\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\naisle recognize the need to address the forgotten maniac in North \nKorea.\n  We have also heard Members speak about a number of firsts that this \nlegislation contemplates--the first time that this would put in place \nmandatory cyber sanctions for cyber attacks. This is something that \napplies, yes, to North Korea today but in the future could apply to any \nnation that wishes to use its means to attack the United States or our \nbusinesses. So it is critically important, that piece of legislation \nthat we are going to pass today that can have a lasting impact on the \nsecurity of this country.\n  We have also heard from a number of Members who have spoken about \ntheir concern with China. This legislation is not targeted at China; \nthis legislation is targeted at North Korea. We have talked about how \nit is not targeted at the North Korean people but at the regime of Kim \nJong Un. The legislation does everything we can to try to give the \npeople of North Korea a better way of life; to try to find ways to \ncommunicate, to break down the silence they are faced with in this \neconomic deprivation zone; to give them tools, perhaps radios and cell \nphone technology so they can find out what is happening beyond the \nconfines of the torturous regime. But it does have an impact on those \nwho try to get around the sanctions and the prohibited activities of \nthe legislation--in fact, some of the strongest language in the \nlegislation, whether exporting to or from North Korea, whether \nexporting to or importing from North Korea goods, raw metals, precious \nmaterials that can be funneled--the money from that funneled to weapons \nof mass destruction and other activities prohibited by the legislation. \nSo when North Korea is exporting gold or coal--and we know that gold \nand coal are chiefly responsible for the North Korean foreign currency \nreserves--then that could be designated as a sanctioned entity under \nthe legislation. Perhaps those entities are in China.\n  The fact is, we need cooperation with China. We need cooperation with \nJapan and South Korea. We had that so strongly, and there is a \npossibility we won't. We have an opportunity for trilateral alliance--\nthat is cooperation between the three nations--and that will allow us \nto work together, to share intelligence, to share the cooperative \nefforts and exercises when it comes to North Korea, and to work with \nChina to help make sure that it is sticking by what it says it wants to \ndo, which is to denuclearize the North Korean regime peacefully. I \nthink it is key to our cooperation with China as we work on any number \nof issues, whether it is trade issues, whether it is issues dealing \nwith the Internet, whether it is issues dealing with the South China \nSea.\n  Those are things that we continue to work with China on and are \nworking to resolve, but we also have to make sure part of that \nconversation is North Korea. China controls a tremendous number of \nlevers and power in North Korea. Ninety percent of their economic \nactivities in North Korea can find their way to some way of subsistence \nwith China, to create a reliance on China, an economic reliance that \nthey have right now.\n  So this legislation will target those who are doing too much to \nempower the Kim Jong Un regime and to give them the money they have \nused to develop missiles and to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  Just to give an example of some of the commodity trade that we have \nseen, trade commodity sanctions in this bill would address the issue of \nrare earth minerals and coal and steel and other goods that are \nexported to other countries to earn foreign currencies for the North \nKorea regime. To give people an idea of how much money that is, expert \nestimates put rare earth minerals and steel exports at around $1.8 \nbillion and $245 million respectively. That is a lot of money that the \nregime is currently getting from outside in trading these goods. But if \nthat $1.8 billion and that $245 million goes back to build weapons of \nmass destruction, this act will begin sanctions. The President is \nrequired to, unless the issue is a very narrow, case-by-case national \nsecurity issue. There is a mandatory investigation into those \nactivities. So I think this is a strong step that is receiving \ntremendous bipartisan support.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, we have been discussing some of the \nopportunities to strengthen the alliance between Japan and South Korea \nand the United States. In the legislation before us today is language \nthat addresses the trilateral cooperation between the United States, \nSouth Korea, and Japan; that we would seek to strengthen a high level \nof trilateral mechanisms for discussion and coordination of our \npolicies toward North Korea; that we would work between the Government \nof the United States, the Government of South Korea, and the Government \nof Japan to meet these goals to ensure that the mechanisms North Korea \nis using when it comes to nuclear, ballistic, and conventional weapons \nprograms are addressed by the three nations; that we address together \nin this trilateral alliance the human rights record, the atrocities of \nNorth Korea, and cyber security threats posed by North Korea.\n  It also talks about in the legislation before us that the United \nStates, Korea, and Japan will meet on a regular basis. The legislation \nencourages that the United States and the trilateral alliance meet \ntogether, including the Department of State, the Department of Defense, \nthe intelligence community, and representatives of counterpart agencies \nin South Korea and Japan, so that we can continue to focus our efforts \non the trilateral alliance.\n  If you look at the conversations taking place today, we have heard \nour colleague from Hawaii, Senator Schatz, talk about the need for \ncooperation when it comes to THAAD. We talked about the concern that \nour allies, neighbors of North Korea, have when it comes to their air \ndefense systems and how they are going to protect themselves from a \npossible missile strike from North Korea. Those conversations are \ncontinuing. We talked about continued and extraordinary cooperation \nopportunities we have in sharing intelligence among the three nations.\n  It all comes on the heels of what has been over the past year--last \nyear, in particular, with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War \nII--some recognition of the historical complexity in the relationship \nbetween Japan and South Korea. Late last year and early this year we \nsaw an agreement entered into by Japan and South Korea to address some \nof those historical complexities. That agreement was a new step forward \nin cooperation, in terms of working through these complexities.\n  That activity was followed shortly thereafter by North Korea's fourth \nnuclear test. What a great statement it was for Japan and South Korea \nto begin finding solutions to these historical complexities at a time \nthat perhaps is needed now more than ever because of the challenges \nthat their neighbor in the north poses to them.\n  While we work together to find ways to protect our allies and to \nassure them that our alliance and our commitment remains stronger than \never, we have to make sure we are continuing to focus on our trilateral \nalliance and on the efforts we have there.\n  I know the Senator from Minnesota is on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, today I join my colleagues in support \nof the North Korean Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. I commend \nSenator Gardner for his leadership, as well as Senator Menendez, \nChairman Corker, and Ranking Member Cardin for their leadership on this \nlegislation, because protecting the American people and others in the \nregion from national security threats like North Korea should, in fact, \nbe our top priority.\n  The reason there is overwhelming bipartisan support for strong \nsanctions legislation against North Korea is because there is \nabsolutely no doubt that North Korea is a well-established threat in \nthe region. North Korea threatens global peace and security.\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nExperts at the United States-Korea Institute estimate that North Korea \nhas 20 to 100 nuclear weapons. Since 2006, North Korea has tested four \nnuclear bombs.\n  Last month North Korea claims to have tested a hydrogen bomb. While \nour analysts in the United States are skeptical that it was in fact a \nhydrogen bomb, it was a nuclear bomb all the same. With each test, \nNorth Korea gets closer to testing a nuclear bomb small enough to fit \non a long-range missile--the very same kind of missile that North Korea \nused over the weekend to launch a satellite into outer space. That \nmissile has a range of 5,600 miles. That means that Alaska, California, \nand the rest of the west coast of the United States is actually within \nrange of a North Korean bomb. Our European allies and Australia are \nalso within range of a North Korean bomb. And, of course, Japan and \nSouth Korea--two of our key allies in East Asia--are closest to the \ndanger North Korea poses. It is in our national security interests to \nprotect these vital allies.\n  It is not just North Korea's nuclear threat that we need to be \nconcerned about. North Korea funds its weapons regime through human \ntrafficking--something I care deeply about--through the production of \nillegal drugs and selling counterfeit U.S. currency. North Korea is \nalso one of the largest suppliers of the arms trade and has become the \nbargain-basement emporium for old Soviet weapons systems. North Korea \nhas a pattern of shipping these illegal weapons on to terrorists in the \nMiddle East.\n  North Korea also threatens our cyber security. North Korea's cyber \nattack on the Sony Corporation of America in 2014, which leaked private \ncommunications and destroyed the company's data systems, cost Sony, an \nAmerican company, more than $35 million. Why this company? Because the \ncompany produced a movie that mocked North Korea's leadership.\n  Last summer North Korea pledged to follow up on its attack on Sony \nwith more cyber attacks, promising to ``wage a cyber war against the \nU.S. to hasten its ruin.''\n  America is not the only target for North Korea's cyber attacks. In \n2013, North Korea launched a cyber attack on three major South Korean \nbanks, and two of South Korea's largest broadcasters were temporarily \nshut down after a cyber attack. This cost South Korea an estimated $720 \nmillion. This is real money and real jobs in our own country and in the \ncountries of our allies.\n  We must take strong action to curb North Korea's nuclear program and \nto address the other threats that it poses to us and our allies. Weak \nsanctions against North Korea have proven unsuccessful. The legislation \nbefore us today represents the tough response that is necessary to send \nthis message directly to North Korean leaders: Disarm or face severe \neconomic sanctions.\n  This bill puts pressure on North Korea in three important ways. \nFirst, it requires the President to investigate those that help North \nKorea import goods used to make weapons of mass destruction. All people \nand businesses involved in helping North Korea obtain illicit weapons \nwould be banned from doing business with the United States and would \nhave their assets and financial operations immediately frozen and their \ntravel restricted.\n  As we work with our allies to track down and bring to justice those \nwho assist North Korea in its effort to harm the United States and our \nallies, we must also hit them financially. This bill will help to cut \noff North Korea's funding and further financially isolate them.\n  Second, this bill sanctions those who attack U.S. cyber security. \nThis bill is the first piece of legislation to lay out a framework for \nsanctions against the North Korean cyber threat. Combatting cyber \nterrorism is a key national security priority. We must be proactive \nabout rooting out those who enable cyber attacks.\n  Lastly, this bill addresses a serious human rights crisis in North \nKorea. North Korea is the most isolated economy and society in the \nworld. The current regime exerts total control over daily life. Even \nhaircuts are controlled--that is right. Women are allowed to pick from \n1 of 14 hairstyles, and men cannot grow their hair longer than 2 \ninches. Thirty-two percent of people in North Korea are undernourished, \nand 34 percent of the population receives food aid.\n  As a Member who has worked extensively to fight modern-day slavery, I \nam particularly disturbed by the fact that North Korea is also among \nthe world's worst human traffickers. The State Department's annual \nreport on human trafficking consistently rates North Korea as one of \nthe worst human traffickers. The United Nations considers human \ntrafficking to be one of the three largest criminal enterprises in the \nworld. The first two are illegal drugs and illegal guns.\n  Last year I was proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of \nlegislation with Senator John Cornyn to fight trafficking and help \ntrafficking victims that was signed into law by President Obama last \nMay. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act tackles trafficking \nhead-on. We are doing work in our own country, but we also need to be a \nbeacon for those victims abroad.\n  Sex and labor traffickers treat North Korean men and women like \ncommodities. Yemoni Park, a North Korean woman who escaped after being \nsold into the sex trade and raped at the age of 13, has dedicated her \nlife to shining a light on what she calls ``the darkest place on \nEarth''--North Korea.\n  This bill calls for harsh sanctions against human rights violators. \nIt calls for mandatory investigations into those who bankroll North \nKorean labor prisons and sex trafficking rings. But it also \nacknowledges the important work of human rights organizations that \nprovide assistance to those suffering in North Korea and allows them to \ncontinue their lifesaving work.\n  China fuels much of the demand for North Korea's human trafficking, \nand they help fund the North Korean regime. Beyond enacting swift and \nsevere sanctions against those associated with North Korea's weapons \nsuppliers, hackers, and human rights violators, we must pressure China \nto get serious about sanctioning the North Korean regime. Unless we \nhave China's help, the regime will not truly feel the repercussions of \nits actions.\n  We have come together today across party lines in a bipartisan effort \nto address the growing threat that North Korea poses to the United \nStates and our allies. We are united in our belief that our national \nsecurity--and the security of our allies--requires a swift and strong \nresponse to North Korea and those who fund its tyrants. We are also \nunited in our belief that we must vigorously investigate and sanction \nthose who in any way help North Korea develop weapons of mass \ndestruction and those who seek to undermine cyber security.\n  We must do everything in our power to help improve the lives of \ninnocent North Koreans. That is why I am supporting this bill, and I \nthank my colleagues for their leadership--Senator Menendez, Senator \nGardner, Senator Cardin, and Senator Corker.\n\n\n                         Ambassador Nominations\n\n  Madam President, I wanted to add one more thing. As I try to do every \nday with Senator Shaheen, I address the issue of the Ambassadors to \nNorway and Sweden. It has been 864 days since we have had an Ambassador \nto Norway. It has been 468 days since the President nominated Azita \nRaji to be Ambassador to Sweden.\n  I appreciate Senator Corker's leadership on this issue. We are \nworking very hard to get these two Ambassadors confirmed. These \ncountries are the 11th and 12th biggest investors in the United States. \nSenator Cruz is the one holding up the vote on these nominations. We \nare hopeful that at some point we will be able to move ahead. This has \nbeen going on way too long.\n  They are some of our best allies in the fight against Russian \naggression. Norway actually shares a border with Russia. We have to be \nby their side if they take in thousands and thousands of refugees. We \nhave talked about the need for a strong Europe. These are the two major \ncountries in Europe that don't have Ambassadors from the United States. \nThat must change.\n  Again, I thank Senator Corker and Senator Cardin for their \nleadership.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I think Senator Capito is next to speak, \nbut I do want to just mention that I appreciate the way that Senator \nKlobuchar has worked on the issue of the\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nAmbassadors to Norway and Sweden, and I do think we are on the cusp in \nthe next 24 hours of that being resolved. I thank Senator Klobuchar for \nher diligence and patience, and with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise today in strong support of the North Korean Sanctions and \nPolicy Enhancement Act. I commend Senators Corker, Gardner, Menendez, \nand Cardin for their hard work on this bill, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  North Korea poses a serious threat to the United States. Last month, \nthe North Koreans tested a nuclear device as they continue to advance \ntheir weapons technology. Just this weekend the North Koreans launched \na satellite as they work to build a ballistic missile program.\n  Cyber attacks launched by North Korea have crippled businesses such \nas Sony Pictures and targeted our allies in South Korea and Japan. The \nthreats posed by North Korea will only continue to grow, and our \ncurrent policy toward North Korea has failed to protect the safety and \nsecurity of the American people.\n  This legislation takes significant steps to deny North Korea's \ncapabilities and to limit the nuclear and ballistic missile programs, \nto stop cyber security attacks, and to end North Korea's horrendous \nhuman rights violations. Mandatory investigations and mandatory \nsanctions are the hallmark of this legislation. Under this bill, the \nadministration is required to investigate the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, human rights abuses, and cyber crimes. When \ninvestigations reveal misconduct related to these activities, sanctions \nare required.\n  Importantly, this bill will target minerals and other items that the \nNorth Korean regime uses to finance its weapons programs at the expense \nof its own people. Sanctions under this bill would also apply to \nbusinesses or individuals around the world that help North Korea expand \nits nuclear weapons and cyber crime capabilities.\n  Similar legislation imposing sanctions targeted towards North Korea \npassed in the House last month with a nearly unanimous vote. That is \nquite an achievement. Today I hope this bill will pass by a similar \nmargin and show that the Senate is united in our resolve against the \nsecurity threats posed by North Korea.\n\n\n                            Clean Power Plan\n\n  Madam President, on another important note, last night the U.S. \nSupreme Court put the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power \nPlan on hold. This landmark decision will prevent the Obama \nadministration from enforcing this rule until all legal challenges are \ncomplete.\n  West Virginia, my State, has lost nearly 10,000 coal mining jobs \nsince 2009. Nearly every week, hundreds of layoffs and more notices \ndevastate West Virginia's coalfields, West Virginia families, and \ncommunities. The impact on State and local budgets has been stark. \nSchool boards have announced significant cuts to education due to the \nloss of coal severance tax revenue. This is all across the State. As \nbad as the current economic situation is, the Clean Power Plan would \nmake things worse for families and communities in my State.\n  We know the EPA's playbook. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court \nstruck down EPA's mercury rule targeting powerplants since the Agency \nfailed to follow the legal requirements, but because the mercury rule \nwent into effect years before legal challenges were complete, billions \nof dollars had already been invested and many jobs had already been \nlost.\n  My ARENA Act has recognized that the 29 States and hundreds of other \norganizations challenging the President's power grab deserve meaningful \njudicial review. My legislation said this rule could not go into effect \nuntil the litigation is complete--such common sense. I am very pleased \nthe Supreme Court has agreed with this commonsense position and \nrecognized the immediate impact of this rule.\n  I also want to extend my appreciation to West Virginia's attorney \ngeneral, Patrick Morrisey, for his leading role in this case. On behalf \nof our State, he has headed the legal challenge against this \nadministration, and last night's decision is just the latest legal \nsetback for an out-of-control EPA.\n  Congress has passed legislation disapproving of the Clean Power Plan. \nWe sent it to the President and he vetoed it. A majority of our States \nare still challenging this rule, and the judicial branch now seems \npoised to play its role in protecting both the separation of powers and \nthe principles of federalism from the administration's power grab.\n  Increasingly, this lameduck President stands alone as he attempts to \nfurther his climate agenda. The American people are not behind him. A \nmajority of Congress has come out against his efforts, and now the \nSupreme Court has raised concerns.\n  This is an important step toward having the American people--not an \nunchecked bureaucracy--set our energy agenda, and we must continue to \nfight to permanently block this rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I also rise to support the North Korea \nSanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. It is good to see on the \nfloor colleagues who have worked on this important legislation from \nMaryland, New Jersey, our committee chair, and the Senator from \nColorado. I appreciate their efforts and believe this can be a great \nexample of bipartisanship and near-unanimous agreement.\n  We have witnessed recently many provocations by the North Koreans. \nThe ballistic missile test this past weekend violates numerous U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions and it threatens both the United States \nand especially our allies in the region. This closely follows a nuclear \ntest in January--another deplorable action by North Korea--and missile \nnuclear weapons program proliferation concerns that have been the \nsubject of a lot of discussion in this body.\n  I appreciate the drafters and the Foreign Relations Committee for \nmoving swiftly to deliver a response that includes penalties for the \nmissile launch and the nuclear test.\n  I will also mention that North Korea's detention of American citizens \ncan't be overlooked. This includes the recent detainment in North Korea \nof Otto Frederick Warmbier, who is a third-year college student at the \nUniversity of Virginia. As we move forward with our strategy on North \nKorea, we have to prioritize and ensure the safe return of our citizens \nwho are detained there.\n  A little bit about how destabilizing North Korea's actions are. This \nrecent test was expected, and it is proof of the North Korean grim \ndetermination to develop nuclear weapons, even if it is hampering and \nhobbling their economy and causing their citizens to suffer. They have \nbeen given warnings that they shouldn't do it, but they have also been \ngiving warnings to the global community that they would.\n  This is a country that is determined to defy a host of U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions that ban it from conducting nuclear and missile \ntests. The international community has been speaking with clarity about \nwhat the line is: Don't do this--but North Korea has chosen to proceed.\n  Kim Jong Un has once again displayed a willingness to defy the \ninternational community--and at such a cost to his people. The economy \nthere is absolutely hobbled because of his desire to be a militaristic \nleader, but the result is the population of his country is suffering. \nHis strategy to have nuclear, military, and economic development for \nhis people is not going to work because he can't have both, and the \nlegislation demonstrates that these things are impossible by imposing a \nsignificant economic cost. The legislation shows that the United States \nwill hold countries and private entities accountable for compliance \nwith rules and law.\n  Kim Jong Un's backward calculus has left his country impoverished and \nalmost entirely dependent on China for economic trade. Roughly 90 \npercent of North Korea's foreign trade is with China, which is why \nChina can have significant leverage over North Korea, but the track \nrecord of China using its leverage to curb North Korean activity is \nvery disappointing. We need to continue to pressure China to increase \nsanctions on North Korea and elevate\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\nthis issue in bilateral discussions with China. The number of North \nKorean nuclear weapons could soon approach China's within the next \ndecade, and that is a direct threat to regional security and global \nsecurity.\n  Yesterday, in the Armed Services Committee hearing we attended, DNI \nJames Clapper stated that North Korea is expanding its uranium \nenrichment activities, it has restarted plutonium production, and it \ncould start extracting plutonium from spent fuel within a matter of \nmonths.\n  China can no longer turn a blind eye to this. As a permanent member \nof the U.N. Security Council, China needs to help foster international \npeace and play the role that an international power on the U.N. \nSecurity Council needs to play. They need to play the role in \nadditionally advancing or pushing for more human rights in North Korea \nbecause they have the leverage to do so. We don't trade with North \nKorea. Our leverage system is somewhat limited, but China, with a 90-\npercent trade share, has that leverage.\n  The good thing about these sanctions is that they will sanction the \nactivities of Chinese companies and entities that are trading with \nNorth Korea, and that secondary sanction effect, I think, has the \nability to work and put pressure on them.\n  We have seen recently how sanctions can work in another context, in \nthe Iran context. The architects of the sanctions policy with Iran are \nin this room, and they deserve praise because there is no way Iran, a \nrogue nation that was moving forward to develop nuclear weapons, would \nhave ever entertained a diplomatic discussion to try to put limits on \nthat program had it not been for sanctions that were designed to have a \nstrategic and careful effect. So we need to do the same thing here, and \nthese sanctions do that.\n  In conclusion, the United States has to undertake a more proactive \napproach to North Korea to address the nuclear and ballistic missile \nprograms. This legislation is good because it not only puts Congress \neven more firmly on the record in opposition to North Korea's activity, \nbut it also provides the executive branch a more robust set of policy \ntools to confront the threat that is posed by Pyongyang.\n  This is an example of legislation that came out of the committee--\nbipartisan and unanimous. It represents the best of bipartisan foreign \npolicy cooperation, and I am strongly in support of the bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I first thank Senator Kaine for his \ninput in this legislation and so much other legislation that goes \nthrough the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is an extremely \nvaluable member of our committee, a very good thinker, but more \nimportantly he listens to others in the committee and finds a common \nway that we can make important national foreign policy issues \nbipartisan. He has done that and did that with the Iran review act in \nreaching a way that we could bring that together in a bipartisan \nmanner. He was very helpful on the North Korean sanction bill that we \nhave on the floor, so I thank Senator Kaine for his contributions.\n  I say to Senator Corker, I know we are getting near the end of this \ndebate. I have been listening to this debate throughout the day, and I \nthink it points out the best traditions of the U.S. Senate. So many \nMembers have come to the floor in serious debate about the national \nsecurity challenge that North Korea presents--not just, as I said, to \nthe Korean Peninsula, not just to our allies in East Asia but \nglobally--and how U.S. leadership is going to be vitally important and \nwe are going to act.\n  The United States is going to act. The Senate tonight is going to \npass a very strong sanctions bill, a very strong message bill that we \ndo not intend to sit back and let North Korea proliferate their weapons \nof mass destruction. We also don't plan to sit back and let them commit \ngross violations of human rights. We will not sit back and allow them \nto attack our intellectual property through cyber security attacks, and \nwe are going to act as one, united. We are going to act, Democrats and \nRepublicans, House and Senate. We are going to work with the \nadministration. We are going to get this done. Then, yes, we are going \nto go to the international community. We are going to put pressure on \nother countries.\n  We know the Republic of Korea is with us. We know Japan is with us. \nChina needs to be with us, and we are going to go and talk to China, \nexplain and work with them so we can get international pressure to \nisolate the North Korean regime until they change their course. It is \ncritically important to our security but also to the people of North \nKorea. I thought this debate has been in the best tradition of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Again, we had the architects, as Senator Kaine pointed out, drafting \nthis bill. Senator Corker's leadership clearly set the climate in our \ncommittee so we could have that type of debate. I am sorry no one here \ncould sit in on some of Senator Corker and Senator Menendez's meetings \nas they were negotiating the specific terms of the bill. Each had their \nviews, but they listened to each other. They recognized that by \nlistening to each other they could come out at the end of the day with \na stronger bill. As a result of our two colleagues, we were able to \nreach that common ground and I think very shortly we are going to be \nable to show the people of in country the best traditions of the U.S. \nSenate on foreign policy issues.\n  I am very proud to work with Senator Corker and my colleagues on this \nbill.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, obviously I appreciate the comments of \nthe distinguished ranking member. Our former chairman, Senator \nMenendez, is here; Senator Gardner, the two of them. We are way ahead \nin the Senate in many ways in addressing this issue prior to these last \nprovocations by North Korea. I thank them for that.\n  Again, as Senator Kaine mentioned, we are doing it in the best \nfashion of the United States. Where there are differences, we worked \ntogether to hammer those out and ended up, as Senator Cardin just \nmentioned, with a stronger piece of legislation.\n  I also commend the House. They sent over a very good bill. They \nreally did. It was strong. Senator Gardner and Senator Menendez, with \nall of us working together, were able to broaden it out and to deal \nwith some other issues that were not dealt with in that piece of \nlegislation.\n  The fact is, things have occurred since that legislation passed that \nhave caused people to want to put in place a much stronger, much bolder \nfootprint as it relates to North Korea.\n  What is amazing--and I appreciated your comments about Senator Kaine. \nI don't think we have a more thoughtful or more principled member on \nour committee, and I don't think there is any way the Iran review act \nwould have occurred without him taking the steps that he did to break \nthe logjam at that time. Let's face it, with some important \nconstituents it mattered, and it allowed us to move ahead with it--\nobviously, Senator Menendez on the front end and Senator Cardin as the \nnew ranking member.\n  What is amazing in many ways is that North Korea has gotten this far \nalong. I mean, it has been through multiple administrations, differing \nparties. Over the last 20 years, they have just continued to move \nalong. While I think our Nation did a very good job in focusing on the \nproblems that Iran was creating, and Senator Menendez, who is sitting \nbeside me, certainly led in putting sanctions in place with Senator \nKirk and others. We moved swiftly to arrest that. Hopefully, while we \nhad disagreements over the content of the actual agreement--and that is \nrepresented by differences in votes on the agreement itself--it did \nbring them to the table. What is amazing is that again they have \nprogressed so far along, way beyond where Iran is.\n  What is also amazing to me is that China--I am going to be having \nthose conversations this weekend with our counterparts in Munich \nregarding this very issue. What is amazing to me is you have right on \ntheir border this country which is definitely, you have to say, a rogue \ncountry that is creating provocations in the region.\n  We have all visited the DMZ and have seen that we have 28,500 troops \nwho are there to keep peace. They have been\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nthere since 1953. So we are right there in the region. We have allies. \nAgain, it is amazing that it has gone this far; that China has not been \nwilling to take the steps; that, as Senator Kaine mentioned, their 90 \npercent trade partner could easily cause this to go in a different \ndirection. But even more importantly, here we are taking action that I \nhope will lead to other members of the international community joining \nus in sanctions. But China--the very entity that could do something \nabout this--is blocking the U.N. Security Council's action toward this \nbeing done on a multilateral basis on the front end.\n  But this is what happens. In the past, the Senate has taken \nunilateral action. We know we are much better off with multilateral \nsanctions. A lot of times it starts this way. It started this way with \nIran, and over time we were able to build worldwide support--or mostly \nworldwide support--toward isolating them and causing them to come to \nthe table.\n  Again, this country is much further along. Hopefully we will have the \nsame success. But we have to realize, because of the 20 years of \nefforts that they have underway and especially the bold steps they have \ntaken since 2003, as Senator Gardner so aptly outlined in an earlier \ndiscussion, we are going to have to do far more than this. We need to \nput this in place, but we also have to remain diligent and keep moving \nahead. It may take additional actions down the road. It is certainly \ngoing to take tremendous oversight and involvement by the \nadministration, and the administration to follow, and the \nadministration after them. This is a great step, though, for the \nSenate. It is a great step for our country.\n  Again, I thank our House colleagues. My guess is that we will send \nthis bill back over this evening at about 5:45, some changes may be \nmade, and it will go to the President. We will have spoken with one \nvoice in the best way the Senate speaks, and in a strong way. We will \nbe doing something that furthers the safety and security of our own \ncitizens, which is what we are here about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, as we are winding down this debate \nthat has been extraordinary not only because of its unanimity, which I \nthink is incredibly important when we are facing a challenge in the \nnational security interests of the United States, but also because of \nthe tone it set and the seriousness of the issue with which Members on \nboth sides have taken to it--that is incredibly important. I know my \ncolleagues--the distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking \nmember--have spoken to this, but it is important to note that when the \nSenate on a bipartisan basis perceives a real threat to the potential \nnational security of the United States and of significant allies, it \ncan come together and send not just a powerful message but a powerful \nstrategy to try to deal with that challenge. So I salute all of my \ncolleagues for having engaged in this debate, and I thank the \nleadership of the committee, as well as Senator Gardner, for working \nwith me.\n  When I introduced this legislation last year, I felt that the time \nfor strategic patience--which had been a hallmark of our policy--had \nrun its course. We had hoped that patience would have had a unique \nregime in North Korea moving in a different direction. But it came to a \npoint where multiple tests of nuclear explosions, each increasing in \nthe size of its effectiveness; the attempts to miniaturize those \nefforts; the missile launches they were going through; the terrible \nlabor camps and other human rights violations inside of North Korea and \nwhat is happening to the North Korean people--that strategic patience \nin and of itself was not getting us to the goal. If anything, while we \nwere being patient, the North Koreans continued to move in a direction \nfor which we needed what I think is a strategic resolve. And that is \nwhat we have come to here today--a bipartisan effort to have a \nstrategic resolve to not only focus on North Korea but also the \nsecondary sanctions to say: Those who want to deal with North Korea and \nto help North Korea achieve its goals in violation of international \nnorms will have a consequence.\n  Right now we have all been focused on North Korea as a government, as \nan entity, but this legislation now broadens that to say to those who \nwant to help the North Koreans provide the material wherewithal for \ntheir nuclear missile and other programs that there is a consequence to \nyou. I believe that is an appropriate use of sanctions. So I want to \nclose on this question of sanctions.\n  For 24 years between the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the last \n10 in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, I have viewed U.S. foreign \npolicy in that peaceful diplomacy has an arsenal. That arsenal is in \npart how one can direct international opinion to a country that is \nviolating international norms, to the extent that country can really be \naffected by international opinion. North Korea is an example of a \ncountry that is difficult to affect by international opinion. There is \nthe use of aid and the use of trade as inducements to a country to act \nin a certain way and join the international community and follow the \nnorms and international will and then the denial of aid or trade and \nother sanctions as a way to get them to move away from the direction in \nwhich they are violating international norms.\n  Outside of that universe--international opinion, use of aid, use of \ntrade, denial of aid, denial of trade, and sanctions, particularly that \nwe have begun to perfect in the financial sector--which can be a very \npowerful tool. It shouldn't be used bluntly but nonetheless is an \nimportant tool in an arsenal of peaceful diplomacy in the world.\n  Looking aside from the military universe of what is available to us, \nwhich should be our last resort, when we are talking about peaceful \ndiplomacy, there are moments in which sanctions are the last use of our \npeaceful diplomacy and a way to get countries to move in the direction \nwe want. This moment, which I think is about strategic resolve, does \nexactly that. It uses sanctions not just against the regime in North \nKorea but against those who would give it the wherewithal to follow its \nillicit pursuits. I think that is what is incredibly powerful about \nthis legislation and the appropriate use of our arsenal of peaceful \ndiplomacy in the hopes that we can deter the North Koreans from where \nthey are and move in a different direction and in the hope that we can \nget other countries in the world--and it will have to be more than \nhope; it will have to be a strategic resolve to get those other \ncountries to join us, as we did in the case of Iran. We did not start \nwith the world wanting to come together with us because of their \neconomic interests and other strategic interests. Through American \nleadership, we ultimately drove the moment in which we had a \nmultilateral international effort that brought the Iranians to the \nnegotiating table.\n  It is my hope that what happens here in the Senate today begins a \nprocess that can proselytize others in the world to join us so that the \nnuclear nightmare that is potentially North Korea never ever \nmaterializes.\n  With that, I hope we have an overwhelming unanimous vote on this \nlegislation. I again thank the leadership for working with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as I listen to my colleagues, I think we \nknow how proud we are to serve with people who have such deep knowledge \nand strategic views on how we as a nation can better defend ourselves \nand lead the world.\n  To Senator Menendez's comments about America's strength, yes, I think \neveryone understands that we have the greatest arsenal in the world. We \ndo. But America also understands the power of diplomacy, and diplomacy \nhas to be backed up with incentives and disincentives.\n  Incentives, yes. The American taxpayer is generous with development \nassistance and our assistance in helping countries develop into \nstronger democracies in which they can be stronger economies and have a \nbetter life for their people and, by the way, be better consumers of \nU.S. products. That is what America does--it offers incentives--but we \nalso lead the world in saying: If you do not follow the internationally \nacceptable norms, there will be consequences, and those consequences \nmean that we will not let you do commerce to strengthen your\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nability to harm your neighbors and to harm global security.\n  That is what Senator Menendez was talking about. The sanctions we are \nimposing here are aimed directly at North Korea's ability to compile \nweapons of mass destruction, to harm their own people, and to harm \nothers through the use of cyber. That is what these sanctions are aimed \nat. They are aimed at preventing them from being able to do that.\n  It also shows U.S. leadership because our allies look to the United \nStates first. It is an international financial system, and if the \nUnited States is not prepared to move forward, we cannot expect the \nrest of our allies to move ahead. So it is a clear signal that we are \nprepared to take these actions. We are taking these actions. We are \ngoing to take them by ourselves if we have to, but it will be much more \neffective if we can get the international community to support us.\n  Senator Menendez is absolutely correct. I remember when we did this \nagainst the apartheid of South Africa. We were able to get actions \ntaken by other countries after we acted. The Senator is absolutely \ncorrect on Iran. We acted on Iran; we then got other countries to act. \nIf the United States had not shown the leadership, they would not have \nacted. That is now true with North Korea. Our actions will help us get \nother countries to act so that we can hopefully accomplish our goal of \na peaceful North Korea without the use of our military might.\n  Let me explain what is at stake here. We all understand the tests \nthat are going on with the so-called satellite tests to be able to \ndevelop a missile that can deliver a weapon well beyond the Republic of \nKorea that could directly attack U.S. interests and certainly our \nallies' interests. That is what they are trying to do with these tests, \nis to develop weapons of mass destruction that could cause unspeakable \ndamage. That is what we are trying to prevent. And it is not just the \ndirect actions by the North Koreans; they have already shown their \nwillingness to work with other rogue states in developing weapons of \nmass destruction. If we allow them to accumulate these weapons, they \ncould then transfer them to other rogue countries and they could be \nused against our interests. We also know that North Korea is willing to \nmake arrangements with terrorist organizations, and these weapons could \nend up in the hands of terrorists and be used against our interests.\n  That is what is at stake. There is a lot at stake, and that is on the \nweapons program. We already saw North Korea act in regard to Sony on \ncyber. We know this is a growing field. If we don't take action now, \nthe circumstances are only going to get more damaging to U.S. \ninterests.\n  The one area that I really congratulate Senator Gardner and Senator \nMenendez for bringing to this bill is the human rights issues, the \ngross violations of human rights. We talked about this. There is no \ncountry in the world that treats its citizens worse than North Korea \ndoes. They are literally starving their population. They are starving \ntheir population. They torture their population. They imprison anyone \nwho dares say anything against the government. They do summary \nexecutions if they don't like you. We know that. It has been documented \nover and over again.\n  This legislation speaks to American values. Our strength is in our \narsenal and our strength is in our universal values; that we won't \nallow that to happen; that, yes, we have an interest in how the people \nof North Korea are treated; that these are international norms that \nhave been violated by North Korea.\n  I just wanted to follow up with Senator Menendez because I thought he \narticulated so well about America's strength and how we act. It is not \njust because we have the best military in the world; it is because we \nhave the will to stand up for values that are important for not only \nour national security but for global security.\n  When the United States leads, other countries join us, and we get \nresults. Hopefully, we are going to be able to change North Korea's \nconduct through these measures. That is in the best interest of the \nUnited States, it is in the best interest of our allies, and it is in \nthe best interest of North Korea. That is what this legislation speaks \nto.\n  I share Senator Menendez's hope that we will see a very strong vote \nin a few minutes, and I know that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle have expressed their views on this. I urge everyone to support \nthis effort and to show America's resolve in the united policy in this \nregard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I want to thank all of my colleagues \nfor their thoughtful input during this debate. We have had great \ndiscussions from numerous Members who have come to the floor throughout \nthe day to discuss North Korea and the North Korea Sanctions and Policy \nEnhancement Act.\n  I want to thank Senator Corker for his leadership on the committee, \nthe product of which is a very good bipartisan sanctions action. I hope \nand agree with Senator Menendez, our colleague from New Jersey, that \nthis will indeed receive unanimous support.\n  I wish to thank Senator Menendez through the Chair for his efforts to \nmake this a success, and thanks to the ranking member of the committee \nand ranking member of the Asia subcommittee, as well, for their work. \nWe set out a year ago to work on this problem and address this \nchallenge.\n  The purpose of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act \nis very simple. The purpose of the bill is to peacefully disarm North \nKorea through mandatory sanctions that would deprive the regime of the \nmeans to build its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, to deprive \nthe regime of its means to carry out malicious cyber activities, and to \ndeprive the regime of the means to continue its gross abuse of the \nhuman rights of its own people. That is the purpose of this bill. \nObviously, there is more work to do.\n  The discussions today talk about the work we have to do with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, in the other Chamber, and \nthe work we have to do around the globe to make sure that the United \nNations Security Council recognizes this challenge and that China \nunderstands our basis of cooperation depends on actions against \nsomething we both agree on, and that is that we shouldn't have a \nnuclear North Korea.\n  Let's build that relationship of cooperation with China. Let's build \nthat relationship of trilateral alliance among South Korea, Japan, and \nthe United States. Those are the things we can begin to accomplish with \nthis legislation.\n  I had a conversation with Admiral Gortney not too long ago about \nNorth Korea. He is the head of NORTHCOM, headquartered in Colorado \nSprings, CO. It was a conversation about North Korea and what he sees. \nThrough his comments, you can tell he is concerned, and he believes the \nsituation in the Korean Peninsula is at its most unstable point since \nthe armistice. Over six decades, we today are seeing the most unstable \npoint on the Korean Peninsula because of a rogue regime that tortures \nits own people, kills its own leaders, and deprives its citizens of \nhuman dignity.\n  Strategic patience has failed. One expert said we have moved from \nstrategic patience to benign neglect. That is not leadership. So today \nwe start a new policy based on strength and not patience. This \nlegislation would mandate--not simply authorize but mandate--the \nimposition of sanctions against all persons who materially contribute \nto North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development; import \nluxury goods into North Korea; enable its censorship and human rights \nabuses; engage in money laundering and manufacture of counterfeit goods \nand narcotic trafficking; engage in activities undermining cyber \nsecurity; have sold, supplied or transferred to or from North Korea \nprecious metals or raw metals, including aluminum, steel, and coal for \nthe benefit of North Korea's regime and its illicit activities; that \nis, $1.8 billion in raw metals, $245 million in other goods that are \nsanctioned under this act, including those entities that decide they \nwould import from North Korea if that money they would generate from \nthe sale of that import goes to the development of proliferation \nactivities.\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\n  The cyber sanctions and strategy that we require are unique to the \nSenate bill. They will be the first mandatory sanctions in history \npassed against cyber criminals. This bill also codifies Executive \norders 13687 and 13694 regarding cyber security, as they apply to North \nKorea, which were enacted last year in the wake of the Sony Pictures \nhack and other cyber incidents. It is also a unique feature of our \nSenate bill today.\n  The mandatory sanctions on metals and minerals are unique to the \nlegislation. Expert estimates, as we just said, put North Korea's rare \nmetal minerals and steel exports at around $2 billion, so these \nsanctions could have a significant impact in deterring the regime and \nits enablers. The sanctions in this bill are secondary, as we have \ndiscussed, which means they would be applied to individuals and \nentities, not just in the United States but around the world, who would \nassist the Government of North Korea and the designated entities that \nengage in the activities prohibited by this legislation. It mandates a \nstrategy and sanctions against North Korea's human rights abuses.\n  You can see what it does on the chart. You can see the opportunity we \nhave before us and the American people and our obligation to make sure \nwe are doing everything we can to stand up for the people of North \nKorea and stand up to the totalitarian regime of North Korea.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation tonight, this \nbipartisan product of countless hours of debate and discussions and \nnegotiations, and to come away with a good product that we can be proud \nof, to work with the House Members so that this is on the President's \ndesk. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about \nchildcare, in particular one piece of legislation which I have \nintroduced today, S. 2539, but also to talk more broadly about the \ncritical need in our country for more options, more opportunities for \nfamilies--especially low-income families--to be able to afford high-\nquality childcare. The bill that was introduced today is the Child Care \nAccess to Resources for Early Learning Act. Of course, the acronym or \nshorthand for the bill is the Child CARE Act, standing for the words in \nthe bill that focus on resources and in particular resources for early \nlearning.\n  It is this Senator's belief, and I think the evidence is abundantly \nclear over time whenever this issue is studied, that in terms of the \npositive impact of early care and learning of a child, the evidence \ntells us over and over again that if kids learn more now, they will \nliterally earn more later. That connection between learning and earning \nis compelling, and I think it is an essential part of the debate. Early \neducation and care for a young child has an impact on all of our lives \nwhen it comes to the economy.\n  We know now from the evidence that high-quality early learning \ncontributes to a reduction in need for special education. It also helps \nto lower juvenile justice rates. It also helps to improve health \noutcomes over time. It also increases high school graduation and \ncollege matriculation rates.\n  For some children from low-income households, a lot of these studies \nhave also shown that by the age of 3, they will have heard 30 million \nfewer words than their more affluent peers. Even before they enter \nkindergarten, this so-called word gap means they are already far \nbehind. The income level of the household can often determine how many \nwords that child has heard in his or her lifetime. Of course, the \nreason it is such a big number is because the words get repeated, but \neven when you factor in the repeating of words over and over again, \njust imagine how far behind they are if they are behind by 30 million \nwords. If it were 5 million words, that would be a substantial gap, \nbut, of course, it is much worse than that.\n\n  I believe and I think the evidence shows that in the decades to come, \nthe strength of our economy and the fiscal stability of our Nation will \ndepend on the viability and vitality of our future workforce. I think \nthat is evident from the research. But, again, that connection between \nearly learning and the earning potential of that individual is \nabundant.\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n  Unfortunately, for many families, the need is still substantially \ngreat. Just last fall, Pennsylvania alone had a waiting list of 7,000 \nfamilies who qualified for childcare vouchers but did not receive them. \nIn other words, in one State there were 7,000 families who were \neligible for these vouchers and did not receive them. That story, \nunfortunately, is playing out across the country. According to data \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services, less than 1 in 10 \nchildren nationwide under the age of 4 received childcare assistance. \nIn Pennsylvania it is about 15 percent. Just think about that--\nnationwide, 1 in 10 is eligible for this kind of help and is not \nreceiving it.\n  Child Care Aware--one of the many groups who helped with the \nlegislation I just mentioned, the Child CARE Act--tells us that \nparticularly in urban and rural communities, there is a severe shortage \nof high-quality or licensed childcare facilities.\n  In Pennsylvania, where we have a significant State investment in \nchildcare, only 3.5 percent of childcare slots for children birth to \nage 4 years old are in the highest quality programs.\n  For many families who can even find care, the cost is very \nburdensome. For most families, childcare is often the second most \ncostly expense, behind only housing. Just imagine that--the second \nhighest expense in the life of a family for far too many families is \nchildcare, second only to housing. In 2014, in more than half of the \nUnited States, a year of childcare costs more than a year of college \ntuition at a public college. That is another stunning comparison.\n  We hear it all the time from real people--not just numbers or \nstudies, we hear it from real people. Last week when we were discussing \nthe bill, the Child CARE Act, we heard from a Washington, DC, \nMetropolitan Police officer who also happens to be a parent. Her name \nis Zunnobia, and she told us how much there is a struggle for hard-\nworking, even middle-class families who just want the best for their \nchildren, how difficult that struggle is to find quality, affordable \nchildcare for early care and learning. This police officer also told me \nand told those in the room how all too often in her work as a police \nofficer, she sees teenagers or young people who did not have the \nbenefit of high-quality care and early learning.\n  This is another example from Pennsylvania. This is what Deanna, a \nparent, tells us, and I am quoting just in part:\n\n       Each month, with two children in daycare, our payment \n     exceeded our mortgage payment.\n\n  So it is not the second highest cost but the highest cost in her \nhousehold.\n  Deanna continues:\n\n       Some months we paid for daycare with our home equity line \n     of credit. It took us 2 years to pay off the debt we \n     acquired. Parents with young children are really struggling. \n     It is a no-win situation.\n\n  That is what Deanna, a parent from Pennsylvania, tells us.\n  Christina, another Pennsylvanian, a parent, told us that the cost of \n``daycare is bringing us straight to foreclosure because we cannot \nafford our mortgage, groceries, diapers, and gas for our one car.''\n  So this is the real world and this is the real life of a struggling \nfamily but especially struggling--even in a recovery--with the cost of \nchildcare.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the component parts of the act. The \nChild CARE Act is legislation that will ensure that families with \ninfants and toddlers who are living at or below 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty level, which we know is approximately $40,000 for a \nfamily of three--it will help those families who need childcare have \naccess to that high-quality care. The act will further the purposes of \nthe child care and development block grant by raising quality standards \nand by providing resources necessary to make those higher quality \nstandards a reality and available to families across the Nation. Over a \n10-year period, we estimate that the legislation could help over 1 \nmillion additional children under the age of 4 gain access to high-\nquality childcare.\n  Part of achieving higher quality care is ensuring that childcare \nproviders are receiving an appropriate level of support and that \nchildcare workers are compensated fairly for their expertise. \nUnfortunately, across the Nation, the average childcare worker often \nmakes below poverty wages. According to the 2013 National Survey of \nEarly Care and Education, the median wage for center-based childcare \nstaff was $9.30 an hour, about $19,000 a year. Just imagine that. The \npeople who we believe are the best qualified and the most dedicated to \ntaking care of our children, who will give them that early care and the \nlearning that goes with it, the people whom we entrust with our most \ntreasured asset, our children, in too many places in this country, \nthose same workers are making just $19,000 a year. This means that \nchildcare workers on average make less than parking lot attendants, \nless than manicurists, and less than massage therapists. So if we \nreally care about our children, I think we would pay them more than \nsome of the occupations I just mentioned. Caring for and nurturing \ninfants and toddlers requires specialized knowledge and competencies \nthat are not easily developed and should not be taken for granted.\n  I believe and I think most Members of Congress, either in the Senate \nor in the House, believe that our children deserve quality. They \ndeserve quality care and learning, but they especially deserve the \nquality that comes with someone who is paid an adequate wage and has a \nlevel of expertise and competency to provide that child with the kind \nof early care and learning she has a right to expect.\n  Childcare funding is critically important not only to families in \nPennsylvania and across the Nation, but, of course, it is critical if \nwe are going to meet that demand that our workforce must meet. The \nchildren who learn more now will earn more later.\n  We also know that this legislation is an opportunity to finally, at \nlong last, make that historic commitment to these same families. We \nknow the return on investment, if that is all someone wants to focus \non, is return on investment. I know some people like numbers sometimes \nbetter than testimonials from parents. But if your only concern is \nreturn on investment, this is a good deal. Return on investment in \nterms of high-quality early care and learning is as high as $17 for $1. \nThat is a pretty good deal anywhere in the country. We want to \nemphasize the return on investment, but I also believe at the same time \nthat we have to focus on the life of that child and that child's \nprospects for future employment to contribute to our economy.\n  We have to make this issue a priority. If we really care about \neconomic growth, GDP growth, competing in a world economy, and having a \nskilled workforce, all those high aspirations, all those goals we talk \nabout a lot, it starts with early care and learning. A child cannot \nearn what she should be able to earn if she doesn't have the \nopportunity for early care and learning--high-quality early care and \nlearning.\n  We can spend up to $40,000 a year on incarceration and thousands on \ndrug treatment and/or special education or we can spend a small \nfraction of that now on early care and learning and give children both \na healthy and a smart start in life.\n  I urge my colleagues, when it comes before them, to support the Child \nCARE Act that has been introduced today.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude with some brief comments about another \nrelated issue for our kids--lead poisoning.\n  What has happened in Flint, MI, is both horrific and inexcusable. No \none should accept any excuse for what happened there. I commend Senator \nStabenow and Senator Peters for shining a light on what occurred in \ntheir home State.\n  But, unfortunately, this is an issue that involves not just the State \nof Michigan, not just the city of Flint, this is a nationwide problem, \nespecially on the eastern seaboard. Unfortunately, many communities \naround the country have numbers that are even worse, even higher than \nthe Flint numbers.\n  By one example, Pennsylvania--one of the largest States in the \nUnion--18 cities in Pennsylvania are reporting higher levels of lead \nexposure among children than Flint. Let me say that again--higher \nlevels than Flint. In Flint, 3.2 percent of children exceeded the \ndanger threshold for lead exposure, tested levels of 5 or more \nmicrograms\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nper deciliter of blood. So 5 or more micrograms is the danger level, \nand Flint was at 3.2. Where were some cities in Pennsylvania that, as I \nsaid, have higher numbers? Instead of being at 5 or 3.2, this is what \nwe see in Pennsylvania: Allentown, 23; Altoona, 20.5; my hometown of \nScranton, 20 percent; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh--our largest cities, \nthe two largest cities and the most urban parts of our State--were at \n10 and 8 respectively, which is lower than the other Pennsylvania \ncities but still higher than Flint. In Pennsylvania, the primary source \nfor childhood lead poisoning is not water but, rather, deteriorating \ninfrastructure and exposure to the remnants of lead-based paint, paint \ndust, and chips. That is a problem in our State, but there are other \nStates, especially on the eastern seaboard, that have a similar \nproblem.\n  We must ensure that children who have been exposed to high levels of \nlead receive all--and I mean that literally--all of the followup \nservices they need to reach their full potential. Whether that is \nremedial, medical, or educational, we need to be there for those \nchildren.\n  I supported funding for the Centers for Disease Control's Healthy \nHomes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, which supports State and \nlocal public health departments working to identify cases of childhood \nlead exposure. But that is just but one step. We have a lot more to do \non this issue.\n  I will conclude by saying that we should take action on childcare to \nmake sure that it is affordable and that it is of a high quality so \nthat especially poor children can learn more now and earn more later. \nIt is very difficult to learn, grow, and succeed if you have the \ndisadvantage of not only not having childcare and early learning but \nthe additional burden of high levels of lead. These are challenges that \nwe face as a country, and these are challenges that both Houses and \nboth parties must confront.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S808-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S808-S810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRADE FACILITATION AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT BILL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will be bringing up \nthe Customs bill that I intend to support moving to. I believe it has a \nnumber of good provisions, and I hope to be able to support its final \npassage.\n  But first, I want to bring attention to the weakened currency \nprovisions that the conference report included. This is not the \nlanguage that initially passed the Senate, but instead is much weaker.\n  The Senate, several times, has affirmed the need to provide the \nTreasury Department and the Department of Commerce tools to prevent \ncurrency manipulation.\n  In 2011, the Senate passed such a bill to provide the Commerce \nDepartment with enforcement mechanisms by a vote of 63-35.\n  Second, in 2013, 60 Senators signed a letter to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, calling for the inclusion of enforceable currency \nprovisions in Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Finally, in May of 2015, the Senate passed by a 78-to-20 vote this \nCustoms enforcement bill, which, for the first time, included new tools \nthat are necessary to defend American manufacturers from foreign \ncurrency manipulations--the language to confront currency cheating that \nthe Treasury Department acknowledges is occurring, but they have \nrefused to take action to confront it.\n  That original bill would have required, where this kind of currency \nmanipulation occurs, action be taken to fix currency manipulation. \nUnfortunately, that language was removed from the conference report.\n  I think it is time--and I think a bipartisan majority of this Senate \nbelieves it is time--for us to pass enforceable currency protection \nmeasures and make sure they make it to the President's desk.\n  In June of 2015, a New York Times poll showed that 63 percent of \nAmericans believe that trade restrictions are necessary, and only 16 \npercent of Americans believe that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would \nactually increase American jobs. I am absolutely convinced the American \npeople are correct on that, based on a study of previous trade \nagreements and the analysis of studies by Tufts University and other \ngroups.\n  A May 2015 poll conducted by Ipsos, a leading polling and \ncommunications firm, found that 73 percent of the U.S. public believes \nCongress should oppose any ``international trade agreement that does \nnot specifically prohibit currency manipulation.'' That is a strong \npolling number.\n  A second Ipsos poll, conducted last year, found that 79 percent of \nrespondents said that it was important for the trade deal to include \nenforceable currency protections.\n  In August, the Chinese Government devalued its currency 4 percent, \ncreating a regional currency war in that area involving Australia, \nMalaysia, and South Korea. All those fell against the United States \ndollar, making their imports to the United States less expensive and \nour exports to their countries more expensive. It happens just that \nway.\n  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, one of the great heroes \nof the economic rebound of the 1980s, has said that years of trade \nnegotiations can be wiped out in minutes by currency manipulation. I \ndon't think there is any doubt about that.\n  These depreciations throughout Asia further disadvantage American \nworkers because they force our workers to compete against international \ncompetitors who receive discounts, in effect, on their exported goods \nin the form of artificially depressed currencies. These devaluations \nhave a real impact.\n  I have talked at length to steel manufacturers in my State. They have \nall told me that steel manufacturing is being hammered by this kind of \ncurrency manipulation, dumping, and other unfair, improper trade \npolicies. But they specifically mentioned currency. Foreign market \nmanipulations have virtually eliminated profit margins that were \nalready slim in the steel industry.\n  I had a conversation a few hours ago with a major paper company which \nsaid that currency manipulations have hurt their exports. They are \nstill making the exports, but it has eliminated their profit. It is \nvery problematic for them. They have to have profit, but they are \ntrying to maintain their production, keep Americans working, and keep \nthe plants operating, even though their profit margin has been hurt \nsubstantially by currency manipulation.\n  In June of 2015, eBay reported that international currency \nfluctuations eliminated 8 percent of its sales. Instead of 6 percent \nsales growth, the company reported a 2 percent decline. Our foreign \ncompetitors are exporting their unemployment to the United States. That \nis the way it is done: You reduce your currency, and you export your \nproducts to the United States at a lower price. Our foreign competitors \nkeep their people working and undermine the ability of American \nmanufacturers to keep their employees working. Sometimes American \nplants are totally closed.\n  A December 1 Wall Street Journal article highlighted the fact that \nthe Chinese yuan had increased against most other major currencies but \nfallen 3 percent against the dollar. They let it decline against the \ndollar, thereby maintaining their trade advantage with the United \nStates--their trade surplus, our trade deficit with China. Our trade \ndeficit with China increased during January and increased substantially \nduring the fourth quarter of last year. Our exports are down, our \nimports are up, and our trade deficit is up.\n  A big part of that is improper manipulation of currency by our so-\ncalled trading partners. It is time we said no to this. We have the \nleverage and the capability of doing so. They need us more than we need \nthem.\n  When Governor Romney ran for President 8 years ago, he was in a \ndebate and explained it very succinctly: If you don't stand up--in this \ncase, to China--they will run over you. Critics say that if we stand up \nto China, it will create a trade war. But we are in a trade war; we are \njust not fighting. Finally, he said: And, anyway, they have a lot more \nto lose than we do in such an event.\n  We have no obligation--as a matter of fact, we must stop being a \npatsy for those who take advantage of us. They need our markets. They \ndesperately need to be able to sell huge amounts of\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\nproducts in our markets. If they will not comply with the rules of \ntrade, we have a right to say no and to limit access to our markets. \nThey say that would hurt American consumers--perhaps some--but in the \nlong run, we cannot allow American manufacturing to be decimated by the \nsustained manipulation of trading partners. We have to have a \nmanufacturing base in this country. The American people know this, and \nthey are worried about that.\n  Even a Walmart executive has said: If nobody is working in America, \nwho is going to buy cheap products from abroad? He even started a \nprogram to try to buy more from America.\n  Even the Department of Treasury in its October 2015 exchange rate \nreport said, ``Our judgment is that the [Yuan] remains below its \nappropriate medium-term valuation.'' In other words, it is depressed. \nChina devalued the Yuan. They gained market advantage over the United \nStates and other countries.\n  On the face of all of this, the White House has refused to adopt any \nenforceable measures. The Treasury Department repeatedly acknowledges \nwe have a problem, but they have refused to take any action to confront \nit. This is the kind of weakness we cannot accept. The time has come in \nAmerica where we cannot afford to lose a single American job to unfair \ntrading partners. We have to end this. We have to defend our people who \nare hurting.\n  While the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that has now been \nsigned by the President--off last week in New Zealand, 7,000 miles \naround the world. The President never even talked about it. Why didn't \nhe talk about it? Why didn't they highlight it? Why did they want to \nsign it 7,000 miles away? The reason is, the American people don't want \nit. He didn't really want anybody to know he had signed it, and they \nhope they can slip it through Congress at some point. But I don't \nbelieve it is going to happen. I think too many things are being raised \nand discussed that show we have to be careful about these trade \nagreements. In particular, this is one that should not pass. The White \nHouse claims that the TPP includes a side measure addressing currency \nmanipulation, but any study reveals that it does not have any real \nenforcement mechanisms.\n  The Wall Street Journal on November 5 wrote this: ``Mexico, Canada \nand other countries signaled they were open to the [currency] deal when \nthey realized it [would not] include binding currency rules that could \nlead to trade sanctions through the TPP.''\n  Get that? They were objecting to this currency rule. They like to \nmanipulate their currency, and they don't want to be subject to \nsanctions if they manipulate it. When they found out the truth--and the \ntruth is that the currency manipulation language attached to TPP means \nnothing--then they said it was OK. So objected to addressing currency \nmanipulation in the TPP until they found out this proposed fix meant \nnothing.\n  On November 6, the Japanese Finance Minister, Mr. Taro Aso, said that \n``there [will not] be any change'' in Japan's currency policy. In other \nwords, by signing on to the TPP, after studying the agreement, Japan \nrealized they are not going to have to change their policy. There is no \nteeth to the President's side-agreement.\n  We were expecting that this currency language would be placed on the \nCustoms bill that we would vote on tomorrow. It was passed in the \nSenate, and it went on the Customs bill. But when it went to the \nconference committee, President Obama said: No, we are not having this \ncurrency language in it. The conference committee eventually \ncapitulated, and struck the enforceable currency provisions in their \nreport. So we have no real enforceable mechanism now to ensure that \nAmerican workers and American manufacturing are able to maintain a \nlevel playing field with our trading partners in this regard.\n  The statement by Japan's Finance Minister caused Ford Motor Company \nto immediately object to and oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nagreement. They did it the day it was released. In their press release, \nFord said they could not support such a deal in which currency rules \nfell ``outside of [the] TPP, and . . . [failed] to include dispute \nsettlement mechanisms to ensure global rules prohibiting currency \nmanipulation are enforced.'' They could not support it.\n  Ford and all these companies are placed under terrific pressure to \nsign on to these deals. A lot of them that signed on and said they will \nsupport it don't like it, but they were basically put in a room and \nasked: What do you need to do? We will agree to some things if you will \nagree to support the deal. Many felt it was going to pass anyway, and \nthey got a few little trinkets--a few little gifts out of the TPP that \nthey liked out of the 5,000 pages that it consists of, and they have \nagreed to either be silent or support the deal. But many of these \ncompanies like Ford are very uneasy about it.\n  So where are we today? I was very pleased that one of the strong \nsupporters of trade in Congress--the new Speaker of the House, Paul \nRyan--announced yesterday that there was not support in the House to \npass the TPP now, and, in fact, he has concerns about it. He has been \nan advocate of these trade agreements. I have been worried about that. \nBut I was very pleased that at least now, in the temporary situation, \nhe has indicated that he has doubts about the agreement, it is not \ngoing to have the votes in the House.\n  Our leadership has indicated they don't intend to bring it up \nimmediately, either. I think that is a good decision. I believe we as a \nnation need to be studying how this works and studying whether these \nagreements are actually helping us. Or are they accelerating the \ndecline in American manufacturing?\n  The Bush nor the Obama White House has taken strong actions to deal \nwith currency manipulations. This administration and its own Treasury \nDepartment continues to reassure us that they are doing everything they \ncan to protect American manufacturing from unfair currency \nmanipulation. However, they repeatedly rejected Congress's efforts to \ngive the White House the tools they need to help enforce our laws. One \nof the best ways to do this is to give the White House the ability to \nimplement countervailing duties, but they have opposed those efforts \nand steadfastly seen to it that they are not made law.\n  Last year, in the spring, we had a month-long debate about the \nimportance of these measures. I think a lot of our Members learned a \ngood bit in the course of that. The Senate passed a TPP negotiating \nobjective calling for enforceable measures in the President's trade \nagreement. What did the President do? He threatened to veto the Customs \nbill if it included the kind of currency language that I have just been \ndescribing.\n  In fact, the White House even issued a Statement of Administration \nPolicy--a SAP--on this question stating that ``the Administration \nopposes the way the [Customs] bill uses the countervailing duty process \nto address currency undervaluation.'' With that objection, the \nconferees took out the language, so the bill we will vote on tomorrow \ndoes not have the language in it that passed in the U.S. Senate with 78 \nvotes in favor.\n  Last year, I wrote the President and asked him a few simple \nquestions. I believe these are simple questions that the American \npeople are entitled to have answered by the leader of our country who \nis proposing and pushing the TPP.\n  One, I asked him to state whether the TPP would increase or decrease \nour trade deficit. Shouldn't we know that? Our trade deficit is \nsurging. Some try to contend that trade deficits don't matter. They do \nmatter. They do matter if your factory is closed. Trade deficits reduce \nGDP. Some studies say that about one-half percent of growth in GDP has \nbeen reduced as a result of the trade deficit. It does impact America.\n  I further asked the President, two, whether the TPP would increase or \ndecrease the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States.\n  Third, I asked him how the TPP would affect the average hourly wages \nfor the American middle class. Shouldn't he tell us that? Shouldn't we \nbe told whether wages are going to go up or down? Shouldn't we be told \nwhether the trade deficit would increase? Shouldn't we be told whether \nmanufacturing jobs are going to increase or decrease?\n  What have they said? This is so clever. I think the media deserves \ncriticism for not talking about it more. All they have ever said was \nthat the TPP would increase jobs in the exporting industries. They \ndon't say how many jobs\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nare being lost when American factories are closed. In fact, the \nAdministration used to make specific job claims, but stopped doing so \nonce the Washington Post gave their claim that the TPP would create \n600,000 jobs four Pinocchios.\n  Let's go back to 2011, the U.S.--South Korean Free Trade Agreement. I \nvoted for it. South Koreans are good people. They are allies of ours. \nWe do business with them. I signed on to that agreement. When the \nPresident signed it, he stated to the American people it would increase \nour exports by $10 billion a year.\n  We have had a chance to look at that. How has that promise come out? \nHave we increased our exports? Well, we did increase our exports. It \nwas eight-tenths of $1 billion last year. I think we will be a little \nover $1 billion this year--not 10, 1. What about Korean exports to the \nUnited States? How did that come out? They increased annually $12 \nbillion a year. What about our trade deficit from 2010 through 2015? \nThe trade deficit with South Korea increased 260 percent.\n  Are these trade agreements effective? Are they helping America? Are \nthey fulfilling the promises being made for them? I don't think so. The \nPresident has repeatedly rejected bipartisan efforts to put protections \nin for American workers. He clearly did not follow Congress's \nnegotiating objectives. He has ignored an issue which the Senate \noverwhelmingly approved, and he failed to negotiate enforceable \ncurrency protections for American workers.\n  American manufacturers cannot wait longer. It is time to give them \nthe tools they need, a fair ability to compete, and a level playing \nfield. The Customs bill that is before us is a step in the right \ndirection. It ensures the Commerce Department and Customs and Border \nProtection share information more efficiently. It gives the Customs and \nBorder Protection new tools to identify and stop illegal trading \npractices. It provides early notification of trade surges, which helps \nensure stable prices of goods here at home, but it is important to note \nthe Customs bill is not a perfect solution. There is still work to be \ndone.\n  As I noted, Paul Volcker pointed out, all of these agreements can be \neliminated overnight through currency manipulation. We can pass this \nCustoms legislation and send it to the President, but we must realize \nthat the protections created in this legislation, the new tools that \nare provided to CBP, can be made irrelevant by our competitors that \nmanipulate exchange rates to benefit their exports.\n  We have that problem now in China, Japan, South Korea, and other \ncountries. I am not going to be satisfied until the President signs \nlegislation granting the Commerce Department real powers to protect \nAmerican workers and American manufacturing from these devastating \nmarket manipulations.\n  Our government does not offer such subsidies to American \nmanufacturers. There are other subsidies, too, that foreign countries \noffer that we don't offer. These subsidies and currency manipulations \nare forbidden by international trading standards, but they go on \nanyway, and nothing is done about it. We must not allow other countries \nto take advantage of us any longer.\n  I will note some of the quotes that we heard about this subject, but \nno action of significance has been taken.\n  On September 3, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in an interview on CNBC \nsaid, ``[China has] to understand, and I make this point to them quite \nclearly, that there's an economic and political reality to things like \nexchange rates.''\n  He is talking about currency exchange rates. There is a political \nreality there. In other words, Mr. Lew, who should be doing something \neffective besides just talking, acknowledges that currency rates have \nreal impact on Americans.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       They need to understand that they signal their intentions \n     by the actions they take and the way they announce them. And \n     they have to be very clear that they're continuing to move in \n     a positive direction. And we're going to hold them \n     accountable.\n\n  We haven't been holding them accountable.\n  Mr. Lew continues: ``I think that we have been very clear for a very \nlong time with China, how they manage their exchange rate is a matter \nof great concern to us and that they need to be willing to let market \nforces drive the value up, not just drive it down.''\n  That is true, but they are not doing it, and China is going to \ncontinue to manipulate their exports until some action is taken to stop \nthem.\n  He said in his interview:\n\n       I think it is something we will discuss at the G-20, is any \n     temptation to slip into what might look like a competitive \n     devaluation. It's both unfair and it ultimately leads to a \n     worse global economy.\n\n  I think there is some truth to that. He is acknowledging that there \nis a problem. What he is saying is our response to devaluation--it is \nunfortunate if we are put in a position where we devalue, where Korea \ndevalues, where Vietnam devalues, where other countries in the world \ndevalue. That is a currency war and that is not helpful. What needs to \nhappen is we need to push back against countries that are improperly \ndevaluing and stop that and try to create a currency system worldwide \nthat serves our Nation in an effective way. It is part of the whole \neconomic future of America.\n  Every business journalist is talking about this. They have different \nviews about what ought to be done, if anything, but everybody talks \nabout the impact.\n  This is T. Rowe Price. They did their fall 2015 Economic Outlook \nReport.\n\n       To be sure, the U.S. economy remains the world's largest \n     and most innovative. But this summer's dramatic plunge in \n     China's stock market and the unexpected devaluation of its \n     currency quickly reverberated around the globe--triggering \n     market volatility, dimming growth prospects for certain \n     industries and the countries, and exacerbating pressure on \n     emerging markets.\n\n  I don't think anybody would dispute that. That is common business \nknowledge. T. Rowe Price's Outlook Report says:\n\n       The devaluation, along with the government's unsuccessful \n     intervention in its plunging stock market, also undermined \n     confidence in China's leadership and, most important, in its \n     ability to manage the transition of its economy from one led \n     by investment and exports to one more driven by domestic \n     services and consumption.\n\n  This is where we are. We need to get this ship on the right path, and \nwe need to not adopt the TPP. We need to use the leverage we have as \nthe greatest market in the world that all these countries want access \nto. We have the leverage. They have more to fear from a trade war than \nwe do. We must put an end to it because we owe it to this country. The \nday we can give away more and more jobs and assume that this has no \nnegative impact on the American economy is over. Wages are down in this \ncountry. The percentage of Americans of working age actually working \ntoday is the lowest we have had in nearly 40 years. We have had a \ntremendous drop in the percentage of males from 24 to 55, high working \nyears, who are actually working in jobs today. It is a troublesome \ntrend. We need to reverse that.\n  We need to put people to work and get them off welfare. We need to \nput them in good job training programs to help them take jobs that \nalready exist in the country. We can't afford to bring in hundreds of \nthousands and millions of people from abroad to take jobs. Our people \nshould be trained and be taken. That is so basic as to be without \ndispute, it seems to me.\n  I think the Customs bill that we consider tomorrow is worthy of our \nsupport. In the long run, I do believe that if we don't confront the \ntrading issues that are facing America, we will regret it, and we will \ncontinue to see adverse economic consequences for the citizens we \nrepresent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S810-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S810-S812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRADE FACILITATION AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 2015 was an extremely productive year for \nour Nation's trade agenda as, on multiple occasions, both parties were \nable to come together to take several steps to advance effective trade \npolicies that\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\nwill put our Nation on a more prosperous course.\n  Hopefully, we will take another step here in the Senate before we \nleave for the recess.\n  Before the Senate breaks for recess, we are likely to vote on the \nconference report for H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act of 2015, legislation that originally passed in this \nChamber back in May of last year. As chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I was one of the original authors of this legislation, and I \nwas honored to serve as the chair of the conference committee. I \nbelieve our report represents a strong bipartisan, bicameral agreement \nthat will effectively address a number of trade policy priorities. In \nfact, it has already passed the House with a strong, super-majority \nvote. I am hoping to see a similar vote here in the Senate.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some of the \nspecifics of this legislation, which is generally referred to simply as \n``the Customs bill.'' If enacted, this compromise version of the \nCustoms bill would address three main policy goals.\n  The first goal is to facilitate and streamline the flow of legitimate \ntrade into and out of the United States. To accomplish this goal, the \nbill, among other things, reduces paperwork and bureaucratic burdens on \nU.S. traders and improves consultation between trade policymakers at \nthe Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, agency and Congress, as well \nas private actors within the trade community. It also modernizes the \nway CBP operates by authorizing the continued development and \nimplementation of the Automated Commercial Environment, or ACE. And it \nsets procedures and establishes deadlines to ensure that all import \nrequirements are fulfilled through a single window process. These \nchanges will facilitate trade by reducing unnecessary burdens and \ndelays created by an overly bureaucratic system. This will improve our \nNation's competitiveness, create jobs here at home, and provide \nnumerous benefits for our trusted trading partners.\n  The second major goal of the Customs bill is to improve enforcement \nof our trade laws. Toward that end, the bill establishes a new process \nat CBP--with strict deadlines and judicial review--for dealing with \nevasion of our antidumping and countervailing duties laws. The bill \nalso ensures that all distributions required under the Continued \nDumping and Subsidy Act are made correctly.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill improves protections for \nintellectual property rights by creating additional monitoring tools to \ndetect violations at the border and expanding requirements for USTR's \nexisting Special 301 Report on our trading partners' IP enforcement \nefforts to include trade secrets. It also establishes a chief \ninnovation and intellectual property negotiator at USTR to better \nensure that our trade agreements reflect our Nation's interests in \nprotecting intellectual property rights.\n  Providing proper enforcement and protection for intellectual property \nrights--both domestically and internationally--has long been a priority \nfor me in large part because it is so important to Utahns. In Utah \naround 19 percent of the total workforce is directly employed in IP-\nintensive jobs, according to a recent report by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce's Global Intellectual Property Center. That same study also \nnoted that Utah's IP industry employs, either directly or indirectly, \nover 590,000 Utahns--or more than half of Utah's workforce. More \nimportantly, the IP industry makes up nearly 80 percent of current \nexports from my home State. So, for obvious reasons, protecting IP was \none of my main focuses in drafting the Customs bill, passing it here in \nthe Senate, and putting together the conference report.\n  I am very pleased that my colleagues on the conference committee \nshared my desire to improve upon our current efforts, and I think our \ninventors and innovators here at home--the people who drive so much of \nour economic growth and prosperity--will benefit greatly from this \nlegislation.\n  The report addresses other enforcement priorities as well, including \nprovisions to give clear direction and robust tools for identifying and \naddressing currency manipulation from our trading partners, an issue \nthat I know is of particular interest to a number of our Members here \nin the Senate, as well as to many of our domestic businesses and \nindustries. The result of all these enforcement provisions will be \ngreater protections for American traders and consumers and a greater \nassurance that foreign competitors will not have unfair advantages in \nthe global marketplace.\n  The third major goal of the Customs conference report is to \nstrengthen the trade promotion authority statute that we enacted last \nyear, reflecting various priorities and concerns from members of both \nparties. The conference report strengthens TPA by enhancing Congress's \noversight role in crafting trade policy, specifically with regard to \nadministration nominees and at negotiating rounds for future trade \nagreements. It also strongly reaffirms that trade agreements should not \ninclude and TPA procedures should not be used with respect to, \nprovisions dealing with immigration policy or greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe bill also establishes a new negotiating objective to address \nbarriers American fishermen face in exporting U.S. fish, seafood, and \nshellfish.\n  In addition, the conference report improves provisions relating to \ntrafficking in persons in order to strengthen Congressional oversight \nand ensure that appropriate steps are being taken to put an end to \nhuman trafficking.\n  I think most of us would agree that we passed a good TPA bill last \nyear. I certainly think that we did. The conference report on the \nCustoms bill would simply ensure that the statute better reflects the \nbipartisan will and role of Congress in our trade negotiations.\n  Those have been the three main goals of the Customs bill. With this \nconference report, I think we have reached good outcomes on all three. \nBut that is not all. Other important issues are also addressed by the \nconference report.\n  For example, the bill will combat politically motivated boycotts, \ndivestments, and sanctions against Israel, bolstering our already \nstrong economic ties with one of our most important strategic allies. \nThe conference report also provides additional trade preferences for \nNepal in order to promote economic recovery in the aftermath of the \ndevastating earthquake last year. With this legislation, we will also \ntake significant steps to promote small business exports and improve \ntariff classifications relating to footwear and outerwear.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge that a number of my colleagues--as \nwell as businesses and job creators around the country--had hoped that \nthe conference report on the Customs bill would include a \nreauthorization of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bills or MTBs. I shared my \ncolleagues' desire to pass MTBs with this vehicle. As you will recall, \na revised MTB process was, after all, passed by the Senate in the \noriginal version of the Customs bill.\n  There are a handful of procedural concerns that complicate this \nissue--particularly over in the House--that made it difficult to \nadequately address MTBs in this conference report. However, the \nconference report does include a strong sense-of-Congress statement \nreaffirming our shared commitment to advancing MTB legislation in a \nprocess that provides robust consultation and is consistent with both \nHouse and Senate rules.\n  And, on top of that, I just want to reaffirm my own commitment, as \nthe chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over this issue, \nto find a process that both the House and the Senate can agree on and \nget MTBs over the finish line. Our businesses and manufacturers that \nbenefit from MTBs have waited too long for Congress to act on this \nmatter, and I am going to do whatever I can to forge a path forward.\n  Let me just say that I am very pleased with the substance of this \nconference report. It has been a long road to get us here, but in my \nview, it has been worth it.\n  I will have many people to thank in the coming days as we debate--and \nhopefully pass--the conference report here in the Senate. For now, I \nspecifically want to thank the vice chair of the conference committee, \nChairman Kevin Brady, for his work on both the committee itself and on \nthe substance of the report. I also want to thank the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, for his efforts\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\nto ensure that our final product was truly bipartisan.\n  This is a good bill. It is not perfect, by any means. But once again, \nit provides what I think are strong outcomes on many key policy \npriorities.\n  Both the House and the Senate came into the conference with their own \nset of demands, which required some compromise. However, throughout our \nnegotiations, I worked extremely hard to preserve the Finance \nCommittee's contributions to the Customs bill and to advance the \nSenate's priorities on this legislation. And in that regard, I think we \ncan all be pleased with the overall outcome, even if some compromises \nhad to be made.\n  I know that some of our members have specific objections to some of \nthe individual compromises we had to make in order to get the deal \ndone. I certainly don't want to minimize anyone's concerns. Instead, I \nwill just say that this comes with the territory of passing legislation \nthat tries to reconcile differences.\n  As a whole, I believe this legislation provides a path on the Customs \nbill that members of both parties can get behind. I am hoping we can \nget past tomorrow's cloture vote and final passage and send the bill to \nthe President's desk in short order.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work with us to make sure that \nhappens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S812-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S812-S813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JUDGE TOM JENSEN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the long career \nin public service of a good friend of mine and a friend to the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky, circuit court Judge Tom Jensen. After a \nlifetime of service in both elected office and on the bench, Judge \nJensen has announced his retirement from the bench of the 27th Judicial \nCircuit Court, effective this February 16. Kentucky is going to miss \nhis wisdom, his judgment, and the benefit of his many years of \nexperience.\n  Judge Jensen has served for 3-plus years on the bench and, prior to \nthat, had a lengthy career in the Kentucky General Assembly. He served \nin the Kentucky House of Representatives in the 1980s and 1990s. During \nhis tenure there, he was elected as minority floor leader, the highest \nRepublican position in the House of Representatives.\n  In 1996, Tom chose to not seek reelection to the house and instead \nwas elected chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky. During his \nleadership, the Kentucky GOP made some significant gains, adding an \nadditional Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives delegation \nand sending another Republican to the U.S. Senate. Republicans also \ngained control of the Kentucky State Senate for the first time in \nhistory under his watch.\n  Judge Jensen was next elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 2005, \nrepresenting the 21st District, which included Estill, Laurel, Powell, \nJackson, and Menifee Counties. As a senator, he chaired the senate \njudiciary committee and the senate budget review subcommittee on \njustice and judiciary. He also served as the vice chairman of the \nsenate natural resources and energy committee.\n  Judge Jensen has been honored many times in the Commonwealth for his \nachievements. He won recognition as Senator of the Year 2011 by the \nKentucky Narcotics Officer Association. He received the highest award \nfrom the Kentucky Department of Corrections. He received the 2011 \nPublic Advocate Award for advancing justice through criminal justice \nreforms. His alma mater, the University of the Cumberlands, also \npresented him an award for his leadership.\n  After 18 years in the legislature, Judge Jensen has dispensed his \nwisdom from the bench for the last 3-plus years, where he presides over \nmany cases involving drugs and drug offenses. He has won acclaim for \nhis wisdom and judicial temperament, but even though he has more than 6 \nyears left in his current term, he has chosen to retire and re-enter \nprivate law practice. Tom has practiced law in London since 1978, is \nlicensed to practice in all courts of the Commonwealth, and has been \nadmitted to practice before the sixth circuit of Appeals and the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  It seems advocacy is Judge Jensen's first love, and after a long and \nsuccessful career, he wants to return to the role of advocacy in the \ncourtroom. While he will certainly be missed on the bench, I know he \nwill be an outstanding attorney and advocate for his clients, who will \nbe very lucky to benefit from his experience.\n  I know my colleagues join me in extending congratulations and best \nwishes to Judge Jensen and to his family: his wife, Nannette Curry \nJensen; their two daughters, Natalie Jensen and Laura Jensen Hays; his \nson-in-law, Henry Hays; and grandchildren, Elle and Spencer.\n  As Judge Jensen begins this new chapter in his career, I want to \nthank him for his career in public service and contributions to the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. We will miss him on the bench or in the \ngeneral assembly halls, but look forward to still seeing him in the \ncourtroom.\n  A local area newspaper in Kentucky published an article extoling \nJudge Jensen's life of service. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Times-Tribune, Feb. 7, 2016]\n\n  Tri-County Profiles: Judge, Legislator returns to Private Practice \n                        After Decades of Service\n\n                 (By Christina Bentley, Feature Writer)\n\n       ``Life's too short not to do things you enjoy,'' said \n     Circuit Court Judge Tom Jensen, who recently announced his \n     retirement from the bench of the 27th Judicial Circuit Court, \n     effective Feb. 16.\n       For Jensen, the thing he will be enjoying for the \n     foreseeable future will be his London private law practice, \n     although he said he has enjoyed every phase of his career, \n     from his 18\\1/4\\ years of service in the Kentucky State \n     Legislature to his three-plus years on the bench. But his \n     heart right now is in returning to private practice.\n       ``I made a commitment that I would go back to my law office \n     . . . When I left, I said, look, I'm just going to go stay \n     three years, maybe four years, and then come back and \n     practice law and finish up that way,' '' he said. ``I may \n     take off a couple of weeks, but I am going back. My staff \n     stayed in place, and I always promised them I'd come back, so \n     I'm going to live up to my promise. And it's time. I've \n     thought about not going back. I've got six-and-a-half more \n     years or so in this term, and I considered it. At my age, \n     maybe that's the smart thing to do. It's not overwhelming \n     work to me. A lot of people have asked me why I'm going back \n     to practice law, and the thing about it is I enjoyed that. I \n     enjoyed that more than anything that I've ever done, I \n     think.''\n       Jensen said that while he has also enjoyed serving on the \n     bench, he just doesn't get the same sort of satisfaction from \n     it as he does from the process of problem solving with \n     clients.\n       ``It just turned out that I would rather advocate for \n     somebody than be the mediator or make the decision,'' he \n     said. ``I think I miss the give and take, the camaraderie you \n     develop by talking to a client, meeting with people, trying \n     to solve a problem, not deciding the issue or the problem, \n     but trying to solve it. I don't want to sound corny, but I \n     think I'm a people person, and I don't think that's the role \n     of a judge. I don't think I'll ever run for anything again, \n     and I think I'd like to finish up practicing law.''\n       Jensen's passion for advocacy is also evident when he \n     discusses the years that he spent working in the Kentucky \n     State Legislature, a political career that resulted in his \n     recognition as Kentucky State Senator of the Year for 2011.\n       ``I enjoyed (the legislature),'' Jensen said, ``trying to \n     make a difference. I think it was seeing if you could make \n     things better. It sounds crazy, but it wasn't the pay. \n     Actually, it probably cost me money, practicing law, being in \n     the legislature, being gone those periods of time. But it was \n     a good feeling if you got something accomplished. It was a \n     good feeling that you thought you could make things better. \n     Sometimes we were right, sometimes we weren't. I think, you \n     know, Kentucky's my home, and I wanted to make it as good as \n     I possibly could. Of course, I wasn't a dictator, and I \n     wasn't governor or anything like that, but I did, as Floor \n     Leader in the House, have some impact on some things. We were \n     able to put in some legislation that I think has made a \n     difference in the state. It moved at a snail's pace; \n     sometimes you'd get frustrated. Sometimes you would argue \n     that there was a better of doing it and you couldn't get your \n     way about it, but that's democracy, and the one thing that I \n     saw in the legislature: for the most part, people were up \n     there for the right reasons. They were up there to make \n     Kentucky better.''\n       Jensen is proud of much of what he accomplished in the \n     legislature, but he said his signature accomplishment was \n     House Bill 463, designed to cut down on prison overcrowding \n     in the state.\n       ``In about 2009 and 2010, we started looking at it,'' he \n     said. ``We were actually using private prisons to house state \n     prisoners, and it was costing the state a considerable amount \n     of money. It was to the point that we were either going to \n     have to build a new prison or we had to do something. So \n     that's when we\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\n     came up with (House Bill) 463 to put a lot of people on \n     probation, more than we had in the past, mainly drug \n     offenses, and it has done what we said it would do . . . Now \n     some people might say we're being too easy on them. The thing \n     about drug addiction, the way I see it, in the courtroom, \n     your criminal days are just filled up with drug cases. Most \n     of them are pleading out, a lot of probation, some \n     diversions. And then about 50 percent of them end up going to \n     prison or jail anyway because they can't comply with the \n     terms. But still, if you look at it that way, it's 50 \n     percent, which is not a good rate, but actually there are 50 \n     percent that aren't going back, which is a good rate, and it \n     has saved us a considerable amount of money.''\n       Jensen said that while he won't be running for office \n     again, he enjoyed the political process and may involve \n     himself in it in other ways, advocating for causes he \n     believes in, primarily those that help his adopted hometown.\n       ``This will be the last political position that I have,'' \n     he said. ``I'm not saying I won't help out somebody \n     politically or maybe get involved in somebody's campaign, but \n     I don't think I'll ever run for anything again. I think I'm \n     done running. But I always liked politics . . . I intend to \n     go back and practice law, but I might even lobby some. I've \n     still got some real good friends in the legislature, so I \n     might do that and lobby for some projects, mainly things that \n     I think would help Laurel County.''\n       For example, Jensen cites the ongoing efforts of Cumberland \n     River Comprehensive Care to build a juvenile drug rehab in \n     Laurel County as a project he would like to have more \n     involvement in.\n       ``One of the things that I even worked on as judge was to \n     try to help Cumberland River Comp Care get the old juvenile \n     detention facility,'' he said. ``I did help by going to \n     Frankfort to talk to the governor and some others . . . What \n     they want to do is have a juvenile rehab center in there, and \n     I can tell you, looking at my court system, these people that \n     are adults on drugs in my court, they didn't start when they \n     became 18. They started at 12, 13. It's actually alarming \n     when you talk to some of them, the age they began this stuff. \n     So I felt like that was a really good endeavor to get into. \n     I'd like to even help them maybe get some more money to fix \n     up more of that building . . . it's going to take \n     considerable money to get it up and operating, and Comp Care \n     has made the commitment to do it, but I thought I'd try to \n     maybe help them, see if I could get them a little more money \n     to help the renovation along a little quicker. That's one of \n     the projects I've developed for myself in retirement.''\n       Jensen is not a Laurel County native, but he has spent his \n     entire career here, after following a basketball scholarship \n     from his hometown of Cincinnati to Sue Bennett Junior College \n     nearly 50 years ago.\n       ``My high school coach was a guy named Ralph Rush, and he \n     was from Bush, and of course I never heard of Bush, growing \n     up in Cincinnati, but he brought me down here,'' Jensen said. \n     ``My grades were not real good in school. I was not a \n     particularly good student. I went to school mainly to play \n     sports probably . . . But that's what brought me down here, \n     and I just kind of fell in love with it here in London and \n     the surrounding area. I think I like the small town more than \n     I ever did a big city. Even though London's not a \n     particularly small town anymore, I wouldn't live anywhere \n     else. This is it. When I left Sue Bennett, I had a lot of \n     scholarship offers, and I went to Eastern Illinois \n     University. I went up there and just didn't like it, and I \n     quit. And this is 1969, I guess, and my dad was furious with \n     me. Vietnam was going on, and he said, 'Here you are going to \n     school for free. What are you going to do?' And I said, \n     'Well, I'll just join the Army.' But my dad threw such a fit \n     . . . So I came back down to London and talked to Ernie \n     Wiggins, who was my coach at Sue Bennett . . . and it just so \n     happened that night they were going to play at Cumberland \n     College, and he asked me if I wanted to go down . . . I went \n     to Cumberland and finished up there. I met my wife there. Got \n     married. Came to London--that's where her family's from--and \n     decided to go to law school about two years later.''\n       Jensen married Nannette Curry and the couple have two \n     daughters, Natalie Jensen and Laura Jensen Hays, who were \n     growing up during Jensen's time in the legislature.\n       ``I enjoyed . . . all those years doing that, looking back \n     on them, other than the time I was away from my family,'' \n     Jensen said. ``You know when you're away from your kids and \n     then they grow up, and if anything goes wrong, you start \n     blaming yourself: should have been there more,' but my wife \n     did a really good job, she covered all the bases. She was a \n     good mother, she was real involved with the kids.''\n       These days, Jensen says he's looking forward to having time \n     to watch his grandchildren swim--they are both on the swim \n     team at Corbin High School--but he doesn't really have any \n     other hobbies. He said he wants to keep serving Laurel \n     County, just in different ways.\n       ``How many years can you do this? I don't know. I just know \n     that I want to work until I can't work anymore,'' he said.\n       He would like to continue to combat the drug problem in the \n     area, something he has seen first-hand as a judge.\n       ``The biggest problem I see facing us today is drugs, and \n     if you come and watch a criminal day, it's nearly all drugs, \n     everybody that's convicted. Now, they might have a theft with \n     it, but they were stealing money to buy drugs . . . It's \n     really sad. I see that as a major problem, not only in \n     Kentucky but across the nation,'' Jensen said.\n       All told, though, Jensen said he is proud of his life's \n     work and feels fortunate to have been able to accomplish what \n     he has for the people of the region.\n       ``I'm glad I left Cincinnati to come down here. It's just \n     been a good life for me here,'' Jensen said. ``I've made a \n     lot of good friends . . . I've been very fortunate. And the \n     people of this community . . . have been really, really good \n     to me. When I was in the Senate, I was representing five \n     counties: Laurel, Jackson, Estill, Powell and Menifee \n     counties. They were always good to me. This (Laurel County) \n     courthouse here, I put the money in the budget for this and \n     the one in Jackson County, too. Those kind of things, when \n     you look back on it, things you were able to accomplish, it \n     kind of makes you feel good about some of it. Some of the \n     things you couldn't accomplish, you know, it's frustrating \n     that you thought you knew the right way to go and couldn't \n     get there, but the things that you have gotten right . . . \n     that makes you feel good. And I know what I accomplished. I \n     don't need my name on a building or anything to know what I \n     did, and I'm pretty proud of the things I did accomplish. \n     It's up to the next generation now to accomplish even more \n     and do things even better.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S813-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S813-S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS AND POLICY ENHANCEMENT BILL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I was necessarily absent from today's \nvote, vote No. 20, on the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement \nAct due to events in Illinois. Had I been present, I would have voted \n``yea'' in support of H.R. 757, to advance sanctions against North \nKorea, and was glad to see it adopted.\n  Today marks the ninth anniversary of President Obama's announcement \nof his intention to run for President. He made the announcement from \nthe steps of the old State capitol, the reconstructed building where \nAbraham Lincoln delivered his ``House Divided'' speech in my hometown \nof Springfield, IL. Today, the President and I returned to Illinois to \ncommemorate his historic announcement and his service in the Illinois \nState Senate. I try to never miss votes, but this was a very special \noccasion in my home State.\n  I have been deeply concerned about nuclear weapons programs in \ncountries such as Iran and North Korea. Almost 10 years ago, I joined \nwith then-Senator Gordon Smith in introducing the Iran Counter-\nProliferation Act, which became the basis for eventual petroleum \nsanctions against Iran that helped compel a negotiated nuclear \nagreement. I also cosponsored and voted for the Iran, North Korea, and \nSyria Sanctions Consolidation Act, which became law in 2012.\n  And I was pleased to be one of the three cosponsors of the North \nKorea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015 led by Senator Menendez, key \nparts of which are included in the bill being voted on today.\n  North Korea has bedeviled administrations, both Republican and \nDemocratic alike, and as such, this legislation is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I have some concerns with the final bill in areas where I think more \nflexibility for the executive branch would have been appropriate, but \nsuch is the nature of compromise.\n  North Korea's recent actions testing nuclear weapons, launching \nmissiles that could carry a nuclear warhead, and apparently restarting \nits plutonium production are all deeply troubling. North Korea's \nleadership does this while many of its own people are starving or \nlocked away in political prison camps. This is unconscionable.\n  One often wonders how such an isolated and repressive regime is able \nto continue such dangerous antics.\n  How does it pay for such endeavors and how does it pay off the \nsycophants and enablers needed to maintain such a police state?\n  After all, a nuclear-armed, erratic North Korea is not only a threat \nto the United States and its allies in the region, but to China as \nwell. Such actions clearly are not in China's security interests.\n  Yet, frustratingly, too often, China seems unwilling to take \nnecessary steps to isolate and pressure the North Korean regime. I \nunderstand China doesn't want a collapsed state on its border. I also \nunderstand it doesn't want a unified, Western-leaning Korea on its \nborder.\n  But I ask our Chinese friends, is what we have today really serving \nChinese security interests?\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\n  The North Korean leadership has thumbed its nose at the Chinese, \nignoring entreaties and some measure of protection offered against \ntighter sanctions or Security Council action. I was recently in New \nYork meeting with our talented Ambassador to the United Nations, \nSamantha Power, and I was dismayed at the challenge she faces in \nobtaining greater Chinese help on this matter.\n  Now, I know the Chinese and some other apologists will argue that \nNorth Korea is so isolated that further sanctions would not work and \nmay even backfire. But we know that there have been effective measures \nagainst the North, for example, going after luxury goods and overseas \naccounts linked to the regime and ruling elite.\n  Yet, despite international sanctions on luxury goods to North Korea, \nthe New York Times recently reported how China loosely defines such \ngoods and continues to allow North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's army's \nto import equipment from China to build a world-class ski resort.\n  That is right--a world-class ski resort in a country that can't feed \nits own people.\n  In fact, according to the report, Chinese customs data showed that \nNorth Korea imported $2.09 billion in luxury goods between 2012 and \n2014, including armored cars and luxury yachts.\n  And, according to United Nations trade statistics, in 2014, China \nexported $37 million worth of computers, $30 million of tobacco, $24 \nmillion of cars, and $9 million of air-conditioning equipment to North \nKorea.\n  So I hope this legislation will tighten the measures against luxury \ngoods used to buy loyalty for the regime. And I hope the Chinese \nrealize that ignoring this regime is far riskier than working with the \nUnited States and others to rein in North Korea's nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  Let us also not forget that in 2014, the U.N. General Assembly voted \nto refer the North Korean regime to the International Criminal Court \nfor well-documented crimes against humanity.\n  Earlier, a U.N. commission of inquiry report documented massive \ncrimes against humanity in North Korea, including deliberate \nstarvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape, and infanticide, \namong other crimes--most of them committed in North Korea's political \nprison camp systems.\n  The almost 400-page report concluded that the bulk of the crimes \nagainst humanity were committed ``pursuant to policies set at the \nhighest levels of the state'' and were ``without parallel in the \ncontemporary world.''\n  This criminal regime holds between 80,000-120,000 political prisoners \nin its system of gulags.\n  So I am glad this sanctions legislation also includes provisions that \naddress North Korea's terrible human rights record.\n  Let me close by reaffirming my support for our South Korean and Asian \nallies that are at the most immediate threat from North Korea--not to \nmention the more than 25,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in South \nKorea. As such, without progress on ending North Korea's nuclear \nweapons program, I support the deployment of necessary missile defense \ntechnologies to help protect these allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S814-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DISAPPEARANCE OF 43 STUDENTS IN MEXICO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been well over a year since 43 \nstudents from Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College were forcibly \ndisappeared in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. On September 26, 2014, \naround 100 students from the college traveled to the city of Iguala. \nThey were there to raise money and to obtain buses to attend a \ncommemoration of the infamous massacre of more than 600 students in the \ncapital in 1968.\n  The now former mayor of Iguala has been accused of ordering the \nattack on the students that evening. While the motive remains a \nmystery, what appears to have occurred is that the police used lethal \nforce against the students, and the 43 who are missing were handed over \nto the criminal organization Guerreros Unidos. Six people were killed \nthat day, and the fate of the 43 disappeared students remains unknown.\n  After it became clear, thanks to the courageous and dogged work of \nforeign journalists that a horrific crime had been covered up by \nGuerrero officials and the police, the Mexican Government established \nthe Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts of the Inter-\nAmerican Commission on Human Rights to provide independent analysis and \ntechnical assistance to the government.\n  The experts' September 2015 report, released on the eve of the 1-year \nanniversary of this tragedy, exposed significant deficiencies in the \ngovernment's handling of the investigation and provided an opportunity \nfor the government to restore the integrity of its own inquiry. The \ngovernment's decision to extend the experts' mandate in the fall was a \nwelcome signal of political will and a desire to build credibility.\n  But as the end of the experts' mandate nears, President Pena Nieto is \nrunning out of time to demonstrate that that political will has a \nlasting impact. The manner in which this investigation is conducted has \ngrave implications not only for the victims of the attacks in Iguala \nand their families, but for the victims of countless other incidents in \nwhich Mexican citizens have vanished during the past decade and remain \nunaccounted for.\n  I urge the Mexican Government to fully support the experts' \ninvestigation by ensuring maximum cooperation of all Mexican officials, \nincluding on issues related to the experts' access to all those \npotentially involved in this incident and the serious pursuit of all \npossible leads the experts have identified, including by soliciting \nassistance from the United States.\n  I also urge the government to publicly refute the campaign that some \nhave waged to delegitimize the experts as a way to discredit their \nwork. If the experts' work is forced to carry on with only the passive \nacquiescence of the government--or worse, subtle attempts to hinder its \nwork--rather than its active support, the progress that has been made \nmay be lost and with it the truth and the Mexican Government's \nremaining credibility on this issue.\n  The Mexican people, like people everywhere who care about human \nrights, deserve to know what happened to these students. As I \nmentioned, we also know there are thousands of other cases in Mexico of \ndisappearances and many reports by the National Human Rights Commission \nand reputable human rights organizations of incidents of torture and \nextrajudicial killings. The only way to effectively address the kind of \nlawlessness that has become far too prevalent in Mexico is to conduct \ncredible, thorough investigations and appropriately punish those \nresponsible, so the message is clear that no one is above the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S814-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S814-S815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FRED SEARS\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today, on behalf of Delaware's \ncongressional delegation of U.S. Senator Tom Carper and U.S. \nRepresentative John Carney, I wish to recognize a close friend from \nDelaware, Fred Sears--a community leader and a passionate advocate for \nall in our community; a man whose name is synonymous with business \nleadership and public service in my home State of Delaware, and a man I \nam proud to call my friend.\n  Fred is known statewide for his generosity, his enthusiasm, and his \nbusiness acumen. For decades, his impact has been felt by elected \nofficials, nonprofit and community leaders, and countless Delawareans \nof all backgrounds and careers. He is a true leader, an authentic \nchampion of the community, and the embodiment of what service means in \nDelaware.\n  Fred Sears is a Delawarean through and through, born just blocks away \nfrom his boyhood home at what was then called Wilmington Hospital, he \ngrew up across the river from Brandywine Zoo. This Delaware native \nattended Mt. Pleasant Elementary, Alfred I. DuPont Junior High, and \nWilmington Friends School for high school. Fred went on to earn a \nbusiness degree from the University of Delaware and had a great deal of \nfun, including a truly memorable spring break trip to the Bahamas with \nJoe Biden, his classmate and friend.\n  After graduating from UD in 1964, Fred began a nearly 40-year career \nin banking. Fresh out of college, Fred was\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\nscheduled to interview for a job with the Bank of Delaware, but \naccidentally walked into Delaware Trust instead. Fortunately, Delaware \nTrust was also hiring, and after starting as a management trainee, he \nrose to become the institution's first vice president of business \ndevelopment. From there, Fred went on to later work at Wilmington \nTrust, Beneficial National Bank, and ultimately Commerce Bank, where he \nwas Delaware market president.\n  While Fred was well and widely known as a leader in our financial \nservices industry, he found many other ways to serve our community as \nwell. Early in his career, Mayor Tom Maloney asked his friend Fred to \ntake a leave of absence from Delaware Trust to serve as the city's \ndirector of finance and then later as director of economic development. \nFred not only fulfilled those two roles terrifically, but decided \nafterwards to run for an at-large city council seat in 1976. Fred won \nand went on to serve two full terms.\n  Many of us in younger generations of politics after Fred's elected \nservice have called on his wisdom, his insight, and his ability to \nbring people together, as we had important decisions to make. So Fred \nserved on the transition teams of Wilmington Mayor James Sills, \nDelaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner, and co-chaired my transition team \nafter I was elected New Castle county executive in 2004.\n  For many of us, decades of success in finance, in business, in \npolitics might be the hallmark of a complete and successful career, but \nfor Fred, these experiences were just a few of the ways he fulfilled a \nlifelong passion for service in our State of Neighbors. Just over 13 \nyears ago, while Fred was at Commerce Bank, our mutual friend Jim \nGilliam, Jr., called Fred one day and said to him, ``I have a job for \nyou.'' After some convincing, Fred accepted the job, and since then, he \nhas served admirably at the helm of one of the most important \norganizations in Delaware: the Delaware Community Foundation. The DCF \nplays an integral role in my home State, helping local nonprofits \ndirect philanthropy to Delaware's most worthy causes and encouraging \nlong-term charitable giving to improve our State.\n  Since Fred began as CEO in 2002, the DCF has tripled its long-term \ncharitable funds and built its assets to $285 million. Dozens of \nnonprofits and community funds have flourished under Fred's leadership, \nand he and his team and their astute financial guidance continues to \ngenerate the funding that enables them to serve. Fred didn't join the \nDCF though just to raise money and just to be important and recognized; \nrather, he sought to improve the entire philanthropic community and \nquality of community life in Delaware, and his success in doing so \nreflects his values and his vision.\n  Fred is a true leader: honest, insightful, thoughtful; creative, \npositive and confident. And Fred possesses that rare quality: the \nability to inspire others. He has used his passion for service to \nmotivate the next generation of great leaders in our State.\n  Take, for example, one of Fred's many initiatives called the Next \nGeneration. It is one he is most proud of--and justifiably so. Next Gen \ntakes groups of civic-minded young professionals with limited or no \nexperience in philanthropy and, with just the right amount of guidance \nand encouragement, helps mold them into nonprofit board leaders. Since \n2004, Next Gen's chapters up and down the State have helped direct over \n$300,000 in grants to community needs all over my home State of \nDelaware.\n  My good friend Tony Allen, who also calls Fred a mentor and a friend \nand a brother, tells a story of how Fred helped establish the African-\nAmerican Community Empowerment Fund. The fund is today known as the \nCouncil on Urban Empowerment, and it promotes philanthropy that \nsupports educational, social, and economic empowerment of African-\nAmerican Delawareans. As Tony notes, Fred didn't just help establish \nthe fund, he wasn't just one of its first donors; he attended every \nmeeting of the group. In 2010, Tony introduced Fred when Fred Sears was \nset to receive an award for nonprofit leadership. As Tony put it then, \n``While patience is a virtue, impatience is a weapon. And Fred can be \nappropriately impatient. Fred doesn't demur to what others would call \ninsurmountable tasks and taboo topics of conversation. He takes every \nopportunity to constructively push the status quo.''\n  Tony's absolutely right, and given that legacy of leadership, it is \nno surprise Fred has been honored by countless organizations for his \nbusiness and community efforts. He has received a Lifetime Achievement \nin Philanthropy Award from the Association of Fundraising \nProfessionals. He has been given a distinguished service award from the \nWilmington Rotary Club. He has been deemed a Superstar in Business by \nthe Delaware State Chamber and was named Citizen of the Year by the \nDelmarva Council of the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Those awards and merits are certainly a reflection of Fred's values \nand his many successes. But those of us who have had the privilege to \nwork closely with Fred and to know him know that his commitment to \nservice shines most brightly in the hundreds of interactions he has \nwith Delawareans every day, whether he is offering ideas and advice or \njust saying a quick hello.\n  We know that even though Fred's leaving the Delaware Community \nFoundation, he will undoubtedly continue to serve the community he \nloves. In fact, Fred just accepted an appointment from Governor Markell \nto chair Delaware's Expenditure Review Commission, suggesting Fred has \nno intention of taking ``retirement'' literally.\n  In a testament to Fred's thoughtfulness, leadership, and sense of \ncompassion, just a day after the passing of our beloved friend Beau \nBiden earlier this year, Fred spoke to the Bidens and offered to help \nthe family establish an organization in Beau's name. That idea became \nthe Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children--and 2 days \nafter it was launched, they had already raised over $125,000.\n  If this is all there was to Fred's story, it would be a remarkable \none, but there is even more to Fred as a businessman, a philanthropist, \nand a person. If you speak to those who have been around him the \nlongest, they will tell you his true passion is his family: his wife, \nJoAnn; his son, Graham; his daughter-in-law, Kathryn; his son, Jason; \nhis daughter-in-law, Jen; and of course his treasured grandchildren, \nKylie, Paxton, and Charlie. I have no doubt that Fred's retirement \nmeans he will be spending a lot more time as Pop Pop to his three \ntreasures, becoming even more of a fixture at their frequent school \nfunctions and their baseball and soccer games.\n  Fred's friends and family will also tell you how much he adored his \nmother, Marjorie, visiting her daily at Stonegates until her passing, \nand how much he cares for his father-in-law today. They will tell you \nthat Fred loves dancing, snappy suspenders, and vinyl records.\n  Fred's friend Tom Shopa will tell you about Fred's passion for golf \nand how, for decades, he has kept track of all of his golf scores, the \nnumber of putts he made, the weather that day--recording every single \ndetail just as his father did. Fred's friends and colleagues will tell \nyou they hear Fred say thank you dozens of times every day.\n  Today I pause for a moment on the floor of this great institution to \nsay thank you to Fred. Thank you for giving your time and talents over \ndecades to more than 40 community nonprofit organizations, for serving \non countless boards, from Christiana Care to the Rodel Foundation, from \nthe Housing Partnership, to the United Way. Thank you for your decades \nof service to Wilmington and Delaware and for a lifelong commitment to \nfamily, friends, and community. Fred, as our friend Tony Allen puts it, \neveryone in Delaware is better off because of your efforts.\n  On behalf of Senator Tom Carper and Congressman John Carney, I \nwholeheartedly thank you, Fred Sears, and congratulations on many jobs \nwell done. I eagerly look forward to seeing where your so-called \nretirement will take you next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S815-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S815-S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ALEX DIEKMANN\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, at the beginning of February, \nMontana lost a true conservationist. Alexander Boris Diekmann, 52 years \nold, passed away peacefully at his Bozeman home after battling cancer \nfor many years. He is survived by his wife, Lisa, and his two sons, \nLogan and Liam.\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\n  Alex is originally from California, graduated from Yale University, \nand previously worked as a financial analyst and in a commercial real \nestate agency before deciding to pursue his love of the outdoors and \ntaking a position with the Trust for Public Land in Bozeman, MT.\n  In Bozeman, Alex worked as a senior project manager for the Trust for \nPublic Land. He not only worked diligently to increase access to public \nlands, but also strived to secure Montana's beauty for many years to \ncome. Alex did just that through his 16 years of work to protect the \nMadison and greater Yellowstone Area, which include the Taylor Fork in \nthe Gallatin Canyon, Three Dollar Bridge, Chestnut Mountain, and Frog \nRock and the restoration of O'Dell Creek in the Madison Valley.\n  A large part of his success came from Alex's remarkable ability to \nfacilitate open dialogue and cooperation amongst different interest \ngroups, such as landowners, government agencies, elected officials, and \nnonprofits.\n  Alex was known as a man very passionate about his work and his \nefforts to preserve open spaces will have a lasting impact for many \nyears to come. His heartfelt love for conservation can be understood by \nhis own words: ``It is unbelievable how proud people are of being \ninvolved in this (conservation) and that's something you can't put a \nprice tag on. The rewards are entirely different. It is all about the \nheartfelt connection we have with the places we help conserve.''\n  He worked on more than 55 projects and helped to preserve more than \n100,000 acres during his time with the Trust for Public Lands. Some of \nhis accomplishments also include conserving 23,000 acres of forested \nlands surrounding Whitefish, MT.\n  As a result of Alex's efforts, there is also an abundance of wildlife \nhabitat, water resources, and migratory corridors that are now secured \nin Montana.\n  Despite Alex's impressive achievements from his time with the Trust \nfor Public Land, he kept a humble spirit and truly cared about the \npeople he worked with. He considered the concerns of others when making \ndecisions and going about his work. He has been described by some of \nhis colleagues as honest, warm, generous, creative, and extremely \ndedicated.\n  Alex Diekmann, you will be greatly missed, but your legacy of \nconservation lives on. Thank you for doing what you did to keep the \nbeauty of Montana secure for generations to come. Montanans thank you, \nand I thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S816-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S816-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a sundry \nnomination and treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S816-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3033.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio urging the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention to take action to improve prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                 House Concurrent Resolution Number 51\n\n       Whereas, Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness \n     in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention (CDC) estimating that 300,000 Americans are \n     diagnosed with the disease each year; and\n       Whereas, Many cases of Lyme disease are never reported to \n     the CDC, as only approximately 30,000 of the estimated \n     300,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the CDC by \n     state health departments each year; and\n       Whereas, Lyme disease can cause devastating health \n     consequences if left untreated, such as severe pain, heart \n     palpitations, and chronic neurological damage; and\n       Whereas, Diagnosis of Lyme disease is difficult because \n     there is no general consensus on the definition of its \n     symptoms and the symptoms are similar to those of other \n     conditions, leading to misdiagnoses. Furthermore, current \n     Lyme disease testing methods often lead to inaccurate \n     results; and\n       Whereas, There remains much debate in the medical community \n     concerning the proper courses of action for diagnosing and \n     for treating Lyme disease; and\n       Whereas, Greater knowledge of Lyme disease and its causes \n     will put the general public in a better position to avoid \n     contracting the disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 131st General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, in adopting this resolution, \n     urge the CDC to take the following actions:\n       (1) Update definitions of Lyme disease symptoms by clinical \n     diagnosis;\n       (2) Reconsider standards and best practices for diagnosing \n     and for treating Lyme disease;\n       (3) Provide more resources for health care professionals \n     and the general public to learn about Lyme disease to aid in \n     prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease;\n       (4) Improve the techniques that state and local public \n     health agencies use to report cases of Lyme disease diagnoses \n     so that fewer cases go unreported and the CDC can better \n     monitor the incidence of the disease across the nation;\n       (5) Provide the means for improved laboratory testing or \n     funding for improved laboratory testing to enhance early \n     detection of Lyme disease in humans; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, to the United States \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the Director of \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the President Pro Tempore and Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, to the members of the Ohio \n     Congressional delegation, and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-130. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan urging the United States Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and the United States Congress to create \n     a pilot program in Michigan instituting a flexible Veterans \n     Choice Card system structured similar to a traditional health \n     care program for all veterans in Michigan; to the Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, The men and women who serve our country deserve \n     our utmost respect and appreciation. Many of them are injured \n     in the line of duty and come home to face challenging \n     physical disabilities and other\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\n     health issues. All veterans are entitled to the best health \n     care we can give them; and\n       Whereas, According to the U.S. Government Accountability \n     Office, several variables affect a veteran's ability to \n     access VA health care. Veterans may have difficulty \n     travelling to a distant facility for care or be unable to \n     secure an appointment in an acceptable period of time to deal \n     quickly with a medical issue; and\n       Whereas, To provide a more flexible VA health care system, \n     Congress enacted the Veterans Access, Choice, and \n     Accountability Act of 2014, allowing for care outside of the \n     traditional VA system. Under the act, the new Choice Program \n     will provide many veterans with VA compensated health care at \n     a non-VA center, providing more timely appointments, less \n     bureaucratic red tape, and easier travel; and\n       Whereas, As currently structured, the Choice Program limits \n     non-VA health care to veterans residing more than 40 miles \n     from a VA health facility. The law does not differentiate \n     between types of VA health care facilities. Therefore, a \n     veteran living near a small VA clinic but needing specialty \n     cardiology care at a VA facility 100 miles away will not be \n     allowed to access private cardiology care. Also, the program \n     requires that every appointment for care be cleared by a \n     program manager: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     Concurring), That we urge the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs and the United States Congress to create a \n     pilot program in Michigan instituting a flexible Veterans \n     Choice Card system structured similar to a traditional health \n     care program for all veterans in Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-131.

A bill to provide short-term water supplies to drought-\nstricken California and provide for long-term investments in drought \nresiliency throughout the Western United States; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nhistoric drought that is devastating California and much of the West.\n  To help address this disaster, today I am introducing the California \nLong-Term Provisions for Water Supply and Short-Term Provisions for \nEmergency Drought Relief Act.\n  Let me begin by saying that the El Nino we're seeing now in \nCalifornia brings with it some good news.\n  The Sierra Nevada snowpack is the deepest it has been in 5 years, and \nwater content is up.\n  The California Department of Water Resources reported in early-\nFebruary that the statewide snowpack stands at 25.4 inches, or 130 \npercent of the historical average.\n  But we are faced with three problems.\n  First, one El Nino--even a strong El Nino--won't be sufficient to \npull us out of this drought. Experts say we need at least 3 consecutive \nyears of above-average precipitation.\n  Second, we lack the infrastructure needed to store much of this \nwater. We need to do more to increase the amount of water we can hold \nfrom wet years to dry years.\n  And while river flows are extremely high from these winter storms, we \nare not taking advantage of them to the extent we should.\n  What that means is tens of thousands of acre-feet are flowing out \ninto the Pacific Ocean rather than being collected for later use.\n  So while California is getting some much-needed rain, it's not likely \nto be enough to end this historic drought.\n  Let me be clear; this drought is hurting California.\n  Mr. President, 69 communities are facing significant water supply and \nwater quality issues, 2,591 wells are critically low or dry affecting \nsome 13,000 residents; California's economy lost $2.7 billion from the \ndrought in 2015.\n  The agricultural sector lost approximately $1.8 billion from the \ndrought in 2015, exceeding the $41.5 billion loss in 2014.\n  More than 1 million acres of California farmland were fallowed in \n2015, an increase of more than 600,000 acres over 2011.\n  Since 2014, the drought has led to 35,000 permanent jobs lost in \nCalifornia, 21,000 seasonal and part-time agricultural jobs have also \nbeen lost.\n  Farmworkers cannot find employment and are forced to move in with \nfamily members or friends who are also struggling.\n  Some single mothers are traveling as far as Washington State for work \nto help support their families.\n  Land subsidence from pumping too much groundwater has caused large \nareas of the San Joaquin Valley to sink by as much as two inches per \nmonth. As a result, bridges, aqueducts and roads have already begun to \ncrack.\n  Mr. President, 50 million large trees are dead or likely will die \nfrom lack of water, and another 888 million trees experienced loss of \ncanopy cover since 2011.\n  These are just some of the many examples of the dreadful effect the \ndrought is having on California.\n  The bill I am introducing today includes a wide range of provisions \nto address two key needs:\n  First, long-term solutions. In addition to helping the many \ncommunities that are running out of water, we must create a new water \ninfrastructure that is not as dependent on annual levels of rain or \nsnow. That is why the bill includes many programs to promote long-term \ndrought resiliency.\n  California is now home to 40 million people, but is relying on State \nand Federal water infrastructure first constructed in the 1960s when \nCalifornia's population was just 16 million.\n  The Central Valley Project and the State Water Project were completed \nin the 1970s, and neither have kept pace with the rapid growth in \nCalifornia's population or economy.\n  Put another way, California's major water infrastructure has remained \nlargely unchanged for the past 40 years while California's population \nhas more than doubled.\n  To address this, we must come up with long-term solutions to address \nthese water infrastructure gaps.\n  This must include investments in water storage projects, desalination \nplants and water recycling projects, as well as programs to assist \nvulnerable communities, fund research and support ecosystem \nrestoration.\n  In addition to those long-term solutions, the bill would also provide \nshort-term, temporary solutions which are limited to the duration of \nthe Governor's drought declaration or two years, whichever is longer.\n  These provisions will help make the water-delivery system more \nefficient during this current drought, and they will do so without any \nmandated pumping levels.\n  Under this bill State and Federal officials will continue to \ndetermine appropriate pumping levels, and all short-term operations \nmust comply with existing applicable laws.\n  Let me repeat: there are no mandated levels of pumping in this bill.\n  Let me briefly discuss how this bill will help California and the \npositive impacts it will have west-wide.\n  Over the past 2 years, my staff and I have gone through an extensive \nconsultation process with both State and Federal agencies.\n  We have worked through every proposal or suggestion we received from\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nthose agencies and all are incorporated in the bill I am introducing \ntoday.\n  On the Federal side, we worked with the Department of the Interior; \nDepartment of Commerce; Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers; Fish and Wildlife Service; NOAA Fisheries; and the White \nHouse Council on Environmental Quality.\n  On the State side, we worked with the California Natural Resources \nAgency; California Department of Water Resources; California Department \nof Fish and Wildlife; and the Office of the Governor of California.\n  In addition to integrating proposals from State and Federal agency \nexperts, we have incorporated feedback from a variety of stakeholders \nincluding environmental groups; urban and agricultural water districts; \nwildlife advocates and Democratic and Republican congressional offices.\n  As part of the consultation process, we received and incorporated \nmore than 40 suggested changes.\n  I would first like to cover the long-term provisions.\n  As I said, California is home to around 40 million people, but has \nthe same water infrastructure as the 1960s, when only 16 million people \nlived in the state.\n  Given the changing climate, I believe that California will become a \ndesert state if we don't act. Droughts will only become more frequent \nand more severe.\n  That's why the long-term provisions of this bill look at new sources \nof water and new ways to store water.\n  These long-term provisions authorize a total of $1.3 billion and \ninclude desalination, recycling, storage, and loan assistance for \ndrought-stricken communities. And as I said, these investments can \nproduce a new water infrastructure not as dependent on weather.\n  This bill increases the WaterSMART authorization by $150 million for \nlong-term water conservation, reclamation and recycling.\n  Some of these WaterSMART funds can then be used for a new Bureau of \nReclamation program to help rural and disadvantaged communities that \nare running out of water. These grants would cover everything from \nemergency bottled water to long-term solutions like water treatment \nfacilities.\n  But we also need to look beyond the current emergency and consider \nways we can shift these communities from vulnerable water sources like \nwells to more sustainable and resilient water systems.\n  That's why this bill prioritizes money from the Environmental \nProtection Agency's Revolving Loan Fund for water infrastructure \nprojects that would help drought-stricken communities that are at risk \nof running out of clean water.\n  This bill also authorizes $200 million for the Reclamation \nInfrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, known as RIFIA. This loan-\nguarantee program will help water districts and municipalities fund \nlong-term solutions to store more water and provide additional clean \nwater.\n  We also need to invest in desalination and water recycling. These are \ntwo of the most promising technologies that may offer long-term \nsolutions.\n  The bill identifies 137 local recycling and desalination projects \nthat, if constructed, could produce upwards of 1.4 million acre feet in \n``new'' water.\n  This includes 27 desalination projects identified by the State--\ntotaling more than 352,000 acre-feet of water--that the Secretary of \nthe Interior must consider funding if eligible.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the Desalination Act and authorizes $100 \nmillion for feasibility studies and project design as well as \ndesalinization research to improve the energy co-efficient from reverse \nosmosis and membrane technology. These funds run through 2020.\n  In addition, the bill identifies 110 water recycling projects that \nthe Secretary of the Interior must consider funding. These projects \ntotal more than 1,060,334 acre-feet of water.\n  The bill authorizes $200 million for the Bureau of Reclamation's \nTitle XVI water recycling program and streamlines the program by \neliminating the hurdle of congressional authorization for individual \nprojects.\n  We also have to encourage public-private partnerships. That's why the \nbill funds a loan-guarantee program and other financing mechanisms to \nhelp make projects a reality.\n  If all the projects identified in the bill were completed, nearly 1.4 \nmillion acre-feet of ``new'' water could be made available.\n  Given the consensus that droughts will grow more severe, we have to \nincrease the amount of water we can hold from wet years for use in dry \nyears.\n  In order to help accomplish this, the bill authorizes $600 million \nfor water storage projects in California and other Western States. \nThese funds would be available through 2025.\n  But the Federal Government can't do it all on its own. California \nsignaled that it's ready by enacting a $7.5 billion water bond. The \nbill therefore positions the federal government as a partner with \nCalifornia to take advantage of these funds to build new reservoirs and \nexpand existing reservoirs.\n  Recognizing that the drought has taken a toll on many aspects of life \nin California, including fish and wildlife, this bill authorizes $55 \nmillion for habitat restoration efforts. Measures include protections \nfor the entire life cycle of fish, from increasing spawning habitat to \nreducing mortality during migration out to the ocean; reducing threats \nto fish, including smelt and salmon, by removing predators such as \nstriped bass from specific locations where they prey on endangered \nfish; using real-time monitoring of turbidity and fish to determine \npumping rates, rather than specific congressional mandates or targets; \nfunding daily boat monitoring to survey for smelt near the pumps when \nturbidity levels are high and the smelt are often attracted to the \npumps; funding studies to track the smelt's most current locations and \nmake decisions that are key to running pumps in a way that is not \nharmful to fish, and providing $10 million in water infrastructure for \nrefuges, a vital resource for billions of migratory birds that use the \nPacific Flyway.\n  In addition to the long-term provisions, the bill includes short-\nterm, temporary provisions to allow for more efficient operation of the \nFederal and State water systems.\n  As I stated, these emergency operations provisions last only for the \nlength of the Governor's Emergency Declaration or 2 years--whichever is \nlonger.\n  These short-term provisions will allow the agencies to capture water \nfrom winter storms. Already, the snowpack is significantly higher in \nheight and water content than the last few years, and more water is \nflowing down the Delta.\n  The bill has eight key provisions that will allow for water to be \ncaptured and stored:\n  Improved data to operate pumps. Enhanced daily monitoring and data \ncollection will help to operate pumps more efficiently, and pump at \nhigher levels when no fish are present and pump at reduced levels when \nfish are nearby.\n  The revised bill requires daily boat monitoring to survey for smelt \nnear the pumps when turbidity levels are high, so that pumping \nreductions are made based on the most up-to-date facts.\n  The bill also authorizes studies to identify smelts' location in the \nDelta on a real-time basis.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes a Delta Smelt Distribution study to \nidentify how many smelt are in different parts of the Delta in drier \nand wetter years. This is critical to know what level of take of the \nsmelt is a threat to the species.\n  Winter storms and ``payback.'' The revised bill authorizes agencies \nto increase pumping during winter storms using their best judgment to \ndetermine when and by how much.\n  Once the storms end, the agencies would no longer be required to \n``payback'' water already pumped unless there was an environmental \nreason, such as harm to fish.\n\n  This so-called ``payback'' has led to the loss of tens of thousands \nof acre-feet of water. Payback currently requires agencies to reduce \nsubsequent water pumping by an equal amount of water as was captured \nduring the storms, which results in the loss of tens of thousands of \nacre-feet of water that could instead be stored or transferred for use \nthroughout the State.\n  Agencies must explain pumping levels under the Delta Smelt Biological \nOpinion.\n  The bill does not impose any mandated pumping levels, instead leaving\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nthose pumping levels up to the discretion of the water agencies. But \nthe bill does require officials to justify the levels at which they \npump.\n  By requiring written justification for the level of pumping, the bill \nattempts to maximize the amount of water pumped by requiring officials \nto consider whether real-time monitoring justifies lowering pumping \nlevels. This water system must be operated based on science, not \nintuition.\n  I want to be clear: The revised text does not include any mandate. We \nremoved a provision that would have mandated pumping at -5000 cubic \nfeet per second in the Old and Middle Rivers, unless pumping at these \nlevels would cause additional adverse effects on the Delta smelt.\n  The 1:1 transfer ratio. The strong El Nino means more water is likely \nto be available for voluntary transfers from willing sellers with extra \nwater to buyers downstream who need water.\n  This provision helps facilitate those transfers in April and May by \nallowing a 1:1 transfer ratio. In past years, agencies have reduced the \nlikelihood of transfers by requiring water users to send more water \ndownstream than could be captured and stored at a 4:1 ratio.\n  By allowing for a 1:1 ratio--while adhering to environmental law and \nbiological opinions--more water transfers can be accomplished, \nproviding water to users who truly need it.\n  Extending the time period for water transfers by five months. The \nbill extends by 5 months the time period when transfers may take place.\n  The current transfer window of July through September is extended to \nApril through November. Extending the transfer window allows water \ntransfers to be available during the spring planting season.\n  All transfers must remain consistent with the biological opinions.\n  Expediting review of transfers and the construction of barriers. \nEnvironmental reviews of water transfers and the installation of \ntemporary barriers must be completed within 60 days, unless an \nenvironmental impact statement is required.\n  Agencies must maximize water supplies consistent with applicable laws \nand biological opinions.\n  Federal agencies can and should try to both protect species and \nprovide water supplies.\n  The bill makes very clear that agencies cannot harm the fish in \nviolation of the biological opinions--but within this environmental \nprotection mandate, the agencies should try to increase water \nsupplies--especially during a drought emergency.\n  This requirement complements the additional requirement that agencies \nmust explain any harm to the fish that requires a reduction in water \nsupplies.\n  Delta Cross-Channel Gates. The bill requires the Secretary of the \nInterior and the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that the gates remain \nopen as long as possible.\n  These gates are critically important for controlling salinity in the \nDelta. When the gates are closed, water that would otherwise be pumped \nor stored is instead used to flush salty water out through the Delta.\n  Keeping the gates open for longer will help to reduce salinity in the \ninterior Delta and avoid releasing water unnecessarily in the Central \nValley Project and State Water Project. This helps both Delta farmers \nand communities as well as those south of Delta.\n  As I stated before, all of these short-term provisions are temporary \nand will sunset when the Governor's drought emergency expires or two \nyears from the date of enactment, whichever is later.\n  We have spent untold hours working on this bill.\n  We have addressed--to the best of our ability--the concerns raised by \na host of constituent groups and individuals including \nenvironmentalists, water districts, Federal and State agencies, and the \nagricultural sector.\n  The bill reflects many meetings between Democrats and Republicans, \nwater districts, cities, rural communities, farmers, fishermen, and a \nnumber of environmental groups.\n  While this bill will not satisfy every water interest, I believe that \nthese provisions will place California on a long-term path to drought \nresiliency.\n  This is a bill that offers real help to California while adhering to \nthe laws and biological opinions that protect fish and wildlife.\n  The result of our efforts is a bill that stands a real chance of \nbeing approved by both parties and signed into law. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to make that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S825-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S825-S827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 370--RECOGNIZING THAT FOR NEARLY 40 YEARS, THE UNITED \n  STATES AND THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN) HAVE \n    WORKED TOWARD STABILITY, PROSPERITY, AND PEACE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Sullivan, Mrs. \nFeinstein, and Ms. Hirono) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 370\n\n       Whereas the February 2016 U.S.-ASEAN summit at Sunnylands \n     in Rancho Mirage, California is an opportunity to deepen the \n     United States-ASEAN partnership;\n       Whereas the United States and the Association of South East \n     Asian Nations (ASEAN) established dialogue relations on \n     September 10, 1977, with the issuing of the 1977 Joint \n     Communique Of The First ASEAN-U.S. Dialogue, and the United \n     States acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in \n     Southeast Asia (TAC) at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference \n     Session with the United States in Thailand on July 22, 2009;\n       Whereas the United States was the first non-ASEAN country \n     to appoint an ambassador to ASEAN on April 29, 2008, and the \n     first dialogue partner to establish a permanent mission to \n     ASEAN in 2010;\n       Whereas the United States has supported efforts to \n     strengthen the ASEAN Secretariat and expand its role in \n     providing greater coordination between and enhancing the \n     effectiveness of regional institutions;\n       Whereas the first-ever U.S.-ASEAN Defense Forum was held on \n     April 1, 2014, in Honolulu, Hawaii, further deepening ties on \n     the challenges to security, peace, and prosperity in the \n     region, and on November 21, 2015, the United States and ASEAN \n     elevated their relationship to the ASEAN-U.S. Strategic \n     Partnership in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at the 3rd U.S.-ASEAN \n     summit;\n       Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and \n     ASEAN can help realize their common vision of a peaceful, \n     prosperous, rules-based Asia-Pacific region that offers \n     security, opportunity, and dignity to all of its citizens;\n       Whereas ASEAN is the 7th largest economy in the world, at \n     $2,400,000,000,000, representing the United States' 4th \n     largest export market with total-two way trade in goods and \n     services reaching $254,000,000,000 and accounting for more \n     than 500,000 jobs in the United States, and it represents a \n     diverse group of nations and dynamic economies with an \n     expanding workforce, a growing middle class, and a diverse \n     set of skills, cultures, and resources;\n       Whereas ASEAN is home to critical global sea lanes located \n     at the center of the world's strongest economic growth area, \n     with $5,300,000,000,000 of global trade and more than half of \n     total shipped tonnage transiting through ASEAN's sea lanes \n     each year;\n       Whereas the United States has a national interest in \n     freedom of navigation and overflight, open access to Asia's \n     maritime commons, and respect for international law in the \n     South China Sea;\n       Whereas the South China Sea represents a critical \n     international waterway not just for the region but the entire \n     world;\n       Whereas the United States does not take sides on the \n     competing territorial disputes, but believes claimants should \n     pursue their territorial claims without resort to coercion, \n     and through collaborative diplomacy, including international \n     arbitration, and in accordance international law and \n     institutions;\n       Whereas the United States opposes all claims in the \n     maritime domain that impinge on the rights, freedoms, and \n     lawful use of the sea that belongs to all nations and upholds \n     the principles that territorial and maritime claims, \n     including territorial waters or territorial seas, must be \n     derived from land features and otherwise comport with \n     international law;\n       Whereas the United States supports the Philippines' \n     decision to use arbitration under the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), done at Montego \n     Bay December 10, 1982, to peacefully and lawfully address \n     competing territorial claims;\n       Whereas the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the \n     South China Sea (DOC) was signed by all members of ASEAN and \n     the People's Republic of China on November 4, 2002, and the \n     United States supports efforts by ASEAN and the People's \n     Republic of China to develop an effective Code of Conduct \n     (COC), encourages claimants not to undertake new or \n     unilateral attempts to change the status quo since the \n     signing of the 2002 Declaration of Conduct, including \n     reclamation activities or asserting administrative measures \n     or controls in disputed areas in the South China Sea; and \n     supports efforts to fully and effectively implement the \n     Declaration of Conduct in its entirety\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\n     and to work toward the expeditious conclusion of an effective \n     Code of Conduct;\n       Whereas the United States has invested significantly in \n     maritime security capacity building with allies and partners \n     in ASEAN to respond to threats in waters off their coasts and \n     to provide maritime security more broadly across the region;\n       Whereas the United States, as a longstanding Asia-Pacific \n     power, will maintain and exercise freedom of operations in \n     the international waters and airspace in the Asia-Pacific \n     maritime domains, which are critical to the prosperity, \n     stability, and security of ASEAN and the entire Asia-Pacific \n     region;\n       Whereas ASEAN is a partner to the United States on key \n     transnational challenges, such as terrorism, violent \n     extremism, climate change, environmental degradation and \n     pollution, energy, infectious diseases, disarmament, \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cybersecurity, \n     trafficking in persons, illicit trafficking of wildlife and \n     timber and illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing;\n       Whereas the United States, ASEAN, and other Dialogue \n     Partners, through the 2015 East Asia Summit, adopted a \n     statement on transnational cyber issues, emphasizing the \n     importance of regional cooperation to improve the security \n     and stability of cyber networks which sets an important \n     precedent for strengthening practical cooperation, risk \n     reduction, and confidence building in cyberspace;\n       Whereas the 2015 East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur adopted a \n     statement on countering violent extremism, where the United \n     States, ASEAN, and other Dialogue Partner leaders sent a \n     clear signal of the region's determination to tackle \n     challenges posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and \n     other violent extremist groups, and to respond to their \n     efforts to spread their ideology of violence and terrorism;\n       Whereas 2015 East Asia Summit leaders also adopted a \n     statement on health security in responding to diseases with \n     pandemic potential, which committed the region to improve \n     health surveillance systems in each nation, and emphasized \n     the importance of information sharing to promote early \n     detention and response to potential pandemics;\n       Whereas all members at the 2015 East Asia Summit adopted a \n     statement on maritime cooperation, including preventing \n     incidents at sea, illegal, unreported and unregulated \n     fishing, irregular migration, piracy, and to collaborate on \n     protecting the marine environment;\n       Whereas changes in climatic conditions in the ASEAN region \n     over the past four decades have resulted in major loss and \n     damage throughout the ASEAN region with disproportionate \n     impact on developing countries, with the experiences of \n     Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar and Typhoon Haiyan in the \n     Philippines providing stark evidence of the destructive \n     impacts on the region;\n       Whereas conservation and sustainable management of forests \n     throughout ASEAN play an important role in helping to \n     mitigate changes in the climate, reduce the risks of extreme \n     weather events and other climate-driven disasters, and \n     provide sustainable economic livelihood opportunities for \n     local communities;\n       Whereas the United States will pursue initiatives that are \n     consistent with broader sustainable development, including \n     the achievement of food security and poverty alleviation \n     throughout the ASEAN region, and build on cooperative efforts \n     outlined at the 2014 ASEAN-U.S. Summit to further tackle this \n     global challenge;\n       Whereas ASEAN is the third-fastest growing economy in Asia \n     after China and India, expanding by 30 percent since 2007 and \n     exceeding the global growth average for the past 10 years;\n       Whereas the ASEAN Economic Community aims to create one of \n     the largest single market economies in the world, \n     facilitating the free movement of goods, services, and \n     professionals and a sense of economic community among its \n     member states;\n       Whereas the United States is the largest investor in \n     Southeast Asia, almost $190,000,000,000 in 2012, creating \n     millions of jobs in the United States and in ASEAN Member \n     States, while investment in the United States from Southeast \n     Asia has increased more than from any other region in the \n     past decade;\n       Whereas the United States has helped ASEAN create a Single \n     Window customs facilitation system that will help to expedite \n     intra-ASEAN trade and make it easier for United States \n     businesses to operate in the region;\n       Whereas the U.S.-ASEAN Business Alliance for Competitive \n     SMEs has already trained 3,500 small-medium enterprises, with \n     nearly half of the individuals trained being young women \n     entrepreneurs;\n       Whereas United States-ASEAN development cooperation has \n     focused on innovation and capacity-building efforts in \n     technology, education, disaster management, food security, \n     human rights, and trade facilitation;\n       Whereas the Lower Mekong Initiative, established on July \n     23, 2009, is a multinational effort that helps promote \n     sustainable economic development in mainland Southeast Asia \n     to foster integrated, multi-sectoral sub-regional cooperation \n     and capacity building;\n       Whereas the United States is a committed partner with ASEAN \n     on the protection of human rights, which are essential for \n     fostering and maintaining stability, security, and good \n     governance;\n       Whereas, on November 18, 2012, ASEAN Member States came \n     together and adopted an ASEAN Human Rights Declaration that \n     by its own terms ``affirms all the civil and political \n     rights'' and the ``economic social and cultural rights'' in \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;\n       Whereas the United States supports the work and mandate of \n     the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights \n     (AICHR), including capacity building for the promotion and \n     protection of human rights and its priority, programs, and \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Program has now \n     engaged over 60,000 people between the ages of 18 and 35 \n     across all 10 ASEAN nations to promote innovation among young \n     people while also providing skills to a new generation of \n     people who will create and fill the jobs of the future;\n       Whereas the irregular movement of persons continues to be \n     one of the main security threats in the South East Asia \n     region;\n       Whereas addressing migration flows and combatting human \n     smuggling in ASEAN is an important, ongoing challenge \n     requiring increased coordination and shared responsibility;\n       Whereas, on November 21, 2015, ASEAN signed the ASEAN \n     Convention Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \n     and Children, which represents an important step forward in \n     preventing trafficking, prosecuting the perpetrators, and \n     protecting the survivors; and\n       Whereas the United States supports ASEAN Member States in \n     anti-corruption efforts through, among other initiatives, the \n     implementation of the United Nations Convention Against \n     Corruption: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the leaders of the Association of South East \n     Asian Nations (ASEAN) to the United States for the special \n     February 2016 U.S.-ASEAN summit meeting at Rancho

through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 30--EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER THE \n         DISAPPEARANCE OF DAVID SNEDDON, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. LEE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. Sasse) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 30\n\n       Whereas David Louis Sneddon is a United States citizen who \n     disappeared while touring the Yunnan Province in the People's \n     Republic of China as a university student on August 14, 2004, \n     at the age of 24;\n       Whereas David had last reported to family members prior to \n     his disappearance that he intended to hike the Tiger Leaping \n     Gorge in the Yunnan Province before returning to the United \n     States and had placed a down payment on student housing for \n     the upcoming academic year, planned business meetings, and \n     scheduled law school entrance examinations in the United \n     States for the fall;\n       Whereas People's Republic of China officials have reported \n     to the Department of State and the family of David that he \n     most likely died by falling into the Jinsha River while \n     hiking the Tiger Leaping Gorge, although no physical evidence \n     or eyewitness testimony exists to support this conclusion;\n       Whereas there is evidence indicating that David did not \n     fall into the river when he traveled through the gorge, \n     including eyewitness testimonies from people who saw David \n     alive and spoke to him in person after his hike, as recorded \n     by members of David's family and by embassy officials from \n     the Department of State in the months after his \n     disappearance;\n       Whereas family members searching for David shortly after he \n     went missing obtained eyewitness accounts that David stayed \n     overnight in several guesthouses during and after his safe \n     hike through the gorge, and these guesthouse locations \n     suggest that David disappeared after passing through the \n     gorge, but the guest registers recording the names and \n     passport numbers of foreign overnight guests could not be \n     accessed;\n       Whereas Chinese officials have reported that evidence does \n     not exist that David was a victim of violent crime, or a \n     resident in a local hospital, prison, or mental institution \n     at the time of his disappearance, and no attempt has been \n     made to use David's passport since the time of his \n     disappearance, nor has any money been withdrawn from his bank \n     account since that time;\n       Whereas David Sneddon is the only United States citizen to \n     disappear without explanation in the People's Republic of \n     China since the normalization of relations between the United \n     States and China during the administration of President \n     Richard Nixon;\n       Whereas investigative reporters and nongovernmental \n     organizations with expertise in the Asia-Pacific region, and \n     in some cases particular expertise in the Asian Underground \n     Railroad and North Korea's documented program to kidnap \n     citizens of foreign nations for espionage purposes, have \n     repeatedly raised the possibility that the Government of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was involved in \n     David's disappearance; and\n       Whereas investigative reporters and nongovernmental \n     organizations who have reviewed David's case believe it is \n     possible that the Government of North Korea was involved in \n     David's disappearance because--\n       (1) the Yunnan Province is regarded by regional experts as \n     an area frequently trafficked by North Korean refugees and \n     their support networks, and the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China allows North Korean agents to operate \n     throughout the region to repatriate refugees, such as \n     prominent North Korean defector Kang Byong-sop and members of \n     his family who were captured near the China-Laos border just \n     weeks prior to David's disappearance;\n       (2) in 2002, North Korean officials acknowledged that the \n     Government of North Korea has carried out a policy since the \n     1970's of abducting foreign citizens and holding them captive \n     in North Korea for the purpose of training its intelligence \n     and military personnel in critical language and culture \n     skills to infiltrate foreign nations;\n       (3) Charles Robert Jenkins, a United States soldier who \n     deserted his unit in South Korea in 1965 and was held captive \n     in North Korea for nearly 40 years, left North Korea in July \n     2004 (one month before David disappeared in China) and \n     Jenkins reported that he was forced to teach English to North \n     Korean intelligence and military personnel while in \n     captivity;\n       (4) David Sneddon is fluent in the Korean language and was \n     learning Mandarin, skills that could have been appealing to \n     the Government of North Korea after Charles Jenkins left the \n     country;\n       (5) tensions between the United States and North Korea were \n     heightened during the summer of 2004 due to recent approval \n     of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-\n     333) that increased United States aid to refugees fleeing \n     North Korea, prompting the Government of North Korea to issue \n     a press release warning the United States to ``drop its \n     hostile policy'';\n       (6) David Sneddon's disappearance fits a known pattern \n     often seen in the abduction of foreigners by the Government \n     of North Korea, including the fact that David disappeared the \n     day before North Korea's Liberation Day patriotic national \n     holiday, and the Government of North Korea has a demonstrated \n     history of provocations near dates it deems historically \n     significant;\n       (7) a well-reputed Japanese non-profit specializing in \n     North Korean abductions shared with the United States its \n     expert analysis in 2012 about information it stated was \n     received ``from a reliable source'' that a United States \n     university student largely matching David Sneddon's \n     description was taken from China by North Korean agents in \n     August 2004; and\n       (8) commentary published in the Wall Street Journal in 2013 \n     cited experts looking at the Sneddon case who concluded that \n     ``it is most probable that a U.S. national has been abducted \n     to North Korea,'' and ``there is a strong possibility that \n     North Korea kidnapped the American'': Now, therefore, be it--\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), that Congress--\n       (1) expresses its ongoing concern about the disappearance \n     of David Louis Sneddon in Yunnan Province, People's Republic \n     of China, in August, 2004;\n       (2) directs the Department of State and the intelligence \n     community to jointly continue investigations and to consider \n     all plausible explanations for David's disappearance, \n     including the possibility of abduction by the Government of \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;\n       (3) urges the Department of State and the intelligence \n     community to coordinate investigations with the Governments \n     of the People's Republic of China, Japan, and South Korea and \n     solicit information from appropriate regional affairs and law \n     enforcement experts on plausible explanations for David's \n     disappearance;\n       (4) encourages the Department of State and the intelligence \n     community to work with foreign governments known to have \n     diplomatic influence with the Government of the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea to better investigate the \n     possibility of the involvement of the Government of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea in David Sneddon's \n     disappearance and to possibly seek his recovery;

Mr. LEE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill H.R. 757, to improve the enforcement of sanctions \nagainst the Government of North Korea, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DISAPPEARANCE OF DAVID \n                   SNEDDON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) David Louis Sneddon is a United States citizen who \n     disappeared while touring the Yunnan Province in the People's \n     Republic of China as a university student on August 14, 2004, \n     at the age of 24.\n       (2) David had last reported to family members prior to his \n     disappearance that he intended to hike the Tiger Leaping \n     Gorge in the Yunnan Province before returning to the United \n     States and had placed a down payment on student housing for \n     the upcoming academic year, planned business meetings, and \n     scheduled law school entrance examinations in the United \n     States for the fall.\n       (3) People's Republic of China officials have reported to \n     the Department of State and the family of David that he most \n     likely died by falling into the Jinsha River while hiking the \n     Tiger Leaping Gorge, although no physical evidence or \n     eyewitness testimony exists to support this conclusion.\n       (4) There is evidence indicating that David did not fall \n     into the river when he traveled through the gorge, including \n     eyewitness testimonies from people who saw David alive and \n     spoke to him in person after his hike, as recorded by members \n     of David's family and by embassy officials from the \n     Department of State in the months after his disappearance.\n       (5) Family members searching for David shortly after he \n     went missing obtained eyewitness accounts that David stayed \n     overnight in several guesthouses during and after his safe \n     hike through the gorge, and these guesthouse locations \n     suggest that David disappeared after passing through the \n     gorge, but the guest registers recording the names and \n     passport numbers of foreign overnight guests could not be \n     accessed.\n       (6) Chinese officials have reported that evidence does not \n     exist that David was a victim of violent crime, or a resident \n     in a local hospital, prison, or mental institution at the \n     time of his disappearance, and no attempt has been made to \n     use David's passport since the time of his disappearance, nor \n     has any money been withdrawn from his bank account since that \n     time.\n       (7) David Sneddon is the only United States citizen to \n     disappear without explanation in the People's Republic of \n     China since the normalization of relations between the United \n     States and China during the administration of President \n     Richard Nixon.\n       (8) Investigative reporters and nongovernmental \n     organizations with expertise in the Asia-Pacific region, and \n     in some cases particular expertise in the Asian Underground \n     Railroad and North Korea's documented program to kidnap \n     citizens of foreign nations for espionage purposes, have \n     repeatedly raised the possibility that the Government of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was involved in \n     David's disappearance.\n       (9) Investigative reporters and nongovernmental \n     organizations who have reviewed David's case believe it is \n     possible that the Government of North Korea was involved in \n     David's disappearance because--\n       (A) the Yunnan Province is regarded by regional experts as \n     an area frequently trafficked by North Korean refugees and \n     their support networks, and the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China allows North Korean agents to operate \n     throughout the region to repatriate refugees, such as \n     prominent North Korean defector Kang Byong-sop and members of \n     his family who were captured near the China-Laos border just \n     weeks prior to David's disappearance;\n       (B) in 2002, North Korean officials acknowledged that the \n     Government of North Korea has carried out a policy since the \n     1970's of abducting foreign citizens and holding them captive \n     in North Korea for the purpose of\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n     training its intelligence and military personnel in critical \n     language and culture skills to infiltrate foreign nations;\n       (C) Charles Robert Jenkins, a United States soldier who \n     deserted his unit in South Korea in 1965 and was held captive \n     in North Korea for nearly 40 years, left North Korea in July \n     2004 (one month before David disappeared in China) and \n     Jenkins reported that he was forced to teach English to North \n     Korean intelligence and military personnel while in \n     captivity;\n       (D) David Sneddon is fluent in the Korean language and was \n     learning Mandarin, skills that could have been appealing to \n     the Government of North Korea after Charles Jenkins left the \n     country;\n       (E) tensions between the United States and North Korea were \n     heightened during the summer of 2004 due to recent approval \n     of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-\n     333) that increased United States aid to refugees fleeing \n     North Korea, prompting the Government of North Korea to issue \n     a press release warning the United States to ``drop its \n     hostile policy'';\n       (F) David Sneddon's disappearance fits a known pattern \n     often seen in the abduction of foreigners by the Government \n     of North Korea, including the fact that David disappeared the \n     day before North Korea's Liberation Day patriotic national \n     holiday, and the Government of North Korea has a demonstrated \n     history of provocations near dates it deems historically \n     significant;\n       (G) a well-reputed Japanese non-profit specializing in \n     North Korean abductions shared with the United States its \n     expert analysis in 2012 about information it stated was \n     received ``from a reliable source'' that a United States \n     university student largely matching David Sneddon's \n     description was taken from China by North Korean agents in \n     August 2004; and\n       (H) commentary published in the Wall Street Journal in 2013 \n     cited experts looking at the Sneddon case who concluded that \n     ``it is most probable that a U.S. national has been abducted \n     to North Korea,'' and ``there is a strong possibility that \n     North Korea kidnapped the American''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) expresses its ongoing concern about the disappearance \n     of David Louis Sneddon in Yunnan Province, People's Republic \n     of China, in August, 2004;\n       (2) directs the Department of State and the intelligence \n     community to jointly continue investigations and to consider \n     all plausible explanations for David's disappearance, \n     including the possibility of abduction by the Government of \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;\n       (3) urges the Department of State and the intelligence \n     community to coordinate investigations with the Governments \n     of the People's Republic of China, Japan, and South Korea and \n     solicit information from appropriate regional affairs and law \n     enforcement experts on plausible explanations for David's \n     disappearance;\n       (4) encourages the Department of State and the intelligence \n     community to work with foreign governments known to have \n     diplomatic influence with the Government of the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea to better investigate the \n     possibility of the involvement of the Government of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea in David Sneddon's \n     disappearance and to possibly seek his recovery; and\n       (5) requests that the Department of State and the \n     intelligence community continue to work with and inform \n     Congress and the family of David Sneddon on efforts to \n     possibly recover David and to resolve his disappearance.\n

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaties transmitted to the Senate on February 10, 2016, by \nthe President of the United States: U.N. Convention on the Use of \nElectronic Communications in International Contracts, Treaty Document \nNo. 114-5; Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for \nPersons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, \nTreaty Document No. 114-6; U.N.

I further ask that the treaties \nbe considered as having been read the first time; that they be \nreferred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's messages \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, subject to certain declarations and understandings, I \ntransmit herewith the United Nations Convention on the Use of \nElectronic Communications in International Contracts (Convention), done \nat New York on November 23, 2005, and entered into force on March 1, \n2013. The report of the Secretary of State, which includes an overview \nof the Convention, is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n  The Convention sets forth modern rules validating and facilitating \nthe use of electronic communications in international business \ntransactions. The Convention will promote legal uniformity and \npredictability, and thereby lower costs, for U.S. businesses engaged in \nelectronic commerce.\n  The Convention's provisions are substantively similar to State law \nenactments in the United States of the 1999 Uniform Electronic \nTransactions Act (UETA), and to the governing Federal law, the \nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, Public Law \n106-229 (June 30, 2000). Consistent with the Federal law, all States \nhave enacted laws containing the same basic rules on electronic \ncommerce, whether based on UETA or on functionally equivalent \nprovisions. The Federal statute allows States that enact UETA, or \nequivalent standards, to be subject to their State law, and not the \ncorresponding provisions of the Federal law.\n  The United States proposed and actively participated in the \nnegotiation of the Convention at the United Nations Commission on \nInternational Trade Law. Accession by the United States can be expected \nto encourage other countries to become parties to the Convention, and \nhaving a greater number of parties to the Convention should facilitate \nelectronic commerce across borders.\n  The Convention would be implemented through Federal legislation to be \nproposed separately to the Congress by my Administration.\n  The Convention has been endorsed by leading associations and \norganizations in this area, including the American Bar Association and \nthe United States Council on International Business. The United States \nGovernment worked closely with the Uniform Law Commission regarding the \nnegotiation and domestic implementation of the Convention.\n  I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to \nratification, subject to certain understandings and declarations.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 10, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate \nAccess to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, \nor Otherwise Print Disabled, done at Marrakesh on June 27, 2013 \n(Marrakesh Treaty). I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, \na report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Marrakesh Treaty \nthat includes a summary of its provisions.\n  This copyright treaty, concluded under the auspices of the World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO),\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\nadvances the national interest of the United States in promoting the \nprotection and enjoyment of creative works. The Marrakesh Treaty lays a \nfoundation, in a manner consistent with existing international \ncopyright standards, for further opening up a world of knowledge for \npersons with print disabilities by improving their access to published \nworks.\n  The United States played a leadership role in the negotiation of the \ntreaty, and its provisions are broadly consistent with the approach and \nstructure of existing U.S. law. Narrow changes in U.S. law will be \nneeded for the United States to implement certain provisions of the \ntreaty. Proposed legislation is being submitted to both houses of the \nCongress in conjunction with this transmittal.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Marrakesh Treaty, and give its advice and consent to its \nratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 10, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, subject to certain declarations and understandings set \nforth in the enclosed report, I transmit herewith the United Nations \nConvention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade, \ndone at New York on December 12, 2001, and signed by the United States \non December 30, 2003. The report of the Secretary of State, which \nincludes an overview of the proposed Convention, is enclosed for the \ninformation of the Senate.\n  The Convention sets forth modern uniform rules governing the \nassignment of receivables for use in international financing \ntransactions. In particular, the Convention facilitates the use of \ncross-border receivables financing by: (a) recognizing the legal \neffectiveness of a wide variety of modern receivables financing \npractices; (b) overriding certain contractual obstacles to receivables \nfinancing; and (c) providing clear, uniform conflict-of-laws rules to \ndetermine which country's domestic law governs priority as between the \nassignee of a receivable and competing claimants.\n  As a global leader in receivables financing, the United States \nactively participated in the negotiation of this Convention at the \nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law with the support \nof U.S. business interests. Drawing on laws and best practices \nprevalent in the United States and other countries where receivables \nfinancing flourishes, the Convention would promote the availability of \ncapital and credit at more affordable rates and thus facilitate the \ndevelopment of international commerce. Widespread ratification of the \nConvention would help U.S. companies, especially small- and medium-\nsized enterprises, obtain much-needed working capital financing from \nU.S. banks and other lenders to export goods, and thereby help create \nmore jobs in the United States.\n  The rules set forth in the Convention do not differ in any \nsignificant respect from those contained in existing U.S. law. In \nparticular, in virtually all cases application of the Convention will \nproduce the same results as those under the Uniform Commercial Code \nArticle 9, which all States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, \nand the Virgin Islands have enacted.\n  I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to \nratification, subject to certain declarations and undertakings set \nforth in the enclosed report.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 10, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual \nPerformances, done at Beijing on June 24, 2012 (Beijing Treaty). I also \ntransmit, for the information of the Senate, a report of the Secretary \nof State with respect to the Beijing Treaty that includes a summary of \nits provisions.\n  This copyright treaty, concluded under the auspices of the World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO), advances the national \ninterest of the United States in promoting the protection and enjoyment \nof creative works. The Beijing Treaty provides a modern international \nframework for the rights of performers in motion pictures, television \nprograms, and other audiovisual works, similar to that already in place \nfor producers of such works, for authors, and for performers and \nproducers of sound recordings, pursuant to other WIPO copyright \ntreaties the United States has joined.\n  The United States played a leadership role in the negotiation of the \ntreaty, and its provisions are broadly consistent with the approach and \nstructure of existing U.S. law. Narrow changes in U.S. law will be \nneeded for the United States to implement certain provisions of the \ntreaty. Proposed legislation is being submitted to both houses of the \nCongress in conjunction with this transmittal.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Beijing Treaty, and give its advice and consent to its \nratification, subject to a declaration pursuant to Article 11 of the \nBeijing Treaty as described in the accompanying Department of State \nreport.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 10, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States: \n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, subject to certain understandings set forth in the \nenclosed report, I transmit herewith the United Nations Convention on \nIndependent Guarantees and Stand-By Letters of Credit (Convention), \ndone at New York on December 11, 1995, and signed by the United States \non December 11, 1997. The report of the Secretary of State, which \nincludes an overview of the proposed Convention, is enclosed for the \ninformation of the Senate.\n  As a leader in transactional finance, the United States participated \nin the negotiation of this Convention at the United Nations Commission \non International Trade Law with the support of U.S. commercial and \nfinancial interests. The Convention establishes common rules on stand-\nby letters of credit and other independent guarantees, instruments that \nare essential to international commerce, and thereby reduces the \nuncertainty and risk that may be associated with cross-border \ntransactions. With two minor exceptions, the Convention's provisions \nare substantively similar to the uniform State law provisions in the \nUniform Commercial Code Article 5 (Letters of Credit), which all States \nand the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have \nenacted.\n  Ratification by the United States of this Convention can be expected \nto encourage other countries to become parties to the Convention. While \neight countries currently are parties to the Convention, having a \ngreater number of parties to the Convention would promote the stability \nand efficiency of international commerce.\n  The Convention has been endorsed by leading banking and business \nassociations in the United States.\n  The Convention would be implemented through Federal legislation to be \nseparately transmitted by my Administration to the Congress.\n  I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to its \nratification, subject to certain understandings set forth in the \nenclosed report.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 10, 2016.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States: \n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nDominican Republic (the ``Treaty''), signed at Santo Domingo on January \n12, 2015. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty would replace the extradition treaty between the United \nStates and the Dominican Republic, signed at Santo Domingo on June 19, \n1909. The Treaty follows generally the form and content of other \nextradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It would \nreplace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern ``dual \ncriminality'' approach, which would enable extradition for such \noffenses as money laundering and other newer offenses not appearing on\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nthe list. The Treaty also contains a modernized ``political offense'' \nclause and provides that extradition shall not be refused based on the \nnationality of the person sought. Finally, the Treaty incorporates a \nseries of procedural improvements to streamline and speed the \nextradition process.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 10, 2016. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/senate-section/article/S832-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2016\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
