Mr. President, our country needs a multiyear highway \nbill, and we are close to finally passing a fiscally responsible and \nbipartisan one. Time is running short to get a bill through Congress, \nbut as with most legislation, we still intend to consider some \namendments from both sides of the aisle as we continue to work to pass \nit. We will start on that today.\n  Most important is a proposal that would repeal ObamaCare and allow \nour country to start over fresh with a real health care reform \nproposal. There is no question that I will be voting for it. There is \nno question that every Senator should join me in doing so. This is a \nlaw filled with higher costs, fewer choices, and broken promises.\n  This is a law that has failed repeatedly and continues to hammer \nhard-working middle-class families. The vote we will take this \nafternoon represents a stark choice for every Senator: protect a \nPresident who likes a law with his name on it or stand with the middle \nclass by finally opening the way to truly affordable care.\n  Another proposal relates to the Export-Import Bank. I will be voting \nagainst it. The Export-Import Bank is a New Deal relic that has \noutlived any usefulness it might have had. If a project is worthy, \nprivate banks will step in to finance it. If it is not worthy, we \nshould definitely not be financing it\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\nby putting American taxpayers on the hook. Either way, Ex-Im is not \nnecessary.\n  At the same time, I understand that many Senators on both sides take \na different view. A significant percentage of my conference and many \nDemocrats support the Ex-Im's reauthorization. They are entitled to \nthat view. I don't see a reason why they shouldn't be allowed a debate \nand then a vote to sort all of this out. I have said repeatedly and I \nhave said publicly for months that the Ex-Im supporters from both \nparties should be allowed a vote. I also said publicly that the highway \nbill would be an obvious place to have that vote.\n  When there is overwhelming bipartisan support for an idea, even if I \nam opposed to it, it doesn't require some special deal to see a vote \noccur on that measure. This is the U.S. Senate, after all, where we \ndebate and vote on all kinds of different issues. The supporters of Ex-\nIm can still lose a vote, of course. They are not the only ones with \npassion on their side. Those on my side of the issue are passionate, \ntoo, and this debate might just present the perfect opportunity to make \nthe case against Ex-Im and carry the day in an open and democratic \nvote, but whatever the outcome, the slots for these amendments will be \nopen once the Senate disposes of them and that will open the \npossibility of considering other important amendments.\n  Let me repeat that. The slots for these amendments will open once the \nSenate disposes of them.\n  We know there are many other ideas from both sides of the aisle about \nhow to improve the highway bill further before its completion, but we \nalso know time is running short to complete our work on the underlying \nhighway bill. Jobs are on the line. Infrastructure projects important \nto the people we represent are on the line. We have to get this done. \nWith cooperation, we can ensure that more ideas from both sides of the \naisle are still heard and voted upon.\n  This is a new Senate. Amendment votes are hardly a rarity here \nanymore. We will have more opportunities soon to address other issues \nin the weeks and months ahead. I will work with colleagues to help \nensure that votes on other priorities occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/26/senate-section/article/S5702-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--AMENDMENT NO. 2266, AS MODIFIED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on one or \nmore motions to overturn rulings of the Chair brought by disgruntled \nRepublican Senators. At another time, Republican Senators would have \ncalled this a number of things, not the least of which is the nuclear \noption.\n  Republicans have controlled the Senate for about 7 months now. It has \nbecome increasingly clear that what is wrong with the Senate today is \nthe same thing that has troubled the Senate before Republicans took \ncontrol--dysfunction in the Republican caucus.\n  Republicans probably will not succeed in overturning the rules of the \nSenate today, but an honest observer of the Senate will recognize that \nthe day is coming when they will, unless the Republicans become the \nparty of Eisenhower, Dodd, Dirksen, and even President Reagan.\n  I was amused to hear the Republican leader say he looks forward to \namendments. Many Senators on our side look forward to being able to \noffer amendments; for example, to improve work safety provisions in the \nbill, but the amendment tree is filled. They are not going to have that \nopportunity unless something untoward happens.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on two amendments. How Senators vote on \nthese amendments will demonstrate their priorities--who is for American \nfamilies and who is doing the bidding of special interests. Consider \ntoday's vote on yet another Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act--ObamaCare.\n  By all accounts, it is working and working well. Is it perfect? Of \ncourse not. That is why we have invited the Republicans for years now \nto join with us in having a better health care delivery system, but \nObamaCare is helping families all across this great Nation. There are \nmany facts.\n  Insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with \npreexisting conditions. They can't discriminate against anyone as they \ndid when they discriminated, basically, against everyone. Twelve \nmillion more people now have coverage through Medicaid programs and \nCHIP programs. Health care costs are growing but very slowly--the \nslowest rate of growth in a long time. Perhaps, most importantly, the \nshare of Americans who lack health insurance coverage has dramatically \ndeclined.\n  After the latest Supreme Court victory less than a month ago, I \nurged, at that time, my Republican friends to stop banging their heads \nagainst the wall because obviously it doesn't feel good. Why do they \ncontinually try to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Apparently, two \nSupreme Court wins and more than 50 votes by congressional Republicans \nto repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act are not enough for the \nRepublican leader and his friends. They are insisting on yet another \npartisan attempt to strip health insurance coverage from more than 19 \nmillion Americans--coverage that a recent Commonwealth Fund survey \nfound that more than 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with this \nprogram.\n  Republicans claim this ObamaCare repeal is part of their crusade to \nreduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nrecently estimated that repealing the Affordable Care Act will increase \nthe Federal budget by more than $350 billion.\n  So today's vote isn't going to be about reducing the deficit. This is \nabout caving to special interests. This is about the Republicans and \ntheir leader desperately trying to appease their base.\n  I am appalled and, more than that, disappointed by these continued \npartisan attempts to strip away insurance coverage for almost 20 \nmillion Americans. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. The \nPresident signed it into law, and the Supreme Court has put a stamp of \napproval on it, not once but twice.\n  It is time for Republicans to move on and not take another \npolitically motivated vote that is going nowhere.\n  Finally, on another subject, the Export-Import Bank. After the \nObamaCare vote, we will then consider the reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank--in fact, their charter. Once again, how Senators \nvote on the Export-Import Bank will reveal their loyalties.\n  Companies like Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, Honeywell, \nalong with dozens of companies in sparsely populated Nevada, along with \nthousands of small businesses across this country, use this Bank to \nfind a market for billions of dollars of their exports. It is not only \nfor Boeing, Caterpillar, and these big companies; it is for thousands \nand thousands of small businesses.\n  Most of the jobs in America are created not by the great big \ncompanies but by small businesses, and they need this. They want this. \nThat is why even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce must have been desperate.\n  Finally, siding with us on something, they support the Ex-Im Bank. \nThis year alone, the Export-Import Bank supported 165,000 jobs in \nAmerica. A vote for the Export-Import Bank is a vote for jobs, a \nhealthy economy, and the prosperity of American families. Conversely, a \nvote against reauthorization is nothing more than a shameless attempt \nto garner the affection of the Koch brothers. After all, opposition to \nthe Export-Import Bank is a prerequisite to having their support. All \ncandidates running for President stumble over themselves to say: What \ndo\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nthe brothers want today? What they want today is a vote against this \nBank, contrary to the needs of the American people. The Koch brothers \ndistributed a survey to the Republican Presidential hopefuls that \nessentially obligates those candidates to oppose the Ex-Im Bank.\n\n  I ask my colleagues today: Are you working for the American people or \nare you doing the dirty work for a couple of billionaire oil barons? A \nvote for the Export-Import Bank is a vote for American families. A vote \nagainst the repeal of ObamaCare is a vote for American families. Today, \nthe Senate Democrats will vote for American families.\n  I was hoping to say a word about Senator Inhofe while he was on the \nfloor, and unfortunately he is not here now. The senior Senator from \nOklahoma is a very conservative Republican Senator. He and I disagree \non a lot of things, but I have great respect for his courage on this \nlegislation. I think this legislation, which we are moving forward on, \nis far from perfect, but I listened to Senator Jim Inhofe yesterday \nwhen he was answering the President. A Republican always follows the \nPresident. I think Senator Inhofe did a fine job of explaining how \nimportant it is that we have a transportation bill. We have said a lot \nof nice things about Senator Boxer, but it is time we said some nice \nthings about Jim Inhofe because this bill would not be where it is \nwithout his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/26/senate-section/article/S5703-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, someone was speaking with me. What is the \norder? I get up to 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, it is Sunday, and it is unusual for us to be here, but \nas I have said many times, this is the reason we are here. Look at this \nphoto. This is the bridge collapse in California, and there is another \nreport coming that says this is going to be far from the last one we \nhave.\n  This is a bridge that carries thousands of people a day from \nCalifornia to Arizona. This can happen in any one of our States, and \nthe fact is we need to pass a transportation bill. I am so grateful to \nmy colleague Senator Inhofe and to everyone on that committee who got \nthis started.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee had a 20-to-0 vote so we \ndon't have to face this anymore. After that, we had other committees \nact, just not in as bipartisan a fashion, so it was difficult. At that \npoint, Leader McConnell and Senator Durbin stepped in with Senator \nInhofe and me, and all we did was try to get to where we are right now, \nwhich is a place where we can pass a fair funding bill.\n  I have a list. It is very interesting, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   FEDERAL SHARE OF EACH STATE'S CAPITAL OUTLAYS FOR HIGHWAY & BRIDGE\n                                PROJECTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          State                             Percentage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRhode Island............................................             102\nAlaska..................................................              93\nMontana.................................................              87\nVermont.................................................              86\nSouth Carolina..........................................              79\nHawaii..................................................              79\nNorth Dakota............................................              78\nWyoming.................................................              73\nSouth Dakota............................................              71\nConnecticut.............................................              71\nNew Mexico..............................................              70\nIdaho...................................................              68\nAlabama.................................................              68\nNew Hampshire...........................................              68\nMissouri................................................              65\nMississippi.............................................              65\nColorado................................................              64\nMinnesota...............................................              64\nOklahoma................................................              63\nArkansas................................................              62\nGeorgia.................................................              62\nTennessee...............................................              62\nWest Virginia...........................................              61\nIowa....................................................              59\nOhio....................................................              58\nVirginia................................................              57\nMaine...................................................              57\nWisconsin...............................................              55\nOregon..................................................              54\nIndiana.................................................              54\nNew York................................................              54\nDistrict of Columbia....................................              52\nCalifornia..............................................              49\nNevada..................................................              49\nArizona.................................................              49\nNebraska................................................              49\nKansas..................................................              49\nLouisiana...............................................              48\nNorth Carolina..........................................              48\nMaryland................................................              48\nTexas...................................................              47\nPennsylvania............................................              46\nWashington..............................................              45\nKentucky................................................              44\nMichigan................................................              41\nDelaware................................................              41\nFlorida.................................................              39\nIllinois................................................              39\nUtah....................................................              38\nMassachusetts...........................................              37\nNew Jersey..............................................              35\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my State counts on the Federal Government \nfor one-half of its transportation funding, highways, and transit. \nRhode Island counts on the Federal Government for 100 percent; Alaska, \n93 percent; Montana, 87 percent; South Carolina, 79 percent; Hawaii, 79 \npercent; North Dakota, 78 percent; Wyoming, 73 percent; Connecticut, 71 \npercent; New Mexico, 70 percent, and it goes down from there, but the \nvast majority of our States count on the Federal Government for \nfunding.\n  What we have done, as both Senators Reid and McConnell have pointed \nout, is we just keep patching up the highway trust fund.\n  I could go to a bank and say: I want to buy a House. The banker says: \nYou have great credit. That's the good news. The bad news is you can \nonly get a 5-month mortgage. What would I do in that case? I would \nsadly walk away. I can't afford to invest in a home if I have only 5 \nmonths of a mortgage. It is the same way with the States. The way the \nHouse went about it, and the way some of my colleagues on both sides \nwant to handle it, is another 5-month extension, and our States are \nstopping.\n  On Tuesday, the general contractors told us that in 25 States they \nhave\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\nbegun to lay off many, many, many construction workers. We all know at \nthe height of the great recession we had millions of unemployed \nconstruction workers. It has been tough to get them back to work, and \nremember the businesses that employ them, it has been tough to get them \nback to work.\n  It has been so hard and now we are seeing a reversal of all the hard \nwork we did because we did a 2-year transportation bill that was \nhelpful. This would be the first 6-year authorization in decades and \nthe first 3-year funding, I believe, in 10 years. It could be more. We \nneed to do this.\n  I want to close by saying this: Working across the aisle is always \ndifficult, but it is exciting, it is interesting, and the staffs from \nboth sides have shown they can do it.\n  Last night, I was on the phone with Senator McConnell's staff--I \nthink it was 20 minutes until 12--and I kept saying: If we can't fix \nthis, I have to call the Senator. They said: Please don't. Well, we \nworked it out this morning.\n  I see the Senator from Rhode Island Mr. Whitehouse is coming in now. \nI told the Senators that Rhode Island counts on this Federal highway \ntrust fund for 100 percent of the funding. I also did not mention that \nSenator Whitehouse is on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He \nis a very active and productive member. There is a program in there \nthat is important to all of our States--major programs that will \nfinally have a fund, regardless of whether it is Kentucky, Utah, Rhode \nIsland or California.\n  This is a fair bill. It has a good increase for highways and a good \nincrease for transportation. States and cities want it. Yesterday, I \nfound out from Senator Inhofe--who, by the way, did a terrific national \nradio address on this issue, and I thank him for that--that the mayor \nfrom Oklahoma City and the mayor from New York City wrote a letter \nsaying how desperately they need the certainty. We are on the cusp.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. President, I personally support the Ex-Im Bank. I know my \ncolleague Senator McConnell and I do not agree on this. I think the Ex-\nIm Bank is important.\n  We should not forget that we are still recovering from the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. We need to stay focused on \nputting people back to work, creating jobs, and growing the economy.\n  We can do that by passing the transportation bill. I thank my \ncolleagues for working together on this bill, and for their patience \nwith this process. This bill will support millions of jobs and \nthousands of businesses nationwide, it will help rebuild our country's \ninfrastructure, and it will strengthen our economy.\n  It will also provide funding certainty for State and local \ngovernments and the construction industry, which was hard hit in the \nGreat Recession. There are approximately 1.4 million fewer construction \nworkers today compared to 2006--which equals roughly 20 percent of all \nconstruction jobs--and over 522,000 construction workers remain out of \nwork in the U.S.\n  The law that authorizes our transportation programs will expire in \njust 5 days--on July 31st--and the Highway Trust Fund is going to run \nout of money shortly after that. Many States, including Utah, Arkansas, \nGeorgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming, have delayed or canceled construction \nprojects due to the uncertainty in Federal transportation funding.\n  We have the opportunity to pass a bill, the DRIVE Act, which is vital \nfor jobs and the economy. Last week, a letter was sent from 68 groups \ncalling on the Senate to vote for a six-year reauthorization of federal \nsurface transportation programs. This letter was signed by labor groups \nsuch as the Operating Engineers, the Laborers International, and United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters, as well as business groups such as the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the \nNational Retail Federation.\n  This letter was also signed by the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO, our State DOTs, who know \nbetter than anyone the importance of certainty from a long-term bill.\n  Today we have the opportunity to do even more to help grow our \neconomy by reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. I applaud my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who worked so hard to reach a bipartisan \nagreement for a multi-year reauthorization.\n  At a time when too many of our workers are still looking for jobs, \nthe Ex-Im Bank helps American businesses create jobs. Last year alone, \nit financed $27.5 billion in exports for over 3,000 businesses, \nsupporting over 164,000 American jobs. And over the last 6 years, it \nhas supported a total of 1.3 million jobs.\n  Not only that, the bank helps the United States level the playing \nfield when so many other countries heavily subsidize their exports. The \nEx-Im Bank helps American businesses compete fairly.\n  Even more important, this job creation comes at no cost to the \npublic. The Ex-Im Bank covers its own costs--sometimes even returning \nmoney to the Treasury--and maintains a default rate of under 2 percent.\n  Unfortunately, as of July 1, the Ex-Im Bank has been unable to \nprocess any new transactions--and this poses a real threat to our \neconomy. Business deals that are months or years in the making are now \non hold, and may fall through, unless we reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank \nimmediately.\n  Let me tell a few stories about the Ex-Im Bank's impact in \nCalifornia. Since 2009, the Ex-Im Bank has helped almost 1,000 \nCalifornia exporters--702 are small businesses--to make deals to export \n$18 billion in American products.\n  Here are just a few examples of what the Ex-Im Bank has done for \nCalifornia businesses.\n  FirmGreen, based in Newport Beach, CA, is a veteran-owned business \nthat converts landfill gas and other renewable resources into renewable \nenergy and clean fuel. Financing from the Ex-Im Bank enabled FirmGreen \nto lead a landfill gas project in Brazil, which generated 165 new \nmanufacturing jobs across seven States. Unfortunately, FirmGreen \nrecently lost a $57 million contract because of the uncertainty \nsurrounding the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization. The company's CEO Steve \nWilburn put it well recently, ``For Congress to create a partisan issue \nout of a bipartisan entity that is supporting U.S. business and growing \njobs simply for the debate is just wrong.''\n  Los Kitos Produce, a minority, woman-owned produce company in Orange, \nCA, wanted to expand its business to new markets overseas. To reduce \nthe risks involved in selling to new foreign buyers, the company \napplied for an insurance policy from the Ex-Im Bank. This insurance \nfacilitated $750,000 in sales and the company's expansion into Colombia \nand Korea. This helped to increase exports from 5 percent to 25 percent \nof their total sales.\n  Martha Montoya, CEO of Los Kitos Produce, said:\n\n       Without the Ex-Im Bank, I'd lose my growers' trust to ship \n     overseas. Our growers reinvest everything back into their \n     business and back into their community. They can't afford to \n     risk not being paid. Congress needs to support American small \n     business by reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. The bottom line is: \n     without Ex-Im Bank, we wouldn't be able to export.\n\n  ProGauge Technologies of Bakersfield, CA, manufactures machines that \ninject steam into reservoirs to thin out oil so it is easier to pump. \nIn recent years, the company received $15.6 million in Ex-Im loan \nguarantees. Exports now make up 65 percent of the company's revenue. \nProGauge President Don Nelson said:\n\n       Without Ex-Im bank, [a lender] would make us put up 100 \n     percent collateral, and we would have no money available for \n     operations. . . . Revenues would go down by about 75 percent \n     and I'd have to lay off between 50 and 60 people. Ex-Im is \n     critical to our business.\n\n  The Washington Post reported that ProGauge will have to withdraw its \nbid for a $30 million project in the Middle East if the Ex-Im Bank is \nnot reauthorized. ``It's going to be devastating for us'' said CEO Don \nNelson. ``Basically, we just won't be able to operate anymore.''\n  Wiggins Lift Company is a small business in Oxnard, CA, that employs \nover 50 workers and has been family owned for three generations. The \nEx-Im Bank recently provided financing of $1.4 million for Wiggins to \nexport its forklifts to three Brazilian companies. This deal will help \nto sustain an estimated 30 jobs at Wiggins Lift.\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\n  ``Ex-Im's guarantee is a positive for everyone'' said Wiggins Lift \nCEO Michelle McDowell. ``These sales are helping us continue to grow, \nadd employees, and contribute to the U.S. economy.''\n  These are just a few stories of what will be lost if the Ex-Im Bank \nis not re-authorized. Every day that the Ex-Im Bank is unable to make \nnew loans, more and more businesses will lose opportunities to compete \nand sell their products worldwide, and that means jobs lost right here \nin America.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. Let's \npass the highway bill. Let's create jobs and strengthen our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important reauthorization.\n  To sum it up, we have a lot of small businesses that count on the Ex-\nIm Bank to finance them so they can export our products. We have so \nmany in our State.\n  I hope it passes on a bipartisan vote, and I thank Leader McConnell. \nI know this is not something he likes at all, but he made a commitment \nand he is sticking to it.\n  Lastly, we are going to have a vote to overturn ObamaCare. Senator \nHatch and I were discussing how much we disagree on this point, but I \ntold him I wouldn't hold back. I think it doesn't make any sense.\n  We are looking at millions of people nationwide who now have health \ninsurance and cannot be told by their insurer they have a preexisting \ncondition like high blood pressure or diabetes, forget it. We have so \nmany families that now have their 24-year-old, 25-year-old, 26-year-old \non their insurance.\n  I have stories that will make you feel good--stories from people in \nmy State. One person had her cancer caught at a very early stage, and \nas a result of that she has lived to tell the tale. Before ObamaCare, \nshe couldn't have gotten the tests she needed to discover this deadly \ncancer.\n  I just say rhetorically to my friends on the other side--and they are \nmy friends. I will tell you, we have really built up some relationships \nover this bill, which I am so happy about. Why don't we work together \nto fix the problems? We know no bill is perfect. The Transportation \nbill is far from perfect, and we had to fix that too.\n  Maybe there is a new day dawning. We keep saying that, but it doesn't \nseem to be happening. But maybe something good is going to come from \nthe bipartisanship, tough as it has been. The Transportation bill is \nfar from perfect. I wanted to do so much more on safety, and I have to \nsay that Senator Nelson did such a good job. I must have talked to \nSenator Wyden half a dozen times. He kept putting on pay-fors that were \ngood, but they were rejected by the other side. We could have done so \nmuch more if we had gone that way. We did what we could do, and just as \nin the trade battle where our caucus was very split, our caucus is very \nsplit here.\n  I hope we can find enough courage and interest, and most important, \nkeep this in mind: This is, to me, the poster child of why we have come \ntogether. This America, this doesn't look like America. It is wrong, \nand we can come together and hopefully vote for Ex-Im Bank, against the \nrepeal of ObamaCare, and then move forward with a good cloture vote \ntomorrow night on our very much compromised bill on transportation--\nbecause it is a compromise.\n  Again, my thanks to people on both sides of the aisle--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and everybody--for moving this along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2328\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have spent much of my time in public \nservice working to promote bipartisanship in health care. In fact, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here. I think he may \nspeak next. Our colleague from Tennessee Senator Alexander is a \ncosponsor of my comprehensive health care reform bill. So, for me, \nbipartisanship and health care policy is enormously important, and \nthere are certainly plenty of ways in which Democrats and Republicans \ncould be working together to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. \nUnfortunately, that does not seem to be on the menu either today or in \nthis Congress.\n  Today, instead of looking forward on health care in America, the \nSenate, on a transportation bill, will have a vote on whether to go \nbackward on health care--backward to the days when health care in \nAmerica was for the healthy and the wealthy. I specifically used those \nwords because the moment you repeal the Affordable Care Act, millions \nof Americans lose protection against preexisting conditions. The moment \nthat happens, if you are healthy and wealthy, no sweat, but for the \nmillions who are aren't, they are back in that abyss where they go to \nbed at night worried that they may get wiped out the very next morning \nbecause they have a preexisting health condition.\n  Protection for those individuals will be gone the moment the Senate \nvotes. I hope the Senate will not vote for ending the Affordable Care \nAct this afternoon, but the moment it does, gone is that protection for \npreexisting conditions. Gone are the tax credits. These are \nopportunities for Americans to get a little bit of tax relief when \nhard-working families pay for health insurance--gone when we repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. Gone would be the protections that bar insurance \ncompanies from charging top dollar for rock-bottom coverage. Gone would \nbe the protections for young adults. Right now, they can't be locked \nout of their parents' insurance plans. Gone would be the protection for \nindividuals to make sure their insurance isn't canceled the moment they \nget sick. Once again, pregnancy could be considered a preexisting \ncondition.\n\n  So what I think this shows is that this debate is no longer about \nnumbers on a page, bills we write, lots of charts, lots of graphs, lots \nof small print. But this isn't an abstraction, when we go back, as I \nhave described, to the days when health care was for the healthy and \nthe wealthy. More than 16 million Americans have gained health \ninsurance coverage by virtue of the Affordable Care Act. Their health \nis on the line every single time there is a vote to repeal that law. So \nthose are the consequences.\n  I will wrap up because I see my good friend from Tennessee is here, \nas well as my Senator and my colleague from Utah. Both of them have \njoined me repeatedly in trying to promote bipartisan approaches on \nhealth care policy. I don't take a backseat to anybody in this body on \nworking on health care policy in a bipartisan fashion. There is nothing \nthat I think would be more valuable than to have Democrats and \nRepublicans come together, not to talk about repealing this law but to \nfind ways to strengthen it. There is not a law that has been passed \nthat we can't strengthen. And having spoken with my friend from Utah \nand my friend from Tennessee repeatedly, I think they know I am serious \nabout reaching out for common ground with respect to this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The pie-in-the-sky insistence that the Affordable Care Act \nwill be repealed and somehow we will not have the suffering I have just \ndescribed--that is not reality.\n  What we ought to do is reject this amendment to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act and then get back to work in a bipartisan way to strengthen \nthe law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Chair please inform me when 10 \nminutes has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n\n\n                   Appeal of the Ruling of the Chair\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today there will be at least three \nvotes. The first, as we have heard, is to end debate on Senator \nMcConnell's amendment to repeal ObamaCare. The second will be to end \ndebate on the Export-Import Bank. Then there may be a third vote on an \nappeal by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz, to overturn a ruling of the \nChair that an amendment of his is not in order. This is how that came \nabout. On Friday Senator Cruz offered an amendment regarding Iran.\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\nThe Chair ruled that the amendment was not in order because--and this \nis what the Chair said, in fact--``it is inconsistent with the Senate's \nprecedents with respect to the offering of amendments.'' The Senator \nfrom Texas then appealed the ruling of the Chair. His intention today \nwill be to try to obtain a majority vote to overturn the Chair's \nruling.\n  I respect the Senator's strong desire to offer his amendment, but I \nbelieve he ought to do it within the Senate rules or I believe we \nshould change Senate rules in the way our rules prescribe. If, instead, \na majority of Senators agree with the Senator from Texas, the Senate \nwill be saying that a majority can routinely change Senate rules and \nprocedures anytime it wants on any subject it wants in order to get the \nresult it wants. The problem with that, as former Senator Carl Levin of \nMichigan once said, is that a Senate that changes its rules anytime a \nmajority wants is a Senate without any rules.\n  Think of it this way. Football season is coming up. Let's say the \nTennessee Titans are playing football against the Indianapolis Colts in \nNashville and the home team sets the rules of the game. So when the \nTitans gain 9 yards, they change the rules to say 9 yards is a first \ndown or when the Colts gain 100 yards, the Titans say: Sorry, you need \n110 yards to score a touchdown. No one would want to play such a game. \nNo one would want to watch such a game. No one would respect such a \ngame. That is why every Monday in New York City a team of former \nNational Football League officials reviews every referee's call and \nnoncall from the previous Sunday's games played in the NFL. The league \nwants to make absolutely sure its rules are followed. And the NFL has a \nrules committee that meets between seasons to consider changes in the \nrules. It has rules about how to change its rules. The NFL, of course, \nwouldn't even consider allowing the Titans to change the rules in the \nmiddle of a game in Nashville in order to defeat the Colts.\n  The U.S. Senate has a rules committee, too, and we have rules on how \nto change our rules. We should follow those rules. The U.S. Senate is \nthe chief rulemaking body for the United States of America. If we \ncannot follow our own rules, how can we expect 320 million Americans to \nfollow the rules we write for them? If we render ourselves lawless, how \ncan we expect our fellow Americans to respect and follow the rule of \nlaw?\n  There is a practical problem with what the Senator from Texas seeks \nto do. If he succeeds, it will destroy a crucial part of what we call \nthe rule of regular order in the U.S. Senate. He will create a \nprecedent that destroys the orderly consideration of amendments. There \nwill be unlimited amendments. There will be chaos. And ironically, \nwhile destroying regular order, he wouldn't get the vote on the Iran \namendment he seeks. That is because if he overrules the Chair and \ncreates another branch of the amendment tree, the Senate leaders have a \nright to offer an amendment to fill that new branch of the tree before \nhe does.\n  The U.S. Senate is unique in the world. It has been called the one \nauthentic piece of genius of the American political system. Its \nuniqueness is based upon a variety of rules, precedents, procedures, \nand agreements that encourage extended debate. This process encourages \nconsensus, and consensus is the way we govern a complex country, \nwhether it is a civil rights bill or a trade agreement or an education \nbill. But a body of 100 of us that operates by unanimous consent \nrequires restraint and good will on the part of Senators to function. \nWe saw a good example of that a couple of weeks ago when the Senate \npassed 81 to 17 in 1 week a complex elementary and secondary education \nbill. Any Senator could have made that process much more difficult, but \nnot one did, and the country is impressed with that result.\n\n  There are different ways--several different ways--to establish Senate \nrules and procedures, but they all fall under the same umbrella. There \nare standing rules adopted by the first Senate in 1789 with the advice \nof Thomas Jefferson. There are standing orders. Sometimes we set rules \nby passing a law, such as the Budget Act. Sometimes we establish a rule \nby unanimous consent or by agreeing to a new precedent. Taken together, \nall of these represent the full body of the Senate's Rules of \nProcedure. These Rules of Procedure have several things in common, no \nmatter how they were established. The authority for establishing and \nchanging each of them comes from the same place: article I, section 5 \nof the United States Constitution. Every one of them can be changed by \n67 votes, following rule XXII of the Senate, except that a standing \norder may be changed with 60 votes.\n  One other thing these different forms of rules and precedents have in \ncommon is that the latest change supersedes whatever rule or precedent \nwas established earlier. So if the Senator from Texas persuades the \nmajority of us to overrule the Chair today, that decision governs the \nSenate forever until it is changed or unless it is changed. So there is \nno real difference between changing a rule or changing a precedent. \nWhat is important is not how the precedent was established or the rule \nwas established but what is being overturned.\n  It is true that occasionally the Senate majority uses its power to \noverturn the ruling of the Chair to refine the interpretation of rules \nor precedents. This means that in some limited circumstances, the \nSenate changes its rules by majority vote.\n  The question today is not whether we can overturn the ruling of the \nChair but whether we should overturn the ruling of the Chair. I believe \nwe should not do so. To do so would destroy regular order in the \nSenate. It would create chaos in the Senate. Most importantly, a Senate \nin which a majority routinely changes the rules by overruling the Chair \nis a Senate without any rules.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to change our rules and \nprocedures. This would be the wrong way. I urge my colleagues to not \nagree with the Senator from Texas in his effort to overturn the ruling \nof the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n             Treating Each Other With Courtesy and Respect\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Senate in my \ncapacity as President pro tempore. I hope my colleagues will give \nattention to what I am about to say and will take it to heart because I \nspeak from the heart out of respect for my colleagues and out of love \nfor this great body in which we are all privileged to serve.\n  The Senate has a long and justly celebrated tradition of comity and \nrespect among Members. Although there have been occasional exceptions \nthroughout history, on the whole, Senators have taken great care to \ntreat each other with courtesy and respect, both in private discussions \nand in public deliberations. We do this for several reasons--first, \nbecause mutual respect is essential for us to be able to work together \nto forge consensus on difficult issues that stir deep and sometimes \ndivisive feelings. Passing meaningful legislation in this body \ntypically requires the two parties to work together, and that, in turn, \nrequires a trust and a certain level of good will. Courtesy and decorum \nfoster an atmosphere where we can work in good faith to find common \nground, where we can appeal to nobler instincts to do what is best for \nall Americans, not just those of a particular partisan persuasion.\n  The second reason we treat each other with courtesy and respect is \nbecause it is the honorable thing to do. We come to this body as 100 \nmen and women with vastly different backgrounds, life experiences, and \nviews on how government should operate. But we share a common humanity \nand a common goal to improve this great Nation and to secure the \nblessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity. We divide into \nparties and join caucuses. We fight passionately about matters of \ntremendous consequence. But we do not become enemies. We remain \ncolleagues. And colleagues treat each other with respect. We treat each \nother with honor even when we feel another has perhaps not accorded us \nthe same esteem. Squabbling and sanctimony may be tolerated in other \nvenues or perhaps on the campaign trail, but they have no place among \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate.\n  The third and most important reason we treat each other with courtesy \nand respect is because we are the people's representatives. We are not \nhere on\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\nsome frolic or to pursue personal ambitions; we are here because the \npeople of the United States have entrusted us with the solemn \nresponsibility to act on their behalf in shaping our Nation's laws. \nThis is a high and holy calling. It is not something to take lightly. \nIt is a sacred trust in which pettiness or grandstanding should have no \npart. We are here to do serious work. In doing this work, egos will \ninevitably be bruised. Feelings from time to time may be hurt. This is \ninherent in the nature of politics. But we are here to carry out the \npeople's business. We serve the people, not our own egos. When we are \non the losing side of a particular debate, when we are disappointed, we \npick ourselves up and move ahead to the next challenge.\n  Our Nation's Founders designed the Senate to play a special role in \nour constitutional system. In contrast to the more raucous, populist \nHouse, the Senate was to be a body of deliberation and reasoned \njudgment. Senators were to seek the common good and consider national, \nnot just parochial, interests in crafting legislation and considering \nnominees.\n  Decorum is essential to executing this constitutionally ordained \nrole. Deliberation and reasoned judgment require an atmosphere of \nrestraint, an atmosphere of thoughtful disagreement. Deliberation \nwithout decorum is not deliberation at all; it is bickering. And \nbickering is beneath this body.\n\n  Regrettably, in recent times, the Senate floor has too often become a \nforum for partisan messaging and ideological grandstanding rather than \na setting for serious debate. It has been misused as a tool to advance \npersonal ambitions, a venue to promote political campaigns, and even a \nvehicle to enhance fundraising efforts--all at the expense of the \nproper functioning of this body. Most egregiously, the Senate floor has \neven become a place where Senators have singled out colleagues by name \nto attack them in personal terms and to impugn their character--in \nblatant disregard of Senate rules which plainly prohibit such conduct.\n  The Senate floor has hosted many passionate debates on crucial issues \nover the years. Tempers from time to time have flared. Voices have on \noccasion been raised. But we have almost universally confined our \ncriticisms to policies and to ideas, to what we think is wrongheaded \nabout particular bills or proposals. We have not, at least in my \nmemory, called our opponents dishonest or sought to disparage their \nmotives.\n  To bring personal attacks to the Senate floor would be to import the \nmost toxic elements of our current political discourse into the well of \nthe Senate, into the very heart of this institution. This would serve \nonly to pollute our deliberations, to break the bonds of trust that are \nessential for achieving some measure of consensus, and to invite the \ndysfunction that so saturates our media and popular culture into this \nstoried Chamber.\n  For those of us who care about the Senate as an institution and who \nwant it once again to help solve the vexing challenges that face our \nNation, such misuse of the Senate floor must not be tolerated. Each of \nus--Republicans and Democrats alike--must stand together in support of \nthe Senate's time-honored traditions of collegiality and respect. We \nmust stand resolute in requiring that the Senate's formal rules \nrequiring dignity and decorum be observed. And we must ensure that the \npernicious trend of turning the Senate floor into a forum for advancing \npersonal ambitions, for promoting political campaigns, or for enhancing \nfundraising activities comes to a stop. There are enough other \nplatforms for those seeking to accomplish those objectives; the Senate \nfloor need not be one.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that many of my colleagues are quite new \nto the Senate and may not yet have had many opportunities to experience \nits proper institutional role as a forum for reasoned deliberation and \nconstructive debate. Some are less familiar with its traditions of \ncomity and respect. Others may know little of the Senate's history in \nrising above parochialism and narrow self-interest. And a few, I regret \nto say, seem unconcerned for its historic pivotal role in promoting \nconsensus and helping to overcome our Nation's challenges.\n  As one who has had the privilege of serving here for the past four \ndecades, I can attest from firsthand experience that the Senate can be \nand has been in times not too far past a distinguished and constructive \nbody that does much good. I recall vividly times when this body was \nmarked by good will rather than rancor and disrepute. In some respects, \nthe Senate today is but a mere shadow of its former self, another \ncasualty of the permanent political campaign. This is deeply \ndisheartening to those like myself who were here to experience this \nbody's better days, and it has severely damaged the proper governance \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I have been frank in my remarks today. This candor \nstems from my genuine concern for this body and its future. I have been \nfrank because I have seen so much of what I love about this body \nfrittered away in recent years for small-minded, shortsighted, partisan \ngain. By virtue of my long service here in the Senate and my role as \nPresident pro tempore, I am a dedicated institutionalist. I care deeply \nabout this institution and want it to work.\n  Our current majority leader has made important strides in putting the \nSenate back on a path toward meaningful deliberation and constructive \nlawmaking aimed at the common good, but his efforts and those of other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who take the long view in seeking \nto build up this institution will not suffice unless each one of us is \ncommitted to instilling comity and respect as a core feature of \neverything we do.\n  Let's each move forward with a renewed sense of honor and respect, a \nresolve not to tolerate misuse of the Senate floor, a commitment to do \nour part to restore civility and constructive debate as defining \ncharacteristics of this body, and a renewed willingness to work \ntogether for the good of all Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                   Appeal of the Ruling of the Chair.\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Utah for an \nexcellent speech. I entirely agree with his call for civility and \ndecorum and respect. No Member of this body should engage in ad hominem \nattacks directed at any other Member of this body, be they a Republican \nor be they a Democrat. At the same time, I would note that it is \nentirely consistent with decorum and with the nature of this body \ntraditionally as the world's greatest deliberative body to speak the \ntruth. Speaking the truth about action is entirely consistent with \ncivility. Indeed, in a quote often falsely attributed to George Orwell, \nthe sentiment has been expressed thusly: ``In a time of universal \ndeceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.''\n  I would make four brief points.\n  First of all, on Friday I gave an unusual speech--a speech unlike any \nI have given in this Chamber. It was not a speech I was happy to give. \nIt was a speech to which the senior Senator from Utah has responded. I \nwould note that in the course of that speech I described an explicit \npromise the majority leader had made to me and to all 53 Republican \nSenators. Neither the majority leader, nor the Senator from Utah, nor \nthe Senator from Tennessee has disputed that the majority leader, in \nfront of every Republican Senator, made that promise, looking me in the \neyes--namely, that there was no deal on the Export-Import Bank, that \nits proponents could offer it in the regular order and there would be \nno special preferences whatsoever. We saw on Friday that promise was \nfalse.\n  In particular, on the amendment on the Export-Import Bank, first of \nall, it was not offered by its proponents, it was called up by the \nmajority leader. Very few of us get our amendments called up by the \nmajority leader because he has priority of recognition, he can edge out \nany other amendment in this Chamber.\n  Secondly, the majority leader followed that by filling the tree--a \nprocedural mechanism that he had often decried when the former majority \nleader employed it to block other amendments.\n  Third, the majority leader filed cloture on the Export-Import Bank \namendment--a tool he has used only once in his entire tenure as \nmajority leader.\n  Those were extraordinary steps designed to force a vote to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank, and they were\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\ndirectly contrary to the promises the majority leader made to all 53 \nRepublicans and to the press. My saying so may be uncomfortable, but it \nis a simple fact entirely consistent with decorum, and no Member of \nthis body has disputed that promise was made and that promise was \nbroken.\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee gave a learned speech on changing \nthe rules of this body through appealing the ruling of the Chair, and I \nvery much agree. When the former majority leader used the nuclear \noption, it was wrong to violate the rules. But the amendment tree does \nnot come from the rules, the amendment tree comes from the precedents, \nand precedents are set precisely through appealing the rulings of the \nChair by a majority vote.\n  Indeed, I would note that previously many Members of this body have \nvoted in favor of overruling the ruling of the Chair, including my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, who has voted 4 times in his \ncareer to overrule the ruling of the Chair; my friend the majority \nwhip, who has voted 5 times in his career to overrule the ruling of the \nChair; and, indeed, the distinguished majority leader, who has voted 14 \ntimes in his career to overrule the ruling of the Chair. I would note \nbeyond that, that as recently as April 2, 2014, there was a third-\ndegree appeal precisely like the one I have filed that was filed by \nSenator Vitter. The ruling of the Chair was appealed, and a significant \nnumber of Republicans voted in favor of that appeal, including the \nmajority leader and including the majority whip.\n  Many Republicans railed against the filling of the tree when the \nDemocratic leader was the majority leader. If it was an abuse of power \nthen, it remains so today. Indeed, I would note what the current \nmajority leader said at the time: ``The practical effect of [filling \nthe tree] is to disenfranchise the people I and my members represent, \nand, more significantly, a significant number of the people his members \nrepresent whose voices are simply not heard in the Senate.''\n  Beyond that, let me say on the substance that if you oppose filling \nthe tree to silence the amendments of Members, be they in the majority \nparty or the minority party, you should vote in favor of allowing my \namendment to go forward.\n  I would note that the Senator from Tennessee was incorrect that it \nwould allow unlimited amendments. It would simply add a third branch to \nthe tree and not unlimited amendments.\n  At the same time, if you are resolved to stand with our friend and \nally the Nation of Israel, if you are resolved to stand with American \nhostages in Iran, and if you are convinced to not lift sanctions on \nIran unless and until Iran recognizes Israel's right to exist as a \nJewish State and that they release four American hostages, then you \nshould vote to allow that amendment to be voted on.\n  Needless to say, if you oppose the Export-Import Bank, you should \nvote to allow that amendment to be voted on.\n  Finally, if you want other amendments on pressing issues, be they \ndefunding Planned Parenthood, be they stopping sanctuary cities, be \nthey passing Kate's Law, or be they ending the congressional exemption \nfrom Obamacare, you should vote in favor of allowing this amendment to \nbe voted on.\n  A great many Members of this body have given long, eloquent speeches \non how this body operates when each Member has a right to offer \namendments--and even difficult amendments. We debate and resolve them. \nThat is the heart of this vote, and I would encourage each Member here \nto vote his conscience or her conscience on both substance and the \nability of the Senate to remain the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments of my \ncolleague, the junior Senator of Texas, both last week and this week, \nand I would have to say he is mistaken.\n  First of all, if, in fact, the majority leader had somehow \nmisrepresented to the 54 Senators what the facts are with regard to the \nEx-Im Bank, I suspect we would find other voices joining that of the \njunior Senator, but I hear no one else making such a similar \naccusation.\n  Secondly, I would just say to my colleague that there is an \nalternative explanation. There is an alternative explanation. As the \nmajority leader has said time and time again, anytime 65 Senators want \nto do something here in the Senate, sooner or later they are going to \nget their way. Indeed, that represents the vote in support of the Ex-Im \nBank--something I will end up voting against but where I realize that \nmajorities will carry the day eventually.\n  But if the rule the junior Senator from Texas is arguing for is \nembraced, we will lose all control of the Senate schedule; there will \nbe chaos; and, indeed, we won't be able to meet simple deadlines, such \nas the one that exists on the 31st of this month with regard to the \nexpiration of the transportation fund, because even after we close off \ndebate, any Senator who wants to get a vote on an amendment will be \nentitled to do so. And that cannot be the rule. It is not the rule. It \nhas never been the rule. And that is why what the junior Senator is \nattempting to do is so extraordinary.\n  I will be opposing that, and I hope all of our colleagues will join \nus in opposing that because ultimately what that would mean is that a \ndetermined 51 Senators who want to raise taxes, who want to pass \nObamacare 2.0, who want to pass a cap-and-trade bill or a carbon tax, \nwho want to pass Dodd-Frank 2.0, or any additional government \nspending--they will be able to do it. They will be guaranteed an \nopportunity to get an amendment and be able to vote on that amendment, \nand it will pass in the Senate. I don't think that is in the best \ninterests of the Senate. I don't think it is in the best interests of \nthe 27 million people whom the junior Senator and I represent together. \nI certainly don't believe that is in the best interests of this \ninstitution which we all revere.\n\n  If all 100 Senators have the opportunity to offer an amendment \nwithout restraint, then there will never be any deadline. There will \nnever be any conclusion, and we would not be able to do the simple work \nthat we have been asked to do on behalf of the American people.\n  The final point is this. I know the junior Senator feels passionately \nabout this amendment. But the fact of the matter is that we have a \nprocess that has been set up to review the Iran deal that President \nObama and Secretary Kerry negotiated. We are going to have a chance to \nexamine it, debate it, and review it over the next 2 months, and then \nwe will have a chance to vote on it. There is a time and place for this \nvote. I will no doubt support the same position that the junior Senator \nis supporting. It is not on this bill. It is not now. It is not at the \nexpense of breaking the orderly procedures that make sure that everyone \ngets a chance to participate. I would just say in conclusion that there \nwas no misrepresentation made by the majority leader on the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The only thing the majority leader promised was an opportunity to \noffer an amendment on a bill, recognizing that if he denied that \nopportunity, when 65 Senators wanted it--not just one Senator who we \nknow can stop things around here, slow them down--the 65 Senators would \nbe bound and determined to use any available leverage until they got \nthat vote. So I agree with what the majority leader has decided to do \nand how he has decided to handle it. I know there are passionate views \naround here, but that does not justify changing the rules of the Senate \nthrough such extraordinary means. So I hope our colleagues join me to \nratify the ruling of the Chair when that time comes rather than to \noverrule it.\n  To overrule the Chair on something this important to the orderly \nconsideration of the Senate's business would be a terrible mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

Mr. President, on Friday, July 24, 2015, as a result of a \nclerical error, I was inadvertently listed as a cosponsor on McConnell \namendment No. 2328.\n  Today, a unanimous consent request was filed by the majority leader's \noffice to remove my name as a cosponsor of this amendment. I did not \ncosponsor this amendment, do not support it, and voted against invoking \ncloture on it today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Honoring Marine Lance Corporal Skip Wells\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, while we have a pause in our business for \na moment, I rise to offer a brief but sincere eulogy. At this very \nmoment in Woodstock, GA, Skip Wells, U.S. Marine Corps lance corporal, \nis being buried and worshipped. Thousands of Georgians are at the First \nBaptist Church of Woodstock, GA to attend his funeral.\n  Skip Wells was murdered in Chattanooga, TN, on the 16th day of July \nwhile he was doing his duties as a marine, recruiting people to come \ninto the U.S. military.\n  Skip graduated from Sprayberry High School just a few years ago. He \nplayed the clarinet and musical instruments in his church orchestra. He \nwas a great student with thousands of friends. He was a young man we \nwould all be proud of. His life was taken away from us in a snap by an \nenraged person on a religious tear.\n  When a young man of 21 years old dies in the prime of life, we ask \nwhy. In particular, when he wears the uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps, \nwe ask why. It is inexplicable. We all know the Book of Ecclesiastes \ntells us, ``There is a time for everything''--a time to be born and a \ntime to die. There is never a time when a young marine's life should be \ntaken. It causes us to truly think about something. As we act in this \nU.S. Senate and guide our country, hundreds of thousands of young men \nand women volunteer to wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica, and when they put it on, they never know when that day to die \nmight come, but they have all made the commitment that they are ready, \nwilling, and able to die for the country they love, the United States \nof America.\n  To Skip's mother Cathy, his extended family, and all those who knew \nSkip, we send our condolences and our best wishes for them to recover \nover time and heal.\n  In Woodstock, GA, an inscription is being read right now, which I \nwill read on the floor of the Senate so we will read it at the same \ntime. These words are comforting, they mean something, and in a time of \ngrief for all of us, I think they are important. Skip's mother wanted \nthis as a part of the ceremony. It is entitled ``To Those I Love.''\n\n       When I am gone, release me, let me go.\n       You musn't tie yourself to me with tears.\n       Just be happy that we had so many good years.\n       I gave you my love, you can only guess,\n       How much you gave to me in happiness.\n       I thank you for the love you each have shown,\n       But now it's time I traveled alone.\n       So grieve a while for me, if grieve you must,\n       Then let your grief be comforted by trust.\n       It's only for a while that we must part,\n       So bless the memories within your heart.\n       I won't be far away, for life goes on,\n       So if you need me, call, and I will come.\n       Though you can't see or touch me, I'll be near.\n       And if you listen with your heart, you'll hear,\n       All of my love around you, soft and clear.\n       And then, when you must come this way alone, I'll greet you \n     with a smile, and say ``Welcome Home.''\n\n  That is the Book of John, Chapter 15, the 13th verse. ``Greater love \nhas no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.''\n  Skip Wells laid down his life for all of the people of the United \nStates of America, for his family, and for his friends. We ask God to \nbless him and bring mercy to his family. We ask God to bless the great \ncountry that Skip wore the uniform to die for--the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/26/senate-section/article/S5710-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

FAIR PLAYING FIELD ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Fair \n     Playing Field Act of 2015''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1978, Congress was concerned that lack of clarity as \n     to the proper classification of some workers, increased IRS \n     enforcement activity, and retroactive application by IRS of \n     interpretations that were arguably new had caused hardships \n     for some small businesses and other taxpayers and confusion \n     as to the applicable rules.\n       (2) To allow time to develop a comprehensive approach to \n     the problem, Congress enacted section 530 of the Revenue Act \n     of 1978 as an interim measure protecting taxpayers from \n     liability for misclassification if the taxpayer has a \n     reasonable basis for classifying a worker as an independent \n     contractor and meets certain other conditions. In addition, \n     the Act prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from \n     publishing regulations or revenue rulings on workers' \n     employment tax status pending the expected near-term \n     enactment of clarifying legislation.\n       (3) During the ensuing 33 years, Congress made section 530 \n     of the Revenue Act of 1978 permanent; however, changes in \n     working relationships and the continued prohibition on new \n     guidance have increased the uncertainty as to the proper \n     classification of workers.\n       (4) Many workers are properly classified as independent \n     contractors. In other instances, workers who are employees \n     are being treated as independent contractors. Such \n     misclassification for tax purposes contributes to inequities \n     in the competitive positions of businesses and to the Federal \n     and State tax gap, and may also result in misclassification \n     for other purposes, such as denial of unemployment benefits, \n     workplace health and safety protections, and retirement or \n     other benefits or protections available to employees.\n       (5) Workers, businesses, and other taxpayers will benefit \n     from clear guidance regarding employment tax status. In the \n     interest of fairness and in view of many service recipients' \n     reliance on current section 530, such guidance should apply \n     only prospectively.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to permit \n     the Secretary of the Treasury to provide guidance allowing \n     workers and businesses to clearly understand the proper \n     Federal tax classification of workers and to provide relief \n     allowing an orderly transition to new rules designed to \n     increase certainty and uniformity of treatment.\n       (d) Authority to Issue Guidance Clarifying Employment \n     Status for Purposes of Employment Taxes.--Chapter 25 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 3512.
