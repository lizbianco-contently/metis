Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will \ndecide whether to advance or filibuster the Defense authorization \nlegislation which is before us. Senators will take a vote and Senators \nwill make a choice. One option is for Senators to follow the bipartisan \nexample of the House of Representatives and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, both of which passed Defense authorization legislation with \nbipartisan backing.\n  It means reaching across the aisle to support the men and women who \nsupport us every single day. It means voting to transform bureaucratic \nwaste into crucial investments for brave troops and their families, \nraises they have earned, quality-of-life programs they deserve, and the \nkind of medical care and mental health support they should expect when \ninjured on the battlefield or haunted by memories at home.\n  It means ensuring our military has the tools it needs to help America \nnavigate a treacherous world beset by an ever-growing array of \nchallenges. It means advancing a bill that contains ideas and \npriorities from both parties and one that gives President Obama the \nexact level of funding authorization he asked for in his own budget \nrequest.\n  It also means endorsing the Senate's return to considering Defense \nauthorization bills through the regular order, allowing real bipartisan \ndebate and a real bipartisan amendment process as we have done this \nyear, as opposed to the bad old days of ramming it through at the last \nminute. That is one option: voting for cloture, voting for a bipartisan \nbill that is good for our troops and our country.\n  But there is another option too: voting to filibuster, voting to \nraise the curtain on this truly bizarre filibuster summer, a strategy \nwe hear Democratic leaders boasting about in the press. Democratic \nleaders are apparently so passionate--passionate--about dumping more \ncash into gargantuan DC bureaucracies like the IRS that they now seem \nprepared to block and filibuster the benefits owed to our troops and \ntheir families or even--even--shut down the government altogether if \nthey can't get their way.\n  As one newspaper reported this morning, ``Democrats appear eager to \nreturn to shutdown politics.'' The minority leader seemed to put it \nplainly enough the other day: ``We're headed for another shutdown,'' he \nsaid. But that can only happen if commonsense Democrats allow their \nparty leaders to advance the shutdown-seeking filibuster summer gambit.\n  Today is every commonsense Democrat's chance to say, Enough. This is \na bad strategy. Today is every commonsense Democrat's opportunity to \nhelp pull their party back from a senseless\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\npath of forcing endless filibusters and a shutdown no one wants but the \nhard left. That is what they want. Because here is what every Senator \nknows deep down: Voting to filibuster would mean allowing Democratic \nleaders to take from every soldier, every sailor, every marine, and \nevery man and woman in the Air Force the pay raises they have earned, \nso Democratic leaders can use it as an ante in the game of shutdown \nroulette.\n  Voting to filibuster would mean allowing Democratic leaders to hold \nour military hostage at a time of unprecedented global threats as part \nof some partisan ploy to extract--extract--a few more bucks for \nWashington bureaucrats. I just cannot imagine serious-minded Democrats \nfeeling comfortable going along with their leaders' plan. It is just \ntoo callous. It is just too extreme. So I hope they will not. I hope \nevery one of my colleagues, no matter which party they are in, will \nstand together instead for bipartisanship, for regular order, for the \nidea that we should support the troops who support us.\n  I thank Chairman McCain for all of his hard work to get us to this \npoint. He did a marvelous job working across the aisle to craft a \nserious defense bill, with input and amendments from both sides. The \nSenate, our military, and our country stand to benefit immensely from \nhis dedication. So I hope every Senator of good will will stand up and \nvote to advance this bipartisan bill later today.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Government Funding\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have for many, many years--every Thursday, \nwhen we are in session, I have what I call ``Welcome to Washington.'' I \nlook forward to those Thursday mornings at 8:30 visiting with people \nfrom Nevada, and there are guests and their friends who come from other \nplaces who want to visit with me. So I enjoy those very much.\n  Last Thursday, I had a young man named Nathaniel visit. He had been \nan intern for me. His family is from Nevada. His grandfather is a very \nfamous man by the name of John Squire Drendel. John Squire Drendel is \nnow 93 but a wonderful lawyer and just a good person. The reason I \nrecognized Nathaniel--they came back to one of my ``Welcome to \nWashingtons.'' I called him and I said: Hey, Nathaniel. Come on up \nhere. I said: Let's show these folks some of your magic tricks. So that \nis what he would do. I would bring him in and he could do magic tricks. \nHe is now going to law school. His magic tricks aren't as good as they \nused to be. He hasn't practiced very much.\n  What I have heard my friend the Republican leader talk about today--\nhe is trying to do some magic tricks. It is not only on the Senate but \nthe country. The Defense authorization bill is an important piece of \nlegislation. We Democrats support our troops. No one can dispute that. \nWe are just as patriotic as any Republican. My 46 Democrats are just as \npatriotic as the 54 Republicans. We support defense just as much as our \nRepublican friends do. But we also support the rest of our country.\n  We support the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice \nDepartment. We support the U.S. marshals who are now out looking for \nthose two killers who escaped from prison in New York. We support the \nDrug Enforcement Administration. We support the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, Social Security, VA. I could go on and on.\n  To have a sound, secure homeland, we have to make sure we take care \nnot only of the Pentagon's needs but the needs of the American people. \nMy friend the Republican leader, as a little bit of his magic, always \nthrows in the Internal Revenue Service, as if: Boy, we are doing great \nthings. We are cutting the Internal Revenue Service. I am not here to \nthrow bouquets to the Internal Revenue Service, but I am here to say it \nis an important part of our country.\n  I met with the head of the IRS maybe a couple of months ago now. He \ncame and said: You know, we made it through tax season and we did a \ngood job. But he said: During the time that people were trying to file \ntheir income tax returns, if someone had tried to call the Internal \nRevenue Service, they would not have gotten an answer. We did not have \nenough personnel to even answer the phones.\n  Is that what we want? Do we want people who call the IRS not to be \nable to have someone answer the phone? And a lot of that is happening \nnow.\n  The Federal Government is being starved for resources. Why? Because \nof the Republican determination to try some magic. We know the \nRepublicans are not really serious about the Defense bill. If they \nwere, would they throw on this the Export-Import Bank--an amendment--\nand move to table their own amendment? Of course not. Some 165,000 \npeople are working today because of the Export-Import Bank. It is an \nimportant function of our government.\n  But a large number of Republicans are trying to kill this program, \nindicating how unserious they are about doing something about it, by \nfocusing on the Defense bill an amendment that they filed and moved to \ntable their own amendment just so they could check the box: Well, we \ntried to do something on Export-Import Bank.\n  Cyber security. We are being hacked on a daily basis. They are not \nonly hacking businesses, they are hacking our government--everything. \nTo show how unserious the Republicans are about this issue, which we \nhave been trying to do something as Democrats for years, the \nRepublicans filed an amendment on this bill knowing the President has \nalready said he is going to veto the bill.\n  I am so disappointed in how the Republicans are being very ungenuine \nin trying to move forward on this legislation. The bill is going to be \nvetoed; the President said so.\n  The other thing that I think is important for the American public to \nunderstand and to make sure all of the Members of the Senate and their \nstaff understand is that this is an authorization.\n  I can remember that as a boy in Nevada, in high school, I would see \nthese big announcements--Senator Cannon and Senator Bible introduced \nthis legislation. I wondered why nothing ever happened on it. It was \nbecause it was only to authorize. The important function of this \ngovernment--and it has been since the beginning--is to have an \nAppropriations Committee. After something is authorized, it has to be \nfunded.\n  So of course this authorization bill is important, and we believe it \nis important. But my friend the Republican leader is treating it--\ntrying to perform some magic because he is really not serious about it \nfor the reasons I have mentioned.\n\n\n                              FOOD SAFETY\n\n  Mr. President, I have thought about this little girl for so many \nyears, little Rylee, Rylee Gustafson. What a sweet, sweet spirit. I \nhave thought about her so often. She was 9 years old. She ate a salad \nthat almost killed her. There was spinach in that salad and E. coli in \nthat spinach. She got so sick, she was hospitalized. Her kidneys began \nto fail. Her pancreas started to dysfunction. Before long, fluid \nswelled up in her brain, heart, and lungs.\n  All told, Rylee spent 34 days in the hospital. She was a 9-year-old. \nI wish that were the only time she was in the hospital, but it was not. \nI wish that were the only time she needed medical care, but it was not. \nEventually, she ``recovered,'' but the lasting effects on this little \ngirl have been horrible. She developed diabetes because of the damage \nto her pancreas, and she now takes an insulin shot every day. She will \nneed a kidney transplant before she turns 30; that is what the doctors \nhave told her. As horrific as her account is, it is not unique. This \nlittle girl is now a teenager and still sick. Her growth was stunted.\n  Unfortunately for many Americans, falling ill from contaminated foods \nhas become all too regular. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl, one in every six Americans gets sick from food every year. \nThat is about 48 million Americans who become sick from food in this \ngreat country.\n  More than 3,000 people die every year from foodborne illness, and \nthose who don't die can be forced to deal with a lifetime of health \ncomplications, just like Rylee. Yes, she is alive, but what horrible \nconsequences followed her having a salad.\n  At a recent Senate hearing on this issue, a woman named Lauren Bush\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\nshared her experience with food contamination. Listen to an account \nthat she shared of the ordeal.\n\n       During my junior year of college, my life suddenly and \n     irrevocably changed when I almost died after eating a spinach \n     salad.\n       What the doctors initially thought to be nothing more than \n     a virus quickly escalated to a diagnosis of appendicitis. \n     Through clenched teeth and unbearable pain, I argued with the \n     doctors that something didn't feel right. It was like nothing \n     I had ever felt before. They began to suspect that I was \n     right when I quickly took a turn for the worse. I found \n     myself in class one day and in a hospital bed the next.\n       I spent the next three weeks in and out of two hospitals, \n     two emergency rooms, and three urgent-treatment facilities \n     before I was well enough to go home and recover.\n       I had lost nearly 20 pounds, and went from being an \n     otherwise young, healthy student to an emotional and physical \n     disaster--all in less than one month's time.\n       I spent the next five months in recovery on continuous \n     antibiotics and vitamins from the resulting complications. I \n     almost lost my colon; and I lost my dignity when I was unable \n     to feed and care for myself. I was fortunate enough to return \n     to school the following spring, but it was several months \n     before I could walk to class without stopping to take a \n     breath. And in some ways, my body will never be the same.\n\n  Sadly, there are far too many Americans with stories similar to \nRylee's and Lauren's. Take, for example, the recent listeria outbreak \nin two brands of some of the food products millions of Americans \nenjoy--ice cream and hummus. To date, the outbreak has claimed the \nlives of three people and sickened hundreds of others. One of the ice \ncream factories is closed as a result of this.\n  This is all the more tragic because each of these contaminations \ncould have been prevented. The United States is the most advanced \ncountry in the world. We have the technology and the resources to \nensure better food quality for people like Rylee.\n  We have made progress. In 2010, for a lot of reasons but not the \nleast of which was Rylee, Congress passed the most sweeping reform of \nour Nation's food safety laws since the 1930s. The law shifted the \nfocus of food safety laws from responding to contamination to \npreventing it. The FDA is working hard to implement this critical law. \nBut the Food Safety Modernization Act cannot work if it doesn't have \nany money. Current funding levels don't provide the resources necessary \nto adequately fund programs to stop food contamination and create a \nsystem based on prevention.\n  It is that word again--``sequestration.'' This Agency has never \nrecovered from the hit taken when the government was closed and then \nbecause of sequestration. By keeping sequestration in place, \nRepublicans are hampering efforts to stamp out food borne illness.\n  Nobody should ever have to worry about dying from eating ice cream or \nbeing hospitalized after consuming hummus or spinach. Congress must act \nto strengthen the food safety of our country and the Food Safety \nModernization Act, and we must do it now. Let's stop sequestration. \nLet's go ahead and authorize the bills, but, remember, we cannot fund \nthem with funny money.\n  I can't imagine my Republican friends--and I have said before, my \nfriend, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee--allowing this \nbill to go forward with this deficit spending that they call OCO. The \nPentagon thinks it is wrong. All people who understand economics think \nit is wrong. Another $39 billion in deficit spending is just wrong. We \nneed to fund the military, and we need to fund the nonmilitary--that \nis, nondefense programs--and we need to do it to make our homeland \nsafer.\n  I hope that programs like this--Rylee has suffered so that we would \ndo something--I hope that we will take care of her and people just like \nher and do something to fund these programs and prevent illnesses that \nare caused by food.\n  We need to act responsibly and raise the level of funding for these \nvital programs because for far too many Americans, this issue is a \nmatter of life and death. All we need to do is ask Rylee and ask \nLauren, and they will tell us.\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 \na.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Metal Theft \nPrevention Act, which was filed as an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. In a moment, I am going to ask unanimous consent to \nmake this amendment pending, but first I wish to explain why this \namendment is so important.\n  I have been working on this legislation for years. Senator Schumer is \na cosponsor. In the past, I have had support for this bill as \ncosponsors in Senator Hatch, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Senator \nHoeven. Why has there been bipartisan support in the past for this \nbill? I think we all know that this is a public safety issue. Metal \nthieves have targeted labs, power stations, and gas lines, causing \nblackouts, service disruptions, and even dangerous explosions.\n  In September of 2013, four people were injured in an explosion at a \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, electrical station. Officials \nblamed it on copper theft that occurred 2 hours before the explosion.\n  Georgia Power was having a huge problem with thieves targeting a \nsubstation that feeds the entire Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta \nInternational Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world. The \nairport was getting hit two to three times a week, and surveillance \ndidn't lead to any arrests.\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\n  The crime has also hurt the dignity of our veterans. Last year in my \nhome State of Minnesota, the metal thieves robbed dozens of veterans' \ngraves, taking the brass rods that hold their symbol of service. It is \na crime that is almost too callous to comprehend, but sadly this wasn't \nthe first time. On Memorial Day in 2012--this is just in Minnesota--\nthieves stole more than 20 Bronze Star markers from veterans' graves in \nIsanti County. That is why this bill is supported by the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America, as well as major law enforcement organizations and \nbusiness groups.\n  The bill is really quite simple. It will help combat the shameless \ncrime across State lines by putting modest recordkeeping requirements \non scrap metal dealers and recyclers in place. It will limit the value \nof cash transactions to $100 and require sellers in certain cases to \nprove they actually own the metal.\n  All we are trying to do is stop scrap metal dealers from taking \nstolen metal. And the reason we can't just do it State by State is that \na lot of States are doing this but a lot of States aren't, and what the \nthieves are doing is crossing State lines, stealing the metal in one \nState and selling it in another.\n  This is an important bill, and it has been heavily lobbied against by \nthe scrap metal dealer association.\n  The Democratic side of the aisle has cleared this bill. We are ready \nto go forward with this amendment. There are objections on the \nRepublican side. But I think people better step back and realize, the \nnext time there is a major explosion, the next time something happens \nlike this, which is happening on a weekly basis across the country--\nthat they understand we could have done something to prevent it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up my amendment No. 1555.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, I object on behalf of the Judiciary Committee. This would \ncriminalize stealing metal. It makes it a Federal offense; therefore, \nthe Judiciary properly has jurisdiction. It would also establish civil \npenalties enforceable by the Attorney General. It directs review of \nthis crime by the Federal sentencing commission. It has no tie to the \nnational security or the National Defense Authorization Act. So I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am disappointed that there is an \nobjection to calling up this commonsense amendment that has so much \nsupport from veterans, law enforcement, and businesses. I have stood in \nfront of small businesses all over my State, including with Senator \nHoeven in Fargo, a number of electric companies that have been \nrepeatedly broken into.\n  I believe this does have national security implications because there \nis a provision in the bill about critical infrastructure and creating a \nfelony-level crime when they are stealing from that critical \ninfrastructure. And I believe it is very important that we debate and \nvote on this issue as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I will continue to work to get a vote on this amendment during this \nentire year. I worry that at some point we are going to have major \ndamage to our infrastructure as a result of metal theft, and everyone \nwill look back and wonder why we didn't listen to every major law \nenforcement group in our country or to every single business that has \nbeen affected or to the electric companies that are being broken into \nall the time or to our veterans groups, that just want their final \nresting places to be respected. Despite the lobby of the scrap metal \ndealers, I will not let this rest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would point out to the Senator from \nMinnesota that we started on this legislation in the committee in May. \nWe are now well into June--many weeks. We are 2 weeks into the \nconsideration of this legislation, and the Senator from Minnesota comes \nto the floor with a compelling amendment.\n  I suggest the next time around the Senator from Minnesota raise the \nissue with the authorization committee and with others when the bill \nfirst comes to the floor rather than waiting 2 weeks before having a \ncompelling interest in this very serious issue.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I still have the floor, I would say to the Senator from \nMinnesota. The rules of the Senate are that we usually don't like to be \ninterrupted.\n  Mr. President, we are going to embark on the McCain-Feinstein \namendment, which I understand is going to be voted on at 11:30; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would like to note that I have been \nattempting to pass this legislation now for 3 years. Senator Hatch was \nmy first cosponsor, then Senator Graham, and then Senator Hoeven. Every \nstep of the way I have been stymied by the scrap metal dealer lobby.\n  I believe this is an important bill. It is a simple bill. It will \ngreatly help because these thieves are crossing State lines with the \nstolen copper. I appreciate, obviously, Senator McCain's viewpoint, \nbeing the manager of this bill on the floor, but I think the record \nshould reflect that I have tried many times to get this amendment up on \nother bills and to work with the committee, but every single time I get \nstopped in my tracks by this lobby. At some point I would like to have \na vote on this so that people can vote their heart and vote with their \nlaw enforcement or vote with the scrap metal dealers. They can decide.\n  For now, our side has cleared this amendment, and the Republicans are \nobjecting to this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nspent be equally divided while in a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Chicago Blackhawks Win Stanley Cup\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are serious matters on the floor of \nthe Senate involving the Defense authorization bill, and I just asked \nthe chairman of the Committee on Armed Services for 5 minutes to speak \non an issue totally unrelated to it but one which is critically \nimportant to the future of America and critically important today to \nthe city of Chicago, IL.\n  Last night, I stayed up late to watch the Chicago Blackhawks win the \nStanley Cup. They were playing the Tampa Bay Lightning--an \nextraordinarily good team--and in the sixth game they won 2 to zip. \nThat is three Stanley Cups in 6 years.\n  I can tell you that you can't visit Chicago, go to any street corner \nor anyplace without seeing evidence of loyalty to the Chicago \nBlackhawks. It is an incredible story of a storied franchise in the \nNational Hockey League that has become a premier sports story in the \ngreat sports city of Chicago. And last night was so much fun for all of \nus to watch that victory.\n  Any child who has ever laced up an old pair of skates or put tape on \na stick has thought about what happened last\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\nnight. From Springfield, IL, to Saskatoon, from Moose Jaw to Miami, if \nyou have spent any time at all around the game of hockey, you wonder \nwhat it must feel like to stand at the end of a very long season, after \nthree long periods of total effort white-knuckled moments, before tens \nof thousands of elated fans, and hoist up the most storied trophy in \nall of sports--Lord Stanley's Cup. The goal of every team in the \nNational Hockey League is to hoist up that cup at the end of the \nseason.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to the players, coaches, staff, and fans \nof the Chicago Blackhawks, the 2015 Stanley Cup champions, whose \nseason-long mantra of ``One Goal'' was realized last night at the \nUnited Center in Chicago.\n  Last night, the Blackhawks won their sixth Stanley Cup in franchise \nhistory and the third in the last 6 years, with the 2-to-0 victory over \nthe Tampa Bay Lightning, a formidable team as well.\n  Fans at the Madhouse on Madison, as we call the United Center, \nwitnessed Duncan Keith and Patrick Kane score show-stopping goals while \ngoaltender Corey Crawford seemed incredible in his defense, stopping \nall of the 25 shots that he faced.\n  I congratulate especially owner Rocky Wirtz, head coach Joe \nQuenneville, who is known as Coach Q, ``Captain Serious,'' Jonathan \nToews, the Blackhawks front office, the players, and, most of all, the \nlegions of Blackhawks fans as they celebrate another Stanley Cup \nChampionship.\n  Those who know the history of this team, and those who have followed \nthem for decades know that in the past 7 years there has been a \ntransformation in the Blackhawks. With Rocky Wirtz taking over as the \nowner, this team went on television just at the moment when they were \nreaching this level of perfection, and they started winning over \nthousands of fans--not just across Chicago but across Illinois and the \nMidwest.\n  Blackhawks fans, I think, are the best fans in hockey, and you can \nunderstand if a lot of them are a little tired this morning. The \nBlackhawks began the playoffs with a remarkable double-overtime victory \nagainst the Nashville Predators, another excellent team. They were down \n3 to 0 after the first period. The Hawks stormed back to tie the game \nand won on a Duncan Keith goal. That victory set the tone for a great \nrun through the playoffs. A goal by Brent Seabrook in triple overtime \nin game 4 helped the Hawks defeat Nashville in six games.\n  A sweep of the Minnesota Wild followed, setting up a showdown with \nthe Anaheim Ducks in the Western Conference Finals. The Hawks were \nbehind in the series one game to none, 2 to 1, and 3 to 2, but they \nearned double- and triple-overtime victories on their way to winning in \nseven games, clinching a berth in the Stanley Cup Final.\n  The Hawks followed a familiar pattern in dropping games 1 and 3 of \nthe final, but they took a 3-to-2 series lead into Monday night's Game \n6 on home ice. It was another close contest as Kane's one-timer with \n5:14 remaining marked the first time either team led by more than one \ngoal in the entire series.\n  The time slowly ticked down until 22,424 fans at the United Center \nwere finally able to erupt in celebration. It was a great night for \nBlackhawks fans and the culmination of a tremendous team effort.\n  Antoine Vermette, acquired at the trade deadline, scored two game-\nwinning goals in the Stanley Cup Final. Goaltender Scott Darling stood \ntall in the net when his team needed him the most, in relief of Corey \nCrawford when called upon against Nashville. Duncan Keith was an iron \nman, earning the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP, while logging more \nthan 700 minutes of ice time in 23 games. Nicklas Hjalmarsson blocked \nshots left and right and seemed to be in the right place all the time.\n  I can't tell you how happy I am for those Blackhawks and for all of \ntheir amazing fans on their Stanley Cup championship. It has been a \nthrill to watch this team throughout the years, and I look forward to \nseeing President Obama host the Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks yet \nanother time at the White House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have serious concerns with the \nlanguage that was tacked on to the House FISA reform bill that passed \nthe Senate, and at the end of my remarks I am going to offer a \nunanimous consent request. I say that because maybe other Members of \nthe Senate would like to be heard or would like to maybe reject my \nunanimous consent request, and I want to give them the privilege of \nknowing I am doing this.\n  The language in the FISA bill made changes to the Federal criminal \ncode to implement four important multilateral treaties relating to \nnuclear terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nIt is good that these treaties are finally being implemented. The \nSenate gave its advice and consent to these treaties back in 2008. In \nthe years since then, however, the Senate leadership repeatedly failed \nto bring bills to the floor that would implement them.\n  The language which is now law omits a number of key provisions that \nwere requested by both the Obama administration and the Bush \nadministration. So I want my colleagues to know this has had support \nfrom both Republican and Democrat Presidents, in the present and in the \npast.\n  My amendment No. 1786 restores these provisions, which are important \ntools to combat the gravest of threats to our national security. I am \nhappy to note that Senator Whitehouse, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, has joined \nme in offering this amendment.\n  First, the amendment adds the authority for prosecutors to seek the \ndeath penalty for these newly created crimes in appropriate cases. \nUnder the criminal code, similar crimes already carry the possibility \nof the death penalty. Singling out these new offenses under this \ntreaty, which is intended to stop terrorists from threatening us with \nthe world's most dangerous weapons, for lesser punishment simply makes \nno sense.\n  For example, section 2280 and 2281 of the code, which criminalizes \nvarious acts of violence on the high seas, already provide for the \npossibility of the death penalty. So it is only logical that new \nsections 2280a and 2281a, which criminalize acts of terrorism on the \nhigh seas related to weapons of mass destruction, should as well. The \nnewly created offenses of nuclear terrorism, now codified in section \n2332i, should as well. In fact, I am hard pressed to think of an \noffense for which the death penalty might be more appropriate than \nnuclear terrorism.\n  Terrorists who kill Americans--especially nuclear terrorists--should \nbe eligible for the death penalty. This shouldn't at all be \ncontroversial, and I think the support of both former President Bush \nand President Obama speaks to that point. Terrorists who kill \nAmericans--especially nuclear terrorists--should be eligible for the \ndeath penalty. I can't repeat too often that this shouldn't be \ncontroversial.\n  Second, the amendment makes these newly created criminal offenses \nmaterial support predicates. In other words, the amendment would \nprovide the government the ability to prosecute those who finance or \notherwise provide material support to these terrorists. Naturally, \nthese are complex crimes that aren't committed by just one person. They \ninvolve entire networks that need to be stopped in their tracks. This \nprovision will help do that by making sure that those who provide \nmateriel support to terrorists don't escape justice.\n\n  Third, the amendment would add these offenses to the list of those \ncrimes that are predicates for wiretap applications. As the law now \nstands, prosecutors can't request a traditional criminal wiretap \nagainst a terrorist suspected of breaking these new laws, but at the \nsame time, they can get a wiretap to investigate a long list of less \nserious offenses. Again, this doesn't make sense. In fact, this is a \ndangerous omission. Our government needs the ability to listen in on \ncalls of suspected nuclear terrorists. So this provision would permit \nprosecutors to request the authority to do so from a Federal judge.\n  Once again, I use the term ``common sense.'' These are commonsense \nfixes, supported by both Republican and Democratic Presidents, fixing \nand harmonizing these recently created crimes with the rest of the \ncriminal code, fixing and harmonizing these recently\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\ncreated crimes with the rest of the Criminal Code. They were requested \nby both the Obama and Bush administrations because they will help \nprotect us from the catastrophe that could result from terrorists \nseeking to use the ultimate weapons against us. So I urge my colleagues \nto support Grassley-Whitehouse amendment No. 1786.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up and make pending Grassley-Whitehouse amendment \nNo. 1786.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  First, the Senator is chairman of the committee which has \njurisdiction for this particular amendment, so he has complete--in \nfact, more than complete--authority to bring it up in regular order and \nbring it forward to the floor. In addition, we have been advised by the \nDepartment of Justice that these provisions are not necessary, given \nthe scope of existing law with respect to terrorists and with respect \nto anyone who conducts a terrorist act. Perhaps an example of that is \nthe Boston bombing, where there is now someone condemned to death for \nterrorist activities--not involving a nuclear device, but I hardly \nthink he would get any less of a sentence regardless of the device he \nused.\n  So for all these reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I accept the good-faith effort to listen \nto my point of view, even though there is a rejection, but I would like \n1 minute to react to the objection.\n  This amendment only does what both the Bush and Obama administrations \nasked Congress to do, to make clear that the death penalty could apply \nto any active nuclear terrorism. It is not enough that other criminal \nstatutes might also apply to nuclear terrorists and might also carry \nthe death penalty. It is quite the opposite; that terrorists who use \nguns and explosives to kill can face the death penalty means that \nnuclear terrorists certainly should as well. It does not take too much \nimagination to come up with a situation which, under current law, the \ndeath penalty might not clearly apply.\n  We are all aware of the threat of cyber terrorism. If a terrorist \nused a computer to take over a nuclear powerplant and caused a deadly \nnuclear meltdown, it is not clear that his crime would be eligible for \nthe death penalty under any other Federal Criminal Code. We simply \nshouldn't accept this potential gap in the law which my amendment \nfixes.\n  So, once again, I am sorry there was an objection. I am not done with \nthis. We will continue it in some other environment. I respect my \ncolleagues, however, for objecting.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1889\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Congress has some unfinished business \nbefore it. When the President took office, he issued an Executive order \nbanning torture. It is regrettable that such a step was even necessary \nfor a country that has been a signatory to the Convention Against \nTorture since 1988, more than 25 years ago. But it was the right thing \nfor the President to do and consistent with our values as Americans. In \nparticular, the President ordered that all U.S. Government personnel \nand contractors must comply with the interrogation standards in the \nArmy Field Manual and that the International Committee of the Red Cross \nshould have notice of and access to detainees held by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Now it is time for Congress to adopt these same requirements--to \nenshrine them in law and ensure that America never again employs \ntorture, no matter what the threat.\n  Senators McCain and Feinstein have offered an amendment that mirrors \nthese requirements of the Executive order. It would require all \ngovernment personnel and contractors, across all agencies and \ndepartments, to abide by the rules and regulations contained in the \nArmy Field Manual. It also would ensure that the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, is provided access to all \nindividuals detained by the United States.\n  These requirements have already been in place for 6 years, and this \namendment is consistent with current practice. The Army Field Manual \nprovides clear guidelines on acceptable and effective interrogation \npractices. It reinforces explicit prohibitions in existing law against \ntorture and other cruel and inhumane treatment. It is relied upon by \nour military personnel when they conduct high-risk interrogations on \nthe battlefield. There is no reason why these rules should not apply to \nall government personnel and contractors, in all places, and at all \ntimes.\n  This is a critically important amendment. We know from the historic \nreport of the Senate Intelligence Committee that the CIA engaged in \nhorrific acts of torture during the Bush administration. We must be \nunequivocal to the world and to ourselves that torture is wrong and \nthat it is never permitted.\n  An Executive order is not enough. Congress must act. We must codify \nthese safeguards into law. When it comes to our core values--the things \nthat make our country great and that define America's place in the \nworld--they do not change depending on the circumstances. The \nConvention Against Torture does not make exceptions. We must be clear \nthat there are no instances when torture is acceptable.\n  I urge Senators to support the anti-torture amendment, and I commend \nSenators McCain and Feinstein for their enduring leadership on this \nissue. We must ensure that America never allows this to happen again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak out at a time when our \nworld is on fire: Putin's Russia is on the march, invading a sovereign \nneighbor in a bid to rebuild the Soviet empire; China asserts its \ngrowing strength in aggressive and provocative ways in the Pacific; \nIran presses ahead in its efforts to develop nuclear weapons \ncapability, a development that threatens to put the deadliest weapons \nknown to man in the hands of a maniacal rogue state; the Islamic State \ncontinues to expand its barbaric reign of terror and endanger \neverything our brave men and women in uniform fought and died for long \nago in Iraq; terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula and Al-Shabab, use the refuge of failed states to plot \nattacks on our homeland; and, across the globe, our allies look to the \nUnited States to provide the leadership necessary to confront these \nthreats to peace.\n  One of the foundational purposes of our Constitution was to establish \na Federal Government to--in the words of the preamble--provide for the \ncommon defense. In facilitating this purpose, the Congress is charged \nwith two particularly crucial duties: establishing the legal authority \nfor our military to operate and funding our military's activities. For \n53 years in a row, Congress has fulfilled these responsibilities with \nan annual National Defense Authorization Act and accompanying funding \nthrough the appropriations process. Despite the gridlock that has so \noften beset the legislative process in recent years, Congress has \nconsistently risen to the call of its constitutional duty every year to \nauthorize and appropriate on behalf of our brave men and women in \nuniform.\n  This year, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have lived \nup to the finest traditions of this body in crafting the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. This bill provides for \nour national security needs across a wide variety of fronts, including \nprograms to aid allies such as Ukraine and Iraq that face aggression, \ncompensation for the men and women who put their lives on the line to \ndefend our freedom, restructuring to improve readiness, authority to \nprocure a wide range of new weapons systems such as the F-35 Joint \nStrike Fighter that are crucial to maintaining our defense \ncapabilities, and acquisition reform to restore accountability to \ndefense contracting and make the money we spend go further.\n  These aren't Republican or Democratic priorities, they are American \npriorities. They are concrete steps we need to take in order to ensure \nour safety and security for years to come, and they should earn the \nsupport of every single Senator.\n  The bill before us authorizes $604 billion in spending for the \nDefense Department in the coming year. That is essentially the very \nsame amount requested by President Obama himself.\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nPresident Obama and our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee did \nnot come up with that number out of thin air. In testimony before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee this year, all four of the military \nservice chiefs testified that American lives are being put at risk if \nwe cap defense spending at the sequester levels. The amount proposed by \nPresident Obama and embraced by the Armed Services Committee is the \namount that both Republican and Democratic, as well as nonpartisan, \nexperts believe is crucial to the Defense Department's ability to \npreserve our national security. Surely, such an approach on such a \ncritical measure should win broad support from both parties.\n  Nevertheless, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare threatening a filibuster of the bill over the amount of funding it \nauthorizes. They are considering the prospect of defeating the National \nDefense Authorization Act for the first time in 53 years unless we \nagree to their demands to increase spending on domestic programs. Put \nanother way, they are aiming to condition the ability of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines to defend our Nation on their demand for \nmore funding for the wasteful Federal bureaucracy that already costs \ntoo much.\n  Let me be absolutely clear. To roll back what progress we have made \nin restoring fiscal discipline after years of profligate spending is \nseriously misguided, to do so by hijacking the Defense bill at a time \nof serious danger--when we face so many crises around the world--\nrepresents the height of irresponsibility, and to make such a ``my way \nor the highway'' demand as a condition of fulfilling one of the \nSenate's basic duties is unworthy of the great traditions of this body.\n  Many of us have worked toward various solutions to replace the \nsequester going forward. Republicans and Democrats alike have their \npreferred alternatives to the current funding arrangements. \nNevertheless, we simply cannot shirk our duty to provide for the common \ndefense in the present. Political reality demands that we reject \npartisan grandstanding in favor of working together on this must-pass \nbill.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, the majority leader and the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee have led a debate on this bill that represents \nthe Senate at its finest. We have considered the bill on time--a needed \nchange from recent years that restores the Senate's proper voice in our \nnational defense. We have held hours upon hours of debate on the floor, \nand we have held a fair and open amendment process for Members on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  As part of that open amendment process, the Senate considered an \namendment from the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee that \nwould condition the funding level on the domestic spending increases \nsought by our Democratic colleagues.\n  Despite my disagreements on the substance, I want to commend the \nranking member for his sincere advocacy and for his determination to \nput his plan before this body for an up-or-down vote. But as that vote \nresult showed, a majority of this body strongly disagrees with the \nminority's preferred alternative. Having fully aired this issue and \nvoted on it, it is time for the Senate to wrap up our debate and pass \nthis bill. To exploit the supermajority threshold to demand a \nconcession rejected by a majority of Senators on a bill of such vital \nimportance to our national defense would represent a gross dereliction \nof duty and a tragically irresponsible choice.\n  I urge my friends in the minority: do not give in to the temptation \nof partisan grandstanding, do not let this become another exercise in \npolitical brinksmanship, do not place a desire to fight the majority \nover our shared duty to keep this country safe, and do not jeopardize \nour men and women in uniform to win concessions for yet more domestic \nspending.\n  Work with us. Embrace the funding levels the Obama administration \nbelieves are necessary to keep us safe and keep alive our proud \ntradition of placing national security ahead of partisan politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know there is important debate, but I wish \nto take a few minutes and talk about America losing one of its finest \nentrepreneurs and citizens.\n\n\n                       Remembering Kirk Kerkorian\n\n  Mr. President, last night, at 10:30, my friend Kirk Kerkorian died. \nWhat a wonderful man. He was 98 years old, and when history books are \nwritten, they will say a lot about this good man.\n  I had the good fortune as a young lawyer to meet him. I didn't do any \nof his mergers and acquisitions and all the stock stuff. I didn't do \nany of that. But when we first met, he was a businessman with an \nairline called Trans International Airlines. I will talk about that in \na minute, but it started out as one airplane.\n  I knew that Kirk was failing because he and I were supposed to go \nwatch the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, and he said he couldn't go. I knew \nthen that his days were numbered, for lack of a better description.\n  I had kept in touch with him all these many years. As I said, I am \nnot one to boast about all the great legal work I did for Kirk. I \ndidn't do much. But I did do a lot of work for his brother, a man by \nthe name of Nish Kerkorian, and Kirk never forgot all the work I did \nfor his brother.\n  Kirk had two siblings: One woman who was a sweet, sweet lady, \nvibrant, named Rose, his sister Rose. She died not long ago. I called \nKirk. It was really hard on him; he cried, and we shed a tear together.\n  He was born in 1917 in Fresno, CA. His parents were Armenian \nimmigrants. He grew up at a very difficult time. He didn't graduate \nfrom the eighth grade. He became a prize fighter, became the Pacific \namateur welterweight champion, and his name was ``Rifle Right'' \nKerkorian.\n  His brother Nish, whom I talked about, was also a fighter and a \nboxer, and he fought a lot. Kirk didn't fight too much.\n  On the floor is one of ours--if not the hero we have in the Senate \nfor military endeavors--the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  It is important to talk about Kirk Kerkorian for just a minute and \nabout what he did for our country in the military, using that term \nbroadly--``in the military.'' He had learned to fly, while milking cows \nand looking after a woman's cattle, at an air strip near now what is \nEdwards Air Force Base. That is where he learned to fly, at a place \ncalled Happy Bottom Riding Club. That is where he learned to fly. He \nloved to fly. He got his pilot's license in just a few months, and he \nwanted to go into the military, but he couldn't at the time because we \nweren't in the war yet.\n  The British Royal Air Force was ferrying Canadian-built de Havilland \nMosquitoes over the North Atlantic because England was desperate for \nhelp. The Nazis were after them, Hitler was sweeping Europe, and the \nsubmarines were sinking the ships trying to take supplies to England. \nSo out of desperation, Canada, which was part of Great Britain at the \ntime, decided they would help. The problem was that to fly those \nairplanes over the North Atlantic was really very, very difficult. They \nhad two routes. One was 1,400 miles. The other was shorter but \nextremely more dangerous. Kirk Kerkorian agreed to take the one more \ndangerous. It was dangerous because the North Atlantic is very brutal. \nThe wings would ice. But he got a lot of money for each flight--almost \n$1,000 for each flight. He delivered 33 planes to England. Every one of \nthose flights was a nightmare, but he did it.\n  He was truly an American patriot. There is a documentary on what he \ndid--flying across the North Atlantic with some other gallant men who \ndid that and helped preserve freedom in the world and take on the \nNazis.\n  After the war, he had saved a lot of his money, and he bought a \nCessna. It was expensive at the time--$5,000. He worked in general \naviation. He first visited Las Vegas in 1944. In 1947 he paid $60,000 \nfor the airline where I first met him. He was dealing with Trans \nInternational Airlines, which was a small air charter service that \nbasically flew gamblers between L.A. and Las Vegas. He, of course, was \na very frugal man. He operated the airline until 1968, when he sold it \nfor $104 million. He paid $60,000 for it and sold it for $104 million. \nThat was him. He was an entrepreneur.\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\n  He moved into Las Vegas quickly. He bought a piece of land across \nfrom the Flamingo Hotel for $960,000. It was 80 acres. That is now \nwhere Caesars Palace is. He was originally the landlord for that \nproperty. He made $9 million on that deal.\n  He then, shortly thereafter, paid $5 million cash for an off-Strip \nproperty--the first one that had ever been done. That is something I \nwas involved with. It was quite interesting. That transaction showed to \nme his absolute honesty. I have said publicly--I am not going into \ndetail here--but I will end by saying that the lawyer with whom I \nworked, Bill Singleton, said: No, Kirk doesn't do business that way, \nand he walked out of the room. He wound up buying the property. That \nwas where the International Hotel was built, and it was a very, very \nexpensive property at the time. It was off-Strip. The first two people \nto appear in the showroom were Barbra Streisand and Elvis Presley, and \nthat was the beginning of Kirk Kerkorian's ascension to power broker, \nto say the least, in Las Vegas.\n  He bought and sold MGM movies two different times. In the process, of \ncourse, he built the MGM hotel in Las Vegas. He was really an \ninteresting, wonderful man. He is one of the personalities I will never \nforget, and my relationship with him is one of the special things in my \nlife. I feel so fortunate to be able to talk on a personal basis about \nthis man. He was one of a kind.\n  I am so disappointed. His No. 1 person, Tony Mandekik, called me and \ntold me that Kirk had died. To be honest with you, the tears on the \nother side of the phone connection from Tony ended the conversation \nbecause he couldn't talk anymore. Now he is responsible, among others--\nbut principally him--for disposing of this man's wealth.\n  He did not make all of his money in movies or hotels and casinos. He \nbranched out. He made a number of fortunes. People would say: How does \nhe know anything about the automobile industry? He wound up owning \nlarge chunks of General Motors. He was one of the chief players in \nChrysler. He no longer made in those propositions millions of dollars \nbut billions. He made about $5 billion on this Chrysler Corporation \ndeal, where people said: What a fool--why would he do that?\n  You know that deal.\n  Not too long ago, about 3 years ago, I met him for lunch in Los \nAngeles. I said: I have to get going. He pulled out of his pocket his \nwatch.\n  Kirk, what is that?\n  He says: It is my watch.\n  It was a Timex with no band on it.\n  He said: It keeps perfect time.\n  He came to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. He drove himself in a little \njeep--a jeep with the top partially down. That was him. He was a very \nprivate man. He rarely gave interviews. I mean, he rarely gave \ninterviews. Even though he was one of the richest men in Los Angeles, \nhe was probably one of the most private. He simply did not do things in \npublic.\n  With all of the hotels that he owned--for those people who have a \nlittle bit of knowledge of Las Vegas, a lot of stuff is done with \ncomplimentary privileges. If you are a hotel owner, you get a lot of \nstuff for nothing--not Kirk Kerkorian. He would not take a comp for \nanything. Everything he paid for.\n  One of the last times we went to a fight, he also would not sit \nringside. He always wanted to be up away from everybody.\n  In 2008 he was worth $16 billion. I am not sure how much he was worth \nwhen he died. But he has given huge amounts of his wealth away. His job \nfor Tony Mandekik and others was to give away the rest of his money.\n  It is a sad day for me and for the people who knew Kirk Kerkorian. He \nlived a good, full life. He has two daughters. He always went out of \nhis way and paid his help well.\n  I wish I had the ability to articulate what a wonderful human being \nKirk Kerkorian was. I will always remember him. When I talk to people \nwho know something about business, I will always interject the name \nKirk Kerkorian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1889\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California have 15 minutes and I have 10 minutes and that the vote \nbe delayed until completion of the 15 minutes and the 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman for this time. I do not think I \nwill take 15 minutes. We have worked it down.\n  I join Senator McCain and Ranking Member Reed--as well as Senator \nCollins and the other cosponsors, Senators Leahy, Paul, King, Flake, \nHeinrich, Whitehouse, Mikulski, Wyden, Murphy, Hirono, Warner, Baldwin, \nBrown and Markey--in offering an amendment that will help ensure the \nUnited States never again carries out coercive and abusive \ninterrogation techniques or indefinite secret detentions.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate will consider this amendment, and I \nurge an aye vote.\n  The amendment we are offering today is really very simple. It applies \nthe authorizations and restrictions for interrogations in the Army \nField Manual to the entire U.S. Government.\n  It extends what Congress did in 2005, by a vote of 90 to 9, with the \nDetainee Treatment Act--which I believe Senator McCain authored--which \nbanned the Department of Defense from using techniques not authorized \nby the Army Field Manual and also banned the government from using \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.\n  The amendment also requires prompt access by the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross to any detainee held by the U.S. Government.\n  Both of these provisions are consistent with United States policy for \nthe past several years, but this amendment would codify these \nrequirements into law.\n  President Obama banned the use of coercive and abusive interrogation \ntechniques by Executive order in his first few days in office, actually \non January 22, 2009.\n  That Executive order formally prohibits--as a matter of policy--the \nuse of interrogation techniques not specifically authorized by the Army \nField Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations.\n  This amendment places that restriction in law. It is long overdue.\n  The amendment also codifies another section of President Obama's \nJanuary 2009 Executive order, requiring access by the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross to all U.S. detainees in U.S. Government \ncustody--access which has been historically granted by the United \nStates and other law-abiding nations and is needed to fulfill our \nobligations under international law, such as the Geneva Conventions.\n  It is also important to understand that the policies in the 2009 \nExecutive order are only guaranteed for as long as a future President \nagrees to leave them in place. This amendment would codify these two \nprovisions into law.\n  Current law already bans torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment or punishment.\n  However, this amendment is still necessary because interrogation \ntechniques were able to be used, which were based on a deeply flawed \nlegal theory, and those techniques, it was said, did not constitute \n``torture'' or ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.''\n  These legal opinions could be written again.\n  In 2009, President Obama's Executive Order settled the issue as \nformal policy, and this amendment will codify a prohibition on a \nprogram that was already defunct at the end of the Bush administration.\n  CIA Director John Brennan has clearly stated that he agrees with the \nban on interrogation techniques that are not in the Army Field Manual. \nDirector Brennan wrote the following to the Intelligence Committee in \n2013 about the President's 2009 Executive order:\n\n       I want to reaffirm what I said during my confirmation \n     hearing: I agree with the president's decision, and, while I \n     am the Director of the CIA, this program will not under any \n     circumstances be reinitiated. I personally remain firm in my \n     belief that enhanced interrogation techniques are not an \n     appropriate method to obtain intelligence and that their use \n     impairs our ability to continue to play a leadership role in \n     the world.\n\n  Furthermore, it is important to point out that the Senate and the \nHouse both\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\nrequired the use of the Army Field Manual across the government in the \nfiscal year 2008 Intelligence authorization bill. Unfortunately, \nPresident Bush vetoed that legislation.\n  Whatever one may think about the CIA's former detention and \ninterrogation program, we should all agree that there can be no turning \nback to the era of torture.\n\n  Interrogation techniques that would together constitute torture do \nnot work. They corrode our moral standing, and ultimately they \nundermine any counterterrorism policies they are intended to support.\n  So before I close, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a series of letters and statements in support of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     June 9, 2015.\n       Dear Senator: As retired generals and admirals who believe \n     that American ideals are a national security asset, we urge \n     you to support the amendment to the 2016 National Defense \n     Authorization Act that solidifies the ban against torture and \n     cruel treatment of detainees in U.S. custody.\n       While international and domestic law, including the 2005 \n     Detainee Treatment Act, prohibit such cruelty, high-level \n     officials in the Executive Branch still managed to evade \n     congressional intent by using loophole lawyering to authorize \n     torture and cruel treatment. We need to make sure this never \n     happens again. The United States should have one standard for \n     interrogating detainees that is effective, lawful, and \n     humane.\n       The McCain-Feinstein amendment would ensure lawful, \n     effective, and humane interrogations of individuals taken \n     into custody by requiring all agencies and departments to \n     comply with the time-tested requirements of the Army Field \n     Manual (``Human Intelligence Collector Operations''). It \n     would also codify existing Department of Defense (DOD) \n     practice of guaranteeing timely notification and access to \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for \n     detainees taken into custody--an important bulwark against \n     abuse.\n       We strongly urge you to support this legislation to help \n     move our country towards decisively rejecting the use of \n     torture or cruel treatment against detainees held in our \n     custody.\n       Thank you for your commitment to upholding our national \n     security and American values.\n           Sincerely,\n         General Joseph Hoar, USMC (Ret.); General Charles Krulak, \n           USMC (Ret.); General David M.

The use of enhanced \n     interrogation techniques, or torture by another name, was \n     wrongly justified by some as means to prevent another \n     terrorist attack. Torture is never justified. September 11th \n     Families for Peaceful Tomorrows applauds the legislation \n     being offered by Senators McCain and Feinstein to reinforce \n     the ban on torture. Any assertion of torture as effective \n     must be repudiated. Any loophole suggesting torture as a \n     justifiable means to security must be closed. Any ethical \n     principle that finds torture morally permissible must be \n     challenged.\n       American legislators must clearly and forcefully codify \n     policy that rejects and criminalizes torture in all its \n     forms. Only then will trust in the rule of law be restored, \n     and the people of this nation truly safe.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 9, 2015.\n       Dear Senator: As intelligence and interrogation \n     professionals who have offered our collective voice opposing \n     torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading \n     treatment, we strongly encourage you to support the amendment \n     to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act that \n     solidifies the ban against torture and cruel treatment of \n     detainees in U.S. custody.\n       While international and domestic law, including the 2005 \n     Detainee Treatment Act, prohibit such cruelty, sadly high-\n     level officials in the Executive Branch exploited loopholes \n     and still authorized torture and cruel treatment. The \n     interrogation methods that have kept America safe for \n     generations are sophisticated, humane, lawful, and produce \n     reliable, actionable intelligence in any interrogation \n     scenario. To promote a return to that respected level of \n     professionalism, there must be a single well-defined standard \n     of conduct--consistent with our values as a nation--across \n     all U.S. agencies to govern the detention and interrogation \n     of people anywhere in U.S. custody.\n       The amendment would ensure lawful, effective, and humane \n     interrogations of individuals taken into custody by requiring \n     all agencies and departments to comply with the time-tested \n     requirements of the Army Field Manual (``Human Intelligence \n     Collector Operations''). It would also require a review of \n     the Army Field Manual to ensure that best practices and the \n     most recent evidenced-based research on humane interrogation \n     are incorporated. It would also codify existing Department of \n     Defense (DOD) practice of guaranteeing timely notification \n     and access to the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     (ICRC) for detainees taken into custody--an important bulwark \n     against abuse.\n       We strongly urge you to support this legislation to help \n     move our country forward and reaffirm that there is no \n     conflict between adhering to one of our nation's essential \n     and founding values--respect for inherent human dignity--and \n     our ability to obtain the intelligence we need to protect the \n     nation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frank Anderson, CIA (Ret.); Donald Canestraro, DEA \n           (Ret.); Glenn Carle, CIA (Ret.); Jack Cloonan, CIA \n           (Ret.); Barry Eisler, Formerly CIA; Eric Fair, Formerly \n           U.S. Army; Mark Fallon, NCIS (Ret.); Charlton Howard, \n           NCIS (Ret.); David Irvine, Brigadier General, U.S. Army \n           (Ret.); Timothy James, NCIS (Ret.); Steve Kleinman, \n           Colonel, USAFR (Ret.); Marcus Lewis, Formerly U.S. \n           Army; Brittain Mallow, Colonel, USA (Ret.); Mike Marks, \n           NCIS (Ret.);\n         Robert McFadden, NCIS (Ret.); Charles Mink, Formerly U.S. \n           Army; Joe Navarro, FBI (Ret.); Torin Nelson, Formerly \n           U.S. Army; Carissa Pastuch, Formerly U.S. Army; William \n           Quinn, Formerly U.S. Army; Ken Robinson, U.S. Army \n           (Ret.); Rolince, Mike, FBI (Ret.); Ed Soyster, \n           Lieutenant General, U.S. Army (Ret.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Committee on International\n\n\n                                            Justice and Peace,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2015.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, As deliberations over the FY 2016 National \n     Defense Authorization Act continue, I write to express \n     support for an amendment offered by Senators John McCain and \n     Dianne Feinstein that would prohibit all U.S. government \n     agencies and their agents from using torture as an \n     interrogation technique.\n       The amendment would:\n       Require all U.S. government agencies (including the CIA) to \n     limit interrogation techniques to those set out in the Army \n     Field Manual;\n       Require the Army Field Manual be updated regularly and \n     remain available to the public to reflect best interrogation \n     techniques designed to elicit statements without the use or \n     threat of force; and\n       Require the International Committee of the Red Cross be \n     given access to all detainees.\n       These provisions are ones that the Committee on \n     International Justice and Peace of the United States \n     Conference of Catholic Bishops have long supported in trying \n     to ban the practice of torture by the U.S. government.\n       The Army Field Manual 2-22.3 prescribes uniform standards \n     for interrogating persons detained by the Department of \n     Defense. A guiding principle of the Field Manual echoes the \n     Golden Rule: ``In attempting to determine if a contemplated \n     approach or technique should be considered prohibited, and \n     therefore should not be included in an interrogation plan, \n     consider . . . if the proposed approach technique were used \n     by the enemy against one of your fellow soldiers, would you \n     believe the soldier had been abused?'' (5-76)\n       The McCain-Feinstein amendment seeks to ensure that Army \n     Field Manual's standard is also the same standard used by \n     other governmental agencies, including the CIA. Adhering to \n     these standards and ensuring access by the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross to visit detainees in \n     international armed conflicts would make a substantial \n     contribution to our nation's efforts to uphold our \n     international obligations under the Geneva Conventions and \n     the Convention Against Torture. The amendment would help \n     restore the moral credibility of the United States.\n       In Catholic teaching, torture is an intrinsic evil that \n     cannot be justified under any\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\n     circumstances as it violates the dignity of the human person, \n     both victim and perpetrator, and degrades any society that \n     tolerates it. We urge all Senators to support the McCain-\n     Feinstein amendment that would help to ensure that laws are \n     enacted so that our government does not engage in torture \n     ever again.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                        Most Reverend Oscar Cantu,\n          Bishop of Las Cruces, Chair, Committee on International \n     Justice and Peace.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Protecting U.S. Security Upholding American Values\n\n       The United States detainee interrogation policy can live up \n     to American values and, at the same time, protect our \n     national security. This policy, supported by overwhelmingly \n     bipartisan legislation in 2005, states: ``No individual in \n     the custody or under the physical control of the U.S. \n     Government, regardless of nationality or physical location, \n     shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment.'' Such principles can be attained by following \n     the U.S. Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector \n     Operations. We believe these lawful, humane, and effective \n     techniques will produce actionable intelligence while \n     adhering to our founding principles.\n       To ensure the integrity of this critical process, Congress \n     should conduct effective, real-time oversight on America's \n     intelligence communities. Failure to live up to these \n     internal safeguards adversely affects the nation's security \n     and damages America's reputation in the world.\n         Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, 2001-2005; \n           Howard Berman, U.S. Congressman (D-CA), 1983-2013; \n           David Boren, U.S. Senator (D-OK), 1979-1994, Governor \n           of Oklahoma, 1975-1979; Harold Brown, Secretary of \n           Defense, 1977-1981; David Durenberger, U.S. Senator (R-\n           MN), 1978-1995; Lee Hamilton, U.S. Congressman (D-IN), \n           1965-1999; Gary Hart, U.S. Senator (D-CO), 1975-1987; \n           Rita Hauser, Chair, International Peace Institute, \n           1992-Present; Carla Hills, U.S. Trade Representative, \n           1989-1993; Thomas Kean, Governor of New Jersey, 1982-\n           1990, 9/11 Commission Chairman.\n         Richard C.

The amendment would prohibit \n     torture by requiring the CIA and other agencies to follow the \n     guidelines in the Army Field Manual when conducting \n     interrogations, and by ensuring that the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross is given access to all detainees. \n     The amendment also provides a means to update the Field \n     Manual to reflect the best legal, humane, and effective \n     interrogation techniques.\n       As Christians we believe that all people are created in the \n     image of God, endowed by our Creator with an inalienable \n     dignity and worth. Torture is a deeply degrading violation of \n     that image and to us it is never morally acceptable. As the \n     most powerful country on earth, we should set an example for \n     humane treatment of prisoners; we should never allow our \n     nation's practices to be used to justify torture.\n       Passing the McCain-Feinstein amendment would strengthen the \n     legal prohibition against torture and thereby prevent the CIA \n     from ever resuming its torture program. Please support \n     McCain-Feinstein and help begin to put the CIA's brutal and \n     degrading use of torture behind us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jim Winkler,\n     President and General Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n         American Civil Liberties Union; Human Rights; National \n           Religious Campaign Against Torture; The Constitution \n           Project; Physicans for Human Rights; Open Society \n           Policy Center; The Center for Victims of Torture\n\n                 (For Immediate Release: June 9, 2015)\n\nHuman Rights Groups Applaud Legislation Reaffirming U.S. Prohibition on \n                                Torture\n\n       On Tuesday, June 9, 2015, Senators McCain, Feinstein, Reed, \n     and Collins introduced legislation to make the U.S. Army \n     Field Manual on Interrogations the standard for all U.S. \n     government interrogations to make sure that the United States \n     never uses torture again. Seven human rights and civil \n     liberties organizations, including the ACLU, the Center for \n     Victims of Torture, The Constitution Project, Human Rights \n     First, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, the \n     Open Society Policy Center, and Physicians for Human Rights, \n     announced their strong support for the legislation via the \n     joint statement below.\n       Washington, DC.--We applaud Senators McCain, Feinstein, \n     Reed and Collins for offering bipartisan legislation to \n     ensure that the United States never uses torture again. \n     Senator McCain's prior legislation (the Detainee Treatment \n     Act) was approved by the Senate in 2005 with strong \n     bipartisan support and was a positive game-changer by \n     mandating among other things that interrogations conducted by \n     all Department of Defense personnel had to follow the U.S. \n     Army Field Manual on Interrogation (the Interrogation \n     Manual). The McCain-Feinstein amendment extends and improves \n     the Detainee Treatment Act by making the Interrogation Manual \n     the standard for all U.S. government interrogations, and by \n     mandating that the Manual be reviewed and updated regularly \n     to insure that it reflects the very best evidence-based \n     interrogation practices and complies with all U.S. legal \n     obligations. The McCain-Feinstein amendment also requires \n     that the International Committee of the Red Cross have access \n     to every prisoner in U.S. custody no matter where or by whom \n     they are held.\n       We believe that the CIA's ``enhanced interrogation'' \n     techniques and ``black sites'' were clearly illegal under the \n     law that existed on 9/11, under the 2005 Detainee Treatment \n     Act and also under the relevant provisions of the 2006 \n     Military Commissions Act. But the overwhelming evidence that \n     has emerged of shocking brutality employed by the CIA \n     notwithstanding these laws--including waterboarding, nudity, \n     stress positions, sleep deprivation, forced rectal feeding, \n     beatings and other abuses--demonstrates that additional \n     protections are still essential. Had the McCain-Feinstein \n     amendment been in place following the 9/11 attacks we believe \n     it would have significantly bolstered other prohibitions on \n     torture and made it far more difficult, if not impossible, \n     for the CIA to establish and operate their torture program. \n     Among other things, the Interrogation Manual explicitly \n     prohibits waterboarding, forced nudity and other forms of \n     torture employed by the CIA and it specifies that only \n     interrogation methods that are expressly described in the \n     Interrogation Manual are permitted. In addition, under the \n     McCain-Feinstein legislation no prisoner could have been \n     hidden away at CIA ``black sites'' without access to the Red \n     Cross.\n       More can and should be done to pursue accountability for \n     past brutal and illegal interrogations and to improve the \n     Interrogation Manual. But the McCain-Feinstein Amendment is a \n     vital and welcome step toward ensuring that the United States \n     never again uses torture.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and by \ndoing so, we can recommit ourselves to the fundamental precept that the \nUnited States does not torture--without exception and without \nequivocation--and ensure that the mistakes of our past are never again \nrepeated in the future.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to, if they wish, \ndisregard my statement with the exception of the statement by GEN David \nPetraeus. I don't know of a military leader who is more respected in \nAmerica and throughout the world than GEN David Petraeus. I don't have \nto remind my colleagues that he was the commander of U.S. forces in \nIraq and Afghanistan and Director of the CIA. He arguably has more \nexperience dealing with foreign detainee issues across the U.S. \nGovernment than any other American. These are the words of GEN David \nPetraeus:\n\n       I strongly support the extension of the provisions of the \n     U.S. Army Field Manual that currently govern the actions of \n     the U.S. military to all U.S. Government personnel and \n     contractors. Our Nation has paid a high price in recent \n     decades for the information gained by the use of techniques \n     beyond those in the field manual, and in my view, that price \n     far outweighed the value of the information gained through \n     the use of techniques beyond those in the manual.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the words of David Petraeus.\n  Here is a letter I received this month from former intelligence \ninterrogation professionals, the U.S. military, the CIA, and the FBI. \nHere is an excerpt from the letter they sent to me this month:\n\n       As intelligence and interrogation professionals who have \n     offered our collective voice opposing torture and other forms \n     of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, we strongly \n     encourage you to support the amendment. . . . The \n     interrogation methods that have kept America safe for \n     generations are sophisticated, humane, lawful and produce \n     reliable, actionable intelligence in any interrogation \n     scenario. To promote a return to that respected level of \n     professionalism, there must be a single well-defined standard \n     of conduct--consistent with our values as a nation--across \n     all U.S. agencies to govern the detention and interrogation \n     of people anywhere in U.S. custody.\n\n  This is supported by some of our most experienced military leaders. \nThey expressed their views in a letter I received this month, 30 of \nwhom are retired, including a former Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nformer commander of Centcom, former commander and chief of U.S. Army \nEurope--they wrote the following:\n\n       This amendment not only solidifies America's stance against \n     torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading \n     treatment. It also ensures that interrogation methods used by \n     all U.S. personnel are professional and reflect the \n     government's best practices. In that way, we not only ensure \n     that these interrogations are humane and lawful, but also \n     that they produce reliable intelligence on which we depend if \n     we are to fight and win against the current terrorist threat.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from those individuals dated June 9, 2015.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 9, 2015.\n       Dear Senator: As intelligence and interrogation \n     professionals who have offered our collective voice opposing \n     torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading \n     treatment, we strongly encourage you to support the amendment \n     to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act that \n     solidifies the ban against torture and cruel treatment of \n     detainees in U.S. custody.\n       While international and domestic law, including the 2005 \n     Detainee Treatment Act, prohibit such cruelty, sadly high-\n     level officials in the Executive Branch exploited loopholes \n     and still authorized torture and cruel treatment. The \n     interrogation methods that have kept America safe for \n     generations are sophisticated, humane, lawful, and produce \n     reliable, actionable intelligence in any interrogation \n     scenario. To promote a return to that respected level of \n     professionalism, there must be a single well-defined standard \n     of conduct--consistent with our values as a nation--across \n     all U.S. agencies to govern the detention and interrogation \n     of people anywhere in U.S. custody.\n       The amendment would ensure lawful, effective, and humane \n     interrogations of individuals taken into custody by requiring \n     all agencies and departments to comply with the time-tested \n     requirements of the Army Field Manual (``Human Intelligence \n     Collector Operations''). It would also require a review of \n     the Army Field Manual to ensure that best practices and the \n     most recent evidenced-based research on humane interrogation \n     are incorporated. It would also codify existing Department of \n     Defense (DOD) practice of guaranteeing timely notification \n     and access to the International Committee of the Red Cross \n     (ICRC) for detainees taken into custody--an important bulwark \n     against abuse.\n       We strongly urge you to support this legislation to help \n     move our country forward and reaffirm that there is no \n     conflict between adhering to one of our nation's essential \n     and founding values--respect for inherent human dignity--and \n     our ability to obtain the intelligence we need to protect the \n     nation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Frank Anderson, CIA (Ret.); Donald Canestraro, DEA (Ret.); \n     Glenn Carle, CIA (Ret.); Jack Cloonan, CIA (Ret.); Barry \n     Eisler, Formerly CIA; Eric Fair, Formerly U.S. Army; Mark \n     Fallon, NCIS (Ret.); Charlton Howard, NCIS (Ret.); David \n     Irvine, Brigadier General, U.S. Army (Ret.); Timothy James, \n     NCIS (Ret.); Steve Kleinman, Colonel, USAFR (Ret.); Marcus \n     Lewis, Formerly U.S. Army; Brittain Mallow, Colonel, USA \n     (Ret.); Mike Marks, NCIS (Ret.); Robert McFadden, NCIS \n     (Ret.); Charles Mink, Formerly U.S. Army; Joe Navarro, FBI \n     (Ret.); Torin Nelson, Formerly U.S. Army; Carissa Pastuch, \n     Formerly U.S. Army; William Quinn, Formerly U.S. Army; Ken \n     Robinson, U.S. Army (Ret.); Rolince, Mike, FBI (Ret.); Ed \n     Soyster, Lieutenant General, U.S. Army (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In a letter this month, the National Association of \nEvangelicals wrote the following in support of this amendment:\n\n       While the use of torture is currently prohibited across all \n     government agencies by executive order, this fundamental \n     principle must be enshrined in law to ensure that no future \n     President may authorize the use of torture.\n\n  Again, that is from the National Association of Evangelicals.\n  The Committee on International Justice and Peace at the United States \nConference of the Catholic Bishops wrote the following in support of \nthe amendment:\n\n       In Catholic teaching, torture is an intrinsic evil that \n     cannot be justified under any circumstances as it violates \n     the dignity of the human person, both victim and perpetrator, \n     and degrades any society that tolerates it. We urge all \n     Senators to support the McCain-Feinstein amendment that would \n     help to ensure that laws are enacted so that our government \n     does not engage in torture ever again.\n\n  I respect the dedication and services of those charged with \nprotecting this country. For 14 years, America's security professionals \nin the military, intelligence community, and beyond have lived every \nday with a dogged determination to protect their fellow Americans. But \nat the same time, we must continue to insist that the methods we employ \nin this fight for peace and freedom must always be as right and \nhonorable as the goals and ideals we fight for.\n  I believe past interrogation policies compromised our values, stained \nour national honor, and did little practical good. I don't believe we \nshould have employed such practices in the past, and we should never \npermit them in the future. This amendment provides greater assurances \nthat never again will the United States follow that dark path of \nsacrificing our values for our short-term security needs.\n  I also know that such practices don't work. I know from personal \nexperience that the abuse of prisoners does not produce good, reliable \nintelligence. Victims of torture will offer intentionally misleading \ninformation if they think their captors will believe it.\n  I firmly believe that all people, even captured enemies, possess \nbasic human rights which are protected by international standards often \nset by America's past leaders. Our enemies act without conscience. We \nmust not. Let's reassert the contrary proposition that it is essential \nto our success in this war that we ask those who fight it for us to \nremember at all times that they are defending a sacred ideal of how \nnations should be governed and should remember this when they conduct \ntheir relations with others, even our enemies.\n  Those of us who give them this duty are obliged by history, by our \nNation's highest ideals and the many terrible sacrifices made to \nprotect them, and by our respect for human dignity to make clear that \nwe need not risk our national honor to prevail in this or any war. We \nneed only remember in the worst of times, through the chaos and terror \nof war, when facing cruelty, suffering, and loss, that we are always \nAmericans and different, stronger, and better than those who would \ndestroy us.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I stand as a very proud cosponsor, along \nwith Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein, on this amendment. I \nparticularly wish to commend both Senator Feinstein and Senator McCain \nbecause they have really been the leaders in this Senate and in this \ncountry in expressing our fundamental values when\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\nit comes to the techniques we employ for those we detain in combat \nzones. Both their words and personal example have set an extraordinary \nstandard for us to respond to, and this amendment is typical of what \nthey have done. It would codify the terms of President Obama's \nExecutive order 13491 that applies to the Army Field Manual on \ninterrogations not only for the U.S. military but also for the \ninterrogation of detainees by other U.S. Government agencies.\n  What I think is so critical to this debate, this amendment, and the \nservice of these two Senators is that the humane treatment standard we \nset for those who are in our custody also serves to protect our men and \nwomen if they fall into the hands of our opponents. We then can say \nwith complete sincerity and complete fidelity that we demand our troops \nreceive humane treatment when in the custody of hostile forces because \nthat is what we do. When we deviate from that standard, we imperil the \nsafety and lives of our men and women in uniform who may fall into \nhostile hands.\n  As we adhere to these standards, we are not only setting a very high \nbar for the treatment of those whom we may hold, but we are innately \nprotecting the safety, health, welfare, and well-being of those who \nserve in the uniform of the United States, and for that reason in \nparticular, I commend the sponsors of this amendment and urge all of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank both Senator McCain and \nSenator Reed for their remarks. I particularly wish to thank Senator \nMcCain, whose life experience, for me, has been a guidepost. I don't \nknow anyone in this body who is more standup--and can sometimes be more \nstubborn, but this all comes into play as an important thing--and \nstands for the real, true, major issues this country faces.\n  I will never forget a conversation I had with him on the plane back \nfrom Guantanamo. When he spoke in the Kennedy Caucus Room and used the \ntap language he learned as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and to see this \nman, so many years since that time, tap out messages that were meant \nfor prison mates in other cells with such speed and alacrity certainly \nindicated that this was a very deep impression which was made on his \nlife. I think the fact that he has shared that with others, including \nme, is very important.\n  I want Senator McCain to know how much I appreciate his work on this \nand how grateful we are for his service to this country. He has unique \ncourage and unique stamina, and maybe that is just all-American. Again, \nI thank the Senator from Arizona very much for his work, and the same \nfor Senator Reed, the ranking member on this committee. Senator Reed is \nmilitary-American through and through. Having his support has been \nterrific.\n  Again, I thank both of them very much. It was a pleasure to work with \nboth of my colleagues, and I hope this passes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for her very \nkind words and her friendship and leadership. I hope that in return for \nall of this, she will send back all the water to Arizona that \nCalifornia has stolen from our State. My beloved former colleague, \nSenator Barry Goldwater, used to say that in Arizona, we had so little \nwater that the trees chased the dogs, so we would like to get the water \nback from California, and I hope that can be part of the wonderful \nfriendship we have enjoyed now for many years.\n  I thank the Senator from California.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1889, offered by the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Florida (Mr. Rubio).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise for a special request. I just \nreturned from a military trip overseas with four other Members just a \nmatter of minutes ago to find out that the two amendments that I was \ntrying to get pending--and I would really settle for just one of those \ntwo. I was not here when all of these UCs were made and the \narrangements were put together between the parties.\n  So I ask the leader on the other side--or the handler on the other \nside, Senator Jack Reed--if he would consider a waiver of his \ncommitment to allow me to bring up one of these to get in the queue.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. To the Senator from Oklahoma, we have been trying to move \nforward on an equal basis in terms of pending amendments. At this \njuncture, I am not able to agree to make another amendment pending.\n  There is a possibility that we spoke about, briefly, of including \nthese amendments in the manager's package or, since it is germane, of \ntrying to arrange for consideration after cloture, along with another \ngermane amendment. So at this point I would not be prepared to--\n  Mr. INHOFE. Regaining the floor, I would only say to my good friend \nthat as the second ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, I \nhave talked about these for a long time. I tried to do them before I \nleft for 4 days on business. Also, Senator Mikulski is my cosponsor on \namendment No. 1728.\n  So I have to make a motion to lay the pending amendment aside for the \npurpose of consideration of amendment No. 1728.\n  Mr. REED. Have you made the motion?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I just did.\n  Mr. REED. I would object.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending \nbusiness aside for the purpose of considering the Inhofe-Mikulski \ncommissary amendment No. 1728.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, at this time, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment, because first, \nthis is something beyond anyone's control. No one could have controlled \nthis. We had four Members who were gone. It couldn't be helped. We were \non business.\n  I have 41 amendments, almost equally divided, Democrat and \nRepublican, on an issue that is probably the most significant issue to \nthe spouses of our kids who are over there, overseas. What it does is \nthat it lets us do an assessment before we close any of the \ncommissaries--not close them but privatize them, instead of privatizing \nthem and then seeing how it works. I think we have a vast majority of \npeople who do support that.\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\n  It is something that is offered on a bipartisan basis, and it is \nsomething that a lot of people--over 100 organizations are sponsoring \nthis amendment--spoke very strongly in support of and consider this \namendment to be the most significant amendment in the everyday lives of \nour troops. Anyone who travels overseas and travels to these various \nareas knows that when they go through a commissary, they see--\nparticularly in areas where there are no other opportunities out \nthere--that there is almost no competition. It is something like a \nclub. It is something that the wives, the husbands, the families, and \nthe kids do. They go to the commissary. Taking that away would be \ntaking away a tradition.\n  Again, the bill doesn't state that it goes away, but it does \ntemporarily privatize five major commissaries. Now, when that happens, \nyou have started the ball rolling. And the bill also states--and we \ndiscussed this in committee--that this gives us time to look and \nevaluate to see whether we want to privatize them.\n  So everyone who is on here as a cosponsor has made the statement: Why \ndon't we find out first.\n  So that is all we want to do--instead of closing or transferring five \nand then finding out whether we did the right thing, go ahead and have \nthe study and then go ahead and proceed however we think is in the best \ninterest.\n  So it is a very serious amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1578\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment No. 1578, the Military Justice Improvement Act, to \nensure that survivors of military sexual assault have access to an \nunbiased, trained, military judicial system.\n  Last year, despite the support of 55 Senators, a coalition spanning \nthe entire ideological spectrum, including both the majority and \nminority leader, our bill to create an independent military justice \nsystem free of inherent biases and conflicts of interest within the \nchain of command was filibustered by this body.\n  But as we said then: We will not walk away. The brave men and women \nin uniform who are defending this Nation deserve a vote. That is our \nduty. It is our oversight role. It is Congress's responsibility to act \nas if the brave survivors of sexual assault are our sons, our \ndaughters, our husbands, our wives, who are being betrayed by the \ngreatest military on Earth. We owe them that at the very least.\n  Over the last few years, Congress has forced the military to make \nmany incremental changes to address this crisis. And after two decades \nof complete failure and lip service to zero tolerance, the military now \nsays, essentially: Trust us this time; we have it.\n  They misrepresent data to claim that their mission is accomplished, \nbut when you dig below the service of their top lines, you will find \nthat the assault rate is exactly where it was in 2010--an average of 52 \ncases every single day--and 3 out of 4 servicemember survivors still \ndon't think it is worth the risk of coming forward to report crimes \ncommitted against them.\n  Seventy-five percent don't trust the current system. One in seven \nvictims was assaulted by someone in their chain of command. And in 60 \npercent of the cases, a supervisor or unit leader is responsible for \neither sexual harassment or sexual discrimination. This is not the \nclimate our military deserves. It is no surprise, then, that one in \nthree survivors believes that reporting would hurt their career.\n  For those who do report, they are more likely than not to experience \nretaliation. Despite a much touted reform that made retaliation a \ncrime, the DOD made zero progress on improving the 62-percent \nretaliation rate that we had in 2012.\n  According to a Human Rights Watch report, the DOD cannot provide a \nsingle example of serious disciplinary action taken against those who \nretaliated against a victim of sexual assault. A sexual assault \nsurvivor is 12 times more likely to suffer retaliation than to see \ntheir offender get convicted of a sex offense.\n  In my close review of 107 cases--from the largest domestic military \nbases and one from each service--in 2013, I found that nearly half of \nthose who did move forward and report ended up dropping out of their \ncases. Survivors still have little faith in this system. Under any \nmetric the system remains plagued with distrust and does not provide \nthe fair and just process that our men and women in the military \ndeserve.\n  Simply put, the military has not held up to the standard posed by \nGeneral Dempsey 1 year ago when he said:\n\n       We are on the clock, if you will . . . the President said \n     to us in December, you've got about a year to review this \n     thing . . . and if we haven't been able to demonstrate we are \n     making a difference, you know, then we deserve to be held to \n     the scrutiny and standard.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to hold the military to that higher standard. \nEnough is enough with the spin, with the excuses, and the false \npromises.\n  Just yesterday I received a letter from a survivor of military sexual \nassault who is serving Active Duty. She says:\n\n       The reason I am writing on her behalf is because I fear she \n     will be retaliated against for speaking out.\n       While the military is on the Hill lobbying Senators not to \n     support the Military Justice Improvement Act (MJIA), I am \n     asking you to take a stand with survivors and their families.\n       These military lobbyists have good intentions; however, I \n     am doubtful any of them will represent my perspective.\n       I have experienced the anguish of a child who has been \n     raped by another servicemember, a fellow brother-in-arms whom \n     she should have been able to trust.\n       Please support the Military Justice Improvement Act, a \n     commonsense law that significantly improves the military \n     justice system. Our military sons and daughters who survive \n     these heinous crimes carry high rates of post-traumatic \n     stress disorder and suicide. I believe that if the MJIA is \n     passed, it could save lives and will positively affect the \n     lives of survivors, both victims and their families.\n       No one should have to worry about retaliation from their \n     chain of command when they report these crimes. Retaliation \n     happens so often that a majority of these assaults go \n     unreported. Every military victim of sexual assault deserves \n     due process, professional treatment by a trained military \n     individual, and equal opportunity to seek and receive \n     justice.\n       Our military has promised improvement and has had adequate \n     time in which to improve, but the numbers show that the \n     military has failed to live up to its promise.\n       The Department of Defense has admitted that it made no \n     progress since 2012. It is time for the chain of command to \n     be removed from decision-making in sexual assault cases and \n     replaced by those trained, non-biased military personnel, \n     educated in the law and experienced in handling sexual \n     assault cases.\n       Further, MJIA specifically carves out sexual assault and \n     other serious crimes, with the remainder of military crimes \n     being left in the chain of command.\n       Please hold the military to a higher standard by voting yes \n     to an unbiased military system, promoted in MJIA.\n\n  We have to listen to our victims, our survivors, the men and women \nwho give their lives to this country, who will sacrifice anything for \nthis country. America's military, if they do these reforms, will have \nfewer dangerous criminals and far more heroes. The brave men and women \nwe send to war to keep us safe deserve nothing less than a justice \nsystem equal to their sacrifice. By listening to the victims, we can \ndeliver that.\n  I urge everyone here to listen to our brave survivors, support our \nbill, and do the right thing.\n  I would now like to yield the floor to one of the authors of the \nMilitary Justice Improvement Act, the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gillibrand for her \nleadership in this area over a long period of time, and I add my voice \nto the support of her amendment. She has been a great leader on the \nissue. As you can see, she has a lot of passion in her dogged pursuit \nof justice.\n  Last year, when I spoke in favor of this measure, I made the point \nthis was not a new issue that required further study or incremental \nreforms. We had been hearing promises for years and years that there \nwould be zero tolerance and a real crackdown on military sexual \nassault. Last year, the National Defense Authorization Act included a \nlot of commonsense reforms, but it did not include any fundamental \nreform of the military justice system. We were told to give these new \nadjustments to the current system a chance to work and come back next \nyear.\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\n  At the time, I made the point that we had already tried working \nwithin the current system to no avail. I am not one to advocate for \nmajor sweeping reform if less will address the problem, but what we \nhave been doing has not worked.\n  Last year, after Congress passed the package of more modest reforms \nbut not our Military Justice Improvement Act amendment, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, said: ``We have been given \nabout a year to demonstrate both that we will treat this with the \nurgency it deserves and that we can turn the trend lines in a more \npositive direction.'' He made clear that if we didn't see real \nprogress, he wouldn't stand in the way of more major reforms. Well, we \nhave not seen significant movement.\n  In terms of the number of sexual assault cases and the shocking rate \nof retaliation against those who report, we simply don't see progress. \nThat is probably because the current system is part of the problem. The \nfact that victims of sexual assault cannot turn to an independent \nsystem to get justice, combined with the very real fear of retaliation, \nacts as a terrible deterrent to reporting sexual assault. If sexual \nassault cases are not reported, they then cannot be prosecuted. If \nsexual assault isn't prosecuted, it leads to predators remaining in the \nmilitary and a perception that this sort of activity is going to be \ntolerated.\n  By allowing this situation to continue, we are putting at risk the \nmen and women who have volunteered to place their lives on the line. We \nare also seriously damaging military morale and readiness.\n  Taking prosecutions out of the hands of commanders and giving them to \nprofessional prosecutors who are independent of the chain of command \nwill help ensure impartial justice for the men and women of our Armed \nForces. This would in no way take away the ability of commanders to \npunish troops under their command for military infractions. Commanders \nalso can and should be held accountable for the climate under their \ncommand, but the point here is the sexual assault is a law enforcement \nmatter, not a military one.\n  This isn't some reform that came out of the blue either. We have an \nadvisory committee appointed by the Secretary of Defense himself which \ncame out in support of reforms. On September 27, 2013, the Defense \nAdvisory Committee on Women in the Services--which goes by the acronym \nDACOWITS--voted overwhelmingly in support of each of the components of \nthe Military Justice Improvement Act amendment.\n  DACOWITS was created way back in 1951 by then-Secretary of Defense \nGeorge C. Marshall. The committee is composed of civilian and retired \nmilitary men and women who are appointed by the Secretary of Defense to \nprovide advice and recommendations on matters and policies relating to \nthe recruitment and retention, treatment, employment, integration, and \nwell-being of highly qualified professional women in the Armed Forces. \nHistorically, this committee's recommendations have been very \ninstrumental in effecting changes to laws and policies pertaining to \nmilitary women.\n  The bottom line is, this isn't some advocacy group or fly-by-night \npanel. It is a longstanding advisory committee handpicked by the \nSecretary of Defense and it supports the substance of our amendment to \na tee.\n  We have tried reforming the current system and it didn't work. When \nwe are talking about something as serious and life-altering as sexual \nassault, we cannot afford to wait any longer. So I urge my colleagues \nto join us in supporting this amendment.\n  As we approach this from the outside, it gives me an opportunity to \nreiterate what I see so wrong in so many bureaucracies. We are always \npromised change, but as I have looked back over a couple or three \ndecades of this problem of the culture of the various bureaucracies, \nnothing really happens from within. It has to happen from without. In \nthis particular case of national defense being the No. 1 responsibility \nof the Federal Government, this change has to happen from without \nbecause it hasn't happened from within, regardless of the promises.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, last year we gathered here to debate \nthis issue, and I think it is really important to point out that \neveryone in this body has the same heart when it comes to this issue; \nthat is, that we want to make sure victims who are assaulted in our \nmilitary are protected and supported, that the system is highly trained \nand professional, and that perpetrators have due process but also are \nput in prison if the system finds them guilty. This difference is an \nhonest policy difference over which system would better accomplish \nthose goals.\n  Now, we have agreed on so much, I think it is important to point out \nthe work the Congress has done reforming sexual assault in the \nmilitary. Last year, we had over 26 different provisions that were \nenacted into law. This year, we haven't stopped. We have 13 more \nprovisions in this piece of legislation. There is simply a disagreement \nover which system would protect victims better.\n  There have been historic reforms, such as commanders having been \nstripped from their ability to overturn convictions. They are being \nheld accountable under rigorous new standards and oversight. Every \nvictim who reports now gets their own independent lawyer to protect \ntheir rights and fight for their interests. It is now a crime for any \nmember to retaliate against a victim who reports a sexual assault. The \n``good soldier'' defense has been removed, along with dozens and dozens \nmore.\n  Yes, there were panels that looked at this issue, as the one just \nreferenced by my colleague from Iowa--DACOWITS. They heard no testimony \nfrom expert witnesses. They heard a brief presentation by myself and \nSenator Gillibrand, but they didn't spend days on it; whereas, the \nsystem's response panel, put in place by this Congress, spent weeks and \nweeks examining this and heard from dozens and dozens of witnesses from \nevery side of the issue. By the way, this panel was made up of a \nmajority of civilians--the majority of them women--and it voted \noverwhelmingly to reject an approach that removes commanders from their \nresponsibility and their duties and, therefore, their accountability.\n  One of the members of this Commission, the woman who runs the victims \ncenter at the Department of Justice for the entire country, said: ``I \nwent into this thinking Senator Gillibrand's legislation made sense . . \n. but when you hear the facts, it doesn't hold up.''\n  She was joined by the liberal icon--a feminist icon--Elizabeth \nHoltzman, who was the author of the rape shield statute in the Congress \nwhen she served as a Representative. She, too, spoke out, saying that \nonce she understood the system and understood the facts, she agreed \nthat keeping commanders accountable was crucial.\n  Now, have we seen progress? It is one thing to have anecdotal \ninformation, it is another to have a statistically valid survey. The \nsame survey that shows retaliation is still a stubborn problem that we \ncan't give up on also shows some very important data. So if you are \ngoing to argue retaliation is a continuing problem, you are relying on \nthe very same survey that tells us the following: incidents are down--\nthat is meaningful progress--dropping 29 percent just in the last 2 \nyears. Reporting continues to go up, which was our stated goal as we \nbegan these reforms. Reports are up 70 percent from 2012. Back in 2012, \nonly 1 in 10 victims were reporting. We have that down to one in four. \nThat is not spin, that is fact. These victims are coming forward \nbecause they have renewed confidence they will have support, they will \nget good information, and that the system is not stacked against them.\n  Increased reporting occurred in all categories. The number of \nunrestricted reports are up, restricted reports are up, and, \nimportantly, the number of reports that victims converted from \nrestricted to unrestricted.\n  Furthermore, they went around the country and did focus groups with \nvictims. This was RAND. This wasn't the military, this wasn't the \nDepartment of Justice, this was the RAND Corporation--well known for \nits ability to do statistical information--that went around the country \nand did focus groups--11 different focus groups--on different bases \nwith just victims and asked victims to come forward and participate in \nthe survey.\n  In that survey--and this is really important--82 percent agreed their \nunit\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\ncommander supported them, 73 percent were satisfied with their unit \ncommander's response, and 73 percent said they would recommend others \nreport if they were a victim of sexual assault.\n  And this is really important: The Gillibrand amendment does nothing \nto combat retaliation. The recent RAND survey found that the majority \nof reported retaliation does not come from commanders; it comes from \npeers. This is a cultural problem we have to get after, and certainly I \nwould stand ready to work with Senator Gillibrand, Senator Grassley, \nand all of my colleagues to look to see what we have to do to get at \nthis peer-to-peer retaliation, which is the vast majority of what was \nreported.\n  Finally, the Gillibrand amendment actually weakens punishment for the \ncrime of retaliation. By moving retaliation from article 92 to article \n93 of the UCMJ, it would actually reduce the maximum punishment for \nthis crime, and it, finally, prohibits the resources necessary to get \nat this problem. The amendment says we cannot add any additional \nresources to get after this.\n  Historic reforms have been made. They are working, based on data. \nTalking to dozens and dozens of prosecutors and untold victims, as a \nformer sex crimes prosecutor who cares about nothing more than taking \ncare of victims and making sure they have due process and are respected \nand deferred to, I must urge this body to reject the Gillibrand \napproach, which removes commanders from being held accountable where \nthey must be held accountable.\n  Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote on the Gillibrand amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the last point \nand the first point that my colleague made that somehow this reform \nmakes commanders less responsible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that all time for \ndebate has expired.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I ask unanimous consent to continue the debate for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, this statement that somehow \ncommanders are removed from responsibility and that we are not keeping \ncommanders responsible, that couldn't be further from the truth. Today, \ncommanders are the only ones responsible for good order and discipline \nat every level. The unit commander is responsible for order and \ndiscipline. Every aspect of the chain of command is responsible. It is \ntheir jobs to train troops, to maintain good order and discipline, to \nprevent rapes and crimes from being committed under their command, and \nto punish retaliation. They have failed in that duty.\n  In this chain of command, 97 percent of commanders are responsible \nand do not have the convening authority we would like to give to \nprosecutors--97 percent, their job doesn't change one iota.\n  So to say you are making commanders less responsible is a false \nstatement that has no bearing. In fact, they are 100 percent \nresponsible for good order and discipline, for training their troops, \nto prevent these rapes, and to prosecute retaliation. In 1 year--they \nhave been on notice for years about this, 25 years, and we have this \nzero tolerance. They are super on notice now--in 1 year, not one \nprosecution of retaliation.\n  This guy can prosecute retaliation under article 15. This guy can do \nsomething about retaliation. This guy, this guy, this guy. Only 3 \npercent have the right to convening authority, and that 3 percent needs \nto be moved to someone who is actually a lawyer, who is trained, who \nknows how to weigh evidence and can make the right decision, and that \nis not what is happening today.\n  So right now this supervisor and unit leader--in 60 percent of the \ncases where there is alleged gender discrimination or sexual \nharassment, it is the unit leader. One in seven of the alleged rapists \nis one of these commanders--chain of command.\n  There is a perspective by a survivor that this chain of command \n``does not have my back.'' So I would like to give it to another chain \nof command--senior military prosecutors--to make this decision, so her \nperspective can be: Someone has my back. This chain of command may well \nbe tainted for her if her unit commander is harassing her and her \nrapist is in the chain of command. We need to professionalize the \nsystem.\n  We are trying to make the military the best prosecutorial system in \nthe world, and they can do this mission. We need to give them the \ntools, and having this current status quo--the status quo that has been \nin charge of no retaliation and no rape for 25 years--is failing. To \nhave the same rate of retaliation we had 2 years ago when the \ncommanders said: You must trust us to do this--every one of these \ncommanders does not have convening authority, but every one of these \ncommanders could have stopped retaliation.\n  When you say it is just peer-to-peer, it is dishonest. Thirty percent \nof the cases of retaliation are administrative, 30 percent of the cases \nare professional. Only a commander can administer administrative or \nprofessional retaliation.\n  This culture must change, and if Congress doesn't take their \nresponsibility to hold the Department of Defense accountable, no one \nwill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2015 NDAA passed last year \nincluded 34 new provisions dealing with sexual assault. Commanders have \nbarely had time to implement these provisions, let alone assess their \neffectiveness.\n  The fiscal year 2014 NDAA included more than 50 individual \nprovisions, the most comprehensive set of changes to the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice since 1968.\n  Cumulative, the last three NDAAs included 71 sections of law \ncontaining more than 100 unique requirements, including 16 \ncongressional reporting requirements. This year's bill builds on that \nprogress with 12 military justice provisions, including every proposal \nthat was offered by Senator Gillibrand during the committee's markup of \nthis legislation.\n  It is true that sexual assaults have been reduced. That is a fact. \nThat is a fact. So to somehow allege that nothing has been done--her \nproposal is rejected by literally every member of the military whom I \nknow who has years of experience.\n  We cannot remove the commanding officer from the chain of command, \nand that is what Senator Gillibrand's amendment and effort has been--to \nremove the commanding officer from responsibility--and I will \nsteadfastly oppose it.\n  I hope that at some point the Senator from New York would acknowledge \nthat we took in this bill every provision that she offered during the \nmarkup of the legislation.\n  So with respect and appreciation for Senator Gillibrand's passion and \nfor her dedication on this issue, I respectfully disagree and urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum call with respect to the cloture vote on the substitute \namendment No. 1463 be waived; further, that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, prior to each vote in the 2:15 p.m. series.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Chair notify me after 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mrs. ERNST. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Colleagues, just a few brief points on this amendment.\n  We are just providing the administration the option to get arms \ndirectly to the Kurds. The Kurds currently are providing refuge to over \n1.6 million refugees from Iraq and Syria. Many of them are ethnic and \nreligious minorities, such as Christians.\n  The Peshmerga have shown the ability to be effective on the \nbattlefield against ISIS. This Ernst-Boxer amendment is a companion \nbill to the one presented by Representatives Royce and Engel in the \nHouse.\n  I urge my colleague to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. ERNST. I yield to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to team up with the good Senator \nbecause this is a very modest amendment that just puts us in line with \nour colleagues: the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Canada, France, \nAustralia, and others who already are directly arming the Kurds.\n  Now, the President's policy that I absolutely support is we are going \nto take this fight to ISIS, but we are not going to have combat boots \non the ground; we are going to help strategically with airstrikes.\n  These are the people who are taking it day after day--deaths and \nblood and wounds. The least we can do is support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I oppose the Ernst amendment. It would \nundermine what has been the fundamental policy of the United States \ngoing back into the last administration: a unified, sovereign Iraq. \nThis amendment would send a signal to the Iraqis that we are supporting \nthe Kurds directly, not supporting a unified, sovereign Iraq. That \nwould complicate our efforts against ISIL. It would complicate our \nefforts in the region.\n  Also, it is the situation now where the effort is shifting into Anbar \nProvince in the Sunni areas. We are supporting the Kurds. In fact, \nPrime Minister Barzani was here a few weeks ago and indicated that he \nwas at least accepting of the arrangements, which I think were \nappropriate.\n  If this amendment passes, the perception will be that the United \nStates is now not trying to unify or help the Iraqis unify but put a \ndegree of separation between an autonomy, and that would be a mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mrs. ERNST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nyes on this strongly bipartisan amendment. The central question is \nsimple--whether this Congress is doing everything we can to protect \nmembers of our military. The metric of success is not how many reforms \nwe have passed; it is whether we have passed all of the reforms that \nare necessary to make the difference. If you think the assault rate \nthat is exactly where it was in 2010 is unacceptable, then vote yes. \nSome 20,000 sexual assaults, rapes, and unwanted sexual contact in 1 \nyear alone is unacceptable. If you think an average of 52 cases every \nsingle day is unacceptable, then vote yes. If you think it is \nunacceptable that three out of four servicemembers still don't feel it \nis worth the risk of reporting, then vote yes. If you think that zero \nprogress on retaliation isn't good enough, then vote yes. If you think \na sexual assault survivor being 12 times more likely to suffer \nretaliation than see their offender get convicted for a sex offense, \nthen vote yes.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's take action and stop the assaults, \nstop the retaliation, and build trust and professionalize our military \njustice system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this effort. If you care \nabout our military commanders, listen to them. Every one of them \nopposes this. If my colleagues believe that the military legal \ncommunity knows what they are talking about, listen to them. Every JAG \nof every service opposes this. A 29-percent decrease in sexual assault \nincidents, a 70-percent increase in reporting. Senator McCaskill, \nSenator Ayotte, Senator Fischer, and many others, along with Senator \nReed--we have reformed the military justice system in an appropriate \nmanner. But here is what we should never allow to happen:\n  Commander, last night there was an alleged rape in the barracks.\n  Oh, I don't care about that anymore; send that over to the lawyers.\n  Let's never let that happen. Never let a commander avoid \nresponsibility for what happens in their unit. It is their job to make \nsure we have good order and discipline. Don't let them off the hook. \nReinforce good commanders and fire bad ones. Do not disenfranchise the \nbest military leadership in the history of the world. And that is \nexactly what this does. We will solve the sexual assault problem. We \nare not going to dismantle the infrastructure that has given us the \nfinest military in the history of mankind. That is why everybody who \nknows what they are talking about opposes this.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \namendment No. 1463, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on whether we \nwill accept the budget gimmicks used by the Senate majority to pay for \ndefense spending priorities, or reject those efforts in favor of a \nmeaningful budget deal that protects both defense and discretionary \nspending. After more than 2 weeks of consideration, and votes on fewer \nthan a dozen of the over 550 amendments that have been filed, I am \ndisappointed by the majority leader's decision to vote to cut off \ndebate on the pending Defense authorization bill. This bill deserves \nthorough consideration. It has not received that.\n  Even worse, little progress has been made in approving amendments \nthrough managers' packages. Less than two dozen amendments have been \napproved by unanimous consent. Even in years when this bill has been \nmost troubled, we have been able to clear noncontroversial amendments \non both sides in significantly greater numbers, to improve the \nunderlying authorization. But this year, that has not happened. So when \nasked if we should cut off debate, my answer is a clear ``no.'' Debate \nover what should or should not be in this bill is not yet close to \nover.\n  It is too bad, because this bill includes many provisions that I \nsupport to promote our national interests, provide support to our \nmilitary personnel, and reaffirm our commitment to partners abroad. As \nthe bill's managers have both noted time and again, this Defense \nauthorization bill increases readiness, keeps faith with servicemembers \nand their families, and invests in game-changing technology.\n  As in past years, however, I am concerned that this year's Defense \nauthorization bill includes several ill-advised provisions that would \nmake it even harder to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. \nIt imposes unnecessary new restrictions on transferring detainees to \nforeign countries--despite the steep cost of holding detainees at \nGuantanamo. And even though military commission proceedings still have \nbarely gotten off the ground--14 years after September 11--it provides \nno realistic path for transferring detainees to the United States for \ntrial in Article III courts. As long as the detention facility at \nGuantanamo remains open, it will continue to serve as a recruitment \ntool for terrorists and tarnish America's role as a champion of human \nrights. Closing Guantanamo is the morally and fiscally responsible \nthing to do, and I strongly oppose the provisions in this bill that \nneedlessly restrict detainee transfers out of that facility.\n  But perhaps the biggest flaw of this bill is that it yet again relies \non and expands the Overseas Contingency Operations fund to avoid \nsequestration caps. The intention of this fund, which I have repeatedly \nstated should be done away with, has been severely distorted since its \ninception. We cannot continue to put our national defense on a credit \ncard while asking working families to take responsibility for these \ncosts. I support eliminating sequestration and believe it never should \nhave been put in place, but simply ignoring its cap for defense \nspending by putting it in this off-books account doesn't get us any \ncloser to that reality. We need a real solution to rid ourselves of \nsequestration, not one that relies on gimmicks while leaving military \nfamilies, and low- and middle-class families, as well as our veterans, \nbehind.\n  The Senate needs to fully consider this bill. The annual Defense \nauthorization is an important bill. It is also a comprehensive bill \nthat authorizes over $\\1/2\\ trillion in defense spending, including pay \nand benefits, acquisition programs, and initiatives to protect our \nnational security. It should be fully vetted before debate is ended. We \nowe it to the American people. I will oppose cloture on this substitute \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1889\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning I voted against the \nFeinstein-McCain amendment No. 1889 because I believe it represents \nshortsighted national security policy.\n  The central provision of this amendment would limit the interrogation \nof detainees by any U.S. Government employee or agent to techniques \nthat are listed in the publicly available Army Field Manual on human \nintelligence collection (FM 2-22.3), essentially codifying a portion of \nExecutive Order No. 13491, issued by President Obama on January 22, \n2009. Due to the wide public availability of this manual, this policy \nenables our enemies to study and dissect the methods we use to try to \nelicit sensitive information from them, giving them the opportunity to \ntrain against these techniques and prepare for them.\n  Quite simply, the effect of this policy is to hand our entire \ninterrogation playbook to groups such as the self-declared Islamic \nState of Iraq and the Levant, ``ISIL,'' Al Qaeda, and the Taliban, \nwhich is a profound mistake. Moreover, this limitation is unnecessary, \nbecause Congress has already taken action to prohibit interrogation or \nother treatment of detainees that is ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment'' by enacting the Detainee Treatment Act of \n2005.\n  In the past, other interrogation techniques that were not publicly \ndisclosed to our enemies, known as enhanced interrogation techniques, \nproved their worth in numerous instances. In the wake of the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001, these enhanced techniques were deemed \nnecessary for use with certain hardened Al Qaeda leaders and operatives \nwho possessed valuable intelligence that could save American lives, \nincluding knowledge of planned attacks against our Nation. There is \nstrong evidence to believe that EITs, in desperate situations, helped \nprotect our country from terrorist attacks. In addition, intelligence \nobtained through these interrogations helped locate Osama bin Laden and \nenabled the operation to kill or capture him in Abbottabad, Pakistan, \non May 2, 2011. The Obama administration cannot deny that intelligence \ngleaned through the use of enhanced techniques played a role in \ntracking down bin Laden.\n  In recent months, the threat of terrorism has been increasing in both \nintensity and complexity. The rise of the terrorist army of ISIL makes \nthis a challenging time in the fight against terrorism. While it is \nclear that President Obama has no intention of authorizing the use of \nenhanced interrogation techniques while he is President, this amendment \nwould unwisely and tightly restrict the tools available to future \nPresidents to protect this country. I cannot support such a policy.\n\n\n                        Working Across The Aisle\n\n  Mr. President, for the past several weeks we have been debating the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, which performs one of our most \nimportant and significant functions, which is to make sure the people \nwho fight our\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nNation's wars have the resources they need in order to do the job and \nto keep the American people safe.\n  This bill that started in the Armed Services Committee passed out \noverwhelmingly, and that is because this is not or should not be a \npartisan issue. Our duty to protect our troops so they can protect us \nshould be a no-brainer. You would think partisan politics would be the \nfurthest thing from this debate.\n  I am glad the Senate has now taken a big step forward to help move \nthis legislation along, but I have to admit there are some ominous \nsigns on the horizon. Initially, Senate Democrats on the Armed Services \nCommittee threatened to block this bill in the committee unless there \nwas some deal cut on spending. That is troubling, although I am \ngrateful that only four Democrats voted against this bill in the \ncommittee. Then there is some suggestion from the President of the \nUnited States that he might consider vetoing this legislation. Why? \nBecause he disagrees with some of the content of this legislation? \nWell, no. The reason he threatened to veto it is because he said we \nhaven't agreed to his demands to increase spending--by the way, \nspending money we don't have, adding to our national debt.\n  It concerns me a great deal when something that should enjoy broad \nbipartisan support, such as our national defense, somehow becomes a \npotential hostage to take in the spending wars here in Washington, DC.\n  Now we have learned that the strategy among our Democratic friends is \nnot to block this bill. Candidly, I think that is because they realized \nthey didn't have the votes to do it, and it would have been a momentous \ndecision if they had blocked it for some extraneous reason. But now we \nare told that the next bill we turn to, which will probably be the \nDefense appropriations bill--that our friends across the aisle are \nthreatening to block that in another continuing effort to do what they \ncall prepare for their filibuster summer.\n  The great thing about our friends across the aisle is that you don't \nhave to wonder necessarily what they are planning to do; all you have \nto do is read the newspapers because they will tell you. There, Senator \nSchumer, one of the senior Democrats in leadership, said they plan to \nblock every appropriations bill until they get a negotiated deal to \nraise spending limits that have been in effect since 2011.\n  Well, I have to think this is why the minority leader, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, initially when we were starting debate on this bill, \nsuggested it would be a waste of time. I can't think of any other \nreason why he would say debating and voting on and passing the Defense \nauthorization bill would be a waste of time unless there was some \nimplicit threat there that it would never actually see the light of \nday.\n  But there has been a casualty along the way. You will remember that \nlast Thursday we had a vote on a bill that would effect commonsense \nimprovements in our cyber security at a time when more and more \nAmericans are undergoing cyber attacks. Of course, these take different \nforms, but many nation states have active cyber attack efforts against \nour intellectual property--let's say the people who have labored long \nand hard and make big investments in weapons systems and airplanes and \nthe like. Well, our adversaries are actively trying to steal the design \ninformation so they can copy that, of course at a much cheaper cost, \nand they can learn what the capabilities are of our weapons systems and \nour airplanes.\n  But other cyber attacks are more straightforward. It is just crime. \nIt is stealing people's identity. It is stealing their money. It is \nstealing their resources. There are criminal networks all around the \nworld that are actively engaged in trying to steal from the American \npeople online.\n  So you would have thought that this amendment, dealing as it did with \ncyber security--that a good place to park this would have been on the \nDefense authorization bill, as important a role as cyber security plays \nin our national security. Of course, the purpose was to help the \ngovernment and private businesses work together to protect Americans' \npersonal information and their privacy, which is a pretty \nstraightforward goal. Protecting the personal information of the \nAmerican people is very important. And it was noncontroversial. This \nparticular bill that was offered as an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill passed out of the Senate Intelligence Committee 14 \nto 1. But since this is filibuster summer, the minority leader, Senator \nReid, decided the Democrats were going to vote as a group to block that \namendment.\n  Not even 24 hours later, though--their timing could not have been \nworse--the need for this critical legislation became even more urgent. \nOn Friday--1 day after the Democratic leader urged his colleagues to \nblock this important cyber security measure--media reports began \nconfirming that hackers had accessed government networks and obtained \nincredibly sensitive background information used for security \nclearances in a second breach to the personnel management systems. This \ninformation, which one former NSA official described as the crown \njewels and a gold mine for foreign intelligence services, was \nreportedly stolen en masse and includes many personal details of job \napplicants. As a matter of fact, the people who actually applied for a \nsecurity clearance, which is processed by the Office of Personnel \nManagement, the people who fill out these forms fill out extensive \nbackground information, including birth dates, names, telephone \nnumbers, and the like, but it also includes things such as passport \ninformation, Social Security numbers, private identification and \nbackground details, extensive information about background places of \nresidence and addresses, and the names and contact information of close \nfriends and family members. So you can see why there would be concern \nwhen state actors penetrate the network at the Office of Personnel \nManagement to steal information about that background and security \nclearance process. This stolen information could be used not only \nagainst our intelligence officers and military officials but also their \nfamily and friends who may well now be exposed.\n  That same day, last Friday, it was reported that the first Office of \nPersonnel Management data breach--a breach that was initially reported \n2 weeks ago--actually compromised the records of as many as 14 million \ncurrent and former government officials. That is more than three times \nthe original estimate.\n  While our Nation's public servants were having their sensitive \npersonal information stolen, the Democratic leader led nearly all of \nhis colleagues to block sensible, bipartisan legislation which was \nfocused on that specific threat and which would provide for greater \ninformation sharing between the private sector and government in order \nto address this very problem.\n  I am pleased to say that the minority leader was not able to convince \nall Democrats to block this legislation. In fact, seven Democratic \nmembers voted to promote security over partisanship. Good for them for \njoining us in doing that.\n  As I said before, but it is worth noting again, the American people \nhave rejected this idea that the Senate and the Congress should do \nnothing. They did that last November during the election. They made \ncrystal clear that they wanted their elected representatives, whether \nthe House or the Senate, to come here to Washington on their behalf and \nto actually take steps to make their lives better and to work on their \nbehalf, not to use this Chamber for partisan political games.\n  We have heard the accusations in the past. The Democratic leader has \nloudly and routinely criticized this side of the aisle for obstruction. \nBut threatening to block all funding bills unless you get 100 percent \nof what you want, after spending money we don't have and while looking \nat an escalating debt in the tens of trillions of dollars, is, to me, \nthe height of hypocrisy.\n  By pledging to filibuster upcoming appropriations bills, including \nthe Defense appropriations bill, he and his Democratic colleagues have \nmade their priorities very clear. They are willing to jeopardize the \npaychecks and the security of our men and women in uniform so they can \ngive more taxpayer dollars to sprawling bureaucracies such as the IRS \nand the EPA. Unfortunately, the leadership on the other side of the \naisle is using these very same troops who put their lives on the line \nevery day to score a few partisan\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\npoints and to leverage their insatiable appetite for tax dollars. There \nis never enough. There is never enough.\n  I don't know that everyone on that side of the aisle is comfortable \nwith this strategy. I am somewhat encouraged in a strange sense of the \nword by the fact that seven Democrats refused to follow the Democratic \nleader down this path to blocking the cyber security legislation. To \ntheir credit, they voted on the merits of the legislation. But, \nunfortunately, not enough did in order for us to get it considered and \nvoted on.\n  In light of this almost contemporaneous occurrence at the Office of \nPersonnel Management and the recurring daily stories about how cyber \nattacks are stealing personal property, represent an intelligence \nthreat, and are stealing the money of the American people, I hope our \ncolleagues will work with us to do what the American people elected us \nto do, which is to work together to move forward sensible, bipartisan \nlegislation that is important to the country.\n  I hope our friends across the aisle will listen to the American \npeople instead of their misguided leadership. Over the past few months \nunder Republican majorities, this Chamber has demonstrated that we are \nwilling to work across the aisle to get the Senate functioning again \nfor the American people.\n  Do you know what? The irony is that our friends who are now in the \nminority who used to be in the majority--I think they kind of like it \nbecause they actually can offer amendments, they can get votes on \namendments, and they can represent their constituents in this body, \nwhich they came here to do.\n  I hope we can keep the Senate working and avoid this filibuster \nsummer that was touted in one of the newspapers just last week. I know \nthe people of my State expect me to come up here and represent their \ninterests, and I know all of our constituents expect us to do better by \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an \namendment I have to the Defense authorization legislation.\n  Americans who volunteer to defend our country deserve our utmost \nsupport and great credit for their uniquely honorable, difficult, and \nimportant service. We are a safe and free Nation because of their \nbravery and sacrifice. However, as we honor our troops and veterans, we \nhave to remember they don't serve alone. Military families serve too. \nThey make serious career and personal sacrifices on behalf of their \nloved ones so their loved ones can serve our country.\n  Anyone who has served in the military or has been married to a \nservicemember or even attended a military retirement ceremony--I \nactually come from a military family--understands that a successful \nmilitary career depends on the support and sacrifice of those you love \nand those who are in your family. A career in the military frequently \ninvolves frequent moves and long separations for your spouse, which \npresent unique challenges for military families.\n  The service and sacrifice of military families not only deserves \nrecognition and respect, but military families are also a critical \ncomponent of our military readiness. It is difficult for a mother, \nfather, husband or wife serving in the military to focus on defending \nour Nation if they are worried about the well-being of their family at \nhome. Perhaps that is why, in March of this year, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, Gen. Joseph Dunford, who has now been nominated to serve \nas the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that ``a key \nelement in our overall readiness is family readiness. The family \nmembers of our Marines are very much a part of the Marine Corps family. \nTheir sacrifices and support are not taken for granted.''\n  However, it has come to our attention that the current laws and \nregulations fail to fully reflect the sacrifices of our military \nfamilies or the importance of this issue to military readiness.\n  I wish to talk about a specific problem; that is, when a member of \nour military actually gets into criminal trouble. Yet their spouse and \nchildren have to suffer as a result of it.\n  Current law forces military juries to sometimes confront the \nundesirable dilemma of either supporting justice or supporting the \nmilitary family--but not both. In these rare and tragic cases, a jury \nmust choose either to impose a just sentence on a member of our \nmilitary--which of course these cases are rare--who commits a crime, \nbut if the jury imposes a just sentence, this could cause the \nretirement benefits that the family of the military member is counting \non to be taken away, and so it leads to this choice of either giving a \njust or strong sentence and also punish the family who is an innocent \nbystander in all of this or give a weak and unjust sentence to spare \nthe innocent family--but not both.\n  When a jury chooses a just sentence, an innocent family can be left \nwith nothing, and that is wrong. Knowing this, some family members \nchoose not to report a crime out of fear that coming forward will risk \nloss of benefits that a family member helped earn.\n  For these reasons, I am proud that the National Defense Authorization \nAct, as passed by the committee, does include an amendment that I \nintroduced with Senator Gillibrand which could make transitional \nbenefits available to innocent military family members when their \nretirement-eligible servicemember forfeits those benefits due to a \ncourt-martial.\n  I am also pleased that the Defense authorization legislation contains \nsense-of-Congress language that recognizes the valuable service of \nmilitary families and emphasizes the view of the committee that \nmilitary juries should not have to choose between a fair sentence and \nprotecting military families. However, this doesn't go far enough. Our \nwork isn't finished. We must do more to recognize the service of \nmilitary families and to ensure a strong and fair military justice \nsystem.\n  I will briefly talk about the case of Rebecca Sinclair. Rebecca was \nmarried to a career Army officer who served with distinction. She \nmarried him early in his career and supported him as he rose through \nthe ranks to become General. She served alongside him for 27 years. He \nwas at home for a total of 5 years between 2001 and 2012. She had been \na single mother during those five combat deployments when he was \nserving our country.\n  She moved 17 times in 27 years. Her oldest son went to six schools by \nthe time he was in sixth grade. Despite earning a bachelor's and \nmaster's degree, Rebecca's career had been severely limited by the \nconstant moves.\n  She thought this sacrifice was worthy because she was doing it on \nbehalf of her Nation and her family. Because she wasn't able to achieve \nher full earning potential, she was counting on the pay benefits and \nretirement plan she helped her husband earn over 27 years. But then, in \n2012, she watched helplessly as all of this sacrifice, all of this \neffort, and all of this work hung in the balance. Unlike the vast \nmajority of servicemembers who serve their whole career with honor, her \nhusband was charged with 25 counts of misconduct, including: forcible \nsodomy, sexual assault, indecent conduct, making fraudulent claims \nagainst the government, and obstruction of justice.\n  Rebecca was totally innocent of this conduct. Her sons, who were 10 \nand 12 years old, were totally innocent. Yet her husband's actions \nthreatened to leave her with no benefits and no security after 27 years \nof sacrifice, and if he were to be dismissed from the Army, Rebecca and \nher sons would be left with nothing.\n  During his sentencing hearing, Rebecca's husband begged the court to \nallow him to retire at a reduced rank so his family could collect the \nbenefits which, in his words, ``they have earned serving alongside me \nall these years.''\n  Rebecca also made a plea to the court for a sentence that would spare \nher family from being punished for her husband's actions. I think \nRebecca sums it up well in the piece she wrote for the Washington Post \nin 2012:\n\n       For military wives, the options are bad and worse. Stay \n     with an unfaithful husband and keep your family intact; or \n     lose your husband, your family and the financial security \n     that comes with a military salary, pension, health care and \n     housing. Because we move so often, spouses lose years of \n     career advancement. Some of us spend every other year as \n     single parents. We are vulnerable emotionally and \n     financially. Many stay silent out of necessity, not natural \n     passivity.\n\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\n\n  It is time to fix these problems. Saying thank you to the military \nfamilies is not enough. We must ensure that our laws and regulations \nreflect our gratitude to military families and the importance of what \nthey do. They serve our country, too, and they have earned the benefits \nas well. It is not right for a military member to rely on his family to \nhelp earn retirement benefits and then have that individual commit \nmisconduct and the family is punished too.\n  My amendment will fix this problem by recognizing that military \nfamilies serve, too, remove disincentives to report misconduct, and put \nthe sentencing process back in balance. Juries can choose a punishment \nto fit the crime without worry that an innocent family member will \nsuffer as a result. My amendment has been endorsed by 10 veterans \nservice organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment that allows \nthe military justice system to function properly and also makes sure \nthat innocent family members do not suffer and that their service is \nrecognized as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                Protecting Internet Access From Taxation\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to address events from the last \nseveral days, both of which have the potential to reshape the way the \nAmerican people use the Internet for communication and commerce.\n  The first came last week when the other body voted on a bipartisan \nbasis to permanently extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I wrote that \nlaw, which is commonly known as ITFA, along with former Congressman \nChris Cox, in 1998. The Internet Tax Freedom Act is one of the most \npopular tax policies in the country, and I believe it is past time for \nthe Senate to follow the House's lead and send a permanent extension to \nthe President's desk.\n  The second important matter came up yesterday, when a bill called the \nRemote Transaction Parity Act was introduced in the other body. What \nthis proposal offers is a brand-new national sales tax managed by a \nprivatizing, tax-collecting bureaucracy that not a single voter in \nAmerica has approved. I see this online tax hike as a major threat to \nthe Internet that has flourished under the bipartisan Internet Tax \nFreedom Act.\n  I want to address both of these issues briefly today, beginning with \nthe importance of the permanent Internet Tax Freedom law. Ever since \nCongress passed it, it has been an essential tool in helping the \nInternet grow unencumbered by discriminatory taxation. It prohibits the \nkind of discriminatory taxes that some in Congress are too fond of; the \nkind of taxes that I believe will hurt innovation and punish the \nmillions of citizens and businesses that use and depend on the Internet \neach day.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act has saved families in Oregon and across \nAmerica hundreds of dollars a year. That is because without the law, \naccess to the Internet would likely be subject to the same level of \npunishing taxation that is currently imposed on cigarettes and alcohol. \nWe already see that with wireless services not protected by the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, and this area does involve onerous taxes. \nInflicting those taxes on Internet access is a burden the Senate \nabsolutely should not heap on the American people.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has become too reliant on stop-and-go \ngoverning, so the Internet Tax Freedom Act has been extended several \ntimes on a temporary basis. Some Members in the Senate and House want \nto tie the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which saves people money, to a \ncontroversial proposal that will drive up the cost of using the \nInternet the way Americans do today, and that is where the second issue \nI would like to address comes in.\n  The House proposal, called the Remote Transaction Parity Act, has \ntaken a variety of different forms over the years. An older version \nthat died in Congress was called the Marketplace Fairness Act. The idea \nused to be to turn every business that operated online--big or small--\ninto a tax collector for the thousands of tax jurisdictions across the \ncountry. With every new version of this online tax hike bill, we would \nsee a new set of problems crop up. Now the proposal has become even \nbigger and more unwieldy. The new proposal coming from the other body \nwould build an enormous, privatized, tax-collecting bureaucracy, and \nthat new bureaucracy would take a big cut of every online sale before a \nsingle dime of sales tax gets distributed back to the States or local \ncommunities.\n  I will take a minute and talk about how this hurts my home State. My \nhome State has no sales tax, but under this proposal, this murky tax-\ncollecting middle man is going to get involved anytime somebody in \nVirginia, Michigan or California makes a purchase online from an Oregon \ncompany. This proposal would unfairly siphon money away from Oregon. \nYet Oregonians will get nothing in return from these newly empowered \nnational tax collectors. In effect, there would be a new national sales \ntax overseen by a privatized middle man, and that raises serious \nquestions about whether taxpayer dollars should be going to a for-\nprofit tax collector. It could put sensitive data about businesses and \ntheir customers into the crosshairs of hackers and criminals. That \nwould be just about the biggest Federal intrusion into State commerce \nin a long time.\n  The online tax bill also creates a major new hurdle for small \nbusinesses that want to find consumers online. That would be a \nparticularly harsh blow to companies in rural America, rural Oregon, \nand elsewhere. It would suddenly be a whole lot harder to compete with \na retailer in a crowded city when the cost of doing business online \ntakes a jump.\n  Finally, it takes a fundamentally tilted playing field against U.S. \nemployers, and, in effect, makes those employers pay a national sales \ntax. It creates a fundamentally tilted playing field. The Internet \nspans national borders, but sellers from China, Canada, and Europe will \nnot and cannot be subject to this tax, and under this approach, they \nwill profit at the expense of the American consumer and American \nworker.\n  In my view, we have at hand now two radically different pieces of \nlegislation. The first has been on the books now for well over a decade \nand has been hugely valuable in terms of innovation, choice, and \nconsumers. That is the permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, in effect \ntaking what we have had for over a decade and making it permanent. With \nthe permanent approach, we lower costs for consumers and protect the \nInternet as a bulwark for free speech and commerce, promoting American \ncompanies and American ideals. So that is approach No. 1--making \npermanent legislation that has worked since 1998.\n\n  The second approach is the Remote Transaction Parity Act, which would \nraise costs for Americans, hurt small and rural businesses, and punish \nStates such as Oregon that have kept taxes low.\n  In my view, it would be legislative malpractice to tie these two \napproaches together. The path forward for the U.S. Senate should be \nvery clear; that is, to take the permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act \nthat has sailed through the House and, with the ball in our court, pass \nit here. I believe that a permanent law protecting Internet access from \ntaxation is long overdue, and the proposal for an online tax hike \nshould not get in the way.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me now in working for a bipartisan, \npermanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, unencumbered by the kind of \napproach which has been introduced in the House and which creates a \nnational sales tax. Let's reject that and move to pass a permanent \nInternet Tax Freedom Act as soon as possible.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1473, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, at 5 p.m. we will be voting on an \namendment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter. The \namendment would require the Secretary of the Army to maintain at least \n32 brigade combat teams in the Regular and Reserve components of the \nArmy and 28 brigade combat teams in the Army National Guard.\n  Effectively and deliberately, this amendment would prevent the Army \nfrom managing its own force structure, determining how many brigades it \nneeds, how they are disposed in terms of Active, Reserve, and Regular \nforces. In addition, the way the amendment is\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\npaid for, to maintain these additional brigades would be to mandate a \n1-percent pay cut for all Federal civilian employees for 2016 and \n2017--not a pay freeze, a pay cut.\n  The Army does not support this amendment. They need the flexibility \nto manage their forces to respond to the threats as they perceive them \nin the world, to determine where the forces are mechanized, whether \nthey are located in the National Guard or whether they are located in \nthe Regular force. As such, as the Army draws down--and it is on that \ntrajectory because of many issues, some of them budgetary--they would \nhave to totally reexamine their existing force structure and they would \nindeed have to, I think, sacrifice what they think is the most optimal \nforce for a legislative mandate of an arbitrary number of brigades in \nplace. This will create readiness problems because it is one thing to \nhave brigades on paper; it is another to have brigades that are ready \nto deploy, fully trained, fully equipped, fully manned. That would \ncomplicate this process for the Army.\n  So for these reasons, when the amendment is presented at 5 p.m., I \nwill be opposing the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nthat opposition. I think the Army is the most capable to determine its \nforce structure and not by legislative fiat.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the Vitter amendment tries to enforce a \nminimum number of Army brigade combat teams. It seeks to direct the \nU.S. Army to maintain not fewer than 32 brigade combat teams in the \nRegular Army and 28 in the Army National Guard. The Secretary of the \nArmy could not reduce these until he reports to Congress and certifies \nimpacts on operational risk to the national defense strategy and \ninsufficient funds or appropriations. The Secretary of the Army must \nalso report rationale for any proposed reduction of total strength in \nthe Regular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserves. This includes an \noperational analysis that shows continued mission performance given a \nreduction and an assessment of force-mix ratio among all of those \norganizations.\n  Additionally, the Secretary, with the Director of the Army, National \nGuard, or Chief of Army Reserve, must report to Congress at least 90 \ndays before any possible reductions. The report must list remaining \nmajor combat units, missions, unit assignments by installation, and \nproposed BCTs for disestablishment--on and on and on and on.\n  I say to the Senator from Louisiana, we don't do this. We don't tell \nthe Army or the National Guard that they can only have a minimum of \nthis or that and that they can't do certain things. The amendment \nrequires the Army to report manning levels. In principle, I agree with \nthe Senator from Louisiana. The world is less secure. We are facing \nmany threats. We need an Army capable of securing our interests around \nthe world. In fact, last week, decisions were made to deploy more \nforces to Iraq.\n  The amendment is bad policy. The Congress shouldn't attempt to manage \nforces. That is the job of the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of \nStaff. Our job is to authorize and fund. The key is giving Army \nleadership the flexibility to manage the total Army force given the \nplanned drawdown. In fiscal year 2016, the Army end strength is being \nreduced and funding is planned to be adjusted accordingly.\n  The cost to maintain the total Army at 490,000 for 1 year is about \n$2.4 billion. Of course, the Senator's amendment does not have any \nindication where that $2.4 billion would come from.\n  If enacted, the amendment could result in a Regular Army of ``tiered \nreadiness.'' The Army would have a force of 490,000 with a budget for \n475,000. We don't want a ``hollow Army'' as we had in the 1970s.\n  So I urge my colleague from Louisiana, the sponsor of this amendment, \nto devote his energies and efforts to the repeal of sequestration. That \nis what is forcing these decisions to be made by the Army, which, in my \nview and the view of our military leaders, is putting the lives of the \nmen and women at greater risk.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to finish my statement first, and I appreciate \nthat.\n  So I oppose the amendment on the fact that we do not have the funding \nhere to maintain the Army at the level that both he and I would prefer. \nIf we do repeal sequestration, then there will be sufficient funding \nfor maintaining the Army, the National Guard, and the Army Reserves at \nthe level the Senator from Louisiana strongly advocates and I also \nadvocate.\n  I will be glad to respond to a question from the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Senator for yielding. I would just ask \nwhether the underlying bill doesn't do exactly the same sort of thing \nin other categories, such as minimum numbers of aircraft carriers in \nthe Navy, such as minimum numbers of certain key equipment in the Air \nForce, which I agree with. But I don't see any difference between those \nprovisions of the underlying bill and what this provision would \nconstitute with regard to a key element of Army brigade combat teams. \nThat is the first question.\n  The second question is, Did the Senator know that in the resubmitted \nversion of the amendment, there is a noncontroversial sense-of-the-\nSenate regarding an offset for this to be put forward?\n  Finally, I would certainly agree with the Senator about trying to fix \nthe top-line numbers and the top-line situation with regard to \nsequestration, and, as I am sure he knows, I support that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I respond to my friend to say that what \nwe have authorized, as the Senator from Louisiana clearly described, is \nwhat the services have said they need to do their mission--and based on \ntheir requirements, not the view of what my requirements are. So I \nthink the Senator's proposal is very different from what he described.\n  Again, there is sufficient funding for everything we have authorized \nin the bill. What this amendment is authorizing in the bill would \nrequire an additional $2.4 billion to be authorized out of the budget \nthat was set by the Budget Committee, which would then mean reductions \nin other areas, as I am sure the Senator appreciates, that we \nauthorized to the budget numbers as a result of the Budget Committee's \nallocation for defense.\n  So I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his continued support of \nthe men and women in the military, especially the bases in Louisiana as \nwell as around the world. He is an advocate for the men and women who \nare serving, and I appreciate his continued dedication to their welfare \nand benefit. We just have an honest disagreement on whether this \namendment is appropriate in our management of the armed services.\n  I thank the Senator. We have a disagreement on the amendment. We will \nvote on it, as he requested. He requested not having a tabling motion. \nHe asked if we could consider his amendment, if we could have it not be \na tabling motion, and I am glad to accommodate the Senator.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent to start \nthe vote now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 1473, as further modified, offered by the Senator from Louisiana, \nMr. Vitter.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, on Thursday, Pope Francis will \nofficially release a historic encyclical on the environment. An \nencyclical is a personal message from the Pope to Catholic bishops and \nthe 1.2 billion Catholics around the world on a topic that he feels \nrequires urgent attention. It is an opportunity for the Pope to bring \ntogether accumulated teachings in a comprehensive way. This will be \nonly Pope Francis's second papal missive, and it has garnered enough \nattention that the conservative Heartland Institute traveled to the \nVatican this spring to respectfully inform the Pope that there is no \nglobal warming crisis.\n  Earlier this week, my colleague Senator Inhofe agreed with the \nHeartland Institute and told them that Pope Francis should ``stay with \nhis job and we'll stay with ours.'' Well, I disagree with Senator \nInhofe. Pope Francis is doing his job, but it is Republicans in this \nChamber who are not doing theirs.\n  To those critics who say that Pope Francis shouldn't be speaking out \non this, I will give them a very simple history lesson. Pope Francis is \nnot the first to speak out on climate change and environmental \nprotection. He will join a chorus of previous pontiffs who drew \nattention to the crisis of climate change and its impact on people, \nespecially the poor and the children of our planet.\n  In 1971, Pope Paul VI warned that human actions that harm nature may \nmake the future intolerable. Pope John Paul II first raised the \ngreenhouse effect as a moral issue in his landmark 1990 World Day of \nPeace message. Two decades later, Pope Benedict XVI shined a light on \nenvironmental refugees in his World Day of Peace message and committed \nthe Vatican to going carbon neutral, including installing a massive \nsolar panel energy system on one of the largest buildings in the \nVatican.\n  As the leader of more than 1 billion Catholics around the world, many \nof whom are suffering from the worst consequences of global warming--\ndisease, displacement, poverty--it is the Pope's responsibility to \nspeak out on behalf of the people he leads. And that is exactly what he \nwill be calling all of us to do.\n  The same people who want to deny Pope Francis's right to speak out on \nclimate change are the same people who deny the science of it. But our \nunderstanding of human influence on climate change rests on 150 years \nof wide-ranging scientific observations and research, and it is \ninformed by what we see today with our own eyes and measured by our own \nhands.\n  Here is the reality. Global temperatures are warming, glaciers are \nmelting, sea levels are rising, extreme downpours and weather events \nare increasing, the ocean is becoming more acidic, and last year was \nthe warmest year on record. Increasing temperatures increase the risk \nof bad air days, in turn increasing the risk of asthma attacks and \nworse for people with lung disease. We have a public health crisis.\n  We are already feeling the cost of climate disruption. The Government \nAccountability Office added climate change to its 2013 high-risk list \nand found that climate change ``presents a significant financial risk \nto the Federal Government.'' GAO could just have easily said it \npresents a significant financial risk for all of America. But the \nUnited States is not tackling this climate change alone. Efforts are \nunderway in countries all around the world. We are seeing academies of \nscience in country after country all coming to the same conclusion.\n  What can we do here in the United States to answer the call of the \nPope? Here is what we can do. We can make sure the wind and the solar \ntax credits do not expire. That is what is happening in this Congress. \nWe can continue this incredible revolution in wind and solar and other \nrenewable sources. That is going to die in this Congress unless we \nrenew them.\n  We can ensure there is a dramatic increase that continues in the fuel \neconomy standards of the vehicles we drive--the cars, the SUVs, the \ntrucks--that dramatically reduces greenhouse gases. We can ensure when \nPresident Obama propounds his clean powerplant rules, which will reduce \nby 30 percent the amount of greenhouse gases going up into the \natmosphere by the year 2030, that they are not repealed on the Senate \nFloor.\n  We are the greatest innovation country in the history of the world. \nScience and technology are the answer to our prayers. They are going to \ngive our country the ability to give the leadership and hope to the \nrest of the world when we answer the prayer of Pope Francis. The \npoorest in the world are going to be those who are most adversely \naffected by the richest countries in the world.\n  We can, in fact, save all of creation by engaging in massive job \ncreation--the new vehicles we drive, the new energy technologies we \ncreate, the new technologies that will reduce the amount of greenhouse \ngases going up from powerplants. We did it once with the Clean Air Act \nof 1990, and we can do it again.\n  So while Pope Francis preaches to the world, the world turns to us \nfor leadership. We cannot preach temperance from a barstool. We cannot \ntell the rest of the world they should change their habits unless we \ntake the leadership in creating the new technologies that we deploy \nhere and then see deployed around the rest of the world.\n  We can transform the way energy is in fact produced across this \nentire planet within the 21st century. That is what the Pope is asking \nus to do--not to sacrifice but to innovate, not to give up but to \ninvest in those technologies that will transform this planet.\n  President Kennedy called upon us in 1961 to put a man on the moon by \ninvesting in new metals and new propulsion technologies, so that we \ncould ensure that the Soviet Union did not impose its communistic \nregime across the entire planet. We invented the new technologies for \npeaceful purposes. And when our astronauts stepped foot on the moon, \nthat American flag that flew was the return on investment of that \ngeneration. This generation of Americans is now being asked to make the \nsame kind of commitment to a new generation of energy technologies that \ncan reduce greenhouse gases dramatically, give leadership for the rest \nof the world, and answer the call from Pope Francis.\n  Those who say it is not Pope Francis's business to speak out on\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\nsomething that is obviously created by human beings and that can be \nsolved by human beings are wrong. It is his place. He challenges us to \nput on the books of the laws of this country the kinds of standards \nthat unleash the green energy revolution, that create jobs by the \nmillions, while ensuring that we reduce the greenhouse gases going up \nand endangering the planet.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to be recognized, and I say in \nconclusion that it is just an incredible moment when the Pope speaks on \nan issue of this importance. I am not saying action will be easy, but \nif we harness the ambition of the Moon landing, the scope of the Clean \nAir Act, and the moral imperative of Pope Francis's encyclical, we can \nleave the world a better place than we found it. We have the tools to \ndo it. Now we need to forge the political will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4195-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4195-S4196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this week the Senate will complete its work \non the National Defense Authorization Act by holding a final vote. The \nNational Defense Authorization Act is one of the most important bills \nCongress considers each and every year. I think this will mark the 54th \nconsecutive year in which Congress has passed a Defense authorization \nbill, recognizing its importance to America's national security \ninterests.\n  The bill authorizes funding for our Nation's military and our \nnational defense, ensuring that our soldiers get paid, their equipment \nand training is funded, and that our commanders have the resources they \nneed to confront the threats that are facing our Nation.\n  In particular, this bill ensures our air men and women maintain \nreadiness levels and receive the training they need to safely return \nhome after protecting our national security abroad.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we are proud to host the 28th Bomb Wing \nat Ellsworth Air Force Base, one of our Nation's two B-1 bomber bases. \nThe B-1s are a critical part of the U.S. bomber fleet, providing our \nmilitary with critical long-range strike capabilities. These bombers \nhave the highest payload capacity, the fastest maximum speed, and the \nlowest cost per flying hour of any bomber in our fleet.\n  Bombers from the 28th Bomb Wing have played a key role in the armed \nconflicts the United States has engaged in over the past 20 years. \nWhatever the mission, from supporting NATO operations in Kosovo to \nconducting operations in Afghanistan, B-1s from Ellsworth have been in \nthe thick of the action.\n  During Operation Odyssey Dawn, B-1s from Ellsworth launched from \nSouth Dakota flew halfway around the world to Libya, dropped their \nbombs, and returned home all in a single mission. This marked the first \ntime in history that B-1s launched combat missions from the United \nStates to strike targets overseas.\n  After 8 years of review, the Air Force and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration recently finalized the expansion of the Powder River \nTraining Complex, an airspace training range that serves as the primary \ntraining space for Ellsworth B-1s, as well as the B-52 bombers based at \nMinot Air Force Base in North Dakota.\n  The expanded training range will be the largest training airspace \nover the continental United States. It will save Ellsworth up to $23 \nmillion a year by reducing the need for the B-1 bombers to commute for \ntraining to other States, such as Nevada and Utah. In an era of tighter \nbudgets, measures such as this, which increase readiness while saving \ncosts, are essential.\n  I was pleased to work with the Air Force and the FAA on this critical \nexpansion, and I am hopeful our air men and women will be able to start \nusing this range for large-force training exercises in the near future.\n  In addition to ensuring our military has the resources necessary to \nmaintain our B-1 bombers, the bill authorizes full funding for one of \nthe Air Force's top acquisition priorities--the Long Range Strike \nBomber, which represents the future of our bomber fleet. This aircraft \nis scheduled to come on line by the mid-2020s and is just one of many \nacquisition priorities necessary to defend our Nation against future \nthreats.\n  Our Nation's defense budget must consider not only the enemies we \nface today but also those we will face tomorrow.\n  In addition to the critical funding this bill authorizes, this year's \nbill is particularly important because it contains a number of reforms \nthat will expand the resources available to our military men and women \nand strengthen our national security.\n  For starters, this bill tackles waste and inefficiency at the \nDepartment of Defense. It targets $10 billion in unnecessary spending \nand redirects those funds to military priorities such as funding for \naircraft and weapons systems and modernization of Navy vessels.\n  The bill also implements sweeping reforms to the military's outdated \nacquisitions process by removing bureaucracy and expediting \ndecisionmaking, which will significantly improve the military's ability \nto access the technology and the equipment it needs.\n  The act also implements a number of reforms to the Pentagon's \nadministrative functions. Over the past decade, Army Headquarters staff \nhas increased by 60 percent. Yet, in recent years, the Army has been \ncutting brigade combat teams. From 2001 to 2012, the Department of \nDefense's civilian workforce grew at five times the rate of our Active-\nDuty military personnel. There is something wrong with that picture. \nPrioritizing bureaucracy at the expense of our preparedness and our \nActive-Duty personnel is not an acceptable use of resources.\n  The Defense authorization bill we are considering changes the \nemphasis at the Department of Defense from administration to \noperations, which will help ensure that our military personnel receive \nthe training they need and that they are ready to meet any threats that \narise.\n  The bill also overhauls our military retirement system. The current \nmilitary retirement system limits retirement benefits to soldiers who \nserve for 20 years or more--which doesn't apply, by the way, to 83 \npercent of those who have served, including many veterans of the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense bill replaces this system with a \nmodern retirement system that would extend retirement benefits to 75 \npercent of our servicemembers.\n  This bill is the product of a bipartisan process, and it received \nbipartisan support in committee. I believe it came out of the Armed \nServices Committee by a vote of 20 to 6. This makes it particularly \ndisappointing that the President is attempting to hijack this bill for \npolitical purposes.\n  Despite the fact that this legislation authorizes spending at the \nPresident's budget request--his budget request--of $612 billion, the \nPresident is threatening to veto this legislation if Republicans don't \nagree to provide more funding for agencies such as the IRS and EPA, and \nhe has tried to convince Democrats here in the Senate to abandon \nbipartisan efforts on this bill and back up a Presidential veto.\n  Holding up funding authorization for our troops is reckless, and it \nis irresponsible. And it is flat wrong for the President of the United \nStates to attempt to hijack this bill not because he disagrees with the \nbill itself but because he wants to make sure his pet projects receive \nthe funding he wants.\n  At this very moment, threats are multiplying around the world. \nRussian aggression is on the rise. ISIS fighters are carving a trail of \nslaughter across the Middle East. Iran is working to acquire a nuclear \nweapon. Now more than ever, we cannot afford to be holding up funding \nfor our military, especially for partisan political purposes.\n  Democrats and Republicans have had a chance to make their voices \nheard on this bill, and our joint efforts have resulted in strong, \nbipartisan legislation that will ensure that our military is prepared \nto meet the threats of the 21st century. The Senate should pass this \nbill this week and the President should sign it to make sure our troops \nhave the equipment and the resources they need to do the most important \nthing we can do as a nation, and that is defend our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to touch on an issue that I think \ndoes not get the attention it deserves. My view is that a nation is \njudged not by how many billionaires and millionaires it has but by how \nit treats the most vulnerable people among us. If we look at the \ngreatness of a nation in that respect, the sad truth is that the United \nStates today does not get particularly high marks. That is true not \nonly in the way we treat our children, but it is also true in the way \nwe treat our seniors.\n  Yesterday, at my request, the Government Accountability Office--the \nGAO--released a new report that found that nearly 4 million seniors in \nour country are what they call food insecure. That means these seniors \ndo not know where their next meal is coming from. What that means is \nthat nearly 4 million American seniors may skip dinner tonight because \nthey do not have enough money to buy food today.\n  Every day in my State of Vermont and around this country, millions of \nseniors have to juggle with their limited budgets their ability to buy \nfood, their ability to buy medicine, or, in the wintertime, their \nability to keep themselves warm in their homes. Those are not the \nchoices seniors in this country should be forced to make.\n  There is a myth out there pushed by corporate and moneyed interests \nsuggesting that seniors in this country are doing just great, that all \nseniors are comfortably middle class. But those people who hold those \nviews have not looked at the reality of life for many seniors in this \ncountry. The truth is--and this is really a shocking truth--that 20 \npercent of seniors in America live on an average income of $7,600 a \nyear. Between us, I don't know how anybody can live on $7,600 a year, \nlet alone older people who need more medicine and more health care.\n  The GAO recently found that more than half of all older American \nhouseholds have absolutely no retirement savings. So we are looking at \nfamilies where people 55 or 60 have zero saved for retirement because \nfor many years they have been working for wages that have been totally \ninadequate, preventing them from putting money into the bank.\n  Many seniors obviously have worked their whole lives. They have \nraised kids. But, sadly, many of them do not have the resources they \nneed to live a secure retirement.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, we have seniors in this country who are \ngoing hungry. The GAO report found that fewer than 10 percent of low-\nincome seniors who needed a home-delivered meal in 2013 received one. \nIn other words, what we have created here in Congress over the years \nare good and effective programs, such as the Meals on Wheels program, \nthat provide nutritious food to the most vulnerable people in this \ncountry--seniors who cannot leave their homes; yet, what the GAO report \ndiscovered is that fewer than 10 percent of low-income seniors who \nneeded a home-delivered meal in 2013 received one.\n  I have gone to many senior citizen locations around this country, and \nI know that many senior citizens enjoy coming out and getting a \ncongregate meal. They go to senior centers, and they are able to \nsocialize with their friends. They get a good and nutritious meal at a \nreasonable price. Unfortunately, fewer than 10 percent of low-income \nseniors who need a congregate meal receive one.\n  The need, in fact, is growing amongst seniors. GAO found that a \nhigher percentage of low-income seniors are food insecure now--24 \npercent in 2013--than were in 2008, when the number was 19 percent. So \nthe problem is becoming more acute. One in three low-income seniors \naged 60 to 69 is food insecure; yet, fewer than 5 percent receive a \nmeal at home and fewer than 5 percent receive a congregate meal in a \nsenior center.\n  GAO found that seniors with a disability, minorities, and older \nadults living on less than $10,000 a year were even more likely to be \nhungry. Overwhelmingly, those seniors are not getting the help they \nneed.\n  The report also found that 16 million older adults from all income \nlevels report difficulties with one or more daily activity, such as \nshopping, bathing, or getting dressed. More than two-thirds of these \nseniors do not get the help they need.\n  Many of the programs designed to provide support to seniors--in terms \nof Meals on Wheels, in terms of the Congregate Meal Program, and in \nterms of a variety of other programs--are funded by the Older Americans \nAct. The Older Americans Act was first passed by Congress in 1965, \nwhich is the same year Medicare and Medicaid were passed. This year, \nall three programs are celebrating their 50th anniversary.\n  I requested this study to see how seniors have been faring in recent \nyears. GAO reported that while the number of older adults in America \nhas increased from 56 to 63 million Americans, the Older Americans Act \nfunding provided to States has gone down since 2009. In other words, \nthe need has gone up, but the funding has gone down. At current funding \nlevels, less than two-tenths percent of Federal discretionary spending \nis going to achieve its original purpose.\n  Common sense tells us that putting money into prevention and keeping \nseniors healthy in the end run not only prevents human suffering, but \nit also saves us money. If a senior is malnourished, that senior is \nmore likely to fall, break a hip, end up in the hospital, at huge \nexpense for Medicaid and Medicare. It makes sense to me, it seems, that \nif we fund adequately this important program which keeps seniors \nhealthy, independent, and out of hospitals and nursing homes--that is \nwhat we should be doing. That is why I sent a letter to my colleagues \non the Senate Appropriations Committee calling for a 12-percent \nincrease in funding for the Older Americans Act programs, such as the \nnutrition programs. Thirty-two colleagues joined me on that letter. I \nhope that when we receive the funding level for the Older Americans Act \nthis year, we will see an increase on these important programs. We \nshould not be giving more tax breaks to those who don't need them. \nInstead, we should be expanding nutrition programs and other services \nfor seniors.\n  I also encourage my colleagues to support the bill reauthorizing the \nOlder Americans Act, S. 192, and I look forward to working with the \nPresiding Officer to reauthorize and expand these critical programs for \nseniors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4196-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4196-S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOLY GHOST UKRAINIAN CATHOLIC \n                                 CHURCH\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Holy Ghost Ukrainian \nCatholic Church as it celebrates its 100th anniversary. Holy Ghost \nUkrainian Church was founded in Akron, OH by a small group of faithful \nand passionate Ukrainian Christians.\n  In 1915, the Holy Ghost Ukrainian Catholic Church began when two \norganizations came together to create a place where Ukrainian \nimmigrants could practice the beliefs and traditions they cherished in \nthe new country they called home. The parish has grown and prospered \nover the years, and continues to flourish at its original location at \n1866 Brown Street, offering a center for spiritual and cultural life to \nAkron and surrounding northeast Ohio communities.\n  On June 21, 2015, Father Vsevolod Schevchuk, ``Father Sal'', and \nparishioners will welcome honored guests His Beatitude Sviatoslav \nSherchuk, Patriarch, and The Most Reverend Bohdan J. Danylo, Bishop, of \nthe Ukrainian Catholic Church to their Hierarchical Divine Liturgy and \ncelebration dinner. The congregation will join together on this day to \ncelebrate the anniversary of the church, their Ukrainian cultural\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\ntraditions, and all that this parish has meant to the community \nthroughout the years.\n  With more than 50,000 Ukrainian Americans in Ohio, cultural and \nreligious ties remain strong within the community and between Ohio and \nUkraine. As cochair of the U.S. Senate Ukrainian Caucus, I have had the \nprivilege of working with the Ukrainian community and know how strongly \nconnected they remain with family and friends overseas. I am certain \nthe continued engagement of Ukrainians in the United States is making a \ndifference in the efforts for the independence of Ukraine. I join the \nmembers of the Holy Ghost parish and Ukrainians throughout the United \nStates who continue to pray and work toward a peaceful resolution to \nthe situation in Ukraine. I am proud to stand with Ukrainian Americans \nand the Ukrainian people as they further their resolve and commitment \nto maintaining a free and independent Ukraine.\n  Mr. President, I would like to personally extend my congratulations \nto Holy Ghost Ukrainian Catholic Church on 100 years of faith, service, \nand worship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4197-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PETER BLAIR\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Peter Blair has been a highly valued and \ntrusted member of my staff from the time I took office in 2011. He was \npart of the team that did the heavy lifting of getting the Senate \noffice off the ground and was instrumental in establishing the systems, \nstructure, and disciplines necessary to support the Senate office and \nserve the people of Utah.\n  Peter has filled a wide range of roles and responsibilities in our \noffice, from administrative duties to correspondence and constituent \nservices, from strategic relationships and outreach to the vital role \nof handling our veterans' affairs. He has approached each of these with \na firm commitment to excellence, an eye toward challenging the status \nquo, and a determination to deliver an experience that is meaningful \nand memorable.\n  Assigning something to Peter is not only to consider it done but to \nknow that it will be done right. His commitment to serve the office at \nanytime, day or night, and in whatever way is needed is extraordinary. \nHe has been vital to the office running on all cylinders. Late night \nvotes, townhalls, serving constituents and veterans, and coordinating \nwith the hardworking people who really make the Senate function, were \nall part of a day's work for Peter.\n  Peter has a unique and innovative way of looking at tasks, projects \nand long-term opportunities--one I wish more people in Washington would \nembrace. Peter is a servant leader--a street-smart and savvy servant, \nwho understands strategy, structure, and discipline and is simply \ndetermined to deliver regardless of circumstances or setbacks.\n  Peter is a forever learner. His quest to find a better way to do \nthings and his inner drive to make a difference has had an impact on \nevery aspect of my office. He is a trusted colleague who is more \nconcerned about getting things done and done right than he is about who \ngets credit. Ronald Reagan often made the comment, ``There is no limit \nto what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the \ncredit.'' I would add that there is no limit to Peter's impact and \nwhere he can go in the future, because he doesn't care who gets the \ncredit.\n  It has been a blessing for me, my family, and my staff to have Peter \nas a member of our team. Having Peter around, from the early days of my \nservice in the Senate, has given me great confidence and peace of mind. \nNothing has been better than knowing that the moment an assignment was \ngiven to Peter it had begun, would soon be done, and above all, be done \nright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4197-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RYAN McKEON\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Ryan McKeon has served as my chief advisor on \neconomic policy for the past several years and has been an \nindispensable member of my staff. The old saying, ``still water runs \ndeep,'' is a good metaphor for Ryan. Many on Capitol Hill race about \ntrying to call attention to themselves or create a torrent of activity \nto prove how smart or important they are. Ryan, on the other hand, has \na style that is indicative of the depth of his substance. He is \nconcerned with properly informing, not impressing, and is less \ninterested in entertaining than he is in engaging in deeper dialogue on \nissues that matter.\n  I have trusted Ryan's wisdom and keen insight on a wide range of \npolicy issues and have always had complete confidence in his thorough \nbriefings and recommendations. He has been the driving force behind an \nexpanding and more meaningful economic policy reach from my office.\n  Ryan is very perceptive. His understanding of core disciplines, \nprinciples, and policies, as well as the nuances and subtleties of his \nissue areas, has been priceless. Ryan is aware of not only the \nprinciple and policy ramifications of congressional business but the \nlikely results and down-stream effect of the decisions made. Ryan's \nstillness allows him to present information in a concise, clear manner \nthat informs me of vital data and impact points while filtering out the \nnoise and chatter typical of Washington, DC, debate.\n  Everyone in my office knows they can approach Ryan to have him run \nthe numbers on any piece of legislation. He understands the big picture \nand regularly worked in tandem with our communications team to ensure \nour messaging was congruent with what we had introduced legislatively. \nRyan has worked well with other offices, as well as with academics and \nhighly specialized policy experts outside of my office. While so much \nof Ryan's work is centered in serious issues and tough topics, he also \nknows the value of some well placed humor, a wry comment, and a little \nlevity.\n  Ryan is committed to adding value and making a difference. I greatly \nappreciate what he has done for me, for the people of Utah, and for our \nnation. There is a confidence that comes of stillness, a strength that \ncomes from serenity, and quiet determination that comes from depth. \nRyan McKeon runs deep, and I am confident his influence will continue \nto ripple and roll on in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4197-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4197-S4198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOXIE SCHOOL INTEGRATION\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nresilience, determination, and courage of the community of Hoxie, AR \nfor its leadership in school desegregation and the foundation it laid \nfor integration across the country.\n  This year, the community is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the \nfirst day of school for the African-American students who became known \nas the Hoxie 21.\n  This small northeast Arkansas community voluntarily integrated its \nschools in the summer of 1955 in response to the Supreme Court case \nBrown v. Board of Education. The reasoning for the school board and \nSuperintendent Kunkel Edward Vance's decision was simple; integration \nwas ``morally right in the sight of God.''\n  On July 11, 1955, African-American students made history in Hoxie and \nhelped build the momentum for integration.\n  This unprecedented move began with a smooth transition, and the \nstudents were welcomed into the school. The news of a small town in the \nSouth desegregating peacefully caught the attention of Life magazine, \nand in its July 1955 issue the story captured the attention of the \nworld. Unfortunately, the media attention brought with it an avalanche \nof negativity despite the positive and peaceful progression.\n  This action was unpopular in the South and while segregationists \nflooded the community in protest, families of the Hoxie 21 and school \nleaders stood their ground and with great faith persevered against the \ninequality.\n  The Hoxie School Board fought back by filing suit on the \nsegregationists, charging the segregationists with trespassing on \nschool property, threatening picket lines, organizing boycotts and \nintimidating school officials. Citizens of Hoxie of all races \npeacefully waited for a resolution, and with encouragement from the \nNAACP were able to stand up against the verbal and physical threats \nfrom the segregationists. Their patience and fortitude was\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\nsoon rewarded. In September, the FBI became involved in the \ninvestigation. Two months later, Federal District Judge Thomas C. \nTrimble ruled that segregationists prevented integration in Hoxie, and \nissued a temporary restraining order against them. In December, a \npermanent ban against the segregationists was issued and later upheld \nby the Supreme Court, freeing the school of their influence. It was the \nfirst mediation in support of a school district trying to comply with \nBrown v. Board of Education--a momentous moment for the country and a \nvictory for integration.\n  This decision was instrumental in desegregating the entire country \nand was a major victory for the 14th Amendment. This demonstrates that \nchange only comes when people stand up for what is morally right.\n  I congratulate the town of Hoxie and the Hoxie 21 on this milestone. \nI am encouraged by your dedication to share this history and positive \nmessage. I thank the Hoxie 21 and the community for their bravery in \nthe face of adversity. It is an honor to tell your story and educate \npeople about your struggle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4198-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HAROLD E. WARD\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, when author Tom Brokaw called \nAmericans who came of age during World War II the ``greatest \ngeneration,'' he had in mind remarkable people like Harold E. Ward, who \npassed away last week. Mr. Ward lived nearly six decades in Lee, NH, \nwhere neighbors knew him for his kindness and warm smile. But few knew \nthat during his 94 years he bore witness to some of the most profound \nevents and transformations of 20th and 21st century America.\n  In his teens, during the Great Depression, he experienced dire \npoverty and frequent hunger, enduring what he called ``missed meal \ncramps.'' As an African American, he endured the slights and \nsegregation of Jim Crow, including when he joined the Navy 2 years \nbefore the United States entered World War II. Mr. Ward had graduated \nfrom trade school as a skilled electrician, but the few African \nAmericans serving in the Navy were routinely assigned to menial \npositions such as stewards for ship officers. It was only later, after \ndesegregation of the military, that he became a cook.\n  On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, he was on duty aboard the USS \nSan Francisco at Pearl Harbor. From his battle station, he witnessed \nthe most devastating foreign attack ever carried out against our \nmilitary on U.S. soil.\n  That was Harold Ward's first taste of combat but far from the last. \nEleven months later, serving in the Pacific during the Battle of \nGuadalcanal, he survived numerous wounds from shell fragments and \nwatched a close friend die next to him. He was awarded the Purple \nHeart. But, referring to shrapnel permanently embedded in his legs, he \nlater said, ``I wear my medals on my body.'' Recalling the prejudice he \nfaced as a Black sailor, he told a local newspaper: ``You look back on \nit, and despite the fact there was such a separation of people, all the \nblood ran red.''\n  Harold Ward served two decades in the Navy, retiring as first class \npetty officer commissary steward. He went on to use his culinary skills \nat restaurants in Exeter and Durham, NH, including his own restaurant, \nHarold's Place, and also worked as a part-time police officer in Lee.\n  Mr. Ward was a 55-year member, past commander, and chaplain of \nAmerican Legion Post 67 in Newmarket, NH, and a founding member and \npast commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10676 in Lee. He lived \nto witness the end of legal segregation, the triumphs of the civil \nrights movement, and the election and reelection of an African-American \nPresident.\n  Across the decades, Mr. Ward was a gifted mentor to countless young \npeople who crossed his path. Harold and his wife Virginia treated these \nyoung men and women as members of the Ward family, giving them love, \ncounsel, and a place to call home.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``Life's most urgent and \npersistent question is: What are you doing for others?'' Across his \neventful life, Harold Ward answered that question in powerful ways, \nincluding service to his country, to his community, and to anyone he \nencountered who needed a helping hand or a wise word.\n  Harold was predeceased by his beloved wife Virginia and two sons, \nBruce and Theodore. He is remembered with much love by daughters Linda \nand Harriet and son Michael. The Lee community is mourning his passing, \nas are countless people whose lives he touched. On behalf of the United \nStates Senate and a grateful nation, I thank Harold Ward for his many \nyears of dedicated service. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4198-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4198-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4198-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4198-S4199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nPROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED \n     STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA \n           CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--PM 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \npapers; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for \nCooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea Concerning Peaceful Uses of \nNuclear Energy (the ``Agreement'').

It provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with the ROK based on a mutual commitment \nto nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\nthe transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, \ninformation, and technology for nuclear research and nuclear power \nproduction. It would not permit the transfer of Restricted Data, and \nsensitive nuclear technology or technology or information that is not \nin the public domain concerning fabrication of nuclear fuel containing \nplutonium could only be transferred if specifically provided by an \namendment to the proposed Agreement or a separate agreement. Any \nspecial fissionable material transferred could only be in the form of \nlow enriched uranium, with two exceptions: small quantities of material \nfor use as samples; or for other specified applications such as use in \nloading and operation of fast reactors or the conduct of fast reactor \nexperiments. The proposed Agreement would also obligate the United \nStates to endeavor to take such actions as may be necessary and \nfeasible to ensure a reliable supply of low enriched uranium fuel to \nthe ROK, similar to terms contained in other recent civil nuclear \ncooperation agreements.\n  The proposed Agreement would also establish a new standing High-Level \nBilateral Commission (HLBC) to be led by the Deputy Secretary of Energy \nfor the Government of the United States of America and the Vice \nMinister of Foreign Affairs for the Government of the ROK. The purpose \nof the HLBC is to facilitate peaceful nuclear and strategic cooperation \nbetween the parties and ongoing dialogue regarding areas of mutual \ninterest in civil nuclear energy, including the civil nuclear fuel \ncycle.\n  The proposed Agreement will have an initial term of 20 years and \nwould renew for one additional period of 5 years unless either party \ngives written notice at least 2 years prior to its expiration that it \ndoes not want to renew the proposed Agreement. The proposed Agreement \nalso requires the parties to consult as soon as possible after the \nseventeenth anniversary of its entry into force to decide whether to \npursue an extension of the proposed Agreement. In the event of \ntermination of the proposed Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions \nand controls will continue in effect as long as any nuclear material, \nmoderator material, byproduct material, equipment, or component subject \nto the proposed Agreement remains in the territory of the party \nconcerned or under its jurisdiction or control anywhere, or until such \ntime as the parties agree that, in the case of nuclear material or \nmoderator material, such items are no longer usable for any nuclear \nactivity relevant from the point of view of international safeguards or \nhave become practically irrecoverable, or in the case of equipment, \ncomponents, or byproduct material, such items are no longer usable for \nnuclear purposes.\n  The ROK has a strong track record on nonproliferation and its \ngovernment has consistently reiterated its commitment to \nnonproliferation. The ROK is a party to the Treaty on the Non-\nproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has an International Atomic Energy \nAgency safeguards agreement and Additional Protocol in force, is a \nmember of the four multilateral nonproliferation export control regimes \n(Missile Technology Control Regime, Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia \nGroup, and Nuclear Suppliers Group, for which it served as Chair in \n2003-2004 and is scheduled to do so again in 2015-2016), and is an \nactive participant in the Proliferation Security Initiative. A more \ndetailed discussion of the ROK's civil nuclear program and its nuclear \nnonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export \npolicies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and in two classified \nannexes to the NPAS submitted to you separately. As noted above, the \nDirector of National Intelligence will provide an addendum to the NPAS \ncontaining a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of the \nROK with respect to nuclear-related matters.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \ndepartments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have \ndetermined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute \nan unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, \nI have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and \nurge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session \nreview provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous \nsession review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, June 16, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4199-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:09 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 728.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine memorializing the President of the United \n     States and Congress of the United States to require expansion \n     of fish hatchery operations; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                            House Paper 933\n\n       Whereas, the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, is a salmon \n     found in the north Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow \n     into the north Atlantic Ocean, and the fish has historically \n     been an important economic asset to the State of Maine; and\n       Whereas, the major rivers of the State once ran thick with \n     salmon traveling upstream to spawn; and\n       Whereas, salmon populations have been reduced to nearly \n     undetectable numbers in most rivers in Maine; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government has designated the Atlantic \n     salmon as an endangered species; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government spends millions of dollars \n     annually to restore the species with no significant success; \n     and\n       Whereas, there are specific hatchery operations that can \n     improve upon the current results; and\n       Whereas, a significant number of salmon originating in \n     Maine are being harvested in a commercial fishery off the \n     west coast of Greenland; and\n       Whereas, this fishery is a major obstacle to the \n     restoration of salmon in Maine rivers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people we represent, take this opportunity to respectfully \n     request that the President and the United States Congress \n     direct the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service to expand hatchery \n     operations to rivers in Maine by partnering with the State \n     and with the many non-government organizations that are \n     focused on restoring Atlantic salmon to their historic natal \n     rivers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, urge that additional \n     resources be made available to the United States State \n     Department that would assist its efforts through the North \n     Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization convention to help \n     with the curtailment or suspension of the wild Atlantic \n     salmon fishery off the west coast of Greenland; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H. Obama, President of the United \n     States, to the President of the United States Senate, to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and to \n     each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-38. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan calling on the President of the United States and \n     the Congress of the United States to direct the Army Corps of \n     Engineers to fully support efforts to determine the best \n     long-term solution for preventing Asian carp from entering \n     the Great Lakes and to move decisively to implement a \n     solution; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 23\n\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes are one of our nation's great \n     natural wonders. Bordering Michigan and seven other states, \n     these inland seas contain nearly one-fifth of the world's \n     surface fresh water. They support jobs in manufacturing, \n     tourism, recreation, shipping, agriculture, science, \n     engineering, energy, and mining throughout the region. The \n     protection of the Great Lakes is essential to Michigan's \n     state identity and economy as well as national economic \n     growth; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp pose an imminent threat to the Great \n     Lakes ecosystem and economy. Asian carp have successfully \n     invaded the Mississippi River basin and now stand only 50 \n     miles downstream from the Great Lakes. Asian carp can \n     reproduce rapidly, consume large quantities of food, disrupt \n     local ecosystems, out-compete native\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\n     fish, and devastate recreational fishing and boating \n     opportunities. There is general scientific consensus that \n     Asian carp will be able to establish populations and thrive \n     in areas of the Great Lakes. Once established, they will be \n     difficult, if not impossible, to control or eradicate. Thus, \n     the federal government has recognized Asian carp as ``the \n     most acute [aquatic invasive species] threat facing the Great \n     Lakes today''; and\n       Whereas, A permanent, long-term solution must be identified \n     and implemented to keep Asian carp out of the Great Lakes. \n     While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Great Lakes and \n     Mississippi River Interbasin Study identified a number of \n     solutions, it stopped short of determining the best option. \n     Regional efforts to reach consensus on a solution, such as \n     those of the Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee, \n     must be supported and recommendations seriously considered; \n     and\n       Whereas, The best long-term solution will prevent Asian \n     carp from entering the Great Lakes while preserving as much \n     as possible the current uses of the Chicago area waterways. \n     Although effective Asian carp prevention is paramount and \n     should not be compromised, the value, impacts, and costs to \n     the barge industry must also be taken into account; and\n       Whereas, Regardless of the means, immediate and decisive \n     action is required to protect the Great Lakes. The status quo \n     will not prevent irreparable harm. Asian carp could cause \n     billions of dollars in lost revenues and thousands of lost \n     jobs in the $7 billion sports and commercial fishing industry \n     and the $9 billion recreational boating industry. In \n     addition, damage done to the Great Lakes, rivers, and inland \n     lakes by Asian carp would greatly harm our state's viability \n     as an attractive vacation destination, thereby leading to \n     decreased tourism revenue and jobs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we call on the Obama \n     Administration and the Congress of the United States to \n     direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fully support \n     efforts to determine the best long-term solution for \n     preventing Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the Obama Administration and \n     Congress to provide sufficient funding that will ensure the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers moves decisively to implement a \n     solution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-39. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan memorializing the Congress of the United States to \n     pass legislation that authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers \n     to implement measures at the Brandon Road lock and dam to \n     prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, Asian carp are an imminent and serious threat to \n     the health and economy of Michigan and the entire Great Lakes \n     region. Only 50 miles downstream from Lake Michigan, this \n     aquatic invasive species' voracious appetite would disrupt \n     food webs, leaving inadequate food for more desirable species \n     within the Great Lakes, and threatening the $7-billion Great \n     Lakes recreational and commercial fishing industry; and\n       Whereas, Current controls in the Chicago area are \n     inadequate to prevent the movement of Asian carp and \n     potential future aquatic invasive species (AIS) between the \n     Great Lakes system and the Mississippi River system. A U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineer and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     study has demonstrated that the electrical barriers that \n     provide the front line of protection against carp do not \n     prevent the movement of all fish; and\n       Whereas, Control measures implemented at the Brandon Road \n     lock and dam in Joliet, Illinois, would reduce the risk of an \n     Asian carp invasion while maintaining efficient navigation. \n     Composed of representatives from government, industry, \n     business, anglers, and conservation groups, the Chicago Area \n     Waterway System Advisory Committee has recommended the \n     deployment of innovative technologies and the reconfiguration \n     of the locks in a newly-engineered channel at this key \n     location. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has begun the \n     scoping process for this project; and\n       Whereas, Moving forward with design, engineering, and \n     construction of these measures would be a worthwhile short-\n     term and longterm investment in the Great Lakes region. While \n     negotiations continue on a permanent long-term solution, \n     these measures would provide additional protection and be \n     consistent with an eventual long-term solution. In addition, \n     this project would serve as a valuable demonstration for \n     technologies that could be implemented in other areas of the \n     country; and\n       Whereas, There is a window of opportunity now to protect \n     the Great Lakes, avoid irreparable harm to the system, and \n     prevent decade upon decade of future management costs. Once \n     established, Asian carp would be nearly impossible to \n     eradicate and would join zebra mussels, sea lamprey, and \n     other AIS that Great Lakes governments and businesses spend \n     millions of dollars per year to control. The Brandon Road \n     lock and dam project would be a solid first step in creating \n     greater structural protections for the Great Lakes: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to pass legislation that authorizes the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to implement measures at the \n     Brandon Road lock and dam to prevent Asian carp from entering \n     the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-40. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Congress to pass legislation that establishes a \n     national, uniform, and scientifically-based label program for \n     genetically modified food; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 89\n\n       Whereas, Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, have \n     become increasingly prominent in today's grocery marketplace. \n     In recent years, scientists have used genetic engineering \n     techniques to modify the DNA of plants to make them resistant \n     to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, and \n     chemical treatments. GMOs help increase crop yields, \n     constrain food prices, and vitally support Michigan's \n     agriculture, food processing, and other industries. Commonly \n     found in crops like corn, soybeans, cotton, and canola, 70 to \n     80 percent of the foods Americans eat today contain GMOs. In \n     2014, 100 percent of all sugar, 93 percent of all corn, and \n     91 percent of all soybeans grown in Michigan were produced \n     using GMOs; and\n       Whereas, Despite the widespread use of GMOs, there is no \n     federal GMO labeling standard. Absent these rules, some \n     states and localities have developed their own proposals, \n     leading to a patchwork of regulation that can be confusing \n     and possibly misleading to consumers. Moreover, a maze of GMO \n     labeling regulations increases agriculture and food \n     production costs, requiring food companies operating in \n     Michigan to create separate supply chains in each state. \n     Ultimately, this could significantly increase the average \n     price consumers spend at grocery stores, which could average \n     an extra $500 per year according to a Cornell University \n     study; and\n       Whereas, Federal legislation must be passed to avoid this \n     patchwork of regulations and the costly ramifications it \n     creates. Legislation like the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling \n     Act H.R. 1599, sponsored by congressmen Pompeo and \n     Butterfield, is a bipartisan solution needed to allow \n     consumers to have access to accurate and consistent \n     information on the products that contain GMOs. A USDA-\n     administered certification and labeling program modeled after \n     the USDA organic labeling program for non-GMO foods would \n     ensure that labeling is nationwide, uniform, and \n     scientifically-based: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States to pass legislation that \n     establishes a national, uniform, and scientifically-based \n     label program for genetically modified food; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-41.

                            ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1583. A bill to authorize the expansion of an existing \nhydroelectric project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will speed the next phase of a renewable energy project in my home \nState of Alaska, that Congress effectively authorized 35 years ago.\n  Back in 1980, Congress in Section 1325 of the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, noted that the Kodiak Electric \nAssociation Inc., KEA, then wished to build a lake-tap hydroelectric \nproject by taking water from Terror Lake, a high alpine lake, whiph was \nplaced just inside the boundary line of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge \nby the act. At the time KEA had wanted to build a 20 megawatt \nhydroelectric project inside the refuge to power the namesake community \non Kodiak Island. Under the law, the Secretary of the Interior was to \napprove the project and its expansion on a ``case-by-case'' basis--the \nlaw simply saying that nothing in the 1980 Act ``shall be construed as \nnecessarily prohibiting or mandating the construction'' of the project. \nThe Secretary the next year approved the power project, which started \ngeneration in the mid 1980's. A third 10-megawatt turbine since was \nadded to the project in 2012-13.\n  Kodiak Electric Association, a rural electric cooperative, is a \nleader in Alaska in promoting renewable energy. In 2014, 99.7 percent \nof its total electricity came from hydroelectric generation and from a \nPillar Mountain wind turbine farm--the first community in Alaska to be \nnearly 100 percent supplied by renewable energy sources. But that \ndesignation will disappear if the next phase of the originally planned \nTerror Lake project is not constructed, since the utility will need to\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nresume burning more diesel fuel to produce power if additional \nhydroelectric generation from the lake is not permitted. That will \nresult in the burning of 2 million gallons of diesel fuel--in a typical \nyear given current electricity load forecasts--that will emit 26,000 \ntons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually.\n  The new expansion involves diverting five small streams located on \nAlaska State lands in the adjacent Upper Hidden Basin--streams \nbranching off the East and West Upper Hidden Creeks--and allowing the \nwater to flow into Terror Lake through an underground tunnel that will \nbe drilled through the ridge line marking the boundary between State \nand refuge lands. The project, which will impact about 13 acres of \nrefuge lands, 3 acres being made up by the tunnel itself, will have a \nsingle visible impact, some grading for a construction laydown area on \nthe rocky slopes above the upper end of the lake, and the ``natural'' \nwaterfall that will result from water entering the lake from the \ntunnel. The entire extent of the project involves drilling a 1.22 mile-\nlong tunnel, about 2,150 feet by current estimates being on refuge \nlands, plus the diversion structure on the State's creeks, a water \npipeline to carry water from the East Creek over to the main diversion \nstructure located on the West Creek, and a related access road.\n  The project should have no impact on the environment or wildlife, \nsince the amount of water being diverted from the 4 square mile basin \nis so slight as to have no impact on fisheries at the mouth of the \nKizhuyak River on the east side of Kodiak Island at Ugak Bay, into \nwhich the Hidden Basin Creeks flow. The project should not affect the \nwildlife along the shore of the steep, rocky lake. The project will not \ninvolve adding turbines or equipment to the existing Terror Lake \npowerhouse, as the project will not increase the maximum amount of \nmegawatt production, but simply increase the annual total production of \nelectricity from the power project. Terror Lake in 2014, a normal water \nyear, produced 134 gigawatt-hours of electricity. By the addition it \nshould produce about 30 additional gigawatt-hours annually, about a 25 \npercent increase.\n  The project, besides allowing KEA to utilize clean, renewable energy, \nshould also enhance the utility's innovative wind-hydro integration \nsystem and further its micro-grid energy storage technology.\n  While this project should be able to proceed by seeking \nadministrative approvals either because of its ANILCA inclusion or \nbecause of Title 11 of ANILCA, which governs future rights-of-way \nrequests, I am introducing legislation seeking Congressional approval \nto speed up the start of construction on the power project. Without \nCongressional approval, the utility will need to fund two environmental \nimpact statements, EIS's, instead of one, covering the exact same \nissues, delaying the start of construction by years. With congressional \napproval, the project will still face the delay of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission conducting a single EIS as part of its hydro \nlicensing amendment process. The project still will be subject to any \nconditions to protect fisheries or wildlife placed on the project by \nthe USF under Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act. But it will \nhave to clear only one such EIS process, sparing rate payers on Kodiak \nIsland a doubling of the permitting expense.\n  This authorization will simply allow another phase of the Terror Lake \nproject to be constructed, as it was envisioned nearly 40 years ago. In \nthe 1978 feasibility plan, two years before passage of the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act, the Hidden Basin Creek \ndiversion was clearly outlined. ``This scheme is the most economical \nmeans of increasing the output of the development . . . and it can be \nbuilt whenever the growth in power demand in Kodiak justifies it. \nTherefore, the scheme is included in the present report as a \nrecommended future development,'' said the Terror Lake hydro report in \nDecember 1978.\n  The project will permit additional clean, renewable energy to be \ngenerated for the inhabitants of Kodiak Island, but without any \nenvironmental or negative fishery or wildlife consequences. This bill, \nif approved by Congress this year, will produce that power more quickly \nand at less cost than will be involved should a lengthy, multiple \nadministrative review take place. It is unfortunate, but in the past 35 \nyears since passage of the Alaska lands act, no entity has ever \ncompleted the lengthy process and received a right-of-way permit under \nthe bureaucratic process set up by Title 11 of ANILCA. I hope that this \nproject will not have to attempt to be the first to actually navigate \nthe Title 11 right-of-way process in order to proceed.\n  I hope Congress will quickly approve this authorization so that more \nrenewable electricity can flow to the citizens of Kodiak in the near \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1585. A bill to authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto issue an order continuing a stay of a hydroelectric license for the \nMahoney Lake hydroelectric project in the State of Alaska, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nneeded to provide additional options for how Ketchikan and parts of \nSoutheast Alaska can receive additional clean, renewable electricity in \nthe future. Today I am introducing legislation being requested by Cape \nFox Native Corp. of Ketchikan, Alaska Power & Telephone Co., and the \nCity of Saxman to extend a 2002 stay on the hydroelectric construction \nlicense for the Mahoney Lake project. This bill will effectively \nrequire the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant another 10-\nyear extension of the construction license for the project proposed \nnortheast of downtown Ketchikan, in hopes that greater clarity will be \nobtained within the next decade on how to supply power to the region in \nthe future.\n  Mahoney Lake was first proposed as a 9.6-megawatt, MW, lake-tap \nhydroelectric project in the early 1990s. By 2002 the sponsors had not \nreceived a power purchase agreement, PPA, and had exhausted the then \nallowed FERC extensions of their construction license. In June 2002 \nthey asked former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens to win legislative \napproval of a stay so they wouldn't lose the license. Effectively, they \nwanted the license expiration to be stayed until after completion of \nthe then proposed Swan-Tyee electrical transmission intertie--in hopes \nthat such completion would clarify future electrical needs in the \ncommunity. That project has since been finished, triggering the \npotential end of the 2002 license stay.\n  The entities backing Mahoney Lake's construction have spent more than \n$4 million on engineering and environmental studies--money in jeopardy \nof being wasted, if the stay and a continuation of the construction \nlicense is not approved by Congress. For that and a host of other \nreasons, I am introducing this legislation to extend the construction \nlicense and normal additional license periods under FERC rules for this \nproject.\n  Ketchikan, which recently received more clean, renewable energy with \nthe completion of the Whitman Lake hydroelectricity project, likely \nwill need additional power within the next decade. Currently the \nSoutheast Alaska Power Authority, SEAPA, is conducting a review of all \npotential power sources. As part of that study the authority is \nstudying the merits of a host of projects, including construction of \nMahoney Lake. The authority, for example, is considering whether to \nraise the height of the existing spillway of the Swan Lake project to \nhold more water and generate more power. The authority is considering \nwhether to purchase power from two potential Metlakatla hydro projects: \nthe 4MW Triangle Lake or the 4.6 MW Lower Todd Lake projects on Annette \nIsland. And the authority is also checking the potential economics and \ncosts, including transmission lines, of new projects throughout the \narea.\n  By this legislation I am simply trying to keep Mahoney Lake, which \nmay be able to produce 41.6 gigawatts of additional power annually for \nthe Ketchikan area, viable as a potential renewable energy project \nuntil that comprehensive review is finished in 2016 or perhaps in 2017.\n  The three entities that currently hold the license for Mahoney Lake \nhave certainly spent more than enough\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\non construction to meet FERC requirements that licensees show they are \nserious about progressing a project and aren't simply ``stockpiling'' \nhydroelectric permits/licenses. Cape Fox Native Corporation, \nespecially, is deserving of an extension given its unique position \nunder terms of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA, \nCape Fox was ``distinctly disadvantaged'' in its land selections under \nANCSA because of Ketchikan land protections, the location of the \nAnnette Island Indian reservation, and the then long-term timber \ncontracts in the area owned at the time by the Ketchikan Pulp \nCorporation. All three issues prevented Cape Fox from selecting most of \nits lands inside its core selection areas. Arguably the Mahoney Lake \nhydro project site is the only valuable land that the corporation was \nallowed to select inside its core selection area, under the bill that \nsettled aboriginal land claims in Alaska.\n  This legislation will not advantage Mahoney Lake over any other \nproject that may be considered to provide low-cost hydroelectric power \nto the region. But its timely passage will level the playing field so \nthat Mahoney Lake can be considered on the same economic grounds as all \nother future power projects in southern Southeast Alaska. I hope for \nthe bill's swift passage in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Flake):\n  S. 1587. A bill to authorize the use of the United States Armed \nForces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce in the \nSenate, with my colleague Senator Flake, the first bipartisan \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force, AUMF, against ISIL. The United \nStates launched military action against ISIL over 10 months ago on \nAugust 8, 2014. It is far past time for Congress to fulfill its duty by \ndebating and determining whether or not it is in the nation's best \ninterest to order United States troops to risk their lives in this \nmission and vote on an ISIL AUMF.\n  This bill authorizes the U.S. mission against ISIL for the purpose of \nprotecting the lives of U.S. citizens and providing military support to \nregional partners in their battle to defeat ISIL. As stated by the \nauthorization, the use of significant U.S. ground troops in combat \nagainst ISIL is not consistent with this purpose, except to protect \nlives of U.S. citizens from imminent threat. Other key provisions \ninclude a sunset after three years unless reauthorized; a repeal of the \n2002 Iraq AUMF; and a clause that defines this authorization as the \nsole statutory authority for the war on ISIL, as opposed to the 2001 \nAUMF.\n  Thousands of members of the United States Armed Forces have been \ndeployed to support military operations against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. \nAs of June 2015, the United States has conducted over 3,500 airstrikes \nagainst ISIL and spent more than $2,600,000,000 American taxpayer \ndollars on this war--a number that continues to rise by approximately \n$9,000,000 per day. Tragically, members of the Armed Forces have been \nkilled in Operation Inherent Resolve, and United States hostages have \nbeen killed by ISIL in barbaric ways.\n  However, while Congress has authorized appropriations for Operation \nInherent Resolve and the training of anti-ISIL forces in Syria, it has \nyet to take formal action to approve this mission. Doing so is critical \nfor reinforcing the leadership of the United States with our coalition \npartners and sending a strong message to our adversaries that the \nUnited States is united in the fight against ISIL and speaks with one \nvoice in confronting ISIL.\n  President Obama submitted an authorization for use of military force \nagainst ISIL in February 2015. And still Congress has not undertaken \nits most solemn duty and responsibility under Article 1. The American \npublic deserves this congressional debate to educate them about the \nnational security interests at stake and the advisability of this war \nand Congress should do its job by formally voicing its support or \ndisapproval of the mission against ISIL.\n  I am proud to join Senator Flake in introducing a bill to start this \nnecessary debate. As we saw with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, \nit is possible to find bipartisan compromise on even the toughest of \nforeign policy issues and I challenge my colleagues to finally come \ntogether to do what is right for our troops and our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4206-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2047.

BURWELL DECISION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a case pending before the U.S. \nSupreme Court that is being followed very closely. It is the case of \nKing v. Burwell. It is a case that really is challenging one of the \nfundamental premises of the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act was passed 4 or 5 years ago here in the \nSenate and in the House and signed by President Obama. Because of it, \nover 11 million\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\nAmericans have chosen or reenrolled in a health insurance plan, most \nwith a tax subsidy that makes their coverage affordable. The subsidy is \nbased on their income. In the private market, millions more now have \naccess to expanded coverage for preventive health services, such as \nmammograms or flu shots, without any cost sharing.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, a person no longer needs to stay \nin a job simply to carry health insurance or be denied coverage because \nof a preexisting condition. Because of this law, prescription drugs for \nseniors cost a lot less. There was a time not that long ago that if a \nmember of your family--for instance, one of your children--had a \nhistory of diabetes or mental illness, they might find themselves in a \nposition where the family couldn't afford to buy health insurance. But \nthe new Affordable Care Act said: You cannot discriminate against a \nperson or family because there is a preexisting health condition.\n  The reason that works, the reason why insurance companies can still \nget by covering people who are sick is that there is also a requirement \nthat people carry health insurance. That means healthy people need to \nbuy health insurance as well as those who are sick and worried about \ncoverage in the future. That enlarges the pool and diminishes the cost \nto the applicant for health insurance who is suffering from a \npreexisting condition.\n  This month, the Supreme Court will make a decision in the case of \nKing v. Burwell. The plaintiffs in this case have made an unusual \nargument. They claim that Congress intended to provide tax credits to \nhelp people buy health insurance only in insurance marketplaces \nestablished by each State but not in the Federal marketplace.\n  I was here during the debate. I was here when we passed the \nAffordable Care Act. I can tell you that absolutely no one made that \nargument that I heard on the floor of the Senate. Overwhelmingly, those \nwho were in exchanges--in either State or Federal exchanges--were \ntreated the same way when we calculated the cost and savings of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  If Republicans get their way--and some of them are rooting for the \nSupreme Court to eliminate the subsidy--6.5 million people will lose \ntheir Federal tax subsidy for health insurance. According to the Urban \nInstitute, premiums for people able to purchase insurance would \nincrease by 35 percent. Now, $12 billion in uncompensated care would be \nshifted to hospitals and Americans with employer-based insurance, \nmaking a ruling in favor of King in the Supreme Court a tax increase on \neveryone.\n  Here is how it works: If you have people--millions across the \ncountry--who have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act \nand they lose their health insurance, they are still going to get sick. \nWhen they get sick, they will show up at a hospital. Nine times out of \nten--maybe more--the hospital will treat them even if they can't pay. \nTheir expenses and costs will be passed on to someone else who comes to \nthat hospital, someone with health insurance.\n  Ultimately, everyone who has health insurance is going to subsidize \nthose who don't. I don't think that is a very fair or wise system. If \nthe King v. Burwell decision goes the wrong way, it may move us toward \nthat.\n  There are some in the other party who say they have an alternative \nplan to the Affordable Care Act. The House and the Senate Republicans \nhave already voted to repeal subsidies for working families by voting \nto repeal the law. I lost track in the House; I think it is 57 times, \n58 times they have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have \ncome out with a plan that they say would restore the subsidies, but it \neliminates the requirement that people carry insurance. It eliminates \nwhat is known as the individual mandate.\n  There were some who argued--and I am one of them--that the individual \nmandate is a question of personal responsibility. If you want to drive \na car in my State of Illinois, you need automobile insurance. It isn't \na question of you making a decision. The State requires it because if \nyou are going to be in that automobile and if you get in an accident, \nthe victim in the other car shouldn't have to bear the expense of \ndamage to their car or personal injury, the person responsible for the \naccident should, and the only way that works is if everybody carries \nautomobile insurance.\n  If you want to buy a home in my State and I think in almost every \nState, the mortgage company requires fire insurance. If a fire destroys \nthat home, the mortgage company will get paid the proceeds and will not \nend up with an empty bag.\n  Similarly, when it comes to health insurance, the individual mandate \nsays: We think everyone should buy health insurance. We will help those \nin low-income categories with subsidies because we think everyone \nshould have health insurance. That is what is behind the individual \nmandate.\n  If you eliminate the individual mandate, you will be back in the \nsituation where people seeking health insurance will be those who are \nthe most vulnerable and sick, those with preexisting conditions. That \nmakes it tough to create an insurance pool that makes sense when it \ncomes to risk.\n  According to the American Academy of Actuaries, putting out a plan \nthat eliminates the individual mandate will really be of no help. That \nbill would only delay the onset of higher insurance premiums and loss \nof coverage for millions of Americans. The Affordable Care Act puts \nfamilies in charge of their care instead of insurance companies. It \nexpands health care coverage, lowers health care cost, makes Medicare \nstronger, and lowers the deficit. I don't know why there is opposition \nto any of those elements.\n  Before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 50 million Americans \ndidn't have health insurance, while health care costs for working \nfamilies and small businesses were increasing out of sight. The \nAffordable Care Act changed that, and 11 million people of the 50 \nmillion now have private health insurance. Millions more are now \ncovered by Medicaid. And for the first time ever, insurance companies \nhave to live up to their promise of being there when you really need \nthem.\n  Many in the other party have argued that this is not the way to do it \nand that there should be a viable alternative. I would like them to \nmeet a couple of people from my home State.\n  The Supreme Court could put in jeopardy health insurance coverage for \nAriana Jimenez. Ariana lives in Chicago and works part time as a \nnursing assistant at a community health center. Ariana pays $52 a month \nfor her basic health insurance premium--$52 a month. When asked what \nwould happen to her coverage if the Supreme Court took away her tax \ncredit, Ariana simply said: I wouldn't be able to afford it.\n  In Illinois, over 800,000 people--in my State of about 12.5 million, \n13.5 million--800,000 people in Illinois now have health insurance \nthrough the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act or through \nMedicaid, and 240,000 people purchased a plan through the Illinois \nmarketplace with a subsidy. I might say that the only marketplace is a \nFederal marketplace. If the Supreme Court decides in favor of the \nplaintiffs, a quarter-million people in my home State will not be able \nto afford their health insurance.\n  What happens to everyone else? If the Court rules for King, the \nplaintiff in this lawsuit, consumers in the individual market in States \nsuch as Illinois who use the Federal marketplace would face premium \nincreases of 47 percent--$1,600 a year more that people would have to \npay for health insurance.\n  A few years ago, Domingo Carino found out he had a health condition \nthat required medication and he could not afford it. Thanks to the \nAffordable Care Act and help from the staff at the Asian Human Services \nFamily Health Center in Chicago, Domingo found good health insurance. \nHe pays $11 a month. Domingo's plan not only allows him to afford his \nmedication, but it also keeps him in a position where he has access to \na primary care physician. According to Domingo, he can now live without \nworrying about how to afford his medication.\n  For Domingo and millions like him, tax credits provided by the \nAffordable Care Act are literally a lifesaver.\n  Over 54 million people benefit from Medicaid. Before the Affordable \nCare Act, two out of three people on Medicaid were pregnant women and \nchildren. That is 36 million of our most vulnerable Americans. Medicaid \nalso\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\nprovides for people with disabilities. Before the Affordable Care Act, \nalmost 3 million people were covered by Medicaid in Illinois, and more \nthan half of the children born in our State were covered by Medicaid. \nSince the Affordable Care Act, another 530,000 people have signed up \nfor Medicaid. That means that finally these people can get better from \na condition they couldn't afford to treat. I call that a success.\n  It is interesting, too, that now that people on Medicaid can shop at \ndifferent hospitals, traditional hospitals that serve the poor--there \nis one, Stroger Hospital, which used to be Cook County Hospital, in \nChicago--have to change the way they do business. They are competitive \nnow. They realize that Medicaid patients can go shopping at another \nhospital. The administrator at Stroger Hospital told the doctors and \nstaff: Be on your toes. Provide better care. We are competing for \nbusiness now. These Medicaid recipients can go to every hospital.\n  According to a recent Gallup poll, the uninsured rate has dropped \n3\\1/2\\ percentage points from 2013 to 2014. In Illinois, the uninsured \nrate dropped 4\\1/2\\ percent during that same period.\n  The Affordable Care Act includes several changes meant to help slow \nthe growth in health care costs. The CBO this week forecast lower \nprivate health insurance premiums. Health care spending per enrollee \nhas slowed in the private insurance market and also in Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  Instead of paying hospitals for the services they provide, because of \nthe ACA, hospitals are paid to make people well. If their patients have \nto go back to the hospital, many of the hospitals are penalized for \nthat. Despite climbing readmission rates since 2007, those rates \nstarted to fall with the Affordable Care Act. Hospitals are responding \nto the incentives in the Affordable Care Act and more of their patients \nare getting better and staying better.\n  The solvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund is now 13 years longer \nthan it was prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act--which \nmeans it will be solvent for 13 more years--which the trustees in 2010 \nsaid had ``substantially improved'' the financial status of the trust \nfund.\n  The law also helps seniors with the cost of prescription drugs by \nclosing the doughnut hole. There was that moment in time when seniors \nweren't covered by Medicare Part D and had to reach into their savings \naccount. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, people with \nMedicare in Illinois have saved over $554 million on prescription \ndrugs. We closed the doughnut hole with the Affordable Care Act. That \nis an average savings for each senior in Illinois of $925. Those who \nwant to abolish the Affordable Care Act have some explaining to do to \nseniors who are pretty happy that they have a helping hand when it \ncomes to paying for drugs.\n  It is my hope that the Supreme Court does the right thing and \nrealizes Congress never intended to have tax subsidies go to only some \nAmericans and not others. I have always said the Affordable Care Act is \nnot a perfect law. As I have said several times on the floor of the \nSenate, the only perfect law was carried down a mountain by Senator \nMoses on clay tablets. Ever since, we have tried our best to put a law \ntogether that serves the purposes of our Nation. We do our best, but we \ncan always improve it. The same thing is true for the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  I hope the time comes--and I hope the Supreme Court doesn't force \nthis sooner rather than later--when we can have a constructive, \nbipartisan conversation about the Affordable Care Act. It is not a \nperfect law. It can be improved. There are parts of it on which I would \ngladly work with Republicans to change.\n  I have told my friends in the restaurant business that I know they \nare concerned about the number of hours employees have to work to be \ncovered and how many employees work at the restaurant and so forth. All \nof those things can be and should be addressed. If they are addressed \nin a positive and constructive way, we can improve this law and make it \nserve the American people better. I think that is why we were elected.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/senate-section/article/S4211-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
