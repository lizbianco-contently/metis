Mr. President, in one week Congress will host one of the \nworld's great faith leaders, His Holiness Pope Francis. Every Member of \nCongress is looking forward to the Pope's historic address.\n  Since beginning his papacy, Pope Francis has been admired for his \nhumility and honesty. Rather than shirk responsibility from important \nand controversial global challenges, he has confronted them. While he \nand I don't agree on everything, his statements on climate change, \nimmigration reform, and income inequality have challenged world \nleaders, and that is an understatement.\n  Yesterday His Holiness and the Vatican stated their support for the \nnuclear agreement with Iran. A spokesperson for His Holiness told the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency that this agreement ``will be a \ndefinitive step toward greater stability and security in the region.'' \nThat is certainly the truth.\n  Supporting the nuclear agreement between the permanent five members \nof the U.N. Security Council, Germany, and Iran is the best way to \nensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. That is what the \nagreement is all about. That is why last week the Senate clearly stated \nthe agreement will stand. No matter how you talk about all these other \nthings, the agreement is to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. \nThat is what it is all about.\n  Last night the Senate again rejected the Republican attempt to derail \nthe nuclear agreement. Now for the second time, the Republican leader \nis refusing to accept the reality that, in fact, it is going to go \nforward. He is doubling down and committing the Senate to vote on other \nissues.\n  We have seen this strategy before. It never works, whether it was \nwith homeland security, ObamaCare or all the other issues. All it does \nis waste time that we cannot afford.\n  When the Republican leader tried this approach on homeland security, \nremember what John McCain, the Senator from Arizona, said: It was the \n``definition of insanity.'' What he was talking about was what Albert \nEinstein said, that if you keep doing the same thing over and over, \nknowing you will get the same result, it is insanity.\n  Today a news report described the Republican leader's strategy as \n``the second kick of a mule,'' and said ``it's not working.''\n  It is unbelievable what the Republican leader is trying to do. We \nhave 7 working days before a shutdown of the government. Why? Because \nwe won't have any money. The Senate will take no votes today. If the \nRepublican leader has his way, all the Senate will do this week is take \nyet another failed vote on Iran. At this rate the Senate will end this \nweek with nothing to show for our time but two failed votes--nothing \ndealing with the most important issue facing this country, and that is, \nhow to fund the government.\n  We have seen Republicans manufacture crises before. This one truly is \nembarrassing. The government runs out of money in a matter of days. \nRepublicans have no plans to avoid a shutdown, and we have almost \ntwoscore of Republicans in the House who said they will vote for \nnothing unless it defunds women's health care. We have a number of \nSenators saying if there is nothing in this to stop the funding of \nPlanned Parenthood, they will vote against it.\n  The government runs out of money in just a few days. To do nothing, \nwith no plans to avoid a shutdown, when we are standing around waiting \nfor something to be done on the budget is unwise and wrong, and it is \nan insult to the American people.\n  Last Thursday's vote is not going to change. Last night's vote will \nnot change. The Republicans lost those votes. What are their future \nplans? They will not prevent President Obama and his administration \nfrom implementing the Iran agreement.\n  There is precious little time left before a government shutdown. It \nis time\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\nfor the Republican leader to get serious about keeping the Federal \nGovernment open and funded. Are we just talking about something that is \nnonexistent as a problem? Two years ago the government was shut down \nfor almost a month. I think it was 21 days that the government was shut \ndown. It is very disturbing.\n  In 1 week, as I have indicated, the Pope will be here, and it is time \nthat we make sure that we follow some of the advice and counsel that he \nhas given us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6662-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF GAYLE SMITH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the goodwill and humanitarian efforts of the \nUnited States are needed all across the world. Victims of civil wars, \ndisease outbreaks, and natural disasters depend on the aid and \ncompassion of the American people. To our credit, we try our best to \nhelp as much as possible.\n  Take one example. The Syrian refugee crisis is the worst humanitarian \ncrisis since World War II. Four million Syrians are now refugees \nbecause of the country's civil war, and thousands and thousands are \nfleeing to any place they can go. Most of them are winding up in Europe \nto escape the violence.\n  There are almost another 8 million who are internally displaced \nwithin war-ravaged Syria. A lot of them are in cities and can't go \nanyplace. If they try to leave, they get killed. Tragically, 5\\1/2\\ \nmillion of these poor individuals are children. The United States is \ntrying to help. We are the single largest donor of humanitarian aid to \nthe Syrian crisis. There is not a close second.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, is one \nof the principal organizations by which the United States administers \ncivilian foreign aid. This Agency plays an essential role in \nadministering our Nation's foreign policy. Yet, while all these events \ncontinue to unfold before the world's eyes, Senate Republicans are \nblocking the next Administrator from taking her place.\n  Gayle Smith was nominated by President Obama 5 months ago. We had \nhearings weeks and weeks ago--now into months. It was right to nominate \nher. She is an experienced leader in administering international \nhumanitarian assistance and global development, serving on the National \nSecurity Council at the White House.\n  During her time at the White House, Gayle Smith has worked on major \ntyphoons in Asia, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and ongoing \nconflicts in Syria and Iraq. She has extensive experience in African \naffairs, both from her time at the National Security Council and from \nher work as a journalist covering international affairs for more than \ntwo decades. During her time as a journalist, she spent time in active \nwar zones and other conflicts.\n  Gayle Smith's credentials are impeccable, and her hearing in the \nForeign Relations Committee in June reflected that. In September she \nwas voted out unanimously in a voice vote. Yet here we are post-June--\nthat is an understatement. Her nomination was reported favorably, and \nwe still have no confirmed Administrator.\n  With all the news accounts we watch every day of these thousands and \nthousands of lost people, the United States is being hampered in its \nability to help because we don't have anyone running the Agency. It is \njust the latest example of Republican obstruction for obstruction's \nsake.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the current \nRepublican Congress has confirmed far fewer nominees than any Congress \nin memory. Why?\n  What are Republicans accomplishing by preventing a qualified nominee \nsuch as Gayle Smith from leading the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment? They are doing it, and in so doing they are undermining \nU.S. foreign policy. They are undoing decades of admirable American \nhumanitarian efforts. But even more unsettling is that Republicans are \nimpeding our ability to assist those around the world who need help.\n  It is time for the Republican leader and his Senators to change \ncourse and stop this blockade of the President's nominations.\n  I look forward to the Senate Republicans releasing their obstruction \non the Gayle Smith nomination and working with Democrats to confirm her \nas the next Administrator of USAID immediately. All the Republican \nleader has to do is bring it to the floor. We will vote on it. If \nsomeone doesn't want to vote for her, don't vote for her. But it is \nreally wrong to have our great country at a time of this huge \nhumanitarian crisis having no one leading the Agency that does more to \nalleviate the problems these people face than anyone we have in our \ngovernment.\n  Would the chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6662-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, back in May, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed legislation guaranteeing Congress the chance to take \nan up-or-down vote on any nuclear deal with Iran. It was widely debated \nhere in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Votes were \nheld, and in the Senate, 98 Senators on both sides of the aisle agreed \nthat we should pass legislation requiring that Congress have a voice--\nand through Congress the American people have a voice--in something \nthat is so important to America's national security interests.\n  Yet here we are 4 months later, and the same Democrats who voted for \nthat at the time and joined Republicans--98 Senators voted for the \nAmerican people to have their voice heard on this-- these same \nDemocrats have now chosen to stifle the voices of the American people \nby refusing to allow an up-or-down vote on the President's nuclear \nagreement. Twice now, when we attempted to move to a final vote on the \ndeal, only four Democrats broke ranks with their colleagues and stood \nup to the President. That is a deeply disappointing result, especially \ngiven the stakes on this agreement.\n\n  I would have to say that in some ways I suppose if you are trying to \nprotect your President from having to make a decision about whether to \nsign or veto this legislation--maybe they were pushed into that \nposition by the administration--but the fact is, this is something that \nwas voted on in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, \noverwhelmingly supported, and sent to the President. The President of \nthe United States reluctantly signed it into law, but the understanding \nwas from that point forward that when this was actually brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, there would be an open debate and there would be a \nvote. All that I think is simply expected by the American people is an \nopportunity to be heard from, in the form of an up-or-down vote, \nthrough their representatives in the Senate.\n  I would think that even if Democrats in the Senate object to the vote \nthat we would have on a resolution of disapproval and want to support \nthe President's position, that they would allow it to be voted on and \nlet it go to the President. If the President is so\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\nproud of this deal--and clearly he is--why would he not then want the \nopportunity to veto a resolution of disapproval coming from Congress on \nthis?\n  I think, clearly, Democrats in the Senate are doing their best to try \nand protect the President from having to make that decision, \nnotwithstanding the President's assertions that this is a wonderful \ndeal for our country, a wonderful deal for our allies. Of course, the \nfacts tell an entirely different story. A nuclear-armed Iran is a \ndirect threat to the security of the United States and our allies in \nthe Middle East, and the American people deserved that chance to have \ntheir voices heard.\n  I wish to take just a moment to read some of the statements that have \nbeen made by Iran's Supreme Leader over the past few weeks. This is \ndirectly from the Twitter feed of the Ayatollah Khamenei. Speaking to \nIsrael, he said: ``You will not see the next 25 years.'' That is the \nSupreme Leader of Iran speaking to Israel. He adds: ``God willing,'' \nthere will be nothing of the ``Zionist regime'' in the next 25 years. \nAgain, this is coming directly from the Twitter feed of the Iranian \nSupreme Leader.\n  Of the United States, he says something he has said before: ``U.S. is \nthe Great Satan.'' That is exactly as I said coming directly from the \nSupreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, in Iran.\n  So I challenge my colleagues in the Senate to reflect on those \nstatements. Think about them. Not only do they demonstrate Iran's \nhostility toward the United States and Israel, but they demonstrate \nanother key point when it comes to this agreement; that is, Iran is \nplaying the long game.\n  President Obama and Secretary Kerry may be thinking in terms of the \nnext few months, may be thinking about their own legacy, but the \nIranian regime is thinking in terms of years and decades. While this \ndeal may slow down Iran in the near term, in the long term it \nlegitimizes Iran's nuclear enrichment and drastically shortens its \nbreakout period for a bomb.\n  Under this agreement, in 10 years, Iran will transition from its \ncurrent IR-1 centrifuges--which is about, they say, 1960s technology--\nto the large-scale production of IR-2m centrifuges, which are four or \nfive times faster than what Iran has today. In addition, this deal \ngives Iran the option of building still more advanced IR-6 and IR-8 \ncentrifuges down the road, which are 15 times faster at enriching \nuranium. In other words, without once violating this agreement in a \ndecade, Iran will have reduced its breakout period for a bomb from a \nfew months to a few weeks. This agreement also allows Iran to keep its \nfortified nuclear facilities, and it gives Iran access to conventional \nweapons and ballistic missiles capable of delivering a warhead far \nbeyond Iran's borders.\n  Plus, under this agreement, Iran will have full access to \ninternational markets and the materials and technical components it \nneeds to build a bomb, material that right now it can only access \nthrough black-market channels. Iran is playing the long game, and in \nthe long term this is a very good deal for Iran.\n  Let's be clear about Iran's intentions regarding its nuclear program. \nIran is not simply interested in pursuing a nuclear enrichment program \nfor its civilian energy needs. Iran is interested in building a bomb. \nMake no mistake about it, if Iran were only interested in producing \nelectricity, it wouldn't need a nuclear enrichment program.\n  Look at other countries that use nuclear power to produce \nelectricity. Sweden, for example, currently has 10 functioning nuclear \npowerplants, but it does not have a domestic nuclear enrichment \nprogram. Finland has four nuclear powerplants, but it does not conduct \nits own nuclear enrichment. Ukraine, which voluntarily gave up its \npost-Soviet nuclear arsenal in the 1990s, has 15 nuclear powerplants. \nIt does not conduct its own nuclear enrichment. Mexico, Bulgaria, the \nCzech Republic, Spain, Switzerland, and South Africa--all these \ncountries have nuclear powerplants, but none of these countries \nconducts its own nuclear enrichment and none of these countries needs \nto conduct its own enrichment because the fuel can easily be obtained \nin the world market, where there is actually a surplus of enriched \nuranium. No one worries that these countries are on the verge of \nbuilding a bomb because their intentions are clear. They are only \ninterested in the electricity they can obtain from nuclear power, and \nfor this they don't need to enrich their own uranium.\n  Another striking example can be seen on the Korean Peninsula. South \nKorea, a thriving democracy, has 23 operating nuclear powerplants. Yet \nit does not have a commercial enrichment program or even a spent fuel \nreprocessing facility. North Korea, on the other hand, chose to pursue \nan undisclosed illicit nuclear enrichment program, and North Korea has \nproduced a nuclear bomb.\n  Based on Iran's behavior, is Iran trying to be more like South Korea, \nwith its multitude of powerplants and no enrichment capabilities, or \nNorth Korea, which fails to provide its population with electricity but \nstill built a nuclear bomb. If Iran wants a peaceful, civilian, nuclear \nenergy program, it does not need to be enriching uranium.\n  Plain and simple, the only reason Iran needs a nuclear enrichment \nprogram is if it is interested in developing a nuclear weapon. If Iran \nwanted to silence all of its critics, if it wanted to prove that it is \noperating in good faith, it could halt its nuclear enrichment facility \nat Fordow and halt its domestic enrichment program altogether.\n  If President Obama had reached a deal that would accomplish this, the \nSenate would not have sought a vote upon a resolution of disapproval. \nInstead, Republicans and Democrats alike would have been supporting the \nagreement praising the success of the negotiations, but that is not \nwhat happened. Instead, the President agreed to a deal that validates \nIran's enrichment program, allows it to maintain its nuclear \nfacilities, and explicitly permits Iran to continue researching and \nmanufacturing advanced centrifuges. In other words, in a few short \nyears, this deal gives Iran everything it would need for the speedy \ndevelopment of a nuclear weapon.\n  If Iran genuinely wants a peaceful nuclear energy program, it can put \neveryone's concerns to rest and dismantle its uranium enrichment \nstructure. Short of that, Iran is telegraphing to the world that it \nwants a nuclear bomb.\n  Mr. President, I wish to shift gears for just a moment and address an \nassertion that Secretary Kerry has made numerous times throughout this \ndebate.\n  As we all know, one of the major points of contention surrounding \nthis deal is the side agreements between Iran and the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, that remain a secret. The nuclear \ndeal grants inspections at Iran's known nuclear sites, but the details \nof these inspections are being kept secret between the IAEA and Iran. \nSecretary Kerry has asserted that keeping these side agreements secret \nis standard practice for the IAEA, but is that really the case? Are \nprivate agreements between Iran and host countries the norm?\n  I wanted to find out. So last week I sat down with the former Deputy \nDirector of the IAEA, Olli Heinonen, and discussed the policies and \nprocedures of the IAEA with him at length. Mr. Heinonen is an expert on \nthis topic, having served with the IAEA for 27 years and personally \ninspected, I might add, sites in Iran in the past. He was able to tell \nme that keeping side agreements a secret is not standard for the IAEA. \nIt is an exception that has periodically been used to protect \nproprietary information for commercial reasons.\n  Let me repeat that. In contrast to what Secretary Kerry is claiming, \nrefusing to disclose these side agreements is not the IAEA's normal \nprocedure; it is an exception. When commercially sensitive information \nis not at risk, the IAEA's practice is to make the details of the \nagreements public.\n  So then why is the IAEA keeping its side agreements with Iran a \nsecret? So far as we know, no proprietary concerns exist, which leads \nto the inevitable conclusion that these agreements have been kept a \nsecret because they outline a weak inspections regime that would be \nunlikely to stand up to scrutiny, and the limited information that has \nbeen leaked so far backs up this conclusion. According to leaked \ndocuments made available to the Associated Press, the side agreements \nwith the IAEA allow Iran to collect its own\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\nsamples, with cameras recording the process. Iran will then deliver \nthese samples to the IAEA to be tested for radioactive material.\n  If that is true, there is reason to be deeply concerned because a \nprocess such as that would give Iran the opportunity to hide its \nnuclear activities from the IAEA. It is like having the fox guard the \nhen house.\n  One of the agreements made by Secretary Kerry when the discussion of \nthe 24-day waiting period for inspections of undisclosed sites came up \nwas that traces of radioactive material could not be hidden in 24 days. \nThat was the Secretary's argument. Samples taken from surfaces, where \nactivities involving radioactive materials have taken place, will still \nhave radioactive traces after the materials themselves are taken away. \nThat has been the argument that has been made by Secretary Kerry. The \nSecretary is right about that. Traces of radioactive material do \nremain, but what the Secretary doesn't mention is that those traces can \nbe hidden. If tabletops, floors or walls are painted over with certain \nmaterials--not just once but several times--samples taken from their \nsurfaces will not reveal radioactive material, and that makes allowing \nIran to take its own samples very dangerous, even if cameras are \npresent.\n  If inspections are intrusive enough--meaning actual human IAEA \ninspectors are walking through a facility looking not only for illicit \nactivity but for signs of someone trying to cover up such activity--it \nis pretty easy to identify newly painted surfaces and to know that \nsomething is amiss. That is the difference between actual inspections \nby the IAEA and having Iran collect samples and having cameras cover \nit.\n  If, as reports suggest, the IAEA has agreed to allow monitoring by \ncamera instead of sending inspectors into the facilities, it will be \nvery difficult for the IAEA to pick up on efforts to hide illicit \nactivities, such as repainting surfaces. If the IAEA's secret side \ndeals allow Iran to conduct its own inspections, then it is no wonder \nIran wants to keep such deals a secret.\n  Given the possibility that these secret side deals significantly \nweaken the inspections regime authorized by this agreement, it is \nimperative that the contents of these deals be made public. In \naddition, if these agreements are not made known, the IAEA will be \nsetting a dangerous precedent that could undermine its credibility \nmoving forward. If Iran gets off the hook on inspections and the IAEA \nallows this, what happens next time there is a rogue regime pursuing an \nillicit nuclear program? Well, I will tell you what is going to happen. \nThat nation will ask for the same inspections deal Iran got.\n\n  If the White House is serious on any level about preventing future \nnuclear proliferation, it needs to consider very carefully what it is \ndoing right now because right now the White House is establishing a \nprecedent that if a country is belligerent enough and hostile enough \nand pursues a nuclear program in violation of international agreements, \neventually the international community will validate that country's \nnuclear program and possibly even allow the country to conduct its own \ninspections. That is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set.\n  I understand that Senators have different ideological foundations \nfrom which we form our views and that sometimes political pressures \ncome into play when Senators are looking at legislation, but it is very \nunfortunate that so many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle chose to ignore the text of this agreement and cast their vote on \nideological grounds.\n  The truth is that this agreement will provide a hostile nation which \nhas an expressed hatred of the United States and Israel with a clear \npath to a nuclear bomb, and I am deeply disappointed that Senate \nDemocrats could not even allow a vote on a deal of this magnitude--a \ndeal that will shape the situation in the Middle East for years to \ncome.\n  As we move forward, Republicans will do everything we can to protect \nour country and our allies from the worst consequences of this \nagreement, starting with Leader McConnell's amendment to require a show \nof good faith from Tehran before congressional sanctions are lifted. I \nhope Democrats will join us. They still have that chance. I really do \nhope they will. This is that important. It is important to America's \nnational security interests. It is important to our allies in that \nregion of the world.\n  This agreement is a bad agreement. It needs to be rejected. At a \nminimum, it needs to at least be voted on by the people's elected \nrepresentatives of this country--something 98 Senators agreed to do \njust 4 months ago, and now all of a sudden, because the President \nevidently doesn't want to have to deal with a decision about whether to \nveto this resolution of disapproval, Democrats have dug in here in the \nSenate and are preventing the very thing 98 of us as Senators voted to \nallow to happen just 4 months ago. That is wrong. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to address this issue the Senator \nfrom South Dakota has been speaking on as well. I am extremely \ndisappointed and frustrated, as the Senator from South Dakota is and \nmany of us are, that 42 of our Democratic colleagues would choose to \nblock the Senate from even being able to consider and have an up-or-\ndown vote on whether we should proceed with this incredibly important, \nin my view, extremely dangerous deal with Iran despite the fact, as has \nbeen observed, that 98 Senators voted to create this very mechanism--a \nmechanism by which we could consider whether Congress wanted to pass a \nresolution of disapproval to prevent this dangerous deal from going \nforward. Nevertheless, they subsequently voted not to allow the \nSenate--and it is mystifying. We know what the outcome would be. We \nknow there is a bipartisan majority in the Senate that opposes the \ndeal, as there is a bipartisan majority in the House that opposes the \ndeal, as there is a bipartisan majority across America that opposes the \ndeal. But somehow we have to I guess pretend that is not the case and \navoid a vote that would clearly manifest that bipartisan majority here \nin the Senate.\n  If we did have that vote and we passed the resolution of \ndisapproval--it has passed the House--it would go to the President, and \nhe would veto it. He has made that clear. And those of us who \ndisapprove of this deal don't have enough votes to override the \nPresident's veto. So in the end the President would still get his way.\n  But somehow we have to hide from the fact that there is a clear \nbipartisan majority in both Houses of Congress that reflects the wishes \nof the American people about this. That is pretty frustrating and \npretty surprising and strange, that my Democratic colleagues who say \nthey are all for this deal nevertheless are afraid to acknowledge where \nthe consensus really is.\n  Well, I want to talk a bit about the specifics of the deal, but \nmostly I want to talk about the context of entering into a deal with a \nregime like the Iranian regime. There are a few things we should bear \nin mind when we are entering into negotiations with any other country, \nbut first and foremost, let's remember that this isn't an agreement \nwith Switzerland; this isn't an agreement with Canada; this is an \nagreement with the regime in Iran.\n  The first point I would make about this regime is to remember how \nhostile they have been to the United States. Thirty-six years ago, \nradical Islamists in Tehran overran the U.S. Embassy, stormed the \ncompound, and took 52 American hostages and held them for 444 days. And \nI would argue that our relationship with Iran has not improved a whole \nlot since then. They are still holding American hostages today. They \nhave killed over 500 American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nregularly call for ``Death to America.'' They call us the Great Satan. \nThis is a very hostile regime indeed.\n  The second point we should keep in mind is the consistent, \ndemonstrated aggressive nature and the regional ambitions of this \nregime. This is, after all, the world's No. 1 state sponsor of \nterrorism. They actively support Hezbollah. They actively support the \nAssad regime as he massacres his own people. And when the government in \nYemen was cooperating with the United States--cooperating with us in \nattacking and killing terrorists who were trying to kill Americans--\nduring\n\n[[Page S6665]]\n\nthe midst of the negotiations, the Iranian regime decided that was \nunacceptable, so they essentially overthrew the Government in Yemen and \nlaunched a civil war, which rages to this day. Of course, they continue \nto consistently threaten the very existence of Israel. That has been a \nconsistent message from this regime.\n  The third point I would make is how fundamentally untrustworthy this \nregime is. They are currently in violation of over 20 international \nagreements; yet we think they are going to comply with this one? It \nescapes me why we think that history isn't going to repeat itself. Even \nduring the negotiations, they were caught trying to buy nuclear parts. \nThat is a violation of their own commitments. They were recently caught \nagain using Hezbollah to supply arms to Assad in violation of \nagreements to which they committed. The bottom line is very clear: This \nregime in Iran cannot be trusted.\n  Maybe the fourth point I want to make is the most important in some \nways. It seems to me, in my experience in business and in life, in \norder to successfully complete a deal of almost any kind, to reach an \nagreement, it starts with a meeting of the minds. It starts with an \nagreement about a desired outcome. That is true in business, in \nmultinational organizations, and it is true in negotiations we engage \nin here in Congress. The starting point is agreeing on a fundamental \nobjective, and when two parties reach that agreement, then you can \ndocument it. You can draft the legal documents that then manifest and \nbring that agreement about. In my view--and I think this is a widely \nshared view--the Iranian regime has not decided to abandon their \npursuit of nuclear weapons, and that makes all the difference in the \nworld.\n  I will take a contrasting point that I think is worth thinking \nabout--the case of Muammar Qadhafi. We can probably all agree that \nMuammar Qadhafi was a very bad guy, probably a human being with no \nredeeming qualities at all. But after the United States went into Iraq \nand when our government presented him with the evidence we had about \nthe Libyan weapon of mass destruction program, Muammar Qadhafi came to \na conclusion. His conclusion was that it was in his interest to abandon \nhis pursuit of weapons of mass destruction because he was afraid of \nwhat we would do to him if he didn't. He didn't become a good guy; he \nmade a rational analysis of his situation and decided it was in his \nbest interest. His ability to hold on to power would be enhanced if he \ngave up those programs, so he did. We reached an agreement, it was \ndocumented, and there is every reason to believe that would have \nsucceeded because he had decided it was in his interest to make that \nagreement.\n  I don't think the Iranian Government has in any way come to the \nconclusion that they have to give up the pursuit of nuclear weapons. \nThey have been at it for decades, and the very conditions they insisted \non in this agreement, in my view, make it clear they have every \nintention of continuing to pursue nuclear weapons.\n  To summarize these points, when you are dealing with a country that \nis extremely hostile to the United States and our allies, that is \naggressively seeking to dominate that region, that has demonstrated by \nits actions that it is completely untrustworthy, and that shows no \nevidence of having actually decided to abandon the pursuit of nuclear \nweapons, given those aspects, the reality we face, it is very difficult \nto complete an acceptable negotiation to ensure that country will be \nnuclear-free. At a minimum, you would need an absolutely bulletproof, \nairtight agreement in order to be successful.\n  Instead, what do we have? We have an agreement where we give many \ntens, maybe over $100 billion virtually up front, which Iran will \ncertainly use, at least in part, to fund their terrorist activities. \nThe agreement allows them to retain an industrial-scale uranium \nenrichment program. You don't need any uranium enrichment to have \npeaceful nuclear energy. There is a very dubious inspection and \nverification process which allows up to 24 days before inspectors can \nget to certain sites. The whole deal is temporary. After Iran gets its \nmoney, Iran can walk away with the deal with 35 days' notice at any \ntime. There is a little process they have to go through that is 30 days \nlong, and then they can give 35 days' notice and just walk away. That \nis codified in the agreement. Of course, I think it is extremely \ndangerous for Israel and diminishes the ability of Israel to defend \nitself, and I think it is very likely to lead to nuclear proliferation \nthroughout the Middle East.\n  Those are plenty of reasons, in my view, to oppose this deal, but \nthose are the parts we know about. What is truly amazing, what is \nabsolutely shocking to me is that we don't have all the documents. I \ndon't know how anyone can support a deal when they know they haven't \nseen some of the important documents that are part of the deal, but we \nknow that is the case.\n  There are two documents, negotiated apparently between the IAEA--\nwhich is responsible for enforcement of essential parts of this \nagreement--and Iran, that not only has Congress not seen, the \nadministration hasn't even seen. Secretary Kerry has not seen them. Our \nnegotiators haven't seen them. Nobody has.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Chair.\n  So it is shocking to me that we would proceed and that people would \nsupport an agreement when they know there are essential parts of \nenforcement and discovery about the previous military dimensions that \nare unknown to us.\n  There is another point I need to make, and I will close with this. We \nhad the minority leader, the Democratic leader, who was here last time \nwe had this vote saying: This is over. You guys need to accept it, deal \nwith it. This deal is going forward, and there is nothing you can do \nabout it. It is done.\n  I strongly disagree with that. This is not over. We are not finished \nwith this. The reason we are not finished with this is because the \nPresident made a conscious decision. His decision was not to treat this \nas a treaty, not to respect the constitutional requirement to get two-\nthirds of the Senate to support this, and had he brought us in early \non, we might very well have been able to get there. Instead, he decided \nto circumvent the Constitution, the Congress, the United States Senate, \nand the will of the American people. So the result is that if the \nPresident goes forward with this, which it certainly looks as though he \nwill, this deal will not be binding on the United States past this \nadministration. That is by virtue of the decision the President made. \nThe President could have gone a different way, but he didn't, so the \ndeal can be undone by the next President. And with bipartisan \nmajorities in both Houses of Congress, that is entirely plausible.\n  There is another consideration, and that is that the President will \nbe doing so in violation of the law. The law--the Corker-Cardin \nlegislation--clearly and unambiguously requires the President to turn \nover all documents to Congress before the 60-day window even begins, \nand only after that is he permitted to lift the sanctions. But the \nPresident has not given all the documents to Congress. In fact, he \nhasn't even gotten all the documents himself. This is a clear, explicit \nviolation of the law we all passed.\n\n  I know the administration says: But it is customary for the IAEA to \nenter into these secret negotiations. As the Senator from South Dakota \nindicated a little while ago, it is not at all clear that it is \ncustomary, but more importantly, that doesn't matter. The law of the \nUnited States of America is more important than whatever is customary \nbetween the IAEA and other parties.\n  So I think this is a very dangerous deal. I am very disappointed that \nwe don't have a chance to have a clean up-or-down vote on this as we \nshould have. But it is important for companies thinking about doing \nbusiness with Iran and countries around the world to realize this is a \ndeal between the current administration and Iran and it does not \nnecessarily succeed this administration. No. 2, if the President goes \nahead and lifts sanctions, he will be doing it in violation of the law \nhe signed.\n  This is not over, and we should not be giving up.\n\n[[Page S6666]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6666-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6666-S6668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REAUTHORIZATION OF THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on another topic, \nand that is the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Senator \nCantwell is going to be here shortly, and I thank her for her strong \nleadership. We will also be hearing at some point from Senator \nMcCaskill and Senator Heitkamp. This has been a bipartisan effort. I \nthank the other Senators who have joined in this fight--Senator Graham \nand Senator Kirk.\n  The reason I am here today is to say that America needs to be a \ncountry that exports, a country that thinks, that invents, that builds \nthings, and that exports to the world. When 95 percent of the world's \ncustomers live outside of our borders, there is literally a world of \nopportunity out there for U.S. businesses. We simply can't afford to \npass this up.\n  We know there are about 85 credit export agencies in over 60 other \ncountries. So all of these other countries, over 60 countries--major \ndeveloped nations--have an Ex-Im type bank. Our businesses in the \nUnited States are competing against companies in those countries, so \nwhen they are bidding against each other for a contract, the companies \nin the other countries can say: Well, I may not be a huge business, I \nam a small business, but I know I can get financing from my country's \nbank--whether they are in Germany or whether they are in China.\n  Do you know what our companies have to say right now? Well, the Ex-Im \nBank's charter has lapsed. We can't get financing.\n  And if you don't think their competitors know this--their competitors \nknow it. We have already heard that they have lost contracts because of \nthis shortsightedness of letting the Ex-Im Bank lapse. So they are \ncompeting against these foreign businesses that are backed by other \ncountries' credit export programs, and they often also receive \ngovernment subsidies. So why, I ask, would we want to make it harder \nfor our own companies to compete across the globe and create jobs right \nhere at home?\n  In 2014, the Ex-Im Bank provided support for $27 billion worth of \nU.S. exports. That sounds like a lot, but in the same year--are you \nready for this?--China financed more than double that amount, $58 \nbillion. So their Ex-Im type bank financed $58 billion, ours only did \n$27 billion, and now we are not doing anything. South Korea and Germany \nhave already provided more support for their exports than we have in \nthe United States of America.\n  So if we don't get this done and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, \ncountries like China are going to eat our lunch. That is why I am \nurging my colleagues to include the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank \nin the spending bills we must pass to keep the government open and \nrunning. If we want to level the playing field for our businesses, we \nneed to have the U.S. Ex-Im Bank open and running too. This is about \njobs.\n  In June I led a meeting of the Steering and Outreach Committee on the \nimportance of the Ex-Im Bank. Several of my colleagues were at that \nmeeting, too, and I will tell you what we heard. We heard from small \nbusiness owners from all over the country. They did not mince words. \nFrankly, they were furious and frustrated after watching some Members \nof Congress throw up roadblock after roadblock and refuse to do the \ncommonsense thing--reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. These small business \nowners, like the many small business owners I have met in my State, \ntold me the Ex-Im Bank is essential for their ability to export. Many \nof these smaller businesses don't have an expert on every country in \nthe world. They rely on the Ex-Im Bank to help them with that \nexpertise, to get the financing. And what do they get now? This is what \nthey get. This is what is on the Web site right now of the Ex-Im Bank:\n\n       Due to a lapse in EXIM Bank's authority, as of July 1, \n     2015, the Bank is unable to process applications or engage in \n     new business or other activities. For more information, \n     please click here.\n\n  Then you click here, and it says:\n\n       To Customers and Stakeholders of the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States:--\n\n  This is the United States of America. It says--\n\n       Due to a lapse in our authority, as of midnight on June \n     30th the Export-Import Bank of the United States ceased \n     processing new applications or engaging in new business.\n       Last week, Congress adjourned for their August recess \n     without reauthorizing EXIM. Both the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives return to Washington on September 8th. This \n     means that EXIM will focus on the management of our $107 \n     billion portfolio . . .\n\n  But they cannot do anything new.\n  Guess who else is reading that. Our foreign competitors, companies \nand countries all over the world. They are able to show the people for \nwhom they are bidding: Look what happens when you go to the Ex-Im type \nfinancing site in the United States. Guess what it says. It says: \nSorry, we are lapsed; we can't do anything.\n  That is what these companies from other countries are seeing.\n  We heard from Boyle Energy Services in New Hampshire, Air Tractor in \nTexas, the Orbital Sciences Corporation in Virginia, and FirmGreen in \nCalifornia. Most were headed up by Republican CEOs. They all said the \nsame thing--that Ex-Im Bank has been critical in building their \nbusinesses and supporting their ability to export all over the world. \nMany of them told us they would lose business, not be able to enter \ninto contracts, and may even have to lay off workers if they lose the \nsupport of the Ex-Im Bank. And now it is not just the possibility of \nhaving to lay off workers; that is actually happening in our country \ndue to this problem with the Ex-Im Bank.\n  At the end of June when the Ex-Im Bank expired, there were nearly 200 \ntransactions totaling over $9 billion in financing pending. Letting the \nEx-Im Bank's charter lapse meant lost contracts and layoffs. It means \nEuropean and Chinese workers will be doing the jobs Americans are now \ndoing.\n  My colleagues, I don't think we can wait any longer. I will put in \nthe Record the evidence from my own State and what it has meant in my \nown State.\n  Every year I visit all 87 counties in Minnesota and I meet with all \nkinds of small business owners. One thing that I find over and over is \nthat these small businesses are exporting and many are using the Ex-Im \nBank to provide them with the expertise they need to enter new markets \nall over the world and the vital loans, loan guarantees or credit \ninsurance they need to access these markets.\n  The list of Minnesota companies that have told me of their strong \nsupport for the Ex-Im Bank is long. Let me share a few examples.\n  I have met with the people at Balzer--an agricultural equipment \nmanufacturer based in Mountain Lake--a town of 2,000. They told me that \nthey have grown their exports to about 15 percent of total sales with \nthe help of the Ex-Im Bank. They export from Canada to Kazakhstan--from \nJapan to Australia--and now South Africa too.\n  With the help of the Ex-Im Bank, Superior Industries in Morris has \nbeen able to export to Canada, Australia, Russia, Argentina, Chile, \nUruguay, and Brazil.\n  I have heard from the Trade Acceptance Group in Edina which provides \ncredit insurance to businesses that export. They rely on the Ex-Im \nBank. I heard from Fastenal and Miller Ingenuity, both from Winona. \nThey told me how the Ex-Im Bank helped them reach new markets in \nMexico, Indonesia, and Africa. And the list goes on.\n  The Ex-Im Bank was helping these small businesses from all over \nMinnesota and all over the country compete and export globally. These \nare success stories and we need more of them. There are success stories \nlike this in every State. And these are the stories we want to hear--\nnot stories about losing jobs and business opportunities to Europe and \nChina.\n  I have given speeches on this before. We cannot wait any longer. We \nneed to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank now.\n  I will end with this, as I see Senator Cantwell, our great leader on \nthis, is in the Chamber. The Ex-Im Bank has been reauthorized 16 times \nin its 81-year history, every time with broad bipartisan majorities, \nand Ex-Im has the support this year. The Senate has voted twice with \nbipartisan support to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, and over 250 House \nMembers have cosponsored bills supporting the Ex-Im Bank.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n  The time is here. It is time to stop playing procedural games, get \nthis reauthorized so our great U.S. companies no longer have to go to a \nWeb site that says: Due to a lapse of authority, the Export-Import Bank \nof the United States is unable to process applications or engage in new \nbusiness.\n  We are all about new business in this country. That is what we have \nalways been all about. So it is time to change that Web site, and we do \nit by reauthorizing Ex-Im.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher work and her leadership position in the Senate and for focusing on \neconomic policy and constantly doing the research and legwork on how \nour economy is moving forward and what key essentials we need to move \nforward. The fact that she is here this morning to speak about the \nExport-Import Bank and the fact that the lapse of the Bank itself is \ncausing us great economic challenge--I certainly very much appreciate \neverything she is doing. She comes from a State that has businesses \nthat are exporters. Minnesota has a lot of exporters, so she knows this \nis causing a big challenge.\n  I know my colleague Senator Heitkamp, who is an original sponsor of \nthis legislation, is speaking out on this issue as well. I think \nSenator McCaskill may be joining us this morning.\n  I don't know if the American people know, but many of our colleagues \nknow that the Export-Import Bank is tooled to help U.S. manufacturers \nexport products overseas by financing the deals--not really financing \nthem so much as basically helping private banks finance them when the \nbanks won't take all the risk. The program works just like the SBA--the \nSmall Business Administration--does to help small businesses with bank \nfinancing. This helps businesses that are trying to export their \nproducts overseas get financing where these developing countries may \nnot have banks to do that. So it has expired, which means it is cutting \noff economic opportunity here in the United States to grow jobs.\n  When we think about it, with 90 percent of consumers living outside \nof the United States, the biggest economic opportunity for our country \nis to sell those consumers products that the United States of America \nmakes. But we have to have financing for developing countries.\n  There are 478 Ex-Im Bank guarantees and credit insurance policies \nworth $3.2 billion set to expire October 1. If we don't quickly \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank, that money will be lost. And those \nare programs that are already underway. As this shows, there are 116 \npending deals--deals we could do, deals we could get approved. That \nwould be basically $9.3 billion in revenue to those companies, and \nobviously companies could grow their economic bottom line.\n  In my visits with companies in the State of Washington, I have seen \nthat a lot of businesses are looking at maybe 20 percent of their \nrevenues coming from overseas markets, so having the Ex-Im Bank helps \nthem reach new market opportunities. Every time I talk to them--what \nhappens if this program goes away and you can't get financing? Most of \nthem will say: That 20 percent of our business will result in layoffs--\nthose people who are associated with that business.\n  So right now what we need to do is to help these businesses that are \nin their fourth quarter have the certainty and guarantee that we are \ngoing to compete on the playing field of what is called a global \neconomy. If you are not interested in that, if you think we are just \ngoing to make U.S. products and sell them to U.S. people, I guess that \ncould be your strategy. I think it is a wrongheaded strategy.\n  So we are here today to talk about how this is impacting small \nbusinesses, big businesses, and what we need to do to get this \nreauthorized.\n  Why are we here this morning? Because yesterday we heard news from a \nmajor manufacturer that basically talked specifically about what is \ngoing to happen. It is not that the Koch brothers are going to win or \nthe Heritage Foundation is going to win; it is that companies such as \nGE and others are going to ship their jobs overseas so they can get \nfinancing for the manufactured products they make. So what happened? GE \nbasically has said it has been forced to move 500 jobs from the U.S. to \nFrance, China, and Hungary. Why? Why are they moving jobs overseas? \nBecause they still have a credit agency. France has one and is willing \nto provide export financing as a major component of wind turbines that \nwould otherwise have been built in the United States. Altogether, GE \nhas $11 billion in contracts that require export credit agency support. \nSo they are going to meet customer demand.\n  I worked in business for 5 years. I know what it is like to build and \nship a product to meet customer demand. They cannot sit around and wait \nfor Congress to stop catering to special interests to get their \ncustomer applications filled. They either do it or they lose business. \nAnd that is what is happening today--the American economy is losing \nbusiness because people here are playing politics with an important \ntool that helps U.S. manufacturers.\n  GE isn't the only one. Boeing is also facing job loss. On July 31, \nBoeing announced that it had lost a contract for communications \nsatellite ABS-8, which will provide service to millions of people in \nthe Asia-Pacific region. We know this is important business, satellite \ncommunication. Think about the developing world in places such as the \nPacific islands, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Zealand, Papua New \nGuinea. This company specifically cited Ex-Im's lapse as the reason \nthey did something else besides going with a U.S. manufacturer. These \nsatellites will still be launched. There will be massive growth in the \nmiddle class of Asia that demands it, and they will continue to get a \nproduct. It just won't be from a U.S. manufacturer. Why? Because we \nhave chosen to let the Export-Import Bank fail.\n  All in all, this Export-Import Bank is on track to support 58,000 \nfewer jobs in 2015--jobs that, if they were able to operate, they would \nbe able to continue. So the fact is that Boeing and GE may be hurting, \nbut they will come up with strategies that work well for them because \nthat is what you do when you are a big company--you figure out how to \ncompete. But the small businesses in America that might be the job \nengine of growth for the future are not so easily able to move their \ncompany or move overseas to get the financing. For example, since 2007 \nExport-Import Bank has supported more than 230 business exporters in \nthe State of Washington. Two thirds of those are small businesses. So \nthese companies aren't going to be able to all of a sudden stop what \nthey are doing, go to France or go to another country, and start a \nmanufacturing facility just to get credit agency support. The damage \nthat is being done to small businesses in America right now is acute, \nand we need to make sure we get this export agency reauthorized.\n  An example of this: My colleague Senator Merkley and I visited Bob's \nRed Mill. I think that about everybody in America, if they don't know \nBob's Red Mill, knows they have bought a product from Bob's Red Mill \nwhen they have gone and bought oatmeal or grains. It has grown their \nexport revenue about 35 percent since they started working with the \nExport-Import Bank in 2012. Think about that: Those consumers--90 \npercent outside of the United States--want to basically consume more \nproducts like Bob's Red Mill, a great product. I personally think these \nare the kinds of things the United States ought to be focusing on. We \nare still number one in agriculture. We still should be focused on \nshipping agriculture products to developing markets around the world. \nThis is one of the biggest and easiest opportunities, feeding the world \nwith a product like Bob's Red Mill. But no, no, no. Bob's Red Mill will \nlose business because they will not have an export authority. I doubt \nthat Bob at his age--a great man, a very vibrant guy at 80-some years \nold--is going to start a business somewhere else in Europe or in Africa \njust to export to that market and try to get the financing.\n  Texas-based Air Tractor will lose up to 25 percent of their sales \nbecause the Export-Import Bank is stopping. Pennsylvania-based \nPrecision Custom Components, which manufactures parts for the nuclear \nindustry, says it has over 100 jobs linked to their ability to service \npeople with export-import financing.\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\n  This is a loss of real jobs. When people talk about what we are \ndealing with in our fiscal crisis--the fact that people are talking \nabout shutting down Government--to me, if you want to be a good fiscal \nsteward, then reinstitute the Export-Import Bank.\n  In 2014 alone, Export-Import Bank paid $675 million into our \nTreasury. That is deficit reduction. In fact, in the previous 5 years, \nit had generated somewhere around $5 billion in deficit reduction. Not \nonly are we taking away a key tool, where are you going to plug the \nhole in our budget from the hundreds of millions of dollars this year--\nto say nothing of next year and the next year--that you don't have from \nkilling the Export-Import Bank? People need to realize, these people--\nsmall businesses, big organizations seeking financing--have to pay a \nfee. That fee generates revenue. That revenue is used to pay down the \nFederal deficit. Not only do we create jobs and not only do we reach \nmarket access, we actually have a government program that is helping us \npay down the Federal deficit.\n  Why would you not want to reinstitute that? The good news is that the \nSenate voted to do that. From what I hear, there are enough people in \nthe House of Representatives. People have continued to hold this \nprogram hostage because people are anxious about the politics of the \nHeritage Foundation, the Koch brothers, or people sending out emails or \nchallenging them when in reality you just need to stand up and speak \nfor the fact that you want U.S. job creation, and you believe that U.S. \nmanufacturers making and building a product and selling it overseas is \na winning economic strategy for the United States of America. It is. To \nboot, it pays down the deficit. We know that American businesses are \nobviously working hard to try to communicate this. Everybody from the \nmanufacturers association to individual workforce organizations is \ntrying to express this. I know my colleague Senator Heitkamp has been \nworking very hard on this on the banking committee.\n  With just a short period of time left before whatever this proposal \nis to shut down the government, which I certainly don't support, we \nhave to say to our colleagues that you either have to get this on the \nhighway bill--which it is as part of a package that we passed out of \nthe Senate--and get either the package that was passed here in the \nSenate passed by the House or come up with another vehicle that gets \nthis done, as my colleague from Minnesota just suggested, on the \ncontinuing resolution or some other bill so that we actually know we \nare giving American businesses the opportunity to continue to compete.\n  I hope we will get a long-term solution here. The fact that we have \nsent this message around the United States and the world--that there is \nno longer financing available--has really hurt our competitive \nopportunity at a time when America needs to embrace the fact that there \nis so much business in these developing middle-class markets around the \nglobe.\n  You can sit here and trade away our opportunity to compete by saying \nI don't want U.S. job creation or deficit reduction. Instead, I want to \nship jobs overseas. I don't get the strategy. I don't get what someone \nthinks is smart about allowing U.S. jobs to be shipped overseas just \nbecause they can't get financing here. If the market were willing to \ntake those risks without some of the security put forth here, obviously \npeople would want to see that. But that is not happening because if you \nare selling grain silos like we are to African nations, there is no \nbank there that is financing that deal. If you are selling product to \nAsian countries that are just developing, whether it is seafood or \nwhether it is grain like Bob's Red Mill, they are not always able to \nget financing. This is a way for the United States to win. All we have \nto do is embrace this and make sure that we pass the Export-Import Bank \nas soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nWashington for taking the floor and supporting the reauthorization of \nthe Export-Import Bank. She has been diligent in coming to Congress and \nexplaining that this agency not only facilitates exports from the \nUnited States, which creates jobs and helps businesses here, but it \nalso generates a surplus for the Treasury. What is wrong with that \npicture? Why would the Republicans be so opposed to an agency that \nhelps American businesses, large and small, export more goods and \ndoesn't cost the Federal Government any money? Why do they want to kill \nthis agency? Why do they want to kill these jobs? I don't understand \nit.\n  We had a vote on the floor of the Senate a few weeks ago on the \nTransportation bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank and it \npassed. We sent it over to the House of Representatives which, sadly, \nhas become the graveyard for big issues, important issues when it comes \nto the future of America. I hope it changes. I hope they will listen to \nbusiness leaders--that Republicans in the House will listen to business \nleaders and not just Boeing aircraft. Of course I am interested in \nthat. It is headquartered in Chicago and is a major employer in the \nUnited States, but large and small companies alike feel the same. \nExport-Import Bank gives our companies in America the ability to \nfinance export deals so they can compete with other countries.\n  When we decide--or at least some in the Senate decide--to take the \nUnited States out of the export business, who is going to step in? Who \nwill take over and create the jobs? Sadly, our competitors, China. They \nare not waiting around for their legislature, whatever it may be, to \ngive permission for them to dramatically increase exports. They are on \nthe road to do that. I support what the Senator from Washington said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6668-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6668-S6669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on the floor we are going to return in a \nfew minutes to the debate on the Iran agreement. This agreement, of \ncourse, has been in the works for a long time. President Obama set out \nto create a set of sanctions, punishment against Iran to force them to \ncome to the table and to negotiate with us and other nations so they \nwould not develop a nuclear weapon. The President invested a lot of \ncapital in it, and it worked. Congress imposed sanctions. The President \nimposed sanctions.\n  The day came when the negotiations started, and we weren't sitting \nalone at the table. It is an amazing alliance of nations trying to stop \nIran from developing a nuclear weapon. It included China, Russia, the \nUnited Kingdom, Germany, France, and the European Union. They all \njoined us in the sanctions, and many others too. But they joined us at \nthe negotiating table, and they worked with us until we reached an \nagreement. That agreement didn't rely on trusting the Iranians. No. It \nrelied on inspectors, real inspectors from the United Nations who have \na sterling reputation. It was those inspectors who warned us before we \ninvaded Iraq that there were no weapons of mass destruction. The Bush-\nCheney administration paid no attention. We paid a heavy price for that \ndereliction of duty.\n  Now these inspectors are in place--will be when this agreement moves \nforward. We can not only find out what is going on in Iran when it \ncomes to nuclear weapons, we can make sure we discourage them from ever \nviolating this treaty or agreement. Should they violate it, \nautomatically the sanctions will snap back. In fact, it takes only the \nvote of the United States in the Security Council of the United Nations \nfor all of the sanctions to come back on Iran if they break the treaty. \nInspectors, snapback on sanctions, and I hope it results in what we \nwant to see: No. 1, stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and No. \n2, avoid the United States from going to war again in the Middle East. \nThose are our two goals.\n  Those who oppose this agreement come to the floor and say: Stop it. \nDon't do it. Walk away from it. It is nothing but bad.\n  Every single Republican in the House and Senate--every single one of \nthem--has come out against this agreement. Not one is supporting it. It \nshouldn't surprise us.\n  On March 9, 2015, 47 Republican Senators sent a letter to the \nAyatollah Khamenei. Do you know what they\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nsaid? Don't negotiate with the United States of America. Don't \nnegotiate with this President or other nations. Whatever you do is \ngoing to be subject to congressional review. There is no guarantee we \nwill support it. Even if it is supported by Congress, there is no \nguarantee that any future President would enforce this agreement.\n  You may even hear it tonight in the Republican Presidential candidate \ndebate. Isn't it interesting that this was the first time in the \nhistory of the United States, the very first time that a group of \nSenators intervened in a Presidential negotiation in national \nsecurity--the first time that has ever happened. And 47 Republican \nSenators, including every Member of the leadership, signed that letter. \nWhat would happen if 47 Democrats had sent a letter to Saddam Hussein \nprior to the invasion of Iraq saying: Don't pay any attention to \nPresident Bush. What do you think the reaction of Vice President Cheney \nwould have been? He would have had us all up on charges--treason. That \nis exactly what happened here. There was a letter from 47 Republican \nSenators saying: Don't negotiate with the United States. The President \nignored it. The negotiations continued.\n  The agreement is before us. There was a key vote last week, a \ncritical vote. Every single Member of the Senate has publicly declared \nwhere they stand on this agreement. After some 8 weeks of deliberation \nand debate, the vote took place last week, but it wasn't enough for \nSenator McConnell. He demanded that we replay the vote last night. We \ndid, with the same result.\n  I don't know how many times he is going to bring this before us, but \nmay I suggest to the Republican leader there are some items that he \nmight consider moving to. We are 8 legislative days away from shutting \ndown the Government of the United States. Should we be discussing that? \nMost Americans would say so. Most Americans think it is embarrassing \nthat the U.S. Government would shut down because a willful group--a \nsmall minority--is determined to get that done. Too many people suffer \nwhen that happens. We have to do everything we can to keep this \ngovernment open.\n  Let's get beyond this debate. We have already established what the \nvote is, and the Republicans didn't come up with the 60 votes necessary \nto move forward. That is the story. They don't like the ending, but \nthat is the ending. Let's move forward in a responsible way to do two \nthings--first, to make sure that Iran lives up to this agreement and do \neverything in our power to enforce it, and second, get on with the \nbusiness of government. Let's fund this government. Let's not become a \nnation that people look at and say: Who is in charge here if a \nRepublican Congress would shut down a government for a second time, as \nthey did a couple of years ago? Who is in charge? Let's get into that \nissue and let's do it in a responsible and a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6669-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REAUTHORIZATION OF THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about something very \nimportant to small businesses in Missouri. Ironically, tonight there is \ngoing to be a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. I hear \na lot of talk from my friends on the other side of the aisle about \nsmall businesses, but here we are today confronting the failure and the \njob losses associated with our not embracing the Export-Import Bank. \nPresident Eisenhower, President Ford, President Reagan, President \nGeorge Bush--both President George Bushes.\n  This was not controversial, and it is really easy to understand why. \nThe Export-Import Bank has never been controversial. This is a credit \nagency. There are 60 other credit agencies around the world that \nsupport companies in their countries--60 around the world. It is not a \nlevel playing field in the global economy if America decides to no \nlonger support our manufacturing economy and the small businesses \nassociated with that by removing this important tool for exports. It is \nreal jobs. This is not fairytale stuff, and this is not crony \ncapitalism. This is an analysis of risks done by a credit agency and \nthat credit agency, when it analyzes the risk, can keep track of it. We \ncan figure out if in fact they are taking good risks or if in fact it \nis scratching somebody's back by virtue of the fact that $7 billion has \nbeen put in our Treasury after the Bank has covered its expenses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). All time for morning business \nhas expired.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for a couple more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. In 2014 this credit agency that all the other \ncountries in the world have access to put $674 million in the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  Let me count off here. It creates jobs, supports manufacturing, and \nadds money into our Treasury. What is the problem?\n  My staff and I have met with nearly 100 companies in Missouri, and 90 \npercent of Ex-Im's work directly supports small businesses. I will say \nthat again: 90 percent supports small businesses.\n  I will give a couple of examples. There is a small company in Joplin, \nMO. These kids started it in their garage. They build skateboard parks. \nThey now have a manufacturing facility, and they are manufacturing \nskateboard parks which are exported around the world. They can't go to \ntheir local community bank to help their customer in Indonesia. They \nneed what other countries have--a credit agency that analyzes risk on a \nglobal basis.\n  I toured a small Kansas City company now run by the third generation \nof the same family. They rely on Ex-Im Bank to help them manage their \nrisk of extending credit in foreign markets. Sixty percent of their \nsales are exports. Do we want to shutter this company? Is that what we \nwant to do? Do we want them to have to cut their employee base by 60 \npercent because they can no longer export?\n  There is a St. Louis company that makes cutting-edge play equipment \nfor children and uses the insurance from Ex-Im Bank to work with \ncustomers in South America, Australia, and beyond. There is another \nsmall St. Louis manufacturer that was founded as a family-owned company \nin 1951 that sells electrical components to Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and \nThailand. They depend on Ex-Im Bank.\n  What is going on in this place? How has this become controversial? \nThis was never been controversial, and there is one representative that \nis in a key position in the House of Representatives that is shutting \nthis whole thing down. The American people ought to be outraged. We can \nvote on Iran as many times as you guys want us to if it makes everybody \nfeel better. I have no problem with that. It was a tough decision for \nme. I made up my mind. But to be wasting time on political posturing \nwhen these jobs--and I have real examples of contracts that aren't \ngoing through now because Ex-Im is not there.\n  I plead with my friends on the other side of the aisle: Make time in \nyour busy schedule of scoring political points on the Iranian agreement \nto reauthorize Export-Import Bank. Jobs in my State depend on it. Yes, \nwe have unemployment down to 5 percent in this country, but that \ndoesn't mean we shouldn't still focus on jobs every day in the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor and ask for the help of all my \nRepublican colleagues to help us get Ex-Im Bank across the finish line \nso small businesses in this country do not suffer at the hands of \nglobal competition that figures out that this ought to be easy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6669-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the agreement \nbefore us. I find in this line of work that repetition is sometimes \nuseful. I know my friend from Illinois mentioned how we ought to be \nfocused on something else, but I think all of us understand that there \nis an assumed deadline on this topic, which is set for tomorrow.\n  I say to my friends on both sides of the aisle that the likelihood is \nthat after tomorrow we will move on to the other types of business that \nwe need to deal with. But this is not, as my friend from Missouri \nmentioned, an issue of political points. The issue with Iran is one of \nthe most significant, if not the most significant, foreign policy issue \nthat we will likely deal with while we are here in the Senate. I think \nit is important, while this is before us, to spend as much time as \npossible talking about this issue, focusing on this issue, debating \nthis issue, and making sure that everyone understands what the contents \nof this Iranian deal are.\n  I will walk through it, if I could for a few moments, and lay out why \nwe are where we are today.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is new here and brings a wealth of \nnational security experience from previous posts that he had with the \nState Department prior to serving here. But what brought us here really \nwas this body acting almost in a unanimous way to put sanctions in \nplace four times since 2010. We worked with the House of \nRepresentatives to put sanctions in place because we knew that Iran was \ndoing things, such as nuclear development, that were going to be \ndamaging to the world. So we sanctioned and punished them. We put \ncrippling sanctions on their economy, and we did that collectively.\n  This is something that very few people on either side of the aisle \nobjected to. We acted in unison. It was the crippling sanctions that we \nput together that really brought Iran to the table. Let's face it. \nTheir economy and standard of living were causing people in Iran to \nbecome restless, and so finally Iran said: OK, it is time to talk.\n  When these talks began, our President stated that what we would do in \nthese talks was to end Iran's nuclear program. And just for what it is \nworth, I think people on both sides of the aisle celebrated that goal--\nending Iran's nuclear program.\n  I might remind people who may be just tuning into this that Iran has \n19,000 centrifuges right now, and 10,000 of those are operating. They \nbuilt underground bunkers at a place called Fordow. It is hard to get \nto it. It is hard to take those out with munitions, if you will. They \nbuilt a plutonium facility called Arak.\n  By the way, much of this was done in a clandestine way. All of it was \ndone violating U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  I will say everyone here understands fully that Iran has zero \npractical need for any of this. Iran has one nuclear facility. Everyone \nknows that it would be so much cheaper for them to just purchase \nenriched uranium to fuel that one facility. But they say: No, we want \nto be leaders in medical isotopes. For what it is worth, if Iran really \nwanted to develop the expertise around medical isotopes, they would \nhave 500 centrifuges. So we all know that the purpose of this program \nhas not been for civilian purposes. It has been to cause them to be a \nthreshold nuclear country. We know that. Everyone knows that. They know \nthat, we know that, and every country involved in the discussions with \nIran knows that.\n  First of all, we know what their goals are. So when the President \nsays that in these negotiations what we are going to do is end Iran's \nnuclear program, I think most people in this body would celebrate that. \nSo he began the discussions, and as he started moving along, it became \nvery apparent to those of us paying attention that what he planned to \ndo was to enter into what is called an executive agreement.\n  Now, for people who don't do what we do on a daily basis, there are \nthree ways that the President can enter into an international \nagreement. One way is through a treaty that requires a two-thirds \napproval by this body. A treaty is interesting because it binds future \nPresidents, and it binds future Congresses. But the President decided \nthat was not the route he was going to take.\n  There is a second route he could have taken, and that is called a \ncongressional-executive Agreement. While it is not as strong as a \ntreaty, it does create a law that is binding on future Presidents and \nfuture Congresses. The President decided he was not going to go that \nroute.\n  The President decided that he was going to do this unilaterally, \nthrough what is called an Executive agreement. As we know, an Executive \nagreement is something the President can do, if he chooses, on his own. \nThe problem with it is that it doesn't survive his Presidency. Another \nPresident can do something very different.\n  In this case, however, as everybody has analyzed this deal, everyone \nunderstands that we lose all of our leverage over the next 9 months and \ngive it away. When people in this body began to realize that we brought \nIran to the table--or at least played a heavy role in bringing them to \nthe table--and that the President was going to use what is called a \nnational security waiver to waive away all the congressional sanctions \nso that he could enter into this Executive agreement without ever \ntalking to us, we achieved something else that was very important. As a \nmatter of fact, this is the first time this has happened since I have \nbeen in the Senate, and there are a lot of misunderstandings about it. \nFor the first time in Congress since I have been in the Senate--on a \nstrongly bipartisan basis--we took power back from the President. We \nsaid: Mr. President, we know that you can enter into Executive \nagreements, but in this particular case, since we put the sanctions in \nplace that brought them to the table--by the way, over your \nobjections--we want a chance to go through this agreement in detail, \nand we want the right to either approve or disapprove. But you have to \npresent us with this, and it has to sit before us for 60 days, which it \nwill have done as of tomorrow, and we want the right to weigh in as to \nwhether we believe the substance of this deal is good for our Nation.\n  We had 98 Senators in this body vote for this. One of the Senators \nwho was absent supported it, and that makes it 99. It is pretty \nremarkable that on a bipartisan basis 99 Senators said: No, we want \nthis to lie before us because we believe this is one of the biggest \nforeign policy issues we are going to deal with, we believe that this \nis a vote of conscience, and we believe that every Senator and every \nHouse Member--which is unusual with these kind of agreements--should \nweigh in and be able to voice their opinion.\n  So we have gone through the deal, and what is fascinating about it \nis--I hate to be pejorative, but we had almost unanimity on putting \nsanctions in place to bring them to the table. We had almost unanimity \non the fact that we should be able to weigh in. It is my strong belief \nthat in lieu of the President achieving the deal that he did or the \ngoals that he stated to end Iran's nuclear program, obviously, we have \ndone anything but that.\n  So what has happened is we have totally squandered an opportunity to\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nunite this Nation, and others, around ending their program. Instead, \nour Nation, with other ``great nations'' have agreed to allow Iran not \nonly to not end their program but to industrialize it. We have agreed \nto let them develop intercontinental ballistic missiles so they can \ndeliver a nuclear weapon. We agreed to let them do research and \ndevelopment.\n  Right now they are using the old IR-1 centrifuges, which are like \nantiques, but we are going to allow them to do research and development \non the IR-2s, IR-4s, IR-6s, and IR-8s, which we know are multiple times \nfaster. We have lifted the conventional weapons embargo and the \nballistic weapons embargo, for some reason, just throwing it in for \ngood measure. We are allowing them, for the first time, to begin \ntesting.\n\n  So what has happened is now in this body, there is some tepid \nsupport--I see my friend from Michigan, I have other friends, and I \nhaven't heard anybody come out and say this is a great agreement. What \nthey are saying--not necessarily the Senator from Michigan but others--\nis, well, we are where we are. We are where we are.\n  This is not a very good agreement. It is flawed. Even though \nCongress, 200 times, has sent international agreements back to the \nexecutive branch--200 times--in this case: We are where we are. And our \nfriends in Russia--by the way, has anybody seen what our friends in \nRussia are doing in Syria right now? Yes, they are really good friends. \nHas anybody seen what China is doing right now in the South China Sea? \nThey are building their third airstrip, claiming territory that for \nthousands of years has belonged to other countries from the standpoint \nof territorial waters. People are saying--our friends and allies--what \nwill we do about our friends and allies?\n  So here is where we are. I could go on and on. I just cannot believe \nthat our great Nation, with ``our friends'' from Great Britain, \nGermany, and France and ``our friends'' from China and Russia, \nsquandered--squandered--an opportunity, had a rogue nation with a boot \non its neck--a boot on its neck--we squandered the opportunity. Now, \nwith our approval, they can industrialize their program. As a matter of \nfact, they don't have to violate the terms of this deal. They can just \nhonor the terms of this deal. Their economy will flourish. By the way, \nit is hard for me to believe this, but I think most people understand \nthat we are giving them back $100 billion. We are going to do that over \nthe next 9 months. We are lifting the major sanctions that have \ncrippled them. We are doing that without us even asking them to do \nmuch. From that point on, by the way, the leverage shifts from us to \nthem.\n  We are very concerned about what they are doing in Syria. By the way, \nthey have doubled down on that since the agreement was reached with the \nnuclear file. We are very concerned about what they are doing with \nHezbollah in Lebanon. We are very concerned about what they are doing \nwith Hamas, allowing rockets to be fired into Israel. We are very \nconcerned about what they are doing in Lebanon with the Houthis. We are \nvery concerned about what they are doing in Bahrain with thousands of \nmen and women in uniform trying to keep the strait open. We are very \nconcerned about that, but in 9 months, if we express our concerns, what \nare they going to do? They are going to say: We have all of our money, \nyou have lifted all the sanctions, and if you press back against us for \nterrorism or human rights or violations in this agreement that are \nminor, we are just going to start a nuclear program again. So it is \nkind of unbelievable that we have ended up in this place.\n  What is happening on the floor now, just to explain to the American \npeople, we have a process in the Senate which says that at the end of \ndebate--by the way, we have had a lot of debate on this. We have had 12 \nhearings in the Foreign Relations Committee alone. The Presiding \nOfficer serves on the Committee on Armed Services and they have had \nhearings. The Intelligence Committee has had hearings. We have had \nhearings as a body. We have had personal meetings. As a matter of fact, \nI would say this body knows more about this international agreement \nthan any international agreement in modern times. As a matter of fact, \nthanks to us pushing back against this administration, the American \npeople know more about this agreement than any agreement in modern \ntimes. It is amazing. Thank goodness we passed the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act; otherwise, none of this would be known--none of \nthis.\n  So where we are today is we all said this was one of the biggest \nforeign policy issues to come before us; we want the American people to \nknow where we stand on the substance of the deal. So for people tuning \nin, here is the way the Senate works.\n  When a vote comes before us--and right now, since there is a strong \nbipartisan majority of people who oppose this deal--as a matter of \nfact, the two most knowledgeable Democrats on foreign policy issues, \nthe ranking member and the former chairman and ranking member, who know \nmore about foreign policy than any Democrat in this body--both oppose \nthis deal. So on a strong bipartisan majority, we have a group of \npeople who think we can do better. Just like the 200-plus times we have \nsent agreements back to say do better, we are saying we think we can do \nbetter.\n  So here is what is happening. When a bill comes or a vote comes \nbefore the Senate, we have these rules, and there is a rule that says \nthere is a cloture vote. What cloture means is that people say: OK. We \nhave heard enough about this. We believe it is time to take a vote.\n  I just heard the Senator from Illinois say we have been talking about \nthis way too long. It is time to move beyond it. He left out a minor \ndetail; that is, it takes 60 Members of the Senate to say we have heard \nenough about it. It is time to vote. But what is happening is that we \nhave 42 Members of one party who are in the minority--42 Senators who \nare saying: No, we are not going to allow this to move to a final vote. \nWe are not going to do it.\n  We know it is not about debate. We know--as a matter of fact, the \nsecond highest officer on the Democratic side says we need to move on \nto other business. It is time to move on to other business, and what we \nneed to do is invoke cloture and let's vote. But let me tell my \ncolleagues what is really happening here. It has sort of taken on--I \nhave said this several times--it has taken on kind of a Tammy Wynette \nkind of flavor: Let's stand by our man. Let's stand by our man. We \ndon't want the President to have to deal with a resolution of \ndisapproval; we want to protect him from that. We don't want to \nembarrass him, that there is a bipartisan--by the way, the smartest, \nmost well-versed, deeply informed on policy Member on his side of the \naisle is agreeing with the vast majority of the Senate--58 Senators--\nsaying this is not good for our Nation because this does not end the \nprogram. By the way, if this ended the program, do we know what would \nbe happening? We would have 100 Senators saying: Let's vote to approve \nthis. This is outstanding. The President achieved his stated goal. But \nsince that isn't the case, what we want to do is send a resolution of \ndisapproval to the President. But we have 42 Senators on the one hand \nsaying let's move on and let's deal with funding government but on the \nother hand are not agreeing to a final vote.\n  So we have one more chance. I just want to say this. We have a lot of \npartisanship that happens here. Let's face it, we do. I get it. It \nhappens. I am going to have to say in this case, the majority leader \nhas allowed me to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nHe has allowed me to move this through in an appropriate way. At every \njuncture--when my friends on the other side of the aisle felt as though \nsomething was occurring that was adding unnecessary temper or maybe \nsomething was getting out of line and we needed to alter our course of \naction--at every juncture, the majority leader said: Senator Corker, if \nyou think this is the best way of moving ahead to keep the \nbipartisanship that I have had with Senator Cardin and Senator Menendez \nand so many others, have at it.\n  I just want to remind people that as we entered this debate--as we \nknow, there are all kinds of inflammatory amendments that could be \nadded to this debate--the leader filled the tree. Now, for people out \nin the listening audience, fill the tree, what does that mean. What he \ndid was he kept any inflammatory amendments from being offered. The \nonly thing that is before\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\nus--I know he has filed an amendment now. After two times, the minority \nwill not let us move to a final vote. I know there is going to be one \nthat is tough--I don't know if it is that tough or not--to vote on this \nThursday, but the fact is that the purpose has been for us to move to a \nfinal vote. Forty-two Senators will not allow us to have that vote of \nconscience. I want to say again to those listening in, the process vote \nof any debate is not a vote of conscience. That is not a vote of \nconscience. The vote of conscience is, when we take the final vote, do \nwe believe that this Iran deal--the President's Iran deal--is something \nthat is good for our country, will create stability in the region, and \ncertainly will keep them from getting a nuclear weapon. Fifty-eight of \nus don't think so. Actually, I have to believe, from listening to the \ncomments of many of my friends when they talk about how flawed it is, I \nthink there is actually a whole lot of concern, even though sometimes--\nand I understand when you have a President of your own party, sometimes \nit is hard to go against the President. I get that. I understand the \npressures that come to play when that happens.\n\n  But where we are, I say to the American people and to my fellow \nSenators, is we want to move to a final vote, an up-or-down vote, \nwhich, by the way, by the rules of the Senate, is a majority vote. We \nwant to move to that. We have 42 Senators who are keeping us from that. \nWhat I hope is going to happen over the course of the next 24 hours is \nthat a couple Senators, a few, will say: Look, we did vote 98 to 1 to \nregister our feelings about the substance of this most important \nagreement. We did. We really did do that. Maybe it is appropriate that \nwe, on behalf of the American people, not get stuck on this procedural \nissue, this cloture vote. We have debated this plenty, so let's go \nahead and move to a final vote. That is what I hope is going to happen.\n  I am thankful, though--I do want to say one more time--I thank people \non both sides of the aisle for having the gumption to buck the \nadministration and to put in place four tranches of sanctions to get \nthem to the table. I thank both sides of the aisle--by the way, led by \nSenators Menendez and Kirk, led by the two of them, one Democrat and \none Republican--we did that together. I thank people on both sides of \nthe aisle for putting us in the position to actually have the \ndocuments, to know what this deal is about, to have this debate, to be \nable to weigh in.\n  I want to say one more time that had the President done what he said \nhe would do--and that is negotiate to end the program--we would have \n100 people supporting it, but he didn't. We all know that. Everyone \nknows that is not what has happened. We have agreed to industrialize \ntheir program, let them do research and development, let them create \ndelivery mechanisms to make sure they can send these nuclear warheads \nthey are going to be on the verge of developing a long way across the \noceans to places such as America and other places. I don't know why we \ndid that, but we did.\n  So now we just want a chance to vote yes or no. Do we believe this is \nan agreement that will stand the test of time? Is it something that is \ngood for our country? Do we believe this is something that if Iran \nwishes to, will keep them from developing a nuclear weapon?\n  I look forward to the comments of my friend from Michigan, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first of all, let me agree with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee that, in \nfact, we did come together on strong sanctions against Iran that has \nbrought us to this situation on a bipartisan basis. We did come \ntogether on the process that would create legislatively a way for us to \nmake a decision. That was done on a bipartisan basis. What I regret is, \nat this point, even though we are following through on the legislative \nprocess we adopted, it now has become so partisan. That is not good for \nAmerica, it is not good for Israel, and it is not good for, frankly, \nthe world to see this happen.\n  So while agreeing on part of what the distinguished chairman said, I \nhave to disagree on many things, although I am not going to take my \ntime to go into them now. But certainly the process we are using is no \ndifferent than any other major bill--health care reform, financial \nservices reform--and it was set up in what we passed. So we can try to \nmake it into some partisan issue now. The reality is we have all \nthoughtfully taken a position. We have voted. Everyone knows everyone's \nposition. So now we are just in the process right now, unfortunately, I \nbelieve, of politics, which does not help us move forward for our \ncountry or for our allies.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2656\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak to an issue I am deeply concerned \nabout, which is the next vote we are going to have on Thursday, and \nspeak to a very important young man who is an American hero and who is \ncaught in the politics of what is happening right now.\n  Amir Hekmati from Flint, MI, is an American hero. He served his \ncountry as a marine between 2001 and 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan. He \nserved with valor. He served with honor. He was awarded the Combat \nAction Ribbon and the Good Conduct Medal. But this morning, Amir woke \nup in an Iranian prison. He has been in that prison for 4 years and 19 \ndays. During that time, Amir has been tortured. The prison is notorious \nfor its deplorable conditions. While he has been there, his father, in \nFlint, MI, has been battling terminal brain cancer.\n\n  The Iranian Government is playing politics with Amir Hekmati's life. \nUnfortunately, though, now, today, the Senate Republican leader is also \nplaying politics with Amir's life. The imprisonment of this veteran, \nthis American hero, is being used by the Senate majority leader in a \ntransparent effort to score some cheap political points, in my \njudgment, and it is appalling. No American should ever be used in this \nway--none of us. This is a young man whose parents are desperately \nworried about his safety, who have been waking up every day for the \nlast 1,479 days hoping this would be the day they would learn their son \nAmir would be freed. How does it show respect to Amir's mom and dad to \nuse their son's plight and possibly even threaten the negotiations that \nare going on now in order to make a partisan political point and \njeopardize his release?\n  We have had a rigorous debate on the international Iran agreement, \nand I know from talking to colleagues and being in many meetings that \nthose on our side have been very thoughtful and thorough--and certainly \nthe chairman has as well--in coming to our positions in a highly \ncharged, difficult, and very complicated situation. I spent many weeks \nin classified briefings, meetings with nuclear experts, meetings with \nthe Ambassadors, and personally calling each of those involved in the \nnegotiations in the P5+1 countries, meeting with constituents in \nMichigan who feel very passionately about this issue on both sides, and \nI have made my decision--the decision I believe is best for America, \nfor Israel, and for our allies. I did not make my decision on the day \nthe agreement was announced, before I had ever read it, or even before \nit was announced--regrettably, as many Republican colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate did.\n  We have had a vote in the Senate. We have now had two votes on this \nissue. Today or tomorrow we will have a third vote, not because the \nmajority leader is expecting a different result--we have all taken our \npositions--but because he wants to score political points and bring in \nas part of that vote four American hostages and what is happening to \nthem. Those political points will be scored at the expense of Amir \nHekmati from Flint, MI, who has served his country honorably.\n  Mr. President, I have gotten to know the Hekmati family, and I know \nhow much their son's freedom means to them. Any of us who have children \ncan understand what they are going through. I have personally talked \nwith the President and other officials at the highest levels of our \ngovernment who are working tirelessly to secure Amir Hekmati's release \nand return him to his loving family, along with the other Americans \nheld hostage.\n  This is a diplomatic mission. It is a humanitarian mission. Yet the \nmajority leader is on a political mission that is not going to help. He \nwants to interfere with and disrupt the international\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nnuclear agreement with Iran. I understand that. I understand his and \nothers' position. But they are willing to use Amir and other American \nhostages in the process, and that is wrong. This political stunt by the \nmajority leader does not help bring Amir home. It doesn't help bring \nthe other three Americans home. It just adds more politics to the \nsituation.\n  What is very disturbing to me, after always having bipartisan \nsupport--one of the things I could always say to my constituents was \nthat when it comes to the issues around Israel and the Middle East, we \nhave always been together on a bipartisan basis--until now and what has \nhappened over the last few months.\n  Unfortunately, what is happening on this debate and the vote we will \nhave tomorrow--bringing the American hostages into this debate on Iran \nis not the first time we are seeing partisan politics interjected into \nthis debate. I still will never forget the 47 Republican Senators who \nwrote a letter to the Supreme Leader in Iran--our enemy, the \nAyatollah--to tell him not to pay any attention to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I have to say that if it were reversed and if there were 47 \nDemocrats, everything would have halted in this Chamber. There would \nhave been impeachment hearings. We would have been called traitors. It \nwould have gone on and on. It is shocking to me. If this had happened--\nwhen we were debating going into Iraq, if we had written a letter to \nSaddam Hussein saying ``Don't listen to the President of the United \nStates'' or anybody else, for that matter, any other President, that \nwould have been a national crisis and there would have been outrage. \nYet, somehow, 47 Republican Senators can write to the Ayatollah in the \nmiddle of an international negotiation that was difficult at best, when \nwe know that Iran is within 3 months of having a nuclear weapon right \nnow, by the way, that we should all be concerned about. I know we are, \nexcept some of us act as if we can go back to renegotiate something, \nwhich will take years, when they are going to have enough materials \nwithin 3 months.\n  In the middle of all that, almost half of this Chamber writes to the \npeople who are funding terrorism and who are our opponents and enemies \nin terms of the Ayatollah, saying: Hey, by the way, the President of \nthe United States--don't listen to him. Don't listen to him.\n  Interestingly, Senator Cotton said in that letter that of course it \nwill take 60 votes to pass anything in the Senate--which, of course, it \ndoes and which, of course, we are debating now. And folks are acting as \nthough it doesn't. But the Ayatollah was sent a letter that said it \nwould take 60 votes, so whoever wrote him might want to check in with \nhim.\n  So here we are now. We have seen the ultimate politics of Members in \nthis body writing to our enemies and saying: Don't listen to the \nPresident of the United States. And now we are in a situation, after \nvoting twice on a serious, difficult, emotional, controversial issue \nwhere there are serious, thoughtful people on both sides--because the \nvote is not going the way the majority wants, now they bring in the \nfour hostages and Amir.\n  There is a tradition in our country when it comes to issues of \nnational security and the lives of men and women who serve in America. \nThis quote was coined by a former Michigan Senator, Arthur Vandenberg: \n``Politics stops at the water's edge.''\n  This picture we are very proud of. It is right outside here in the \nReception Room. Very few U.S. Senators have their portraits painted on \nthe wall in the Reception Room, and I am very proud one of those is a \nformer Republican Senator from west Michigan, Senator Arthur \nVandenberg. He was a great nemesis of President FDR. He hated the New \nDeal. He went after President Roosevelt at every turn on his domestic \nagenda. But as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, when we \nwere being attacked at Pearl Harbor and World War II was happening, he \nstepped up and said, ``Politics stops at the water's edge.''\n  For over 70 years, that was the way the United States of America \nacted. That is the way the Senate operated. We have lost that, and I am \ndeeply concerned--not as a Democrat but as an American--about where we \nfind ourselves today on matters of such seriousness, international \nthreats to our country. We can debate them. We can have differences. If \nsomeone loses the vote, it becomes time to come back together and find \na way to move forward to keep America strong. There are many \nopportunities for us to do that, many opportunities on this agreement \nto make it stronger, to focus on the nonnuclear sanctions and other \nthings that we need to do together against Iran, to focus on bringing \nour heroic Americans home. But this is not the way to do it. This is \nnot the way to do it.\n  So I stand today to object to what I view as a political stunt, and \nthe vote tomorrow is deeply concerning to me and to people in Michigan \nwho want to bring Amir Hekmati home. This is not politics; this is \nsomebody's life. It is about the future national defense of our country \nand our allies and the world.\n  The vote is the vote. We have taken our positions. It is time to come \nback together as Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Michigan for pointing something out \ntoday that I haven't heard before, which is that this vote we are going \nto have tomorrow, which is a revote on the Iran nuclear agreement, \nadding a couple of pieces regarding hostages and sanctions regarding \nIsrael, is actually a dangerous vote, and I agree with her completely \nthat it is a political vote.\n  If you ask the people on the street what they think of Congress, we \njust are not thought of very well because the people see through this. \nThey see through the politics of this.\n  You know, we have already voted on this agreement. My friend Senator \nCorker, my chairman--I serve on that committee. I am very proud to \nserve with him. He says: Well, all we want is a vote on the agreement. \nWe gave them a vote. We wanted an up-or-down vote on the agreement. \nSenator Reid asked for that twice, for a 60-vote threshold. Oh, no. \nSuddenly, even though Senator McConnell has said over the years that \nevery single important vote is a 60-vote threshold, suddenly--this is \nan important vote. How well I remember a vote cast here on climate \nchange legislation where we got--counting the people who weren't here \nwho said they were for it--56 votes. We fell four votes short. Wouldn't \nit have been nice if I had gone to the floor and said: This is \noutrageous. This is outrageous. Let's have a 51-vote threshold.\n  Well, we knew we needed 60. We didn't play games. We didn't play \ngames with it. That is what we have here. We are playing games with an \nagreement which already has been voted on, and we had enough people \nvoting in favor of the agreement, if I can say, to derail the \nRepublican plan.\n  Now derailing this agreement, in my view, means war. And I see my \nfriend on the floor here from Arkansas, and he was the one person who \nsaid it. Let's just essentially, he said, bomb this thing away. Well, \nhe is honest about it. Other people say: Oh, just go back and get \nanother agreement. That is code word for ``no agreement.'' That is code \nword for ``war.''\n  We have spoken out on this very clearly, and it isn't as if we don't \nhave other issues we need to deal with. The fact is, enough Senators \nsaid they support the agreement to derail the effort to stop it. Grow \nup, accept the fact, and move on. Use it in your campaigns just as we \nwill use it in our campaigns.\n  I do not think the people in this country want another war in the \nMiddle East, and I feel very strongly that this is a conscience vote. \nSo bring it up 10 times. I am not going to change my vote, especially \nwhen I see playing politics has become the way my Republican friends \nare dealing with this most sober issue.\n  As you look on the horizon, we know there are a couple of real \nproblems facing us. The budget runs out in 14 days. Are we going to \nhave a government shutdown because some people don't think women should \nhave the right to choose? Are we? I don't know, but we have 14 days to \ndeal with it. Why aren't we dealing with it? We voted on the Iran \nagreement. It is not going to change. It is just politics as usual. \nPeople are sick of it.\n  Mr. President, let's take a look at the Republican budget. The \nproposed\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\nSenate Republican budget would cut over one-half billion dollars from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's budget. I just came from a \nhearing--a very important and good hearing--where we looked at a \nhorrible tragedy that happened in Colorado. EPA went in there, at the \nrequest of the State, to check whether this old mine that hadn't been \ncleaned up in generations caused a risk of a blowout. And when they \nstarted to do their testing, there was a blowout. EPA was devastated \nwith that.\n  What our committee looked at is how are we going to move forward. \nWell, we are not going to move forward, I say to my friends, when we \ncut one-half billion dollars out of the EPA budget that could be used \nto clean up these mines. When there is a devastating blowout, horrible \nchemicals, such as cyanide and lead, get into drinking water supplies \nand it destroys communities. Why would we want to have a budget that \ncuts so much from the Environmental Protection Agency that 80 percent \nof the people support? It is so popular. Congress is so unpopular; the \nEPA is popular. People want a clean environment.\n  In all my years in office, no one has come up to me and said: The air \nis too clean. The water is too clean. They say the opposite. They say: \nYou know what. My kid has asthma, clean up the air or they say: I am \nworried that I can't drink the water. I have to purify it.\n  So instead of revoting on something we already voted on--and every \nMember, it is not like anyone was hiding. We all came out. We were \neither for the agreement or against it. I have to say my colleagues \nwere wonderful in explaining their positions, and I was proud, but I am \nnot proud to see us now go right back to the same thing.\n  When we have all of these problems facing us, the Republican budget \ncuts $400 million from community health centers, preventing 620 new \nclinics from opening and keeping 2.6 million Americans from getting \npreventive and lifesaving care--that is right, 400 million from \ncommunity health centers.\n  How about the HOME Program, the Nation's primary affordable housing \nprogram? It would be practically eliminated with a 93-percent cut. This \nmeans a loss in production of about 40,000 affordable housing units \nacross the country.\n  The Centers for Disease Control, we know how important they are when \nwe have an epidemic looming. It would be slashed by the Republican \nbudget by $245 million, hurting our efforts to protect communities from \ndiseases such as Ebola and the measles. We all thought the measles were \ngone. It came back in California and thank God for the CDC for helping \nus when we needed them.\n  Then there is the Export-Import Bank. We extended its life and \nattached it to the Transportation bill, which is great, but the Export-\nImport Bank expired 78 days ago. And the Transportation bill that I \nworked so closely on with Leader McConnell, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nDurbin, and others--it is stuck in the House of Representatives. I \ndon't know what to think about what they are doing over there, but they \nneed to get going and get that Transportation bill into conference so \nwe can do this. This is a bipartisan bill. But instead of pushing and \nworking on that, we are revoting on an issue we already voted on.\n\n  The Ex-Im Bank has real consequences. GE, General Electric, announced \nit will shift 500 jobs overseas because of the Bank's closure. So \nanyone who tells you it doesn't have an impact, they are wrong; it does \nhave an impact. Five-hundred families are suffering because the Ex-Im \nBank--which we did the right thing in the Senate--is stuck in the \nTransportation bill in the House. They have yet to mark their bill, and \nI hope they will.\n  Then we have the debt ceiling, something Ronald Reagan warned us \nabout over and over again: Don't play politics with the debt ceiling. I \nremind everybody, when Bill Clinton was President, we balanced the \nbudget. I was here. That shows you how long I have been around. I \ndidn't have these gray hairs then.\n  So in those years we balanced the budget, created a surplus. And then \nwhat happened after Bill Clinton? Immediately, we had this humongous \ntax cut for the rich, and we had huge deficits under Republican \nPresident George W. Bush. Thank God, President Obama has cut that \ndeficit in half, but we still have a debt. That is because two wars \nwere put on the credit card and there were these tax cuts to the rich, \nwhich caused huge deficits, so the debt kept climbing up. Now we have \nto raise the debt ceiling to accommodate the past spending of this \nCongress.\n  President Reagan was right: Don't play politics with the debt--even \nthinking you will hurts our economy. The last time we played these \ngames it cost us a fortune, and it caused huge uncertainty in the \nmarkets.\n  So we have the budget crisis, we have a Republican budget with huge \ncuts to programs we need, such as the Centers for Disease Control; we \nhave a transportation bill, the authority for which runs out in \nOctober. We have all of these things. Yet what are we doing today? We \nare voting again on Iran. No one, in my view, is going to change their \nmind.\n  I was thinking maybe some of my Republican friends might come over to \nour side in favor of the agreement since Colin Powell is for the \nagreement, Richard Lugar is for the agreement, John Warner is for the \nagreement, and Brent Scowcroft is for the agreement--these are all \nleading Republican voices--and others, many others. I don't see that \nhappening.\n  For those people who say it has been partisan, it has been partisan. \nSeveral Democrats joined Republicans against the agreement. Not one \nRepublican--not one--despite all the leadership on their side outside \nthe Senate--joined us, so the partisanship has been coming from the \nother side of the aisle. We are voting again on Iran, so maybe I \nthought next week we could take up some of these serious issues that I \njust outlined, these pressing, pressing issues: the budget, the debt \nceiling, the Ex-Im Bank, all these incredibly important issues that we \nare facing. But, no, next week the majority leader has decided to take \nup abortion--abortion.\n  What we are going to be faced with is a bill that says to a woman: \nYou cannot have an abortion after a certain period of time. It is a \nban--no exception for the health of the women. I wish to talk a little \nbit about that today.\n  The bill, as it is coming forward, is extreme. It is a direct attack \non women, on doctors, and on the law of the land called Roe v. Wade. It \nis unconstitutional because it offers no health exception. It bans \nabortion at a certain point in pregnancy, with no exception, no health \nexception: no help for a woman facing cancer, no help for a woman \nfacing kidney failure, no help for a woman facing blood clots or other \ntragic complications during their pregnancy. This is a war on women, \nand that is what they are going to do. They are not going to the debt \nceiling, they are not going to the budget, which must be fixed, and \nthey are not going to Ex-Im, even though jobs are leaving the country.\n  This bill they are taking up next week will revictimize survivors of \nrape and incest by assuming they are lying, forcing women to go through \nmultiple medical visits to prove they have been victimized. It would \nthrow doctors in jail for up to 5 years for helping a woman after a \ncertain point in her pregnancy, when that doctor knows she risks \nparalysis, infertility, a woman who has cancer whose life would \nactually be in danger if that pregnancy is continued.\n  But don't take it from me, take it from the women who have had to \nhave these abortions, women who desperately wanted a child, such as \nThais from California, who learned at the 20-week ultrasound there were \nmultiple tragedies facing her baby's heart and lungs. The baby had no \ndiaphragm, which means her baby would have suffocated to death once \noutside the womb. You would force that woman to go through a pregnancy, \nnot to mention the impact on the baby.\n  Then there is Emily from South Carolina, a 26-year-old mother of two \ngirls. During her third pregnancy, she suddenly had extreme health \nsymptoms, including blurred vision and intense abdominal pain. After \ntesting, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia, which posed a serious \nthreat to her health. Under this bill, she could not have been spared \nthe risks to her health.\n  So when we say there is a war on women, we mean it. We are not just \nsaying words. Frankly, I am confused\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nwith everything else facing us. We had such a bipartisan breakthrough \non the Transportation bill. I was so proud to work with the majority \nleader, so proud of the product that came out of that. I was proud to \nwork with the Democrats and Republicans on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--every one of whom was involved and supported the deal \nthat went through. As a matter of fact, we had a majority of both \ncaucuses. Why can't we build on that bipartisanship? Why do we have to \ngo back to the usual corners? It is sad and unnecessary.\n  But, you know what, we are going to be voting on Iran, so I am going \nto tell you why I am backing the deal. If you have to go through it \nagain, I am going to go through it again.\n  The key points of this agreement: No. 1, it cuts off the uranium \npathway to a bomb; No. 2, it cuts off the plutonium pathway to a bomb; \nand, No. 3, it uses the most intrusive inspections regime ever \nnegotiated. When people say: Oh, but they have 24 days to stall if \nsomebody wants to look at their program, let's be clear, not one party \nin the world who is a party to a nuclear agreement has any deadline, \neven the United States. If there is a suspicion of a program being \nhidden, you can stall it off--but not this one. You have to let them \nin, in 24 days, or they are in breach. There is a mechanism to require \nIran to provide the IAEA with access to those suspicious sites--that 24 \nday-limit that is not present in any other agreement. It requires the \nIranians to disclose their past nuclear activities before they receive \na penny of sanctions relief, and the United States and our allies have \nthe ability to snap back multilateral sanctions.\n\n  The bill that is going to come before us for another vote talks about \nhow we cannot lift sanctions in this deal until certain conditions are \nmet. But it ignores the fact that there is a whole other set of \nsanctions that are in place for Iran's terrorist activities, and those \nsanctions are not touched. Don't conflate the two and confuse people. \nThere are sanctions for their nonnuclear activities, which include \ntheir horrific support of terrorism; and then there are sanctions for \ntheir nuclear activities, which we will be lifting if they agree and \ncarry out the terms of this agreement, particularly since they will not \nhave one penny lifted until they disclose every bit of their past \nactivities.\n  So let us see what else I can share with my colleagues as to why I \nsupport this deal. I have to say, at a time when Congress is not \ntrusted and has the worst approval rating--I am so embarrassed by \nthat--I have come to the point where I look at third parties to make my \ncase. So, 29 of our Nation's top nuclear scientists, including 6 Nobel \nlaureates, say this is a good deal; 60 bipartisan national security \nleaders say this is a good deal; over 100 former U.S. ambassadors say \nthis is a good deal; three dozen retired U.S. generals and admirals say \nthis is a good deal; 340 U.S. rabbis say this is a good deal; and 53 \nChristian leaders and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops--and we \nare going to be seeing the Pope here next week--say this is a good \ndeal.\n  So the religious leadership on the side of this deal, for the most \npart, is overwhelming because our religious people who lead us here \nwant peace in the world. They do not want to see an escalation of war. \nWe see what war brings. We lost, in the Iraq war, more than 4,000 of \nour people.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is what our allies are saying:\n\n       If the U.S. were to walk away from this deal, international \n     unity would disintegrate, the hardliners in Iran would be \n     strengthened, and we would lose the most effective path to \n     stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n  That is a direct quote from Philip Hammond, the UK's foreign \nsecretary. He speaks for all of our partners in this--100 nations who \nsupport this deal--100 nations who support this deal.\n  Why would we want to stand with the hardliners in Iran? I know my \ncolleagues wrote to them. And they are partners with them, make no \nmistake--the hardliners here and the hardliners in Iran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. But I believe if you are a moderate person, support this \ndeal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I feel at times as if I have exhausted my \nwords against the nuclear deal with Iran. I have inveighed against the \nwickedness of the Ayatollahs, their responsibility for the deaths of \nhundreds of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, their support for \nterror, and their attacks on Israel and other American allies. It is \nthe height of folly, weakness, and credulity to give Iran tens of \nbillions of dollars in sanctions relief and put them on the path to \nnuclear weapons.\n  Indeed, I feel as if I can say nothing more than I have already said. \nBut, fortunately, the Democrats who support the Iran nuclear deal have \nsupplied cogent arguments against the deal. Thus, rather than speak \nmyself, I will simply let the Democrats speak in their own astonishing \nwords.\n  Here are the Democrats on the expiration of the deal.\n\n       I remain extremely concerned that after 15 years, the \n     restrictions on how much uranium Iran can enrich and to what \n     level expire and Iran will once again return to its current \n     status as a nuclear threshold state with a breakout time of \n     just a couple of months, if not weeks. It is disconcerting \n     that Iran can achieve this status without breaking the rules \n     or bending the agreement. To be clear, in fifteen years, Iran \n     will be allowed to be a legitimized threshold nuclear state. \n     . . . My fear is that 15 years from now, America and the \n     world will face an Iran that sees its enrichment power as \n     legitimized, that is wealthier and more economically \n     powerful, and an Iran that is fortified with new weapons and \n     air defenses as embargoes on conventional arms and ballistic \n     missiles expire five and eight years from now.\n\n  That was Senator Peters.\n\n       I acknowledge that legitimate concerns have been raised \n     about Iranian activities after the first 10 years of the \n     agreement, sometimes referred to as the ``out years.'' During \n     this time, Iran's breakout time could shrink substantially.\n\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n\n       When key restraints begin to expire in 10 to 15 years--a \n     blink of an eye to a country that measures its history in \n     millennia--our country will still have to deal with an \n     Iranian leadership that wants to build an industrial-scale \n     nuclear enrichment program. That's a big problem.\n\n  Senator Wyden.\n\n       None of us knows what lies 10 or 15 years on the horizon. I \n     have deep concerns about what the shape of Iran's nuclear \n     program could look like beyond this horizon. . . .\n\n  Senator Bennet.\n  And here are the Democrats on Iran's financing of terrorism:\n\n       Iran will be disruptive in the Middle East and fund \n     terrorist activities. This regime will continue to deny \n     Israel's right to exist. The Quds Force will still be listed \n     as a terrorist organization, and Iran will continue to \n     exacerbate tensions with allies in the region.\n\n  Senator Gillibrand.\n\n       Let's be clear, Iran is a sponsor of terrorism and an \n     abuser of human rights. This deal doesn't change that.\n\n  Senator Heitkamp.\n\n       It is certainly possible, perhaps probable, that Iran will \n     use its additional resources and access to conventional arms \n     to increase its support for terrorist groups.\n\n  Senator Merkley.\n\n       I do share concerns about parts of the agreement, including \n     how Iran could use funds from sanctions relief to continue \n     funding Hezbollah and other terrorists around the world. It \n     is clear they have been funding these activities despite \n     crippling sanctions. And we are right to be concerned that \n     additional funds from sanctions relief, or any other sources \n     from other countries if this agreement is not approved, could \n     be used to continue these outrageous activities.\n\n  Senator Stabenow.\n  Here are the Democrats on Iran's continued nuclear activities and \nenrichment:\n\n       With this deal, we are legitimizing a vast and expanding \n     nuclear program in Iran. We are in effect rewarding years of \n     their deception, deceit, and wanton disregard for \n     international law by allowing them to potentially have a \n     domestic nuclear enrichment program at levels beyond what is \n     necessary for a peaceful civil nuclear program.\n\n  Senator Booker.\n\n       It is certainly possible that Iran will use its nuclear \n     research or nuclear energy program to provide a foundation \n     for a future nuclear weapon program.\n\n  Senator Merkley.\n  Here are the Democrats on Iran's adherence to the deal:\n\n       Iran is a bad and dangerous actor. We all agree on that.\n\n  Senator Boxer.\n\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\n\n  \n\n       Critics insist America cannot trust Iran. I agree . . ., I \n     still have serious doubts about their government.\n\n  Senator Carper.\n\n       We need not, and indeed should not, trust the Iranian \n     regime. Implementation of this agreement may be challenging \n     and we need to be prepared for the possibility that Iran will \n     violate the agreement.\n\n  Senator Casey.\n\n       When Iranian extremist leaders chant ``Death to America'' \n     and ``Death to Israel,'' the first question we have is, ``How \n     in the world can we trust them to live up to an agreement?'' \n     The answer is: We cannot.\n\n  Senator Stabenow.\n\n       Even under the deal, we should expect that Iran will cheat \n     when it can, particularly at the margins; that it will \n     continue or even ramp up its destabilizing activities and \n     sponsorship of terrorism with the additional resources \n     provided by increased sanctions relief; that it will seek to \n     break out if the opportunity presents itself after 15 years \n     when specialized inspections fade and many limits on its \n     nuclear program are lifted.\n\n  Senator Booker.\n\n       Iran has misled us in the past when it comes to their \n     nuclear program.\n\n  Senator Markey.\n  What a condemnation of Iran, what an indictment of this nuclear deal \nwith Iran. But this indictment comes from the supporters of the deal. \nDespite their own words, these Democrats have chosen to give Iran \nbillions of dollars that will be used to fund terror and war and \nultimately put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.\n  So let there be no mistake for history about the consequences of \nthese Democrats' choice: When Iran detonates a nuclear device, these \nDemocrats will bear responsibility. When Iran launches a missile \ncapable of hitting the United States, these Democrats will bear \nresponsibility. When Iran kills more Americans, as it has in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere, these Democrats will \nbear responsibility. When Iran imprisons American hostages, these \nDemocrats will bear responsibility. When Iran attacks Israel through \nHezbollah's missiles or Hamas's tunnels, these Democrats will bear \nresponsibility. When Iran kills Jews around the world in places like \nArgentina and Bulgaria, these Democrats will bear responsibility. When \nIran massacres its own citizens, these Democrats will bear \nresponsibility.\n  President Obama and these 42 Democrats bear a direct political, \nmoral, and personal responsibility for the coming crimes and outrages \nof Iran's ayatollahs. There will be grave consequences for them and for \nall of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 242\n\n       Whereas, on September 10, 1990, the Office of Research on \n     Women's Health (in this resolution referred to as ``ORWH'') \n     was established at the National Institutes of Health (in this \n     resolution referred to as ``NIH'') to--\n       (1) ensure that women were included in NIH-funded clinical \n     research;\n       (2) set research priorities to address gaps in scientific \n     knowledge; and\n       (3) promote biomedical research careers for women;\n       Whereas ORWH was established in law by the National \n     Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law \n     103-43; 107 Stat. 122) and implemented the law requiring \n     researchers to include women in NIH-funded tests of new drugs \n     and other clinical trials;\n       Whereas today, more than \\1/2\\ of the participants in NIH-\n     funded clinical trials are women, enabling the development of \n     clinical approaches to prevention, diagnosis, or treatment \n     appropriate for women;\n       Whereas, in 2015, ORWH, with enthusiastic support from NIH \n     leadership, announced that, beginning in January 2016, NIH-\n     funded scientists must account for the possible role of sex \n     as a biological variable in vertebrate animal and human \n     studies;\n       Whereas ORWH, along with NIH leadership, enhances awareness \n     of the need to adhere to principles of rigor and \n     transparency, including the need to publish sex-specific \n     results to inform the treatment of women, men, boys, and \n     girls;\n       Whereas over the past 25 years, ORWH has helped expand \n     research on women's health beyond its roots in reproductive \n     health to include--\n       (1) the study of the health of women across the life-spans \n     of women; and\n       (2) biomedical and behavioral research from cells to \n     selves;\n       Whereas by studying both sexes, ORWH is leading the \n     scientific community to make discoveries headed toward \n     treatments that are more personalized for both women and men;\n       Whereas today, ORWH communicates through programs and \n     policies that sex and gender affect health, wellness, and how \n     diseases progress;\n       Whereas turning discovery into health for all, the NIH \n     motto, means studying both females and males across the \n     biomedical research continuum;\n       Whereas the ORWH Specialized Centers of Research on Sex \n     Differences program supports established scientists who do \n     basic, clinical, and translational research with a sex and \n     gender focus;\n       Whereas all NIH Institutes and Centers fund and encourage \n     scientists at universities across the Nation to conduct \n     research on the health of women and on sex and gender \n     influences;\n       Whereas over the past 25 years, ORWH has established \n     several career-enhancement initiatives for women in \n     biomedicine, including the Building Interdisciplinary \n     Research Careers in Women's Health program that connects \n     junior faculty with mentors who share interests in women's \n     health research;\n       Whereas ORWH co-directs the NIH Working Group on Women in \n     Biomedical Careers, which develops and evaluates policies to \n     promote the recruitment, retention, and sustained advancement \n     of women scientists;\n       Whereas the Women's Health Initiative (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``WHI'') marked the first long-term study of \n     its kind and resulted in a wealth of information so that \n     women and their physicians can make more\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\n     informed decisions regarding postmenopausal hormone therapy;\n       Whereas WHI reduced the incidence of breast cancer by \n     10,000 to 15,000 cases per year, and the overall health care \n     savings far exceeded the WHI investment;\n       Whereas ORWH supported the National Cancer Institute's \n     development of a vaccine that prevents the transmission of \n     Human Papilloma Virus, resulting in a decrease in the number \n     of cases of cervical cancer;\n       Whereas, in 1994, ORWH co-sponsored with the National \n     Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a landmark \n     study, the results of which showed that giving the drug AZT \n     to HIV-infected women with little or no prior antiretroviral \n     therapy reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of \n     HIV by \\2/3\\;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, perinatal HIV infections in the United States \n     have dropped by more than 90 percent;\n       Whereas ORWH co-funded a large clinical study of the \n     genetic and environmental risk factors for ischemic stroke, \n     which identified a strong relationship between the number of \n     cigarettes smoked per day and the probability of ischemic \n     stroke in young women, prompting the targeting of smoking as \n     a preventable and modifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular \n     disease in young women; and\n       Whereas over the past 25 years, ORWH has contributed \n     support toward major advances in knowledge about the genetic \n     risk for breast cancer, and discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 \n     genetic risk markers has enabled better-informed genetic \n     counseling and treatment for members of families that carry \n     mutant alleles: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends ORWH for its work over the past 25 years to \n     improve and save the lives of women worldwide and expresses \n     that ORWH must remain intact for this and future generations;\n       (2) recognizes that there remain striking sex and gender \n     differences among many diseases and conditions on which ORWH \n     should continue to focus;\n       (3) encourages ORWH to continue to focus on ensuring that \n     NIH supports biomedical research that considers sex as a \n     biological variable across the research spectrum; and\n       (4) encourages the Director of the NIH to continue to \n     consult and involve ORWH on all matters related to the \n     influence of sex and gender on health, especially those \n     matters pertaining to the consideration of sex as a \n     biological variable in research with vertebrate animals and \n     humans.\n\n  The amendment (No. 2665) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To amend the title)\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A resolution celebrating \n     the 25th anniversary of the Office of Research on Women's \n     Health at the National Institutes of Health.''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think the parliamentary choreography \ndoes not show what we just did.\n  We are now, through a resolution cosponsored by Senator Collins and \nme, cosponsored by all the women of the Senate on both sides of the \naisle, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Office of Research on \nWomen's Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n  Twenty-five years ago, on September 10, 1990, the Office of Research \non Women's Health was established at NIH. It ensured that women were \nincluded in NIH-funded research protocols. It set research priorities, \nscientific peer review and scientific knowledge, and it promoted \nmedical research.\n  There were two outcomes that I am so proud of--No. 1, what we have \ndone to improve women's health, and No. 2, we showed that a process of \nworking on a bipartisan basis actually worked.\n  This is not to tell old war stories about legislative issues. Twenty-\nfive years ago women were not included in the protocols at NIH. There \nwere many reasons given, most of them not scientifically reliable or \naccurate. Working together, Senator Nancy Kassebaum and I--the only two \nwomen in the Senate at the time--joined hands with the House--\nCongresswoman Pat Schroeder, Connie Morella, and Senator Olympia \nSnowe--and we worked together to get legislation passed to get women \nincluded in the protocols, scientifically appropriate, and to establish \nthe office of women's health. We worked then with Senator Tom Harkin \nand Arlen Specter here and Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum to \nget it done. These rollcalls of people who are no longer with us in \nthis institution and some who passed by showed we got it done. It was \nmodest in money, big in dreams. I will give one outcome of what they \ndid.\n  George Bush the elder appointed Dr. Bernadine Healy to be head of \nNIH. Dr. Healy led a scientific study on hormone replacement. She was \nable to get the money because of Tom Harkin, Arlen Specter, and all of \nus, all working together. I was an appropriator as well who helped and \nassisted, Senator Kennedy, Senator Nancy Kassebaum--now, of course, \nBaker. And guess what. This is the outcome: Because of that hormone \nreplacement study, medical practice was changed because of the \nexcessive use of hormones in inappropriate situations. As a result, it \nis estimated by public health epidemiologists that we save 15,000 lives \na year. Because of the hormone replacement study, breast cancer rates \nwent down 12 percent.\n  So when they say: Can't you guys and gals work together? When we do, \nwe save lives. We save lives. It is estimated that over 600 lives were \nsaved because of this one study alone, and more will happen every year. \nSo when we get it together, yes, we save lives, hundreds of thousands \nat a time.\n  So I commemorate the great work of the Office of Research on Women's \nHealth, and I want to once again, joining with my dear friend and \nesteemed colleague Senator Collins, show that when we work together, we \ncan really make a change--a change that improves the lives of the \nAmerican people, and women all over this country thank this body for \nthe leadership we have provided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my friend and \ncolleague, the Dean of the Senate women, Senator Barbara Mikulski, in \nsponsoring this resolution to commemorate the 25th anniversary of NIH's \nOffice of Research on Women's Health. This office has improved and \nsaved the lives of countless women not only in our country but \nworldwide. It has been a great success.\n  Our resolution, as Senator Mikulski mentioned, is cosponsored by \nevery single one of the women serving in the Senate today. I always \npoint out that just as the men of the Senate span the ideological \nspectrum, so do the women of the Senate. But we have come together to \nendorse this resolution because each and every one of us recognizes the \ncritical, lifesaving work that has been done by this office at NIH.\n  As the Senator from Maryland has pointed out, this was a \ncollaborative effort among women--including my former colleague, \nOlympia Snowe--in both the House and the Senate 25 years ago to redress \nthe fact that so many clinical trials that were being conducted by NIH \nor through NIH funding excluded women. I remember one on heart disease \nthat was called Mr. Fit. Mr. Fit. Not a single woman was included in \nthis groundbreaking study despite the fact that women die of heart \ndisease more than any other disease and despite the fact that women \nreact differently than men do to different therapies, to different \ndrugs.\n  Our resolution commends the office for its work over the past 25 \nyears to improve and save the lives of women. It recognizes that there \nremain striking gender differences among many diseases and conditions \non which this office should continue to focus. It also encourages the \noffice to continue to focus on ensuring that NIH supports biomedical \nresearch that considers gender as a biological variable across the \nspectrum of research projects that we are doing. And it encourages the \nDirector of the NIH to continue to consult and involve the Office of \nResearch on Women's Health on all matters related to the influence of \ngender on health, especially those pertaining to the consideration of \ngender as a biological variable in research with humans.\n  I am delighted that we have now been able to clear the obstacles to \nthe adoption of this resolution and that it has been approved without \ndissent.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                      Ban on Domestic Oil Exports\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, there is a proposal that is going to be \nmade before the House of Representatives and before the Senate. That \nproposal will lift the ban on the exportation of American oil--oil that \nis drilled for here in the United States. The oil industry wants to \nhave this ban lifted. You have to go back in history 40 years, to 1975, \nin order to find why that ban on exported oil is on the books. In 1975 \nwe were at the height of the first oil embargo from OPEC. We were \nimporting 30 to 35 percent of the oil we consumed in the United States. \nA ban was put in place for us to export our own oil if we were \nimporting 30 to 35 percent of the oil that we were consuming in \nAmerica. It put us at a big disadvantage if we took that approach to \nour own oil.\n  Today the United States imports 25 to 30 percent of all the oil which \nwe consume. Mark Twain used to say that history doesn't repeat itself, \nbut it does tend to rhyme. Today is a lot like 1975 in terms of the \namount of oil that we import into our country. Right now we import 5 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. We import oil from Iraq, we import oil \nfrom Venezuela, and we import oil from the Persian Gulf in order to \nfuel our economy. Now the oil industry says: Let's start selling the \noil we have and drill for in the United States out in the open market. \nWhy does the oil industry want to do that? Because when oil is drilled \nfor in the United States, the price that is set is set in Oklahoma. \nCushing, OK, is where the price is set. On average that price is $3 to \n$6 less expensive per barrel than the oil that is on the open market. \nThat is called the Brent crude price. But it is the world price. That \nis not our price. Our price is $3 to $6 less.\n  The oil industry in America wants to get our oil out in the open \nmarket so they can sell it to other countries. What countries? First in \nline would be China. After that, most likely, are other Asian nations. \nThat makes a lot of sense for oil companies. It does not make any sense \nfor American consumers. By keeping the ban in place, Barclays Bank \nestimated that all that oil here put pressure on prices and lowered \nprices for consumers by $11 billion last year. You can see it when you \nlook at the price at the pump when you go to fill up.\n  This year Barclays Bank estimates that there will be a $10 billion \nreduction in cost for consumers. You can see it at the pump. You can \nsee the price coming down. The pressure works for consumers. The oil \nindustry does not like that. They want to get that oil out of America. \nThey want to get a higher price on the global market.\n  As to national security, does it really make any sense for the United \nStates to be sending young men and women over to the Middle East in \nuniform, into that highly unstable part of our planet in order to \nensure that this stability leads to huge ships with oil in it coming \nfrom the Middle East into America, while simultaneously having the oil \nindustry saying let's export our own oil that we already have? It makes \nno sense. As long as we are exporting young men and women over to the \nMiddle East to fight, to protect ourselves, we should not be exporting \nour own oil domestically. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Our own Department of Energy says that our production in America is \ngoing to peak in the year 2020--peak--and then decline for the next 20 \nyears. We import 5 million barrels a day. Our oil production will peak \nin the year 2020 and then start to decline, and the oil industry wants \nto start exporting our own oil. Many of the advocates of that say: You \nwouldn't have a ban on any other product being exported from the United \nStates. That is probably right. We don't have a ban on the export of \nwidgets or watches. But on the other hand, we don't fight wars over \nwidgets. We don't fight wars over watches.\n  Oil is different. Oil has been at the center for 50 years of this \npowerful geopolitical battle that the United States has been drawn into \nin the Middle East. Let's not kid ourselves. We are living it every \nday, looking at the lead stories on every television network in our \ncountry--every day.\n  In terms of what we lose, the domestic refining industry is totally \nopposed to this. The oil refining industry of the United States is \ntotally opposed to exportation. Why? Because they are investing in the \nconstruction of new refineries here to refine American oil here in \nrefineries that are constructed and employing hundreds of thousands of \npeople within our own country. The refining industry opposes it. It \nwould be a $9 billion loss and a reduction by 1.6 million barrels of \noil per day that could be refined in the United States. The \nshipbuilding industry is opposed to it.\n  We are seeing a 40-percent increase in the amount of shipbuilding in \nAmerica. Here is what is happening. The oil is produced in the oil \npatches. It is put on ships, and it is sent to Pennsylvania, sent to \nNew Jersey, sent to other parts of America. You need ships to do that. \nThen that oil gets refined in Pennsylvania, and it gets refined in \nother parts of the country. That would end this incredible shipbuilding \nboom that we have seen.\n  Where will these exports go? We are not like Russia. We are not like \nSaudi Arabia. We don't have state-run oil companies. We are a \ncapitalists. Capitalists go for the highest price no matter where it \nis. You put the oil out on the open seas, and our companies will head \ntoward the highest price.\n  Who is going to pay the highest price? China is going to pay the \nhighest price. Other countries that are wealthy are going to pay the \nhighest price. We can't pretend that it is going to go to where the \ngeopolitical needs of the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense \nare going to go. That is not how capitalism works. You go towards the \nhighest price. That is the fiduciary responsibility that you have as a \nCEO of a company. That does not get mixed up within our society. The \nhand on the tiller of those ships is heading towards the highest price.\n  Who benefits? The oil companies will benefit. There are estimates \nthat by 2025, they will be making an extra $30 billion a year in \nprofits--per year. It makes sense for the oil companies.\n  Who are the losers? Our consumers are going to be big losers. Our \nnational security is a big loser. We are exporting our strength, our \noil, even as we need 5 million extra barrels a day. Our domestic \nrefiners are big losers. Our U.S. shipbuilding industry is a big loser, \nand our environment is a big loser.\n  Can you imagine it? The Pope is arriving next week, and he is going \nto talk about the role that human beings are playing in the dangerous \nwarming of our planet. What the oil industry wants us to do is to \ncontinue to engage in expanded fracking of oil on our own soil, even \nthough we haven't fully figured out how to contain the methane that \ncomes out of that fracking, and then put it on ships and send it around \nthe world. Where are the benefits for the American people? Our \nenvironment takes all of the risks, and the oil goes out to the open \nseas with the benefit to the oil companies. It makes no sense at all.\n  Within 10 years, they are making an extra $30 billion every single \nyear from that additional profit that they get by selling it overseas, \nrather than keeping it here and keeping the pressure on lowering the \nprice for consumers here in our country.\n  Many times you hear them saying: We really should be able to drill \noff the coastline of the United States, all the way up to Maine, down \nto Florida, from San Diego up to the top of Alaska--right off the \ncoastline. What about the fishing industry? It could endanger it. What \nabout tourism on those beaches if this is spilled? It could endanger \nit. But they say: We must do it in order to ensure that we have the oil \nthat we need here in the United States.\n  You can't have it both ways. You can't say that we have enough oil \nthat we can export it out of our country, and simultaneously say that \nwe must drill off of our coastlines in dangerous conditions because we \ndon't need the oil because we can export it. You can't have it both \nways. No one is allowed to do that.\n  There is a pretty high contradiction coefficient in the argument made \nby\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nthe oil industry. We need to have this debate. The American people must \nknow that they are going to run the risk of being tipped upside down at \ngasoline stations all across the country and having money shaken out of \ntheir pockets as they fill up their tanks because the oil industry just \nwants more.\n  So national security--let us know when we have produced the extra 5 \nmillion barrels a day here. Let us know when they have the evidence \nthat proves that the Department of Energy is wrong and our production \ndoesn't start to go down after 2020. Let us know when they have \ninvested in the safeguards that ensure that methane does not come up \nfrom the fracking wells. Let us know when we put as a priority those \nAmerican young men and women that we are sending over there into the \nMiddle East. It makes no sense. It is a bad policy. They had it right \nin 1975. We are still importing about the same amount of oil as we were \nback then. We don't want to invoke the first law of holes, which is, \nwhen you end one, stop digging. We want to make sure that we abide by \nthat rule, that we guarantee that we start to come out of that hole, \nthat we use American oil here first before we sell it overseas and hurt \nconsumers, the environment, and our national security.\n  This is the beginning of a very important debate in our country. I am \nlooking forward to it. I think the American people are going to rise up \nand realize that this is very dangerous for them on so many different \nlevels that it will be rejected on the floor of the Senate before this \nentire process has ended.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday evening our Democratic friends \nacross the aisle, led by the minority leader, again refused to allow \nthe Senate to cast an up-or-down vote on a resolution that would make \nclear that the Senate disapproves of President Obama's nuclear deal \nwith Iran. It is clear that there is, in fact, a bipartisan majority of \nboth Houses that disapproves, but, using a procedural tool--the \nfilibuster--our Democratic friends are trying to deny the American \npeople an opportunity to cast a vote on this bad deal through their \nelected representatives and indeed I would suggest to also avoid the \naccountability that goes along with this because this movie will not \nend well.\n  They are the No. 1 state sponsor of international terrorism. This \ndeal gives them $100 billion to continue to finance terrorist attacks \nand proxy war against the United States and our allies. This has a \nphony inspection regime because it requires the United States to ask 24 \ndays ahead of time to be able to inspect various sites. Indeed, we \nfound out that on some of their military sites, the International \nAtomic Energy Agency--the IAEA--will not even be allowed to access \nthose military sites but, rather, the Iranians will do their own \ninspection and then turn over their samples to the IAEA waiting \ndutifully at the gate of these military compounds where we know there \nis nuclear activity taking place.\n  So this is really a lousy deal. I mean, assuming that we could \nsomehow deny Iran a nuclear weapon, which used to be American policy, I \nthink we would find a huge consensus. But, in fact, this also changes \nAmerican policy. Rather than denying them a nuclear weapon, it would \nliterally pave the way, essentially giving them a free hand in 10 to 12 \nyears from now.\n  We just observed the 14th anniversary of 9/11, September 11, 2001. It \nwas only 14 years ago that we had a terrorist attack on our own soil. \nOne of those airplanes was heading toward the U.S. Capitol, one hit the \nPentagon, and of course two hit the World Trade Center in New York \nCity. So the idea of paving the way for Iran to get a nuclear weapon in \n10 or 12 years--when put in that context, that is certainly not very \nlong. That means the nations in the Middle East are going to begin to \narm themselves because they are not stupid. They realize a nuclear Iran \nis a threat to the region. Sunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia and \nothers, will begin a nuclear arms race. Instead of suicide vests and \nimprovised explosive devices, the prospect of a nuclear confrontation \nin the Middle East ought to send chills up and down anybody's spine. \nYet that is exactly what our Democratic friends have embraced, along \nwith the President.\n  The irony is that in trying to shield President Obama from having to \nveto the resolution of disapproval, our Democratic friends have also \nthrown away a chance to improve the legitimacy of this deal by allowing \nan up-or-down vote. Why in the world would they feel the pressure to \nprotect the President from something he is proud of, which is this \nIranian nuclear deal? It doesn't make much sense. This deal on its own \nmerits is indefensible.\n  Thankfully, there is a small silver lining because this is not \nlegally binding beyond the Presidency of Barack Obama. This is not a \nlegal document or a treaty; it is a political agreement. I hope the \nnext President understands that he or she will have complete freedom to \ntear this deal up and negotiate a better deal and keep the pressure on \nIran and deny them a nuclear weapon.\n  We have seen this happen before with issues such as ObamaCare and \nDodd-Frank. If the shoe were on the other foot, were Republicans to try \nto jam through legislation such as this on a controversial topic on a \npurely partisan basis, it wouldn't have much staying power because you \nwould not have built the sort of political consensus that would give it \nstaying power. So the controversy continues.\n  We have already spent a lot of time on this debate discussing and \nhighlighting the weaknesses of this deal and the danger it poses for \nU.S. and world security. Those weaknesses, as I pointed out yesterday, \nhave been highlighted by the deal's supporters. I mean, the statements \nthat were made by some of the Senators who voted for this deal seemed \nto be completely at odds with their vote to filibuster the resolution \nof disapproval. So they are clearly nervous about this deal, as they \nshould be.\n  The fact is that, rather than making this a bipartisan consensus and \nmaking it purely a partisan matter--they will own the negative \nconsequences of this deal because Iran's leaders, at the same time they \nhave been negotiating this deal, have been shouting ``Death to \nAmerica'' and saying that Israel will not even be on the map in 25 \nyears. So the chances, I would think, of this deal turning out very \nbadly--all of that responsibility will be in the laps of those who \nfilibustered this deal.\n  I pointed out that Iran is not giving up or disavowing its role as a \nforemost state sponsor of terrorism. In fact, all one has to do is go \nto the State Department's Web site, which is John Kerry's department. \nSecretary Kerry negotiated this deal. Right there on their Web site is \npointed out Iran's role as a major sponsor of international terrorism, \nits ties to and funding of Hezbollah and Hezbollah's efforts to attack \nAmerican interests in the Middle East, as well as Syria, Lebanon, \nLibya, and Iraq. All of this is very well documented. Almost all of the \nmischief, violence, killing, and threats to the security of that entire \nMiddle East region have Iran's fingerprints all over it.\n  As a result of some of the documents that were uncovered when Osama \nbin Laden was killed, we found out even more information. There was a \nstory--I believe it was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday--about \nrecords of open cooperation between Al Qaeda and the Iranian regime and \ntheir attacks and pursuit on American interests. These are more facts \nabout Iran's nefarious activities recorded in the administration's own \npublic records.\n  Of course, the regime continues to not deny or suppress but, rather, \nproudly announce its support of violence in the region and propping up \nproxy groups, as I said, that are fighting from Syria, to Iraq, to \nYemen, and further destabilizing an already volatile region. To add to \nthat mix, this deal dumps nuclear weapons. That is like pouring \ngasoline on a fire, except it is much more dangerous.\n  Of course, this deal won't change any of those facts. In fact, \nPresident Obama and his national security advisers admitted that \nterrorist groups supported by the Iranian Government will likely be the \nreal benefactors of sanctions relief under this deal. How will the \nObama administration work to keep the billions of dollars that will \npour into Iran as a result of this deal from being used to arm and \notherwise finance the work of terrorists who seek to kill us and our \nfriends and allies in the region? Well, they simply don't\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\nhave an answer for that because they know that is a byproduct or I \nshould say a direct result of this bad deal.\n  As I pointed out a moment ago, even after the deal was announced, the \nSupreme Leader in Iran and others continued their attacks on our \nclosest ally in the Middle East, Israel. The so-called Supreme Leader \nof Iran went so are far as to say that Israel won't exist in 25 years. \nIf they had their way, they would wipe Israel off the map.\n  How does the administration plan to counter this theocratic regime \nthat continues to call for the complete destruction of our Nation's \nclosest ally in the Middle East, Israel? As far as I can tell, they \ndon't have a plan, but that describes so much of their foreign policy.\n  We have witnessed the refugee crisis in Europe and the heartrending \npictures on the news of a young boy's body being washed up on shore \nbecause he was trying to get away from a war-torn region of the Middle \nEast--Syria--to somewhere where it is safe so he could grow up and have \na productive and normal life. I mean, they are heartrending pictures, \nbut they are a result of this administration having no policy and no \nreal strategy in Syria.\n  So, really, this is more of the same--no strategy and no clue about \nhow to deal with the dangers that confront the region and the people in \nthe Middle East and its ripple effect on the rest of the world, \nincluding the United States.\n  Tomorrow we will vote on a piece of legislation that addresses some \nmajor omissions from the President's executive agreement with Iran. Our \nfriends across the aisle have made their bed and decided to lie down in \nit, and they have blocked now two times an up-or-down vote on this \nresolution of disapproval. They made that decision, so now it is time \nto have another vote and to fill in some of the gaps left by this bad \ndeal.\n  The bill we will vote on tomorrow is pretty straightforward. It will \nbar President Obama from lifting sanctions on Iran until two specific \nbenchmarks are met. This doesn't solve all of the problems I mentioned \na moment ago, but it will fill in a couple of important gaps. First, we \nwill vote on whether Iran must formally recognize Israel's right to \nexist as a state, and if they don't, then the President will not be \nauthorized to lift sanctions on Iran. Second, Iran must release \nAmerican citizens whom it continues to hold hostage. This is the part I \njust really can't believe. We had this negotiated deal for months and \nmonths at the very highest level of the U.S. Government. Yet, under \nthis deal, the leadership of the U.S. Government decides to leave \nAmerican citizens in prison in Iran and doesn't use this as an \nopportunity to negotiate their release.\n  This Chamber should wholeheartedly approve of these commonsense \nmeasures--one that calls for the safe return of our own citizens and \none that affirms the right of our ally to exist. This is not a big ask. \nThis does not fix all of the problems with this bad deal, but it does \naddress two glaring deficiencies, and so I think that vote is entirely \nappropriate.\n  In conclusion, I will just say that this deal is dangerous, \nmisguided, and, you know what, it is pretty darn unpopular. As I said \nearlier, bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress oppose it, \nand for good reason. When we look at the public opinion polls, only 21 \npercent of the public supports this executive agreement.\n  Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to let the voices of our \nconstituents be heard loud and clear, and I hope our Democratic \ncolleagues will come to their senses, quit playing defense for the \nWhite House, and join us in seeking the release of our U.S. citizens \nheld captive abroad and the future security of our unwavering ally, the \nState of Israel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            The Middle East\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Iranian deal--this executive \nagreement dealing with nuclear weapons and their policy in Iran that \nhas been executed between the President of the United States and Iran's \nleaders--not the Congress, not in a formal treaty that is binding over \ntime but a personal executive agreement--I don't believe is a good one, \nand I think it is the predictable end, frankly, of a poorly initiated \nnegotiation. I will vote against it based on many of the arguments our \ncolleagues have heard over the last several days and will continue to \nhear. I do believe it is not the right policy for the United States. I \nam not going to attempt to restate all of the reasons.\n  I remember distinctly being in the Middle East, meeting with a top \nofficial in one of the countries whose name is well known. President \nObama decided to intensify these negotiations toward this kind of end. \nThis Middle Eastern official warned that talking could be a trap. He \nwarned that the Iranians are sophisticated negotiators. They have been \nrecognized as such throughout the world and the Middle East for \ndecades. He warned that one could be trapped into these negotiations, \nand once you get into them, you have to be able to extract yourself as \nsoon as you realize a good result isn't in the offing. I think that \nwarning was not heeded. We have gone on for 6 years now, and we have \nreached a point where the President had to either agree to what they \nwanted or walk away and admit defeat, and he decided to reach an \nagreement. I think that put us in this bad position. He wanted to \nachieve this before he left office, apparently, and we can only hope \nthat somehow, some way, this turns out to be better than it appears at \nthis time.\n  The Iranian acquisition of and their drive to achieve nuclear weapons \nis just one aspect of the complex situation that results from the \nextremism that is arising in the Middle East. It is a part of the \nextremism that has been arising in the Middle East. I wish to take this \nopportunity to go further than just discuss Iran today. I think we need \nto discuss the need for a long-term strategy, bipartisan--Republicans \nand Democrats--and our Western World allies, the free world allies, for \nhow we are going to deal with the problems of extremism in the Middle \nEast over a long period of time.\n  It is clear that we are seeing a resurgence of militant Islam. This \nstrain of Islam seeks to advance a theological and political approach \nto the world. It seeks to unify faith and politics, and believers, as \nsuch, seek to advance policies they think will honor Allah's religious \ncommand. So this strain that has been in Islam for years that advocates \nconversion by the sword in fact finds much support in the Koran. I wish \nit wasn't so, but it does. Many--even most--Muslims are certainly truly \npeople of peace, faithful in their daily activities, but there is a \nsizable minority that oftentimes seeks dominance and achieves dominance \nthat finds a basis in the Koran for their violent jihad against those \nthey describe as infidels. They see the hedonism of the West and other \nactions that occur in the Western World, for example, as totally \ndestructive and contrary to what they believe is right, and they don't \naccommodate to it.\n  So we are seeing a spasm and an eruption of aggression that has \noccurred before over the centuries, but it is certainly reaching a high \npitch today, exacerbated by the technology of weapons of mass \ndestruction, nuclear weapons, and other dangerous weapons. The nature \nof this eruption is complex. It is different in every region, in every \ncountry, and area, and is different among sects, tribes, and \ntraditions, and is shaped by economic conditions, security conditions, \nand tribal and human conditions in the various regions of the Middle \nEast, spanning from Afghanistan, Pakistan, to Syria, to Yemen, to \nEgypt, to Morocco, and into Africa today.\n  This crisis, occasioned by Iran's religious determination to obtain a \nnuclear weapon, is just one aspect, though a huge one, that has arisen \nas a result of this extremism. The world is surely presented with a \ndeep and complex problem that requires the most wise and consistent \nresponse over years. The surge of terrorism will not end quickly. We \nare most likely talking about decades. Our response to such violent \nactions cannot be based on short-term, political, partisan factors.\n  President Bush had in his mind a vision for a good future for the \nMiddle East. I supported him. He believed all people wanted peace, \nfreedom, education, and prosperity. He reached too far, perhaps, and \nmade some tactical errors as he sought to advance his vision, but, by \n2011, after much bloodshed and cost, Iraq had achieved stability of a \nkind and some real political progress.\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nA democratically elected government had been formed and stability and \neven prosperity seemed possible. Our new President, however, was not \nimpressed. He did not share the depth of this vision. President Obama \ndid not consider the Bush vision as part of an established, bipartisan, \nlong-term strategy of the United States. He thus felt little loyalty to \nthat vision, and he started to execute his different vision in the \nMiddle East.\n\n  I was with some British parliamentarians recently and noted that \nsomeone had said that President Obama's complete withdrawal from Iraq \nin 2011 was the greatest error of the 21st century to date. One of the \nexperienced Brits responded: Well, some say it was the disbanding of \nthe Iraqi Army after the victory in Iraq. So even when great nations \nact, things don't usually go smoothly, and failure of great nations to \nact often has its own consequences. Enemies do not desire to be \ndefeated. They do not desire to be killed. Enemies adjust to whatever \ntactics are used against them.\n  So the point, colleagues and friends, is that military actions are \nfraught with danger. Inaction is fraught with danger. The world is very \ncomplex. The very best minds who know very well the specific countries \nthat are at risk and in turmoil must be involved when plans are made \nand evaluated. Long-term--even very long-term consequences of action \nand inaction must be considered at the beginning. The world is a dicey \nplace indeed.\n  On my heart and mind is the concern that this spasm of Islamic \nextremism and terrorism will be with us for at least 40 years, perhaps \nmore. Experts have told us this. Dr. Kenneth Pollack, at the Brookings \nInstitute, testified before our Armed Services Committee recently. It \ncame my time to ask a question, and I said: Dr. Pollack, you said that \nproblems that are long in the making will be long in solving. Just \nbriefly, would you say with the spasm of extremism, violence, and \nsectarianism in the Middle East that we have to have a long-term \npolicy--I mean 30, 50, 60 years--to try to be a positive force in \nbringing some stability to that region? History tells us those states \nof violence tend to cool off but often take decades to cool off. And I \nremember it very distinctly. I got an answer that we do not often get. \nHe looked up at me, and he said: Yes, that is what I am saying.\n  This terrorism, unfortunately, is often focused on the United States \nthat the extremists see as the Great Satan. This represents a direct \nthreat to the security and prosperity of our people. Thus, we should \nseek to act in a statesmanlike manner, considering the threats and \ninterests of the people we serve in the near and the long term. That \nmeans making wise decisions that may not be popular in the 60-second \nsound bite world.\n  In the late 1940s, the famous George Kennan, a State Department \nofficial, penned the ``long telegram'' they called it. It formed the \nbasis for a long-term Cold War policy that became known as the \ncontainment doctrine. It was the basis for resisting the expansionism \nof communism, totalitarianism, and atheism, and it was part of that \nmovement that was clearly contrary to Western values. So his paper \nbecame a bipartisan policy of the United States as we confronted the \nenormous threat of totalitarian communism, that had a goal, as does \nradical Islam, of world domination.\n  While there were vigorous and usually healthy debates over the years \nover tactics and techniques and procedures, there was consistent and \nbipartisan support for the overarching strategy that communism could \nnot be allowed to dominate ever-growing portions of the world, that it \nmust be contained. Our Nation--indeed the entire free world--became \nunited in that goal. This strategy held until the blessed collapse of \nthe Soviet Union.\n  So, once again, we face a totalitarian threat to the free world. This \ntime it is from ideological and apocalyptic Islam. Like communism, its \ngoals are incompatible with the laws, institutions, and freedoms that \nwe see as central to our liberty and prosperity. There can be no \ncompromise with this form of radical Islam. It just will not merge with \nor accommodate the freedom that we believe is essential in the Western \nWorld.\n  Theologically based sharia law fundamentally conflicts with our \nconstitutional order, which separates church and State and considers \nfree debate and dissent in the Senate as a way to a better world. We \nbelieve in debate and dissent and disagreement and the right of freedom \nof religion. Thus, this threat has to be resisted. It just has to be. \nTo do so obviously means that we and our allies have to agree on an \neffective strategy--not just the tactics for Iran today, ISIS tomorrow, \nEgypt the next day, Yemen the next day.\n  Seven years into his Presidency, President Obama has failed in this \nregard. We must accept that fact. The result of that failure is \ninstability, violence, and displaced persons. Would we have had none \nwith a good effective strategy? No, I can't say that, but I believe \nwith confidence that we would have had much less difficulty. Indeed, \none wise, very sophisticated, European leader told me recently that the \nimmigration crisis, as a result of refugees from the Middle East, is \nthe greatest challenge to the European Union since World War II. What a \ndramatic statement.\n  I know many of my Democratic friends are concerned about where we are \nand are willing to discuss the kind of strategy we need.\n  The question of Iran and its sponsorship of terrorism and its \nacquisition of nuclear weapons is a dramatic and extremely important \ndevelopment. That is why it has engaged all of our attention lately.\n  I chair an Armed Services subcommittee--and I have been on it for 18 \nyears--that deals with strategic forces--nuclear forces. It has been \nthe unified position of the entire world that there not be a \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, and particularly not in the Middle \nEast. So the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran is a dangerous \nevent because they have ideological, apocalyptic, theological views \nthat are scary. In addition, we have been told by the best experts \naccepted worldwide that if Iran has nuclear weapons, Egypt, Saudi \nArabia, Turkey--who knows what others--maybe Jordan in the future would \nwant those too--and the idea that we will have multiple nations in that \nvolatile region of the world with nuclear weapons has been a fear that \nhas unified the U.N. and unified the nuclear anti-proliferation groups \nworldwide for decades.\n  But the Middle East presents even broader and more complex issues, in \naddition to that. Were the people of Syria and the world better off \nwith Assad in power? Was Libya doing better under Qadhafi than it is \nnow? One European official said a million people, mostly Libyans, are \non the North African shore seeking to enter Europe or the United \nStates. Is Egypt, under their new military regime, a more secure and \npositive force for good for the Egyptian people and the whole world and \nthe Middle East than it was under the ousted Muslim Brotherhood and \nother extreme parties that were a part of that coalition? How would our \ndiscussions and actions have been different if our Nation had \nestablished a sound, long-term policy to guide our overall approach to \nthis entire region?\n  Our involvement in each of those situations and others was, it seems \nto me, far too ad hoc, far too reactive to certain events. Our actions \nhave not been consistent; they have not been predictable; they have not \nadvanced a unified strategy; they have not been a part of a coherent \nstrategy designed to reduce tensions and strife, to reduce our direct \ninvolvement in the region. Our policies have not resulted in a \ncontainment or a reduction of terrorism and extremism.\n  I asked a historian a few weeks ago before the Armed Services \nCommittee about this and how we should be approaching the Middle East--\nProfessor Walter Russell Mead. I mentioned George Kennan and the \ncontainment strategy and asked: Do you think what we need as a nation \nis people like some of the experts on the last two panels that we have \nhad, seriously analyzing the future of the Middle East, the nature of \nthe extremist ideology that is there, and developing a long-term, \nsophisticated policy to rebut it and try to diminish it over time?\n  He replied and said a number of things. He said:\n\n       But what we're also hearing in the background is a kind of \n     a universal confession of failure of strategy.\n       What is our strategy for ISIS? Are we fighting Assad first, \n     then ISIS? ISIS first, then Assad? Neither? Both? Something \n     entirely different?\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\n       I think--I've rarely in my lifetime--although I certainly \n     have heard moments of strategic incoherence--I've rarely seen \n     American policy on such a wide scale on so many issues in \n     such a vital region seem to be so incoherent. I'm still \n     waiting to see what our strategy is in Libya or why we \n     intervened. . . .\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       So we--we do, I think, need, as a country, to have the kind \n     of discussion about the Middle East that we had about Soviet \n     expansionism in the 1940s, and to try to work our way toward \n     some kind of general bipartisan agreement or confidence in an \n     analytical approach to really a very vital part of the world.\n\n  We are not close to that. We have a Presidential election going on, \nand people are making policies and statements based on the latest \ndevelopments. It makes me uneasy.\n  Our policies have not resulted in containment and a reduction of \nextremism. Our policies have not resulted in improvement of conditions \nfor the people in those countries or the security of the American \npeople.\n  Statesmanship, as Henry Kissinger says, requires wisdom, insight, and \na willingness of officials to understand the complexity and history and \nchoices the nation faces, and then to provide leadership to the \nAmerican people first that produces support for policies that may not \nseem clear or understandable or even positive at the time they are \nannounced because the world is a complex place.\n  So, in conclusion, I am certain that the foreign policy of our Nation \nis too reactive. I am certain we have not adopted on a bipartisan basis \na policy to confront Islamic extremism that provides direction for \nactions and can build confidence in our people and in our allies. I am \ncertain this is a failure that must be remedied.\n  So let's get together, colleagues, and commit to developing a wise \nand sound strategy outside of the rush of daily politics, using the \ngreat insights and talents of people that are available to us. This \nNation is fortunate to have persons of loyalty, experience in the \nMiddle East, judgment, knowledge, and history, who can help us.\n  In its basic form, a good strategy must be simple and understandable \nto high officials and everyday Americans. This is not an impossible \ntask. A good strategy will provide guidance and produce consistency in \nour policies over the long run. Importantly it will reduce the adverse \nimpact of politics on our foreign powers. The American people will \nrespond positively. I pledge to do my part in this effort. We have \ndeveloped such strategies before. Most dramatic was the Kennan \ncontainment strategy, but there have been others--the Monroe Doctrine, \nother policies--and we can do it again.\n  I just think it is important to raise some additional concerns about \nwhere we are today. I think the President took unacceptable risks in \ngoing deeply into these negotiations. He went beyond the framework that \nPresident Bush was using to talk with Iranians. The Iranians were in \nclear violation of a number of U.N. resolutions that restricted what we \nwould do in our negotiations with them. We refused to participate with \nthem. Both Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry have recently testified before Congress that Iran remains \nthe No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and they do not \ncontend that releasing this money to them, hundreds of billions of \ndollars, which is being released on some sort of promise that they will \ncease to do that--they basically have said they are going to continue \nthe same policies they have been advocating.\n  This is a terror-sponsoring State. Our own experts tell us that. Our \nown officials tell us that. It is very difficult to enter into any kind \nof negotiation with a person who sees you as a Great Satan, who says \nthat Israel will not exist 25 years from now and must be eradicated \nfrom the Earth.\n  So these P5+1 negotiations did reverse cautious activities before, \nbased on the fact that Iran was an outlaw State.\n  I will not continue to discuss this, other than to say that we \nentered into this, we have gotten down here to the end, and I think it \nis a mistake. I am going to vote no.\n  It looks as though it may somehow be processed anyway. If that \noccurs, it will create instability, even more so in the Middle East, \nand alarmingly will lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in \nmultiple countries in the Middle East, each one of which, if their \nunstable governments fall, could allow nuclear weapons to fall into the \nhands of terrorists who can use them at any time or place around the \nworld, creating all kinds of ramifications that are too grim to think \nabout.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, what is the status of the session at this \npoint? Are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. KING. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning \nbusiness for approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Governing in the Senate\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, one of the peculiar aspects of my service in \nthis body is that I was sworn in as a U.S. Senator 40 years to the day \nfrom the day I entered Senate service as a staff member in January of \n1973. Consequently, it has given me an interesting perspective about \nthe operation of the Senate compared then and now.\n  I am sure that some part of my memory of working here in the early \n1970s and mid-1970s is colored by the rosy view of nostalgia, looking \nback at one's youth and one's past; but, even correcting for that bit \nof nostalgia, it is my observation that in those days we spent about 80 \npercent of our time governing and about 20 percent of our time on \npolitics.\n  And there were plenty of politics. This was during the Watergate \nperiod. There was a Democratic Senate and Republican President. \nPresident Nixon resigned during the period I was here. It wasn't as if \npolitics were not a part of our life, but the work of the government \ncontinued, and the governing, which was done by this body and the House \nof Representatives, continued even in an era of very intense politics \nin our Nation's history.\n  A friend asked me the other day: What is the difference between then \nand now?\n  I said: Well, in those days my recollection is that it was about 80 \npercent governing and 20 percent politics. Today it is reversed. It is \n80 percent politics and 20 percent governing.\n  I want to talk a bit about governing. Probably our most fundamental \nresponsibility after national security is a little matter of the \nFederal budget. It is something that we have to do every year. It is \nsomething that is in the Constitution. It is one of our most basic \nresponsibilities. Yet here we are, 10 legislative days away from the \nend of the fiscal year with no budget, no appropriations bills that \nhave been passed in both Houses, no conference committees, and as far \nas I can tell, no negotiations at the highest level in order to resolve \nwhat could be an impending shutdown of the U.S. Government.\n  In addition, we have the sequester facing us, which was designed to \nbe stupid. It was designed to be so unacceptable to both sides of the \npolitical aisle that a solution would surely be found.\n  I remember being asked about it when I was running for this office in \n2012. People said: Well, what do you think of this sequester that might \nhappen next year? I said it will never happen because it is so \nunacceptable, both on the defense side and on the domestic side. \nSurely, Members of Congress will come together and find a compromise \nsolution. That happened with the Murray-Ryan arrangement 2 years ago.\n  But here we are again, facing a potential shutdown. I don't have to \nenumerate the problems that creates: problems of national security, \nproblems of the effect on the overall economy, problems of confidence \nand trust in the government itself. So here we are, and we are not \ngoverning when it comes to a budget.\n  The highway fund is an even worse embarrassment. We have patched the \nhighway fund temporarily 34 times, most recently this summer. That \nexpires in October. I have not heard a great deal of discussion about \nwhat the resolution of the highway fund is going to be, and I will make \na bold prediction. Come October, there is going to be somebody who \ncomes to this floor and says: We are close to a solution.\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\nAll we need is 2 more months. So let's extend it to January, and then \nwe will solve the highway problem once and for all.\n  That doesn't pass the straight-face test. Here we are. We have the \nbudget in 10 days, the highway fund in October, and we have the tax \nextenders, which last year we passed and they only affected 2 weeks of \nthe year. Yet we expect American businesses to make plans, investments, \nand look ahead. They don't know what the Tax Code situation is going to \nbe until the last 2 weeks of the year, and they have gotten to the \npoint where they expect this: Well, OK, it looks like they are going to \ntake care of it.\n  But that is not governing, and there is a cost to that and a cost to \nour economy. I have been in business, and I know that one of the most \nimportant things to a business is certainty, knowing what the rules \nare, knowing what the Tax Code is, knowing what the regulations are \ngoing to be. Business people can deal with regulations or tax policy.\n  The very difficult thing, however, is uncertainty. When you have \nuncertainty, you have a lack of confidence; and when you have a lack of \nconfidence, you have a lack of investment; and when you have a lack of \ninvestment, you have a lack of jobs. I don't have the econometric \nanalysis, but in my view the uncertainty, the instability, and the \nunpredictability of this body and of this institution has significantly \nput a damper on economic growth in this country.\n  I don't know whether it is half a point of GDP, a full point or a \nquarter point, but it is a lot because people don't feel they can have \nconfidence in what the rules of the game are going to be.\n  To pass tax extenders for 2015 in the last 2 weeks of 2015 is just \nembarrassing. Oh, I think I said the highway fund was embarrassing. \nThey are both embarrassing.\n  Then we have the Export-Import Bank, whose charter expired at the end \nof June. This is one I really don't understand. This is a government \nagency that is 70 years old or 80 years old, provides support to \nbusinesses across the country, including in my State of Maine with some \nvery small businesses, and it fills a market niche that the private \nsector is not filling. It returns money to the Treasury, and it helps \nto create jobs in the United States. What is there not to like? For \nreasons that I can't discern, it tends to be something about ideology, \nbecause you don't want to have--heaven forbid there should be a \ngovernment agency that works. So we better put it out of business. It \nis not making any more loans.\n  Yesterday General Electric, one of our most important national \ncompanies, announced the elimination of 500 jobs, including 84 jobs in \nBangor, ME, because of the lack of the support provided by the Export-\nImport Bank. By the way, every other industrialized nation in the world \nprovides some level of support and encouragement for exports--except us \nas of June 30.\n  For a staff member for the financial services committee in the other \nbody, which handles this, their comment about the 500 layoffs was this: \nWell, 500 jobs is a drop in the bucket for GE.\n  Eighty-four jobs is not a drop in the bucket for Bangor, ME. Those \nare families; those are real people. It makes a difference in our \ncommunity, and it is ridiculous. If there were some policy reason for \nit, if there were some controversy, I could understand it. But to do it \njust because we don't like the idea of this agency, even though it is \neffective in its mission and returns money to the Treasury, just \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  So the budget we are not doing; the highway fund we are not doing; \nthe tax extenders we are not doing; the Export-Import Bank we are not \ndoing.\n  What are we doing? We are spending another week on the issue of Iran, \nwhich we thoroughly debated and voted on last week. And I understand we \nmay spend another 2 or 3 days on it next week for a series of \namendments that can appear, to me, to be strictly designed to embarrass \nsome Members of this body and to create fodder for 30-second ads a year \nfrom now. That is not governing. That is pure, unadulterated politics, \nand it is not dealing with the problems of this Nation.\n  We debated the Iran issue thoroughly. I have never worked so hard on \na single issue in my life. We all had the entire recess to work on it, \nto think about it, to talk to people, and to read the agreement. Before \nthe recess, there were innumerable hearings, briefings, and classified \nbriefings. We have now had two identical votes.\n  Yesterday, one of my colleagues said: I feel like I am in ``Groundhog \nDay.'' We are voting again on exactly the same issue. Now I understand \nwe are going to have more votes.\n  I have never known an issue where every single Member of this body \nhas expressed themselves on one side or the other. There is no question \nwhere anybody stands. Everybody has expressed themselves. Everybody has \nannounced their position. One hundred Senators have announced their \nposition.\n  I have to say a bit about 60 votes. To argue that this issue of such \nmomentous import should not require 60 votes, when virtually everything \nelse we have done around here since I have been in the Senate for the \npast 2\\1/2\\ years has required 60 votes, is just preposterous.\n  I remember standing on the floor a year ago hearing one of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about some obscure \namendment to some bill and saying: This amendment should be subjected \nto the normal 60-vote requirement.\n  And I said: Normal? When is it normal? Well, it has become normal. It \nwas the rule for the last 2 years. Now, suddenly, it was a bulwark of \ndemocracy. I remember talking about how should we modify the filibuster \nrule? No, we can't do that. The 60 votes is a bulwark of democracy. \nThat protects the minority. That is built into the essence. That is \nwhat it is all about. Now, all of a sudden, it is not so important. \nPeople say: Well, this was a procedural vote, and you had a filibuster. \nHow dare you filibuster?\n  Let me say, unequivocally, that the proponents of the Iran agreement \nare prepared to have an up-or-down vote on that agreement this \nafternoon as long as a 60-vote majority is part of the agreement about \nthe vote. The only reason there was a 60-vote threshold on a filibuster \nmotion, on a cloture motion, was so that the majority would not put \nthat issue on the table--an up-or-down vote with a 60-vote margin. Yet \neverybody knew when this bill passed--when the Corker bill passed--that \nit was going to require 60 votes. Senator Corker is on the record on \nthe floor talking about this: Of course, it is going to require 60 \nvotes. And even the famous letter to the Ayatollah in the second \nparagraph said: Of course, agreements like this are going to be subject \nto a three-fifths majority.\n  Everybody knew this was going to be 60 votes, and to express shock \nnow reminds me of the end of ``Casablanca,'' where the inspector says: \nI am shocked, shocked to see gambling here. I am shocked that there \nshould be a 60-vote requirement.\n  But, of course, there is going to be a 60-vote requirement as there \nhas been for every other substantive issue--and a lot of not so \nsubstantive issues--for the last 2\\1/2\\ years. Now we are going to \nstart to vote, apparently, on other issues not in the Iran agreement: \nBring home the hostages; recognize Israel. Those are desirable ends. I \nsupport them entirely, but that was not what this negotiation was all \nabout.\n  This negotiation was to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon now. \nIt was to roll back their nuclear program. That is what the negotiation \nwas. It wasn't about the hostages. It wasn't about Israel. It wasn't \nabout Iran's malign activities in the region.\n  One of my colleagues on the floor a few minutes ago said: Iran is a \nmalign state, a rogue state. They are going to get money from the \nsanctions relief.\n  Yes, they are. But the only thing worse than a rogue State with money \nfrom the sanctions relief is a rogue State with money--as the sanctions \nerode--with nuclear weapons, and that is what this is all about.\n  When President Kennedy was negotiating with the Soviet Union to get \nthe missiles out of Cuba, at the end of the negotiation he didn't say: \nBy the way, Castro has to go--or you, Soviet Union, have to foreswear \nyour enmity to the West.\n  And, by the way, we have heard Iran say ``Death to America,'' and the \nSoviet leadership said: ``We will bury you.'' It is the same deal, the \nsame\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\nlevel of threat. But President Kennedy was focused on getting those \nmissiles out. That was the threat, just as today the threat is to keep \nnuclear arms out of the hands of Iran, which we all agree is what we \nneed to do.\n  We have debated Iran. We have taken two identical votes. The outcomes \nare the same. I predict the outcome will continue to be the same, and \nyet every minute we now spend on an issue that has been resolved is a \nminute that we don't spend on issues that need resolution: the budget, \nthe highway fund, the debt limit, the Export-Import Bank, the tax \nextenders. That is governing, and that is what this body should be \ndoing.\n  I hope my colleagues at some point in the very near future will \ndecide that it is time to attend to those issues. And if we disagree \nwith a policy decision that has been made, so be it. But we need to \nmove forward and not continue to politicize an issue that, in my view, \nshould not have been politicized in the first place. These are weighty \nand important issues. The Iran decision was the hardest that I have \never had to make, but I have made it. We voted. It is done. We need to \nmove forward, and we need to move forward to meet the urgent needs of \nthe people of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nthat what has transpired at the end of everything we debated with \nregard to the Iran deal is that we have chosen, as a body--a minority \nof this body--to filibuster the Iran agreement.\n  For weeks--weeks--we have been talking about how important this \nagreement is and how we have been debating it. As to my colleague from \nMaine, I agree with him. All of us put so much time and effort into \nstudying it and how it is one of the most important foreign policy and \nnational security issues that many of us--even Senators who have been \nhere for 10, 20, 30 years--will ever debate, study, and vote on. That \nis all agreed to.\n  And what happened? Now we are filibustering that.\n  American foreign policy and our national security are strongest when \nthe executive branch and the congressional-legislative branch work \ntogether. That is when America is its strongest. That is why our \nConstitution gives powers to both branches of government in terms of \nforeign policy and national security. Yet every step of the way on this \nIran deal of the President, the President and his team have been \ndismissive of the role of the American people through their \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  You have to remember where we began, because the only reason the \nIranians actually came to the table was because of the sanctions that \nthis body--Democrats and Republicans--put on the Iranian regime--\nAmerican-led sanctions throughout the world. Two different \nadministrations did this. Senator Corker talked a lot about the role of \nthe Congress today and how important that was. So we start these \nnegotiations with Congress playing the critical role--drove Iran to the \nnegotiating table--and then when we start negotiating, the President \nsays: Nope, we are going to do this alone. We are going to go it alone. \nWe do not need the Congress of the United States. We are going to do an \nexecutive agreement.\n\n  There was no involvement of the American people through their \nrepresentatives in Congress to weigh in on one of the most important \nforeign policy issues in a generation. So this body acted. This body \nacted. Through the leadership of many Members on both sides of the \naisle--Senator Corker, Senator Cardin--we passed legislation--98 \nSenators--that said: No, the Congress has a role. Congress should have \na role.\n  Initially, the President said: I am going to veto that. We don't want \nyou involved. I am going to veto that.\n  But this body came together and said: We want to be able to vote on \nthis agreement. Our constituents want to be heard.\n  There were more affronts. The U.N. Security Council voted on this \ndeal before Congress even started the debate on this deal. Again, \nMembers of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, went to the \nadministration--wrote the President, wrote Secretary Kerry--and said: \nPlease do not do this. This would be an affront to the American people.\n  They did it anyway.\n  So now we have come to this moment. The U.N. Security Council and its \nmember states have voted on the deal. The Iranian Parliament will need \na majority vote to pass the deal, but the world's greatest deliberative \nbody won't. On one of the biggest foreign policy and national security \nissues facing the United States, a partisan minority of the Senate has \ndecided to take a pass on even voting up or down on the substance of \nthis agreement.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor over the last several \nweeks--both sides of the aisle--to explain why they are for or against \nthe agreement. It has been a very good debate. People focused on this \nissue very intently. People of good will have a serious difference of \nopinion. I disagree profoundly with my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, but I respect them for explaining to the public why they are \nsupporting a deal that so many Americans oppose and oppose intensely.\n  That has been one debate, but I am not sure I have seen any of my \ncolleagues come to the floor to explain why they voted to filibuster a \nvote on the President's agreement with Iran; why they voted to deprive \nthe American people of a right to be heard through their \nrepresentatives in the Senate on the substance of the deal--not a \nprocedural move but the substance of the deal; why they are letting the \nWhite House continually press to usurp their constitutional authority \nto weigh in and make foreign policy for our country; why they have done \na 180-degree turn after voting for Corker-Cardin, saying that we need \nto vote on this, that the American people and their voices need to be \nheard on the substance of this deal, and then voting to stifle these \nsame voices by supporting a filibuster.\n  I have been trying to see what the rationale of this is. Certainly \nthere seems to be one where the White House says they should be doing \nthis in order to spare the President the embarrassment of having to \nveto a bipartisan majority resolution of disapproval of the Iran deal. \nThere are other press reports saying the filibuster happened to protect \nPresident Obama's legacy.\n  With due respect to the President, he will be gone--he will be moving \non in a little over a year and a half--but the security implications of \nthis dangerous deal will be something the American people--our kids and \nmaybe even our grandkids--will be living with for years. This issue is \nmuch bigger than any so-called Obama legacy.\n  Today I have heard many of my colleagues come to the floor and say \nthe agreement has already been voted on. I am a new Member of this \nbody, but I am not sure that is exactly the case. The agreement has not \nbeen voted on. My colleagues have not held an up-or-down vote on this \nagreement. They are actually avoiding voting up or down on this \nagreement with their filibuster. They know it, and they should be clear \non this point with the American people.\n  I think this body is making history during this debate. It appears \nthat for the first time in U.S. history, an immensely important U.S. \nforeign policy agreement will move forward with a partisan minority of \nsupport in both Houses of Congress. For the first time in U.S. history \non an agreement that is critical to our national security, the \nagreement will advance not on the basis of a vote on substance--a \nmajority vote on substance--but on the basis of a filibuster, a \nprocedural vote. And for the first time in U.S. history, the President \nof the United States sought the vote of foreign nations, including the \nworld's largest state sponsor of terrorism, in approving and \nimplementing a major foreign policy agreement and then fought the vote \nof the American people to weigh in on that same agreement.\n  Yes, the Senate is making history on the President's Iran deal, but \nit is not a history we should be proud of. It is history, I fear, that \nwill be remembered for undermining our national security and the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to supplement my remarks from last \nweek with some insights from Alan\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nDershowitz's book ``The Case Against the Iran Deal.'' All of us \nreceived a copy of this last week. I read it last week.\n  Incidentally, Mr. Dershowitz has been a consultant to several \nPresidential commissions and has advised Presidents, U.N. officials, \nPrime Ministers, Governors, Senators, and Members of Congress. He has \nsold more than 1 million copies of his books worldwide in a dozen \ndifferent languages, and he is a law professor emeritus at Harvard. He \nis an accomplished attorney and has been active in politics. I make \nthat point because Mr. Dershowitz endorsed President Obama in 2008. So \nI think his comments might be particularly telling.\n  I want to start by discussing the point Mr. Dershowitz makes that I \nfind the most intriguing. ``The President is not the Commander in Chief \nof Foreign Policy.'' Mr. Dershowitz notes that the Constitution does \nnot make the President Commander in Chief, period; rather, article II, \nsection 2, clause 1 of the Constitution makes the President ``Commander \nin Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia \nof the several States, when called into actual Service of the United \nStates.''\n  Mr. Dershowitz points out that this language does not make the \nPresident Commander in Chief for purposes of diplomatic negotiations, \nand his involvement in international diplomacy is as chief negotiator \nwhose deliberations are subject to the checks and balances of the \nlegislative and judicial branches. Specifically, Mr. Dershowitz writes \nthat the President ``cannot make a treaty without the approval of two-\nthirds of the Senate. He cannot appoint ambassadors without the consent \nof the Senate.'' And this is probably the most important one: ``And he \ncannot terminate sanctions that were imposed by Congress without \nCongress changing the law. . . . Our Constitution separates the powers \nof government--the power to command--into three coequal branches.'' Mr. \nDershowitz goes on to describe the President's actual constitutional \nrole as the ``head of the executive branch of our tripod government \nthat stands on three equal legs.''\n  I would remind my colleagues that this argument is being made by a \nprominent scholar on U.S. constitutional law.\n  This point reminds me of what a former colleague who carried a copy \nof the Constitution in his pocket said in June of 2004. When debating \nthe 2004 Omnibus appropriations conference report, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Why so deferential to presidents? Under the Constitution, \n     we have three separate but equal branches of government. . . \n     . How many of us know that the executive branch is but the \n     equal of the legislative branch--not above it, not below it, \n     but equal.\n\n  I wonder what the former Senator from West Virginia would think of \nthe ways the President has sought to diminish the role of Congress with \nregard to the Iran deal.\n  According to Mr. Dershowitz, those actions include declaring the Iran \nagreement to be an ``executive agreement'' instead of a treaty or joint \nagreement, promising to veto any congressional rejection of the deal, \nagreeing to submit the deal to the U.N. Security Council before \nCongress considered it, trying to marginalize opponents of the deal as \npolitically motivated, and describing the only alternatives to the deal \nas Iran quickly developing nuclear weapons or war with Iran.\n  Another discussion I found interesting in ``The Case Against the Iran \nDeal'' relates to the President's assertion that if we don't accept \nthis deal with Iran, the only other option is war. Mr. Dershowitz \nargues that this ``sort of thinking out loud empowers the Iranian \nnegotiators to demand more and compromise less, because they believe--\nand have been told by American supporters of the deal--that the United \nStates has no alternative but to agree to a deal that is acceptable to \nthe Iranians.''\n  He also writes that while numerous administration officials have said \n``no deal is better than a bad deal'' with Iran, he views the United \nStates as negotiating on the belief that the worst possible outcome \nwould be no deal.\n  In addition, Mr. Dershowitz notes that ``diplomacy is better than \nwar, but bad diplomacy can cause bad wars'' and points out that \nIsraeli, French, Saudi, and other leaders have expressed concern ``that \nthe Iranian leadership is playing for time--that they want to make \ninsignificant concessions in exchange for significant reductions in the \nsanctions that are crippling their economy.''\n  That leads me to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2013 \nUnited Nations speech, which Mr. Dershowitz argues was distorted by the \nNew York Times.\n  The Prime Minister said:\n\n       Last Friday, [Iranian President Hassan] Rohani assured us \n     that in pursuit of its nuclear program, Iran--this is a \n     quote--Iran has never chosen deceit and secrecy, never chosen \n     deceit and secrecy. Well, in 2002 Iran was caught red-handed \n     secretly building an underground centrifuge facility in \n     Natanz. And then in 2009 Iran was again caught red-handed \n     secretly building a huge underground nuclear facility for \n     uranium enrichment in a mountain near Qom.\n\n  What strikes me about the Prime Minister's words is that they give us \na clear picture of whom we are dealing with in Iran. And if we need \nmore evidence, just last week Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah \nKhamenei, predicted that Israel will not exist in 25 years and referred \nto the United States as the Great Satan. What level of trust can we \nhave for this regime? Even if this agreement were a good deal for the \nUnited States, what makes us think Iran will abide by the terms of the \ndeal? In other words, do you trust Iran? And to be clear, this is not a \ngood deal.\n  As Mr. Dershowitz writes, ``All reasonable, thinking people should \nunderstand that weakening the sanctions against Iran without demanding \nthat they dismantle their nuclear weapons program is a prescription for \ndisaster.''\n  Mr. Dershowitz goes on to ask if we have learned nothing from North \nKorea and from Neville Chamberlain. For those in the Chamber who are \nnot history buffs, let me explain how I interpret Mr. Dershowitz's \nquestion.\n  In 1994, the United States and North Korea agreed to a roadmap for \nthe denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Several rounds of six-\nparty talks were held between 2003 and 2009, but North Korea continues \nnuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. The President seems to be \nheading down a similar path with Iran.\n  As for Neville Chamberlain, he was the British Prime Minister when \nEngland entered World War II. He is best known for his policy of \nappeasing Germany in advance of World War II, signing the Munich Pact \nthat gave part of then-Czechoslovakia to Germany. Hitler violated that \npact and invaded Czechoslovakia, then Poland. Should we expect a \nstronger commitment to this deal from a country whose Supreme Leader \nrefers to the United States as Satan?\n  How can Mr. Dershowitz label this deal as a prescription for \ndisaster? He does so by pointing out the ``enormous difference between \na deal that merely delays Iran's development of a nuclear arsenal for a \nperiod of years and a deal that prevents Iran from ever developing a \nnuclear arsenal.'' Mr. Dershowitz says that if this deal is meant to \nprevent Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons, the President must \nclearly say so and the Iranians must agree with that interpretation. \nThat has not happened.\n  How did we get to such a bad deal? Mr. Dershowitz says the first \nmistake was taking the military option off the table when the \nadministration declared that they weren't militarily capable of ending \nIran's nuclear weapons program. He says the second mistake was taking \nthe current sanction regimen off the table by acknowledging that many \nof our partners would reduce or eliminate sanctions. Lastly, he says we \ntook rejection of the deal off the table by indicating that rejecting a \ndeal would be worse than accepting a questionable deal. Mr. Dershowitz \nwrites that ``these three concessions left our negotiators with little \nleverage and provided their Iranian counterparts with every incentive \nto demand more compromise from us.'' He adds that our negotiators \n``caved early and often because the Iranians knew we desperately need a \ndeal to implement President Obama's world vision and enhance his \nlegacy.''\n  While this deal might implement the President's world vision in the \nnear term, I question whether it will enhance his legacy because I do \nnot think it makes the United States or the world more safe.\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\n  I am disappointed that the President didn't submit this deal to us as \na treaty for our approval. I am disappointed that the minority has \nfilibustered even allowing us to vote on disapproving the deal. I wish \nwe had paid more attention to the fact that sanctions put in place by \nCongress have to be terminated by Congress, not by the President.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read Mr. Dershowitz's book because I \nthink it provides some invaluable insights and might change their \nthinking. I think we need a different outcome.\n  I thank the leader for the amendments he has put up that will make a \ndifference. I think one of those should have been done before any \nnegotiations, and that is that the American hostages be released. That \nwould have been a good starting point. They should have walked away \nseveral times to show that the deal was in favor of Iran rather than \nthe United States. It has to be some of the world's worst negotiating.\n  I hope everyone will read Mr. Dershowitz's book, ``The Case Against \nthe Iran Deal.'' We all got a copy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to discuss the \nagreement that is being proposed between the United States, the other \nmembers of the P5+1 nations, and Iran with regard to Iran's capacity to \nbuild a nuclear weapon.\n  I strongly oppose this agreement for a number of different reasons. \nBefore I get into the specifics of those reasons, I need to back up a \nlittle bit. About 2 years ago, I served on the banking committee. I \ndon't think most people in America realize that the banking committee \nhas jurisdiction over the sanctions legislation which deals with Iran \nand other sanctions legislation throughout the world.\n  Over the years, we have developed a very powerful and effective \nsanctions regime with regard to Iran. This regime involved not only the \nUnited States but the participation and agreement of nations around the \nglobe, including sanctions that were followed by us through the United \nNations.\n  Those sanctions--after having had four or five different versions of \nthem, increasingly tightening them down--had worked very effectively to \ncause Iran to need to come to the negotiating table. I think most \nAmericans realize that the reason Iran came to the negotiating table \nwas the fact that our sanctions were working.\n  In fact, a couple of years ago, we had another version of new \nsanctions legislation to tighten down our sanctions even further and \nincrease the leverage that the United States had on Iran in order to \ntry to cause Iran to not only come to the negotiating table but also to \nagree to stop development of a nuclear weapon.\n  At that time, the President asked the banking committee--I was the \nranking member at the time--to pull back our proposed new sanctions \nlegislation. He gave us his explanation, which is the fact that he \nwanted to open up new negotiations with Iran and did not want to cause \nan offense that would cause Iran to back away from the negotiating \ntable. I disagreed at the time. In fact, my position was that if the \nUnited States wanted to go into negotiations, we should have Congress \npushing for a new round of sanctions legislation so the President could \nsay honestly and effectively to Iran that we needed to get a workable \ndeal put together or we had a Congress that was ready to move forward \nwith ever-increasing and more effective sanctions. Instead, the \nPresident said no. I understand that his party controlled the Senate at \nthat point in time and we could not get the chairman at that point to \nagree to move the legislation forward, even though the chairman and I \nhad worked together with the other sponsors of the legislation to \ndevelop it. At that time, it was my position that if the United States \nwas going to withdraw its leverage through increasing sanctions \nlegislation, that we should at least ask for some kind of a good-faith \neffort on the part of the Iranians as we were exercising the right to \nwithdraw our sanctions legislation.\n\n  So it was my position that we at least should have asked for the \nrelease of our prisoners. Most Americans are aware that we have four \npolitical prisoners--at least four--in Iran today who are being \nwrongfully held. One of them, Pastor Saeed Abedini, is from Idaho. He \nhas been held illegally in Iran now since 2012. In addition, we have \nRobert Levinson, who is a retired FBI agent, missing since 2007; Jason \nRezaian from the Washington Post, a reporter, held since 2014; and Amir \nHekmati, a former marine, who has been held since 2011. Yet the \nadministration would not ask for the release of these prisoners as a \ntoken of good faith in return for starting the negotiations, even \nthough we were willing to withdraw our efforts to impose new sanctions \nin an effort to start these negotiations. I felt that was a mistake \nfrom the outset. The United States gave up its leverage and refused to \nask for a concession as we moved forward in these negotiations. Yet it \nhas set a pattern for what has happened since.\n  Well, I think everyone knows the history from that time forward. We \ndid engage in negotiations. It is important to note that at that time, \nthe President assured--he assured us--that he would not enter into an \nagreement that would allow Iran to ever have a nuclear weapon and that \nwe would have ironclad inspection and verification regimes in place to \nassure that.\n  So where are we today? We are now faced with an agreement that \ncements in place Iran's nuclear stockpiles, that effectively allows \nIran to develop a nuclear weapon over time, even if it complies with \nthe agreement, and does not have any kind of an effective sanctions \nregime. I strongly oppose this agreement.\n  During the remainder of my remarks, I wish to go through four or five \ncritical reasons Congress should reject this agreement. First, it does \nnot prohibit Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Second, it does not \nprovide ironclad inspections and verification procedures. Third, it \nprovides sanctions relief that is almost certain to result in increased \nterrorism around the globe. Fourth, it dangerously and needlessly lifts \nunrelated, nonnuclear embargoes. Fifth, it contains inexcusable and \ndangerous omissions. Finally, it will create instability in the Middle \nEast and effectively a new regional arms race, dangerous to the entire \nworld.\n  Let me go back through these. First, it does not prohibit Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear bomb. Even if Iran complies with the agreement, \nwhich it does not have a very good record of doing with regard to its \nagreements, it will still be able to develop a nuclear weapon. The \nagreement fails to roll back Iran's nuclear development program beyond \na 1-year breakout period.\n  For 10 years, the agreement will only include IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, and \nIR-8 centrifuges. Now, this is getting into the weeds, but this is a \nlevel of centrifuge development that Iran has already been working on \nand engaging in. And the agreement says--and this is exactly from the \nagreement--``For 10 years will only include the IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, and \nIR-8 centrifuges as laid out in Annex 1.'' In other words, the only \napplication of the agreement is to these centrifuges during a 10-year \nperiod.\n  During the 10 years, ``Iran will continue testing IR-6 and IR-8 \ncentrifuges, and will commence testing of up to 30 IR-6 and IR-8 \ncentrifuges, as detailed in Annex I.''\n  It does not dismantle any of its nuclear sites of concern, which are \nthe sites at Arak, Natanz, and Fordow. None of them is dismantled. It \nrecognizes Iran as a de facto nuclear state. And with all of the \ncentrifuges that Iran now has, is it required to destroy them? No. It \nsimply has to disconnect them and store them in another room. Iran is \nallowed to keep 6,000 centrifuges and 300 kilograms of uranium. Iran is \nallowed to conduct nuclear research and development during the terms of \nthe agreement, and, in fact, amazingly the United States commits to \nassist Iran with its nuclear research and development in developing its \nown nuclear technology and infrastructure.\n\n  That is not even the end. One of the provisions of the agreement \nwhich I find most outrageous is that it requires the United States \nGovernment to oppose State and local sanctions against\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\nIran and amazingly to help ``strengthen Iran's ability to protect \nagainst, and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage, \nas well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and \nphysical protection systems.'' In other words, if Iran develops nuclear \nweapons capacity, this seems to imply that the United States will need \nto help Iran protect its capacity.\n  I am sure the argument will be made that this is only to help Iran \ndevelop its peaceful nuclear weapons capacity, but the agreement isn't \nclear. At a minimum, these kinds of things should have been made clear \nin the agreement.\n  So let's look at the inspections. Assuming that Iran will comply with \nits one-sentence agreement that it will not build a nuclear bomb for 10 \nyears, does the verification system that we have adopted prohibit that? \nWell, the agreement does not provide ironclad inspections and \nverification. I think Americans are increasingly becoming aware that \nnot only do we not know what the inspection regime is, the United \nStates does not participate in the inspection regime. The inspection is \nturned over to the United Nations. The IAEA, the committee under the \nUnited Nations that does these kinds of inspections, is in charge, and \nthe IAEA has entered into side agreements with Iran that it will not \ndisclose to the United States or any other country. Some of the \ninformation we are starting to see about it, if it is accurate--and we \ndon't know if it is accurate--but it seems to imply that Iran will not \neven allow the IAEA inspectors onsite. It is going to provide its own \nsamples. These are concerns that are serious. Yet we cannot even \nconfirm them, and Congress is being asked to deal with this issue \nwithout even having all of the agreement in front of us.\n  Moreover, as we move forward in this process, we have identified that \nthe sites are identified as two different kinds. There are declared \nsites. Those are the ones that Iran admits exists. As to declared \nsites, Iran must first draw up a list and tell us what they are. We \ndon't have onsite inspection to determine that. As to undeclared sites, \nIran is permitted to negotiate for at least 14 days for the IAEA to say \nwe have a site that we think there is, but we are not sure, and Iran is \nallowed to negotiate whether there is such a site. If the IAEA and Iran \ncannot agree to a joint inspection of a suspected new site, then there \ncan be further delays, taking up to 54 days before anybody would be \nable to take a look at these sites.\n  Again, we don't know whether those persons then required to look at \nthese sites will be Iranians showing the United Nations inspectors what \nthey want them to see or whether they will be United Nations \ninspectors, but we are pretty sure we know they aren't going to be U.S. \ninspectors.\n  The bottom line is that we have a very weak inspection regime that is \nalmost certain to result in the same outcomes we have seen for the last \n10 years, as we have tried to inspect and monitor Iran's development \nactivities on its nuclear weapons.\n  That brings me to the third issue, which is sanctions relief. Iran \ndoes get major sanctions relief under this agreement. Iran is regarded \nas one of the top, if not the top, sponsors in the world of terrorism--\nthe top state sponsor of international terrorism. Many have said Iran \nhas been connected to hundreds of U.S. service personnel deaths in \nIraq. Some say more Americans have died in Iraq because of Iranian \nstate-sponsored terrorism and other activities than any other source.\n  We lift economic sanctions that we have been putting onto Iran. There \nis some debate about what the value of those sanctions are, but the \nestimate that I think is fair is approximately $100 billion will be \nreleased to Iran very quickly under this agreement. Just by comparison, \n$100 billion to Iran, in terms of the size of its economy, is \napproximately the same as $4.25 trillion to the United States \nrespecting our economy. It is about one-quarter of Iran's economy. \nThose who say Iran will simply use these sanctions relief dollars in \norder to strengthen their economy ignore the reality that Iran today \nhas a weak economy because of our sanctions and it is plowing money \ninto sponsoring terrorism. There is no question that these dollars are \ngoing to result in an increased support of terrorism across the globe.\n  Next, the agreement dangerously and needlessly lifts unrelated, \nnonnuclear embargoes. As we were dealing with all of these issues I \nhave just discussed as the negotiations were moving forward, at the \nvery end we find out that in order to complete the deal, Iran and \nRussia introduced new unrelated issues that the administration \nwillingly conceded to. We lifted the existing conventional weapons \nembargoes on Iran and we lifted the ballistic missile embargoes on \nIran. Russia is already today going forward with selling advanced S-300 \nsurface-to-air missiles to Iran, making future military action \nincreasingly more difficult.\n  The next issue is that the agreement contains inexcusable and \ndangerous omissions. First, as I said at the outset, it does not free \nPastor Abedini and the other Americans who are detained in Iran. \nSecondly, it does not recognize Israel's right to exist. Third, it \nlimits nuclear research for 10 years and frankly does not assure, as I \nhave indicated earlier, that we don't have violations of the agreement \nbefore 10 years.\n  It does not require an accounting of past nuclear weapons cheating by \nIran, meaning it does not require them to disclose where their \nfacilities are. It does not require disclosure of the military \ncomponent of Iran's nuclear program. What this means is that Iran has \ngiven us no information about its military facilities and has said that \nits military sites are off-limits. Now, where would we expect Iran to \nbuild a nuclear bomb?\n  It does not address Iran's existing ballistic missile capacity, and \nit does not ban ballistic missile development. We don't know what its \ncapacity is and we no longer ban them from developing their capacity \nfurther. In fact, we have lifted the ballistic missile embargoes. The \nagreement does not require Iran to stop sponsoring international \nterrorism. The agreement is deficient in so many different ways.\n  Finally, the agreement creates instability in the Middle East and a \nnew regional arms race. One hundred billion dollars is an immediate \nwindfall to Iran, a portion of which the administration acknowledges \nwill wind up in the hands of international terrorist groups targeting \nAmericans and our allies. That money will be made available to Iran \nshortly.\n  Neighboring States have already said they are going to have to \naccelerate their own nuclear enrichment programs to counter Iran. \nRecognizing the new threats to Iran's regional neighbors, the President \nhimself wrote to Congress on September 2 to announce stepped-up \nsecurity enhancement for our Middle East allies, further evidence that \nthe agreement is destabilizing and requires increased military \ncommitments in the region.\n  Having abandoned the ``no notice'' inspections requirement, the \nadministration has agreed to permit a process for contested sites that \ncould stretch for weeks or months before inspectors step a foot into \nthe facility, if they are even able to do so at all. Some experts \nacknowledge that window is sufficient to hide or remove any kind of \nincriminating evidence of smaller illicit activities crucial to weapons \ndevelopment.\n  Other states in the region--Egypt and Saudi Arabia--have already \nsignaled that they are going to embark on a nuclear weapons program, \nsparking a new arms race. The possibility of further instability in the \nMiddle East does not serve our national security interests or give the \nAmerican people comfort.\n  We cannot forget that Iran is a regime with a history of sponsoring \nterrorism against Americans and our allies and which continues to \nthreaten the existence of Israel. This agreement changes the U.S. \npolicy toward Iran but does very little, if anything, to change Iran's \naggressive nature.\n  The Iranian leaders have already renewed their threats to Israel, and \ncontinue to call the United States the Great Satan and have publicly \nrejected the administration's hope that the agreement will lead to \nbetter cooperation with Iran.\n  So where are we?\n  The United States Senate passed legislation 98 to 1 saying that \nCongress should have a right to vote on this agreement. Twice already \nin these Senate Chambers within the last week we have tried to bring \nthat legislation up only to face a filibuster that has stopped us from \neven being able to vote\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\non the agreement. Ninety-eight Senators voted to let Congress have a \nright to vote on this agreement, and 42 of them voted twice now in the \nlast week to refuse to let us bring the agreement before the Senate to \nvote on it.\n  So today we are facing yet another effort. Today the issue before the \nSenate is a provision that would say the agreement cannot go into \neffect until Iran recognizes Israel's right to exist and until Iran \nfrees the four political prisoners whom I identified. Once again we are \nfacing a threat of a filibuster.\n  As I indicated, this agreement is dangerous. It is dangerous to the \nsecurity interests of the United States. It is dangerous to the \nsecurity interests of the world. It is destabilizing in the Middle \nEast, and it contains very, very serious potential consequences for the \nfuture security of all Americans, and, frankly, of people throughout \nthe world.\n  This is a critical time. This is a monumentally important decision, \nand I encourage all of my colleagues to let us simply bring the \nagreement forward for a vote. A critical issue such as this should not \nbe stopped from even being brought forward for a vote in the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my colleague \nfor his speech. I will be echoing a lot of the same points that he has \nmade.\n  I think that it is a critical time. This is important. It is \nimportant for the young people around this country to know what kind of \na future they are going to have, and I think he has lined it out very \nwell, and this week, I think, will be critically important in terms of \nthe decisions that we make as a country.\n  In May, the Senate passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act by a \nvote of 98 to 1. You don't see too many 98-to-1 votes in this Chamber. \nSixty-six Senators cosponsored this legislation. The principal reason \nfor this overwhelming bipartisan support was the desire to give \nCongress, the voice of the people, the opportunity to weigh in on the \nPresident's agreement with Iran.\n  We have been working together now for 4 months across the aisle to \nensure that the opportunity for Congress to review this agreement comes \nforward. Yet I am severely disappointed, as my colleague expressed, \nthat 42 of our colleagues have now voted twice to deny the Senate the \nability to take a simple up-or-down vote on this very important \nresolution--a simple vote to say exactly how they feel, to make sure \neverybody in the country and in your State knows your opinion, and yet \n42 of them are blocking that simple vote.\n  Iran's supreme leader said earlier this month that he expects Iran's \nparliament to vote on whether their country will approve the nuclear \nagreement. At the very least we should have that up-or-down vote. \nCertainly this agreement is also worthy of this vote. Our constituents \nexpect us to vote on this matter. Multiple national surveys have shown \nthat the Iran nuclear agreement is opposed by either a plurality or a \nmajority of the American people, and any support this agreement had, as \nyou look at the national polling, is disintegrating.\n  A recent poll in my State shows that opponents of this deal outnumber \nsupporters by a margin of 3 to 1. Yet I am not going to have the \nopportunity to vote my vote of disapproval of this agreement because of \nthe obstructionism on the other side. In fact, when President Obama \nsaid that there was strong support for this deal among lawmakers and \ncitizens, the Washington Post fact-checker awarded him three \nPinocchios. We all know what Pinocchio was famous for, and that was the \ngrowing of his nose when he wasn't telling the truth. Three \nPinocchios--that's a lot of skepticism about the President's statement.\n  There is bipartisan opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement in \nCongress, but only partisan and tepid support. Our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives voted last week on a resolution approving this \nagreement. That resolution received only 162 votes, all from the \nDemocratic Party. There was opposition by 260 House Members, including \n25 Democrats. Here in the Senate, more Democrats joined with \nRepublicans to support moving forward on an up-or-down vote on this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  It is important to recognize the depth of bipartisan opposition to \nthe President's agreement with Iran. Many of the Democrats who have \nbeen opposing this deal have tremendous experience in foreign policy \nmatters. In the House of Representatives, the ranking member of the \nForeign Affairs Committee, the ranking Democratic member of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member on the Subcommittee on \nthe Middle East and North Africa all voted against approving this \nagreement.\n  In the Senate, the former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the committee's current ranking member are among the Democrats who \noppose this agreement. They have joined Republicans on the floor in \nseeking an up-or-down vote on this agreement. The senior Democratic \nforeign policy leaders and every Republican in both chambers of \nCongress oppose this deal, and they have made their reasons clear.\n  The President's agreement fails to make America safer, quite frankly. \nIt is not likely to eliminate Iran's path to a nuclear weapon, and the \nagreement will hurt the security situation that is rapidly \ndeteriorating in the Middle East, especially in Israel.\n  We have not seen the two side agreements between the IAEA and Iran. \nWe have not seen those. We don't know what is in them. We are supposed \nto have seen everything, and these side agreements, we think, include \nimportant provisions about suspected Iranian nuclear sites. We already \nknow that Iran will have the ability to delay inspectors' access to \nother sites for more than 3 weeks. We were supposed to get anytime, \nanywhere inspections. This benchmark falls severely short of that.\n  The combination of the cash from sanctions relief--anywhere from $50 \nbillion to $150 billion, so I will go right in the middle and say $100 \nbillion--the end of the arms embargo in 5 years, the end of the \ninternational restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program in 8 \nyears will strengthen Iran's ability to cause trouble in the Middle \nEast and around the world.\n  Think about this. I think about this--the country of Iran with \nanother $100 billion. Under the sanctions that have been imposed, Iran \nhas expressed concern about the health and welfare of their people. Yet \neven under that sanctions domain they are still fomenting terror around \nthe Middle East. What will they do with $100 billion? I think it is \npretty clear what their intentions will be.\n  International sanctions that have helped bring Iran to the \nnegotiating table will be difficult to snap back into place in the \nevent of violation of the agreement. Nothing snaps anywhere here in \nWashington, DC, and sanctions can't snap back, so that defies reason. \nThis will lessen our leverage to ensure Iran's compliance.\n  Despite these serious flaws, it appears, based on the two failed \ncloture votes the Senate has taken thus far, that a partisan minority \nis prepared to thwart the bipartisan majority and move forward with the \nagreement.\n  Leader McConnell has filed an amendment that would block sanctions \nrelief until Iran both recognizes Israel's right to exist and releases \nAmerican political prisoners. While that amendment will not cure the \nflaws of Iran's agreement, it does represent commonsense policy that \nshould receive overwhelming support.\n  Regardless of their views on the substance of a nuclear Iran, I think \nmost Americans would agree that before we provide tens of billions of \ndollars in sanctions relief to Iran, the Iranian government should have \nto recognize Israel's right to exist and should release our four \nAmerican political prisoners.\n  Just last week, as the Senate was debating the Iranian nuclear \nagreement, the Iranian leader posted on Twitter his view that Israel \nwould not exist in 25 years. That underscores, again, what a serious \nproblem Iran is to our most important ally, and that is Israel.\n  Even proponents of the nuclear agreement have recognized that Iran is \nlikely to use at least some of the funds they received from sanctions \nrelief to strengthen their military and continue to finance terrorism. \nIf this windfall is going to be provided to Iran, then ensuring Iran \nrecognizes Israel's right to exist is the least we would ask.\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\n  Equally important is securing the release of our four American \npolitical prisoners held by Iran. I get this question at home all the \ntime. Why was this not part of the bargaining? Why were we not asking \nfor the release of our Americans before we moved forward? Frankly, I \ndon't think the administration answered that question, and I don't have \nthe answer to that question. Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to \nexpress our wishes. We should not provide sanctions relief to Iran \nwithout the release of the hostages.\n  The Senate will have the opportunity to decide whether to move \nforward with the McConnell amendment tomorrow. Those who have prevented \na vote on the merits of the nuclear agreement have it in their power to \nblock a vote on the McConnell amendment as well, but let's be clear on \nwhat that would mean. If a minority of the Senate blocks a vote on the \nMcConnell amendment, then they will allow the President to provide \nsanctions relief to Iran without securing Israel's right to exist and \nwithout the release of our Americans.\n  I believe the President's agreement with Iran should be rejected by \nthe Senate, and we are going to have another opportunity to vote on \ncloture to allow the Senate to take a true up-or-down vote on that \nagreement. But even my colleagues who support the nuclear agreement \nshould vote to protect Israel and bring our Americans home before \nproviding that sanctions relief.\n  I hope our colleagues will reexamine their positions on cloture and \nallow the Senate to do what we have come here to do, to take the tough \nvotes, to let people know how we feel, to show our commitment and our \npassion, and to have our voices and their voices heard.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                             Refugee Crisis\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am always a little more than awed \nand inspired to be here on the floor of the United States Senate, a \nplace that my father never could have predicted that I would be when he \ncame here in 1935, an immigrant, fleeing persecution in Germany at 17 \nyears old with not much more than the shirt on his back, speaking no \nEnglish, and knowing virtually no one. This country gave him a chance \nto succeed. This great country opened its arms to him, much as the \nStatue of Liberty did, when he entered this country through Ellis \nIsland.\n  We are a nation of immigrants and of refugees. It has given us \nstrength. Our diversity is what makes America the greatest, strongest \ncountry in the history of the world.\n  Sadly, the kind of displacement that caused him to come to this \ncountry is far from unprecedented. This country has opened its arms \nagain and again and again, generation after generation, to provide for \nrefugees displaced by war and oppression. Inhumane dictators, \nterritorial disputes, environmental degradation, all are contributing \nnow more than ever to the largest refugee crisis since World War II.\n  We are going through a humanitarian crisis in this country. Part of \nit is due to the brutality and inhumanity of the Assad regime in Syria, \nthe horrors unleashed by ISIL in Syria and Iraq. Neighboring countries \nhave been overwhelmed by fleeing refugees.\n  During my Middle East trip in July 2013 with Senator McCain and \nothers, I visited a refugee camp in Jordan that houses many of these \nrefugees and, since my visit, the situation has only worsened \nsignificantly.\n  Syria alone has produced an estimated 4 million registered refugees--\nthose are the individual ones counted--in addition to the 7.6 million \ninternally displaced people.\n  Turkey bears the brunt of this refugee crisis, housing nearly 2 \nmillion of them. Lebanon shelters over 1.1 million refugees, while \nJordan has taken 600,000 or more, and Egypt recently exceeded the \n130,000 mark.\n  These numbers are abstract. For every one of them, there is a human \nvoice and a face. Many are children barely able to comprehend the fate \nthat has befallen them. This year alone, Germany is expecting 800,000 \nasylum seekers, a marked increase from 626,000 in 2014 and 431,000 in \n2013. Again, these numbers have impact on those countries, on their \npopulations.\n  We met this morning with the Ambassadors of the European countries to \nhear about that impact on them and about their plans to do even more.\n  The Atlantic Ocean separates us from this crisis physically, but \nmorally we have no separation at all. The destabilizing effect of that \nmassive displacement ultimately affects us as well, our national \nsecurity, and the stability of regions where we have a vital economic \nstake and a moral obligation.\n  I strongly support a policy of American generosity and humanitarian \nrelief toward those refugees seeking to escape the untenable and \nunlivable conditions in Syria and Iraq. Exactly what steps this Nation \nshould take will be a matter of contention and continuing debate, but \nclearly, we have obligations--moral obligations, self-interested \nobligations, economic obligations--to the men, women, and children who \nhave walked hundreds of miles in search of safety and security and to \nthe countries currently searching for ways to accommodate them.\n  Our obligation is multifaceted. First, we have provided $4 billion in \naid--which is real money--to countries where those refugees now live \ntemporarily in camps. But humanitarian aid is desperately needed in \ngreater amounts and rising magnitude in countries where refugees are \nflowing fast. Regional countries, including Turkey and Jordan, as well \nas the European Union, must be able to provide refugee camps that \nprovide basic necessities for people to live, with adequate food, \nwater, shelter, clothing, education, and other elements of a safe and \nstable life for adults but also for children who can be seen running, \nlaughing, playing in these camps in the most rudimentary of conditions.\n  The United States must show international leadership as well in \nensuring the availability of resources from other nations that, \nfrankly, have failed to meet the test of moral and political \nobligation. Saudi Arabia is one. The Gulf States are others. Our allies \nin this region must fulfill their obligation to do more and to do their \npart in assisting those fleeing war and bringing about a diplomatic \nresolution to the crisis. The absence of these nations from this \nchallenge is reprehensible and regrettable. Ultimately, Syria must seek \nand achieve a resolution internally but, in the meantime, its neighbors \nhave an obligation to do more.\n  I applaud the President's announcement that the United States will \nresettle approximately 10,000 Syrian refugees within our borders next \nyear. As my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has said this step \nis certainly in the right direction. But increasing the number of \nrefugees coming here is an insufficient response alone if we fail to \nprovide the expanded capacity and services that are necessary to \neffectively resettle and bring to this country refugees fleeing their \nhomeland. Our focus should be on devising an effective program so that \ncandidates for resettlement can have that hope without waiting years \nfor assistance. Now, under the present system, they are waiting here.\n  In particular, I wish to cite a group of refugees that merits the \nspecial conscience and conviction of this Nation. They are the \nrefugees--mostly women and young girls--who are victims of what the New \nYork Times, in an extraordinary report, has called enshrining the \ntheology of rape.\n  These girls and women have been enslaved. They are members of the \nYazidi community. This New York Times report shows the systematic \nenslavement and rape of women and children held in the territory that \nISIL controls. Approximately 5,000 Yazidis have been abducted by ISIL \nand 2,700 remain in captivity.\n  These reports, which are shocking and horrifying, challenge our \nconscience to do more. Nobody reading them can think of our daughters, \nthe women in our family, without revulsion and shock. At the end of \nthis week, several of my colleagues and I will be sending a letter to \nSecretary of State John Kerry urging him to take further action to help \nthe Yazidis, the Christians, and other religious minorities who have \nbeen systematically kidnapped, enslaved, tortured, raped, and \nbrutalized by ISIL simply because of their faith.\n  We talk a great deal on the floor in this body, in this building, and \nin this country about faith. The horror of this persecution calls to \nour conscience.\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\n  I am calling on the State Department to declare religious minorities \nas protected, priority groups, able to seek refugee assistance within \nIraq's borders. As of now, the only Iraqis allowed to leave the country \nwith assistance in this way are the people who have been affiliated \nwith the U.S. Government during the war. That category should be \nexpanded to include these refugees.\n  Second, I am calling on Secretary Kerry to improve the in-country \nprocessing for refugee claims in Iraq, specifically, the time required \nfor that processing. The estimated time for Iraqis who served alongside \nU.S. military personnel is at the unacceptably high rate of 5 years to \n8 years. This issue has been brought to me by numerous veterans--Iraq \nand Afghanistan veterans--who owe their lives, in some cases, to the \nservice of these Iraqi and Afghan colleagues. Yet they wait there 5 to \n10 years simply to be processed to come here. We must assure timely \naccess to refugee assistance for both Iraqis affiliated with the U.S. \nGovernment and Iraqis within persecuted religious minorities such as \nthe Yazidis and Christians. There is mounting, irrefutable evidence of \nthat persecution on a scale that sometimes defies imagination and \ncomprehension.\n  There are many ways the State Department can accelerate processing \ntimes: Double the number from 10 to 20 of in-country State Department \npersonnel processing Iraqi refugees; consult with the Department of \nHomeland Security on the use of video interviews, consistent with \nsecurity requirements, to be conducted in addition to the in-person \ninterviews currently required; identify a nongovernmental organization \nto work with the U.S. Embassy to identify and screen religious \nminorities seeking refugee assistance in Erbil; and establish a \nfacility in Erbil where the U.S. Government can conduct refugee \nprocessing. These steps are not particularly complicated or ingenuous; \nthey are common sense.\n  The United States has a proud, moral tradition and heritage of aiding \nrefugees. That tradition and heritage are epitomized by the Statue of \nLiberty and by Ellis Island. The Nation has not always lived up to the \nhigh standards that have been set for it by us. We are still very much \na work in progress, and there are times in our history when we have \nfailed the high test of morality.\n  But the Statue of Liberty stands tall at our harbor and embodies what \nis best about our Nation. We are a nation of immigrants truly because \nwe welcome the tired and hungry, yearning to be free. We need to \ndemonstrate the international leadership that has made us proud in the \npast to establish a new, inconclusive vision for Syria; to abate this \nrefugee crisis; to provide a path for them to come here; and to provide \nthem, consistent with our security, the opportunities that fathers, \nmothers, grandfathers and grandmothers had--going back in history, all \nof us have come here from somewhere else, or almost all of us--and \nhumane and effective policies that help us to keep alive that great \ntradition and heritage, serving millions of people who are tired, \nweary, yearning to be free and seek that lamp beside the golden door.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2043 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here today for the 111th time in \nmy ``Time to Wake Up'' series urging this body to wake up to climate \nchange. It is happening all around us, and it is happening right now, \nnot in some distant future. The warnings of what is to come if we fail \nto act are sobering.\n  Congress has the ability and responsibility to change the course we \nare on, but we can't do it until Senate Republicans step up and start \ndebating real solutions. Smart climate policy can align with \nconservative values--conservative values, such as prudence in the face \nof risks, protection of property rights and individual liberty, and \nmarket-based solutions for solving problems.\n  Senator Schatz and I have proposed a fee on carbon emissions, \ncorrecting a market failure that currently allows major emitters to \npollute for free while forcing regular citizens to bear the physical \nand financial burden. Even if you are a tea-partier, why would you want \na big special interest to be able to distort the energy market and make \nregular people pay the price for the harm they cause? Other than \nspecial interest politics, it makes no sense.\n  This market incentive would work. It would reduce emissions. A recent \nreport on our bill shows it will reduce carbon emissions 45 percent by \n2030, more than the President's Clean Power Plan does. It will also \ngenerate significant revenue--over $2 trillion over 10 years--to return \nto taxpayers. With $2 trillion, you can lower a lot of tax rates.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will give this bill a serious look. \nFormer Congressman Bob Inglis, a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, \ndescribed our bill not as an olive branch, but as an olive limb we have \noffered to Republicans. Yet still in this Chamber, all we hear from \nRepublicans is equivocation and denial when it comes to climate change. \nWe hear Republican Senators trumpet industry-backed reports that point \nto the costs of action, but ignore the terrible costs of inaction. They \nlook at only one side of the ledger. If accountants did business that \nway, they would go to jail, but that is evidently good enough for \nRepublicans in the climate debate.\n  We hear Senators using cherry-picked data. They will take a graph \nthat goes up and down, up and down on an upward trend and pick a high \nspot and a later low spot, and from those two selected points, they \nwill say: Aha. See, there is no increase.\n  An expert witness would be thrown out of court for that nonsense, but \nit is evidently good enough for Republicans for the climate debate.\n  We hear Senators ducking and dodging on this issue, exclaiming they \nare not scientists, but then they will not listen to what they are \nbeing told by the people who are scientists. We hear deniers denigrate \nscientists, ignore basic established science, and venture into loopy \nconspiracy theories about a great hoax, one that the United States \nmilitary and every American national laboratory and NASA are all \nevidently in on. Seriously? And they say this with no shame for the \nsmear it implies of some of our most reputable scientists. Again, that \nis good enough for Republicans in the climate debate, I guess.\n  We even had a Senator throw a snowball on the Senate floor because he \nthought the continued existence of snow here somehow disproved climate \nchange. Truly. I did not make that up.\n  Meanwhile, what we see all around us shows us that this is happening. \nSimple, straightforward measurements show that the climate is changing \naround us.\n  One summary is the annual ``State of the Climate'' report by the \nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the American \nMeteorological Society. The report reviews dozens of climate \nindicators--from ocean and air temperatures to extreme weather events. \nIt doesn't get into forecasts or projections. It discusses what we are \nobserving and measuring now. The ``State of the Climate'' report shows \nthat 2014 was a benchmark year for the climate, and not in a good way. \nThe article in Bloomberg News summarizing the report's findings was \ntitled ``The Freakish Year in Broken Climate Records.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Its author, Tom Randall, sums up the state of the climate with two \nwords: ``it's ugly.'' I have to agree. From record temperatures to \nrecord sea levels to changing weather to retreating glaciers, climate \nchange is evident across an array of measurements and observations. We \nare watching our planet change before our very eyes.\n  Let's see what these measurements say.\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\n  Well, 2014 was another record year for global temperatures. NOAA and \nNASA both concluded that 2014 was the hottest year since recordkeeping \nbegan in 1880.\n  This chart shows where temperatures in 2014 were warmer than the \n1981-to-2010 average, which is shown in red, and blue shows where the \ntemperatures were cooler than average.\n  The eastern part of the United States and Canada was one of only a \nhandful of places around the world that saw cooler-than-average \ntemperatures. But while it was cool here in 2014, almost everywhere \nelse in the world was feeling the heat. All you have to do is look at \nthe data to see it. It is a massive sea of red.\n  And 2014 does not stand alone; 17 of the 18 hottest years in the \nhistorical record have occurred in the last 18 years. The past decade \nwas warmer than the one before that, which was warmer than the one \nbefore that, and so far 2015 is on track to be even hotter than 2014. \nAll of this is measurement and straightforward fact.\n  Of course, as humans, we don't experience annual average changes in \ntemperature, we experience the weather, and we are beginning to see \nclimate change affect weather patterns all over the world.\n  This chart shows the number of extreme warm days and the number of \nextreme cold nights since 1960. The number of hot days, as we can see, \nis climbing, and the number of cold nights is decreasing. Both are \nsymptoms of a warming planet. This matters because those very warm days \npose human health risks and can be downright dangerous for people who \ndon't have air conditioning, especially for the young, old, and infirm. \nExtreme heat can stunt crops and drive down yields, and it can stress \nlivestock and other animals.\n  Cool nights are important too. It is the cold nights of winter that \nhelp control the mountain pine beetle, ticks, and other pests. With \nfewer cold nights, the mountain pine beetle has wreaked havoc over the \nwest in the past few years.\n  Last week, my colleagues on the Senate Climate Action Task Force and \nI heard from Dave Chadwick of the Montana Wildlife Federation about \nclimate change effects on the Montana's hunting industry, with hunters \ngoing to their favorite spots and no longer seeing the game they used \nto see.\n  Jill Ryan, the commissioner in Eagle County, CO, told us they are \nalready seeing fewer ski days in her Rocky Mountain community--not good \nfor Colorado's iconic ski industry.\n  In Maine and New Hampshire, out-of-control tick populations are \nattacking the region's iconic moose. A single moose might now carry \ntens of thousands of ticks. It is sickening to see, and it is no good \nfor the New Hampshire moose-watching industry. Yes, people actually do \nthat. Between mud and snowmobile trails and fewer, sicker, tick-\nencrusted moose, it ain't looking good.\n  This chart shows how much water various glaciers around the world \nhave lost each year since 1980. Last year the melting was equivalent to \neach glacier losing 33 inches right off the top. Look at these losses--\n31 consecutive years in a row of loss.\n  Last year's melt continues a sobering trend of heavier and heavier \nlosses. The red line here shows the total amount of ice loss since \n1980. It shows that glacial ice loss has been accelerated. Average \nlosses were about 9 inches in the 1980s, 15 inches in the 1990s, and 29 \ninches in the 2000s. Again, this is measurement, folks, not conjecture.\n  The oceans are warming. Why? Well, it is simple. As greenhouse gases \ntrap heat in the atmosphere, the heat is absorbed by the oceans. Over \n90 percent of the excess heat from greenhouse gases that has been \ntrapped has actually gone into the oceans, and 4 out of 5 analyses say \nthat the heat in the upper ocean set a record high in 2014.\n  These data show the decades-long warming of the surface oceans. \nColleagues who still insist that the climate has not warmed in the past \ncouple of decades--look at the oceans, that's where the heat went. This \nwarming is changing the oceans and changing our fisheries and, because \nof the law of thermal expansion, contributing to sea-level rise.\n  In 2014, global sea level was at its highest point since we began \nmeasuring it with satellites in 1993, which is shown on the chart.\n  In 2014, we saw the sea level continuing to rise at a rate of about \n\\1/8\\ of an inch per year. We measure this in Rhode Island. Sea level \nat the Newport Naval Station has increased almost 10 inches since the \n1930s. This matters when you have storms riding in on higher seas and \ntearing away our Rhode Island coastline. Sea level rise matters a lot \nto my constituents.\n\n  Measurements are confirming what the scientists have predicted: The \nseas are rising because the oceans are warming and ice on land is \nmelting. The climate is warming because greenhouse gases are trapping \nheat from the Sun in the atmosphere.\n  Again, these are irrefutable facts, confirmed by experts and \nscientific organizations and big corporations such as Walmart. Here is \nthe reason. The main culprit behind the changes we are observing is \ncarbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere, which in 2014 reached \nrecord levels. The global average exceeded 400 parts per million in \n2014. In context, for as long as human beings have been on the planet, \nit has been between about 170 and 300. For our whole duration as a \nspecies, that has been the range. Now we are out of it by over 400 and \nclimbing. The global carbon dioxide levels haven't been this high in \nhuman experience.\n  Where are we headed in 2015? Well, these trends are likely \ncontinuing. Scientists are already predicting that 2015 will eclipse \n2014 in the record books for global temperature change. In 2015 we can \nexpect that the temperatures will continue to go up, the seas will \ncontinue to rise, and glaciers will continue to melt. It won't stop \nunless we choose to stop what is causing it.\n  We know our binge of carbon pollution is driving these changes. May I \nsay that today a news report has come out that shows one of the biggest \ncarbon polluters of all, ExxonMobil, knows that our binge of carbon \npollution is driving these changes and spent decades covering up what \nthey knew with a fusillade of lies that they launched to try to \ncontinue to sell their product. This is what folks who are engaged in \nclimate denial are buying into--a campaign of lies from a fossil fuel \ncompany, ExxonMobil, that itself knows better. I will have more on that \nstory later.\n  We can't just keep our heads buried in the sand. We have to wake up. \nWe have to wake up to the facts, and we have to wake up to our duty.\n  I appreciate the patience of my friend the Senator from Utah.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Freakish Year in Broken Climate Records\n\n                    (By Tom Randall, July 17, 2015)\n\n\n                      State of the climate: Broken\n\n       The annual State of the Climate report is out, and it's \n     ugly. Record heat, record sea levels, more hot days and fewer \n     cool nights, surging cyclones, unprecedented pollution, and \n     rapidly diminishing glaciers.\n       The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     (NOAA) issues a report each year compiling the latest data \n     gathered by 413 scientists from around the world. It's 288 \n     pages, but we'll save you some time. Here's a review, in six \n     charts, of some of the climate highlights from 2014.\n\n\n                     Temperatures set a new record\n\n       It's getting hot out there. Four independent data sets show \n     that last year was the hottest in 135 years of modern record \n     keeping. The map above shows temperature departure from the \n     norm. The eastern half of North America was one of the few \n     cool spots on the planet.\n\n\n                   Sea levels also surge to a record\n\n       The global mean sea level continued to rise, keeping pace \n     with a trend of 3.2 millimeters per year over the last two \n     decades. The global satellite record goes back only to 1993, \n     but the trend is clear and consistent. Rising tides are one \n     of the most physically destructive aspects of climate change. \n     Eight of the world's 10 largest cities are near a coast, and \n     40 percent of the U.S. population lives in coastal areas, \n     where the risk of flooding and erosion continues to rise.\n\n\n             Glaciers retreat for the 31st consecutive year\n\n       Data from more than three dozen mountain glaciers show that \n     2014 was the 31st straight year of glacier ice loss \n     worldwide. The consistent retreat of glaciers is considered \n     one of the clearest signals of global warming. Most alarming: \n     The rate of loss is accelerating over time.\n\n\n             There are more hot days and fewer cool nights\n\n       Climate change doesn't just increase the average \n     temperature--it also increases the\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n     extremes. The chart above shows when daily high temperatures \n     max out above the 90th percentile and nightly lows fall below \n     the lowest 10th percentile. The measures were near their \n     global records last year, and the trend is consistently \n     miserable.\n\n\n              Record greenhouse gases fill the atmosphere\n\n       By burning fossil fuels, humans have cranked up \n     concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by more \n     than 40 percent since the Industrial Revolution. Carbon \n     dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, reached a \n     concentration of 400 parts per million for the first time in \n     May 2013. Soon we'll stop seeing concentrations that low ever \n     again.\n       The data shown are from the Mauna Loa Observatory in \n     Hawaii. Data collection was started there by C. David Keeling \n     of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in March 1958. \n     This chart is commonly referred to as the Keeling curve.\n\n\n                The oceans absorb crazy amounts of heat\n\n       The oceans store and release heat on a massive scale. Over \n     shorter spans of years to decades, ocean temperatures \n     naturally fluctuate from climate patterns like El Nino and \n     what's known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Longer term, \n     oceans are absorbing even more global warming than the \n     surface of the planet, contributing to rising seas, melting \n     glaciers, and dying coral reefs and fish populations.\n       In 2015 the world has moved into an El Nino warming pattern \n     in the Pacific Ocean. El Nino phases release some of the \n     ocean's stored heat into the atmosphere, causing weather \n     shifts around the world. This El Nino hasn't peaked yet, but \n     by some measures it's already the most extreme ever recorded \n     for this time of year and could lead 2015 to break even more \n     records than last year.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, last week I began a thorough examination of \nthe facts in the case of Planned Parenthood and the scandal that is now \nengulfing our Nation's largest provider of abortions. Today I wish to \nreview briefly the evidence against Planned Parenthood--evidence \nbrought to light thanks to whistleblowers and the conscientious \njournalists working with an organization called the Center for Medical \nProgress.\n  After hearing that Planned Parenthood, in addition to performing \nalmost 1,000 abortions every single day, was also selling the organs \nand body parts of its victims, CMP began investigating. CMP's \ninvestigation, which it calls the Human Capital Project, lasted for \nmore than 2 years. Its findings have finally been published over the \nlast few months in the form of a series of video documentaries posted \non the Internet consisting mostly of interviews and undercover \nreporting of Planned Parenthood officials and facilities.\n  The videos have sparked debate and controversy and have thrown the \nabortion industry and its political clients back on their heels. But \nthanks to an indefensible coverage blackout in the pro-abortion \nmainstream media, most Americans have never even heard of, much less \nseen, these videos. Based on the vote the Senate took last month, and \nin particular based on the lack of substance coming from the other side \nof the aisle during that debate, it is a good bet that most of our \ncolleagues defending Planned Parenthood haven't seen those videos, \neither. So I thought it might do some good to at least get the facts \ninto the Congressional Record before we move forward.\n  To date, 10 of the expected 12 videos have been posted on the home \npage for the Center for Medical Progress. The first video was posted on \nJuly 14 and showed a luncheon meeting between CMP investigators posing \nas corporate buyers of fetal organs and Planned Parenthood's senior \ndirector of medical services. In the course of this business lunch, we \nlearn from the senior Planned Parenthood official's own words that \nPlanned Parenthood clinics traffic in the body parts of aborted \nchildren as a matter of routine; that Planned Parenthood keeps these \ntransactions at the local franchise level for legal reasons that appear \nto be designed to sidestep corporate liability; that Planned \nParenthood's abortionists may alter their surgical procedures--\nallegedly after consent forms have been signed--so as to maximize the \norgan harvest from unborn children. This was the infamous moment when \nwe learned that Planned Parenthood doctors can ``crush below'' and \n``crush above'' a baby's most lucrative parts. Finally, we learned that \nsuch alterations may involve performing dangerous and illegal partial-\nbirth abortions.\n  These revelations by themselves--in and of themselves, all by \nthemselves--shock the conscience, but they were only the beginning. In \nthe Center for Medical Progress's second video released on July 21, we \nwitness another undercover business lunch with investigators again \nposing as corporate organ buyers, this time with the president of \nPlanned Parenthood's Medical Director's Council. What we see in this \nvideo, contrary to Planned Parenthood's protestations, is without \nquestion a financial negotiation about the price of baby organs. They \nare not talking about compensating Planned Parenthood for procurement \nand delivery costs; no, they are haggling. As the official herself, a \nmedical doctor, jokes at one point, ``I want a Lamborghini.''\n  In another video released August 4, the vice president and medical \ndirector of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is seen not only \ndiscussing exactly this kind of market pricing but the need to conceal \nsuch transactions through message discipline. Here we learn that \nPlanned Parenthood physicians do indeed alter their surgical procedures \n``in a way that they get the best specimens''--that is, not to serve \ntheir patients but to maximize their sales numbers--because, as this \nvice president boasts, ``My department contributes so much to the \nbottom line of our organization.''\n  Subsequent videos have only corroborated these allegations. From the \nCEO of StemExpress, a major corporate buyer of fetal body parts, we \nlearned that, yes, the price of fetal tissue is driven by supply and \ndemand, not just cost reimbursements. And sometimes this market goes \nbeyond organs and tissue and actually traffics in whole unborn \nchildren.\n  From a fetal tissue producer, we learned that sometimes babies are \nborn alive and are killed outside the womb because, she says, it just \nfell out. Just this week, a new video showed a Planned Parenthood \nofficial admitting that some abortion clinics ``generate a fair amount \nof income selling baby organs.'' And these are just the undercover \nvideos.\n  Other videos feature the heart-wrenching testimony of a former \nStemExpress employee who tells the harrowing stories of her work inside \nPlanned Parenthood clinics. She tells not only of the screaming and \ncrying of the patients but also witnessing unethical behavior by the \nmedical staff. And, yes, the videos also contain horrifying, behind-\nthe-scenes images at Planned Parenthood centers where the exploitation, \nbutchering, and violence are worse than anything one can imagine. The \nimages and stories will pierce the heart of anyone who has a child or \nhas ever been one. But that is exactly why we must watch these videos. \nFor those who don't already know what abortion clinics are like and \nwhat they do, these videos must be seen to be believed.\n  For anyone who has ever wondered why so many Members of Congress, so \nmany citizens want to transfer taxpayer funding of abortion clinics to \nsafe community health centers that actually practice life-preserving \nmedicine as proposed in the bill recently introduced by Senator Ernst, \nwatch these videos and you will know. Watch these videos and you will \nunderstand.\n  Every new video brings further corroboration not simply of particular \ninstances of blood-chilling behavior but of what appears to be a \npattern and practice of endangering vulnerable women by manipulating \nsurgical procedures after consent forms have already been signed to \nperform abortions in a ``less crunchy'' way, for purposes not of \nwomen's health but greed; to harvest organs from aborted children and \nsell them to corporate purchasers; and to conduct this grisly business \nin secret to avoid public detection and outrage and, quite possibly, \ncriminal indictment--yes, indictment.\n  That--the potential crimes of the abortion industry evidenced in \nthese videos--will be the topic of my next speech on this scandal, for \nthe behavior documented by the Center for Medical Progress is not just \nstomach-turning--it is that, to be sure, but it may well also be \nillegal, violating not only the moral laws of nature and of nature's \nGod, which we already knew, but also the criminal laws of the United \nStates of America.\n  I would encourage my colleagues and all Americans to view these \nvideos for themselves so that they, too, can judge\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nfor themselves. We should all be warned: The videos are as difficult to \nwatch as they are easy to find, but the price of self-government is \nself-awareness.\n  The American people need to know the truth about what actually goes \non in America's abortion clinics, what lies are being told, and what \ncrimes are being committed in their name and with their own money. The \ntruth about human life and dignity has the power to set us all free, \nbut first, we have to tell it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, I spoke about Senate \nRepublicans' virtual shutdown of the judicial nominations process since \nthey took over the majority. Their refusal to respond to the urgent \nneeds of our independent third branch is threatening to harm our \njustice system and rob the judiciary of outstanding public servants.\n  One glaring example of this harm is the unnecessary delay of Judge \nLuis Felipe Restrepo, who was nominated last year to fill an emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in \nPennsylvania. Judge Restrepo was unanimously confirmed 2 years ago by \nthe Senate to serve as a district court judge. During his tenure as \nboth a Federal district court judge and as a Federal magistrate judge, \nhe has presided over 56 trials that have gone to verdict or judgment. \nHe is superbly qualified, and I have heard no objection to his \nnomination. Despite his outstanding credentials and experience, it took \nthe Republican majority 7 months just to schedule a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee for this qualified nominee.\n  Judge Restrepo has bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators \nand was voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote. \nOnce confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic judge from \nPennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second Hispanic \njudge to serve on the Third Circuit. He has the strong endorsement of \nthe nonpartisan Hispanic National Bar Association. At his confirmation \nhearing in June, Senator Toomey stated that ``there is no question \n[Judge Restrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve on the \nThird Circuit.'' Senator Toomey described Judge Restrepo's life story \nas ``an American Dream'' and recounted how Judge Restrepo came to the \nUnited States from Colombia and rose to the top of his profession by \n``virtue of his hard work, his intellect, his integrity.'' I could not \nagree more.\n  Given his remarkable credentials, wealth of experience, and strong \nbipartisan support, you would think the Senate would have confirmed \nJudge Restrepo months ago. Instead, he was nominated for a judicial \nemergency vacancy back in November 2014, and for 10 months since his \nnomination, he has been denied a vote on his confirmation. No Senate \nDemocrat opposes a vote on his nomination. The only ones who are \nholding up his nomination are the Senate Republicans. I have heard \nSenator Toomey indicate his strong support, and that he would like to \nsee Judge Restrepo receive a vote. I know Senator Toomey can be a \nfierce advocate for issues he cares passionately about, and I hope he \nwill get a firm commitment from the majority leader to schedule a \nconfirmation vote this week.\n  In addition to Judge Restrepo's nomination, there are 12 other \nnoncontroversial judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar \nwaiting for a vote. All of them were approved by voice vote by the \nJudiciary Committee. There is no reason for Republicans to block these \nnominees. More than 8 months into this new year, Republican leadership \nhas allowed votes on just six judicial nominees. By this time in 2007, \nwhen I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we had confirmed 29 \njudges nominated by President Bush. That is nearly five times more \nnominees than what this Republican majority has accomplished so far \nthis year. Because of the Republicans' virtual shutdown of the \nconfirmation process, judicial vacancies have increased by more than 50 \npercent--from 43 to 67. This is demonstrates an astounding neglect of \nthe needs of our independent Third Branch.\n  Instead of confirming Judge Restrepo and the 12 other \nnoncontroversial judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar, \nRepublicans are talking about another doomed vote on harmful \nlegislation to block women's health care choices. Republicans had \nalready forced a failed ``show vote'' to defund critical health \nservices for women, spending 2 days on that unnecessary political \nexercise. Although Senate Republicans campaigned last year on the \npromise that they would govern responsibly if they won the majority, \nthey continue to prioritize divisive issues that play only to their \npolitical base and yield no results for the American people.\n  I am urging Republican leadership to reverse course. Confirm Judge \nLuis Felipe Restrepo without further delay, and then confirm the other \n12 noncontroversial judicial nominees pending on our Executive \nCalendar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6693-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6693-S6694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the United States has a proud and unique \nhistory as a nation of immigrants. Ever since our founding, we have \nbeen a beacon of hope for those seeking opportunity. Generation after \ngeneration, our Nation has greatly benefited from the entrepreneurial \nspirit that these newcomers bring with them. That is as true today as \nit was 200 years ago.\n  Our Nation's history with immigration has not always been a story of \nacceptance. Newcomers have often faced resistance, isolation, \ndiscrimination and even racist opposition. Many of us here in this body \nknow those painful stories from our own immigrant families--others here \nhave felt the stinging words of bigotry themselves. My grandparents \nfaced signs telling them to not bother applying for work because of \ntheir ancestry but those old stories are hard to imagine today.\n  That is why it is so shocking to hear the steady rise in racist, \nxenophobic rhetoric coming from the Republican field of Presidential \ncandidates. These statements are offensive and have no place in our \nnational dialogue. Those who use such rhetoric are fear mongering for \npolitical gain. Even in today's hyped up political theater, this kind \nof language is unacceptable. It is hurtful, harmful, and just plain \nwrong.\n  It is incumbent on all of us to speak out against this dehumanizing \ndiscourse. A topic as important as immigration is worthy of debate, but \nin an informed and thoughtful manner. This weekend, Steve Case, a co-\nfounder of America Online, took a powerful stand in an opinion piece in \nthe Washington Post titled ``Business Leaders Must Speak Out Against \nTrump's Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric.'' Two years ago, as chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I invited Mr. Case to testify before the \ncommittee when we were considering comprehensive immigration reform, \nand he has continued to be a leader on the issue. He is right to stand \nup, speak out, and call on all Americans to reject the ugly words we \nare hearing from too many political actors on one of the most pressing \nmatters facing our country.\n  The growing partisan rhetoric that attempts to equate immigrants with \ncriminals and suggests we deport them en mass is both irrational and \ndangerous. It is time that they stop. The characterization of \nimmigrants as criminals here to harm us and our communities is not just \nbeneath the dignity of anyone who seeks to lead this Nation as \nPresident, it simply is not supported by the evidence. Anyone who \nlistened to the extensive testimony that the Senate Judiciary Committee \ncollected 2 years ago will know that immigrants commit crimes at lower \nrates than those born in the United States. Many become job producers \nand the vast majority are hard-working members of our communities who \nsupport our economy and strengthen our neighborhoods. No less than \nGrover\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\nNorquist testified that ``Increased legal immigration will add millions \nof consumers, workers, renters, and others who will make our economy \nlarger by working with Americans to produce more of the goods and \nservices we demand.''\n  We must put an end to this destructive anti-immigrant rhetoric and \nfind a way back to the constructive, bipartisan approach to reforming \nour immigration system. The Senate Judiciary Committee played a \ncritical role in that effort and I am proud of the productive, \nrespectful debates that marked our consideration of comprehensive \nimmigration reform in 2013. Both Democrats and Republicans praised the \nprocess as fair and thorough. Bipartisanship was a priority, and of the \n136 amendments we adopted in committee, all but 3 passed on a \nbipartisan basis. As a result of that remarkable effort, the Senate \npassed comprehensive immigration reform with overwhelming support. If \nHouse Republican leaders had simply brought that bill up for a vote, it \nwould have passed and been the law of the land. We would have taken an \nenormous step forward as a country to fix our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  That bill is an example of all we can accomplish when we put aside \nhateful slogans and focus on our primary job of actually legislating. I \nhope that we will return to a bipartisan approach this Congress so that \nwe can again pass legislation that strengthens our communities and our \neconomy, improves our border security, and keeps families together.\n  There is still strong support for meaningful immigration reform in \nthe Senate, and that is what we should work on here in Congress. There \nis no excuse for continued inaction and scapegoating. The time for \nimmigration reform is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6694-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING DR. YUICHI SHODA, DR. WALTER MISCHEL, AND DR. PHILIP PEAKE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, basic research is a building block of \nAmerican innovation. Without it, profound breakthroughs in science, \nmedicine, technology and other fields would simply not happen.\n  In Washington State, we know investments in basic scientific research \nare a key ingredient to the future of our information economy--from \naerospace and agriculture to technology and health care, and across all \nsectors of our economy.\n  It is in that spirit that, today, I recognize my constituent Dr. \nYuichi Shoda of the University of Washington and his colleagues, Dr. \nWalter Mischel and Dr. Philip Peake, for their receipt of a Golden \nGoose Award for federally funded research.\n  The Golden Goose Award recognizes the immense benefits of federally \nfunded research to human knowledge and our economy by shining a \nspotlight on obscure studies that resulted in significant impacts to \nour society and major breakthroughs.\n  Dr. Shoda and his colleagues are being honored for their seminal \nlongitudinal research project that has become known as ``the \nmarshmallow study.'' This study, funded by the National Institutes of \nHealth, began in the 1960s. The study presented children aged 4-to-5-\nyears-old with a choice between a single marshmallow they could eat \nimmediately or the promise of two marshmallows for which they would \nhave to wait.\n  Dr. Shoda and his team discovered a significant correlation between \nhow long children were able to wait for the treat and social and \nacademic traits as they became adults. Their discoveries have led to \nsignificant advances in the way we understand the human behaviors and \nthe neuroscience behind self-control and delayed gratification. \nAlready, educators are using Dr. Shoda's research to teach children \npositive habits at an early age. The implications of this research, \nfrom education to retirement and health, are vast.\n  As Dr. Shoda's project demonstrates, federally funded scientific \nresearch builds the foundation upon which new ideas are developed. Dr. \nShoda's research also provides an example for why Congress must make \nrobust and strategic investments in basic research across a variety of \nfields.\n  I congratulate Dr. Yuichi Shoda and his team for the marshmallow \nstudy and wish them a bright future as they continue unlocking new \nknowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6694-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING PAULA EKONOMOS KOZLEN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring the life of my dear friend, Paula \nKozlen, a former marketing executive, avid tennis player, world \ntraveler, community leader, beloved wife, sister, stepmother, aunt, and \nfriend, who passed away on August 29, 2015, after a courageous battle \nwith cancer.\n  Paula was truly one of a kind. Her energy and determination, her \nsense of humor and adventure, her incredibly kind heart and love of \nlife will always be remembered by everyone lucky enough to have crossed \nher path during her amazing life.\n  Paula was born in Illinois on July 26, 1952. After graduating from \nWestern Illinois University with a degree in education, she embarked on \na long and successful career in marketing and sales for several major \ncorporations around the country. Paula's career provided her with the \nopportunity to travel, which became a lifelong passion. She loved \nvisiting new places and developed deep and lasting friendships with \npeople all over the world who were drawn to her extraordinarily \ncompassionate and generous personality. Of all the places she traveled, \nshe found her home in the Coachella Valley of Southern California.\n  Paula cared so deeply about helping others and improving her \ncommunity, and she gave her time and energy without reservation. She \ndedicated herself to supporting music, theatre, and education in the \nCoachella Valley, served on boards for organizations that provide \nservices to those in need, and dropped everything to help the people of \nNew Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. Paula was the type of \nperson who wouldn't hesitate when she saw people in need and knew that \nshe could make a difference.\n  My entire family joins me in mourning her loss and sending our \nheartfelt condolences to Paula's husband, Vern Kozlen; sisters \nKatherine Wolcott, and husband Keene, and Vicki Griffin, and husband \nMichael; step-son Mark Kozlen; and niece Katherine Griffin.\n  Those of us who were lucky enough to have known Paula will be forever \ngrateful for the extraordinary time we had with her, the example she \nset, and the wonderful memories that we will forever cherish. We truly \nwalked in her light. She will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6694-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6694-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6694-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 720) to improve \nintergovernmental planning for and communication during security \nincidents at domestic airports, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 6:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker had \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 720.

A bill to designate the mountain at the Devils Tower \nNational Monument, Wyoming, as Devils Tower, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the introduction of \nlegislation which designates the mountain and populated place at Devils \nTower National Monument as Devils Tower. This is legislation I am \nintroducing today with the support of Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming \nand in conjunction with Representative Cynthia Lummis who is \nintroducing this same measure in the House.\n  Devils Tower National Monument is not an ordinary national treasure. \nThere are approximately 117 national monuments, but Devils Tower has \nthe distinction as being America's first national monument. Established \nby President Theodore Roosevelt on September 24, 1906, Devils Tower \nNational Monument preserves the unique geologic, cultural, and \naesthetic values of this breathtaking feature.\n  Devils Tower has a rich cultural history, and has many meanings to \ndifferent cultures, including the many peoples and Native American \ntribes that have historical and geographic ties to Northeastern \nWyoming. The Geographic Names Information System, GNIS, prepared by the \nU.S. Geological Survey, USGS, acknowledges there are sixteen documented \nvariant names to Devils Tower. Documents submitted to the U.S. Board on \nGeographic Names cite approximately 94 different published names for \nDevils Tower. Meanwhile, official Federal records indicate the name \nDevils Tower has existed for over 130 years.\n  This is why I am glad there was an opportunity for public comment and \ndebate on the most recent petition to rename Devils Tower. The results \nof that 5 month public comment period demonstrated there is strong \nsupport from the community and local officials to retain the Devils \nTower name for the geologic feature, the populated place, and the \nNational Monument.\n  Now that there has been an opportunity to hear comments about the \nmost recent petition to rename Devils Tower, the Wyoming congressional \ndelegation is introducing this legislation to preserve the Devils Tower \nname for the feature, populated place, and for America's first national \nmonument. We also encourage the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, U.S. \nDepartment of Interior, and the President to suspend any additional \nconsideration on the petition to rename the features at Devils Tower \nNational Monument.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Crook County\n\n\n                                       Board of Commissioners,\n\n                                 Sundance, WY, September 11, 2015.\n\n       In 1868, the Wyoming Territory was created. In 1885, Crook \n     County was created. In 1890, the Territory of Wyoming \n     obtained statehood. In 1906, the first national monument, \n     Devils Tower, was established. The United States was the \n     first country in the world to set aside its most significant \n     places\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\n     as national park units so they could be enjoyed by all.\n       Over the centuries, many people have passed through or have \n     inhabited the region now known as Crook County. The many \n     Native American tribes who were in the area called the summit \n     different names over time. By establishing the summit and the \n     surrounding grounds as Devils Tower National Monument, the \n     decision was made as to its official name.\n       The Crook County Commission would like to submit comments \n     from the public it began to solicit since March 2015. A \n     survey was developed and was inserted in the local \n     newspapers, put on Crook County's website and each \n     Commissioner hand delivered comment sheets throughout the \n     county to the area businesses and town halls. We received \n     comments from within the County and from around the world. As \n     of August 3, 2015, we have received 954 comments about the \n     summit: 34 approve the name change and 886 oppose the name \n     change. For changing the name of the settlement called Devils \n     Tower, we received 953 comments: 37 for the name change and \n     855 against it.\n       Crook County citizens believe the Tower is special. There \n     is evidence that organized gatherings have taken place at the \n     Tower since the first recorded climb of the Tower July 4, \n     1893. Citizens urged State and Federal officials to recognize \n     the importance of this landmark and pressed for improved \n     roads to the Tower in the early 1900's. Since then, the Tower \n     has been the site of numerous weddings, reunions, picnics, \n     school outings and other important life events. Always, the \n     Tower has been referred to with reverence. It is always \n     called ``Devils Tower'' or ``the Tower''. We are not aware of \n     any pet name or slang references used by local citizens. One \n     definition of the word, ``sacred'', in Webster's Dictionary \n     means ``worthy of respect''. By that definition, Devils Tower \n     is sacred.\n       If the name is changed to ``Bear Lodge'', it will diminish \n     the uniqueness of the site. This special place deserves more \n     than a generic name. There is already the Bear Lodge \n     Mountains east of the Monument. There is a rare earths mine \n     being built in the Bear Lodge Mountains called the Bear Lodge \n     Project. There is Bear Butte in Meade County, SD which is \n     reportedly a sacred site to some Native Americans. By having \n     so many places with ``Bear'' already in its name, it creates \n     confusion for the over 400,000 annual visitors who come \n     specifically to northeast Wyoming to see Devils Tower.\n       Records show the name Devils Tower has existed officially \n     for over 130 years. In the Bureau of Land Management \n     Cadastral Survey Land Plats dated August 24, 1883, it is \n     indicated that the summit was named Devils Tower. This is \n     based upon field notes from 1881 and 1882. Those field notes \n     dated July 23, 1883 state ``A prominent land mark is a high \n     peak in Section 7 called Devils Tower''.\n       Today is not the time to debate whether the site is sacred \n     to some tribes or not. Anecdotal evidence exists that some \n     tribes did avoid the area due to the ``bad gods''. Please see \n     some of the comments submitted. For example, the Campstool \n     Ranch was established by Lady Grace Esme MacKenzie in 1881. \n     ``The location of the ranch near the base of Devils Tower was \n     chosen not due to its scenery but because the Native \n     Americans were scared of it and would not go near it''. This \n     was in 1881. The Battle of the Little Bighorn was June 1876 \n     and the Indian Wars continued until 1918.\n       We do not believe that all elders, leaders and individual \n     tribal members find the name of the summit highly offensive, \n     insulting, etc., as stated in the petition. There is an \n     organization called Devils Tower Sacred to Many People whose \n     mailing address is Devils Tower, Wyoming which owns land near \n     the Tower. This federally recognized non-profit exists to \n     benefit the Native Americans who live on reservations. The \n     international monetary supports this organization receives \n     show many people recognize the name Devils Tower. The Native \n     artists who sell their wares to the organization recognize \n     the name also and support their efforts.\n       We do not believe the summit was given its name purposely \n     due to white people finding cultural and faith traditions \n     practiced by Native Americans ``evil''. It was the name \n     commonly used by the people who lived in the area. That is \n     why one name was chosen for the summit and for the National \n     Monument. Many tribes have their own historic name for the \n     Tower. The United States Board on Geographic Names Case Brief \n     cites approximately 94 different published names for Devils \n     Tower. We do not believe that over twenty tribes who have \n     potential cultural affiliation with the Tower have reached a \n     consensus to support the proposal of one name for the summit. \n     We believe each tribe will continue to use their traditional \n     name for the Tower and Wyoming natives will do the same. \n     Devils Tower has always been open to anyone to use as a \n     respectful place to carry on their own traditions and we \n     expect it to remain that way. The Tower can be shared by all.\n       The Crook County Commission questions what significant or \n     historic benefit will be advanced by changing the name of the \n     summit located at Devils Tower National Monument? Will the \n     name change proposed by the petitioners benefit many, just a \n     few, or will it cause more dissention? Therefore: We request \n     the Wyoming Board on Geographic Names and the United States \n     Board on Geographic Names retain the name of the summit as \n     Devils Tower.\n       We question why the settlement of Devils Tower is being \n     petitioned for change. There is a United States Post Office \n     there and we have not received a recommendation from the USPS \n     for a name change. Records show that particular Post Office \n     has been in existence since 1925. Reading some of the \n     comments we received from our Wyoming natives, we ask ``How \n     can people who do not even live in the area propose a name \n     change to a populated place?'' Numerous comments from the \n     people who have Devils Tower as their mailing address mention \n     the unnecessary distress of changing the name of their \n     business and changing their address on passports, official \n     documents and just receiving mail and packages.\n       Crook County received 855 comments to retain the name of \n     the settlement of Devils Tower. Again we ask: what \n     significant or historic benefit will be advanced by changing \n     the name of the settlement? A name change should be proposed \n     by the citizens it would most affect. Therefore, we request \n     the name of the settlement be retained as Devils Tower, \n     Wyoming.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kelly B. Dennis,\n       Chairman.\n     Jeanne A. Whalen,\n       Vice-Chairwoman.\n     Steve J. Stahla,\n       Member.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Graham, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        Mr. Lee, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Flake, Mr. Franken, Mr. Cruz, Mr. \n        Coons, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Perdue, and Mr. Markey):\n  S. 2040.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem \n     that threatens the vital interests of the United States.\n       (2) The Constitution confers upon Congress the power to \n     punish crimes against the law of nations and therefore \n     Congress may by law impose penalties on those who provide \n     material support to foreign organizations engaged in \n     terrorist activity, and allow for victims of international \n     terrorism to recover damages from those who have harmed them.\n       (3) International terrorism affects the interstate and \n     foreign commerce of the United States by harming \n     international trade and market stability, and limiting \n     international travel by United States citizens as well as \n     foreign visitors to the United States.\n       (4) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through \n     affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds \n     outside of the United States for conduct directed and \n     targeted at the United States.\n       (5) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of \n     action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under \n     the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (6) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the \n     leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, provides the proper legal framework for how \n     such liability should function in the context of the Anti-\n     Terrorism Act of 1987 (22 U.S.C. 5201 et seq.).\n       (7) The United Nations Security Council declared in \n     Resolution 1373, adopted on September 28, 2001, that all \n     countries have an affirmative obligation to ``[r]efrain from \n     providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n     or persons involved in terrorist acts,'' and to ``[e]nsure \n     that any person who participates in the financing, planning, \n     preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in \n     supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice''.\n       (8) Consistent with these declarations, no country has the \n     discretion to engage knowingly in the financing or \n     sponsorship of terrorism, whether directly or indirectly.\n       (9) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or \n     recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly \n     or indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a \n     significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that \n     threaten the security of nationals of the United States or \n     the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n     United States, necessarily direct their conduct at the United \n     States, and should reasonably anticipate being brought to \n     court in the United States to answer for such activities.\n       (10) The United States has a vital interest in providing \n     persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks \n     committed within\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n     the United States with full access to the court system in \n     order to pursue civil claims against persons, entities, or \n     countries that have knowingly or recklessly provided material \n     support or resources, directly or indirectly, to the persons \n     or organizations responsible for their injuries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil \n     litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with \n     the Constitution of the United States, to seek relief against \n     persons, entities, and foreign countries, wherever acting and \n     wherever they may be found, that have provided material \n     support, directly or indirectly, to foreign organizations or \n     persons that engage in terrorist activities against the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to revise counseling requirements for certain \nborrowers of student loans and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, student debt is a big and growing \nconcern for millions of American graduates.\n  As we look at ways of addressing this problem, it is important to \nkeep in mind that about 90 percent of that debt is owed to the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government currently holds more than $1 \ntrillion of student loan debt. That makes the U.S. Department of \nEducation one of the country's largest lenders.\n  As such, any solution to the debt problem needs to examine the \nFederal Government's lending practices. Federal banking regulations \nrequire commercial lenders to confirm a borrower's ability to repay the \nloan. Federal student loans are given without a credit check or any \nanalysis of the student's ability to repay the loan in the future. This \nis intentional, since many prospective college students have no credit \nand little or no income, but it also puts all the burden on student \nborrowers to make sure they don't borrow more than they need.\n  As a Nation, we have accepted that it makes moral and financial sense \nto assist low-income Americans in accessing higher education \nopportunities, and we do that to the tune of billions of dollars \nthrough Pell grants, subsidized student loans, and other student aid \nprograms. However, while need-based Federal student aid is vital to \nhelp students who could not otherwise afford to attend college, \nstudents are able to borrow well in excess of their financial need and \npotentially in excess of what they will be able to repay. So something \nneeds to be done about this.\n  College financial aid officers are required under law to issue \nFederal loans up to the full amount for which the student is eligible \neven if a financial aid administrator knows a student is borrowing more \nthan the student needs and will likely have trouble repaying. Think \nabout that. Even if the financial aid administrator knows the student \nplans to put the funds toward an engagement ring or sports car, Federal \nrules say they must issue the loan. If a bank followed the same rules \nas the Federal Government follows for student aid, it would be accused \nof predatory lending.\n  There have been lots of suggestions about how to address the student \ndebt issue, but if you don't tackle the root of the problem, it is like \nclosing the barn door after the horse has gotten out. A good place to \nstart is looking at how our current Federal student lending practices \nmay be helping to fuel the student debt problem. For example, about 60 \npercent of the students at the University of Iowa graduate with debt, \nand their average debt is about $25,000. However, the university \nestimates that of that $25,000 figure, about $13,000--or 60 percent of \nthe debt--is debt that was incurred to pay for tuition, room and board, \nand books, and the remainder is for what can be called lifestyle \nexpenses. In other words, about 40 percent of the average student debt \ntaken out by the University of Iowa student goes toward lifestyle-\nenhancing extras.\n  The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be \nlooking at a number of reforms to the student loan program as it drafts \nlegislation to reauthorize and reform the Higher Education Act. I know \nthat our esteemed Chairman Alexander has in the past proposed giving \nhigher education institutions additional tools to reduce unnecessary \nstudent borrowing. I have worked with Senator Franken of Minnesota on \nsome measures to provide more information about college costs when \nstudents are selecting a college in the very first place, which will \nhopefully encourage more price competition to combat rising tuition.\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\n  There is room for a lot of innovation in higher education. I don't \npretend to have all the answers and solutions to the problem of college \ncost and student debt, but I am proposing some very simple, very \ncommonsense first steps to empower students with the information they \nneed to make sound financial decisions.\n  The Higher Education Act already contains a requirement for colleges \nto provide counseling to new borrowers of Federal student loans. \nHowever, the current disclosures in the law do not do enough to \nencourage students to understand the scope and impact of the debt they \nwill face when they graduate.\n  I am here on the floor to introduce legislation I have entitled the \nKnow Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act. This bill strengthens the \ncurrent student loan counseling requirement by making the counseling an \nannual requirement before new loans are disbursed rather than just for \nfirst-time borrowers. My bill then adds several key components to the \ninformation institutions of higher education are required to share with \nstudents as part of that loan counseling. Under my bill, colleges would \nhave to provide an estimate of the student's projected loan debt-to-\nincome ratio at the time of their graduation. This would be based on \nthe starting wages for that student's program of study and the \nestimated total student loan debt the student will likely take out to \ncomplete the program. That way, students will have a real picture of \nthe student loan payment they will face and whether they will be able \nto afford those payments with their likely future income from whatever \nprogram they majored in.\n  We often hear that statistics show that on average a college degree \nresults in higher earnings over a lifetime. However, not all college \ndegrees have the same earning potential, and many students will be in \nfor a very rude awakening when they graduate and find that what they \nare able to earn with their degree does not match the level of their \ndebt. Students deserve to have this information when they are deciding \nhow much to borrow, not after they graduate with unmanageable debt.\n  This legislation I am proposing will also ensure that students are \ncounseled to borrow only the minimum amount necessary to cover expenses \nand informed that they do not have to accept the full amount of the \nloan offered. Students will also be given options for reducing \nborrowing through scholarships, reduced expenses, work study, or other \nwork opportunities. Also, not graduating on time can significantly \nincrease student loan debt, so students will be counseled on the impact \nof adding an additional year of study to the total indebtedness and how \nthey can stay on track to graduate on time.\n  Crucially, the bill also requires that a student manually enter \neither in writing or through electronic means the exact dollar amount \nof the Federal direct loan funding the student desires to borrow. The \ncurrent process almost makes borrowing the maximum the default option. \nIf you want to borrow less than is offered, you have to ask for less.\n  Because the amount of Federal student loans a student is eligible to \nborrow is not limited by the calculation of the financial need or \nability to repay, it is important that the student make a conscious, \ninformed decision about how much to borrow rather than simply accepting \nthe total amount of the Federal student loan which the law allows them \nto borrow.\n  Many schools already make a concerted effort to counsel students \nagainst over-borrowing, and such efforts are showing signs of success \nright in my home State of Iowa.\n  My alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, created a program 5 \nyears ago with the theme ``Live Like a Student.'' The program includes \nworkshops and courses designed to educate students on the importance of \nliving within their means while they are in school so they need not \nlive like a student later in life. As a result, the university has \nlowered average student debt from more than $26,000 to $23,163.\n  Grand View University, also in my State, has a financial empowerment \nplan where students and families construct a comprehensive 4-year \nfinancing plan. Under this plan, borrowing is based on the student's \nfuture earning potential in the student's field of study. The 4-year \nplan also helps ensure students graduate on time, and tuition increases \nare kept at 2 percent a year over those 4 years.\n  Iowa Student Loan, my State-based nonprofit lender, also has a \nprogram called the Student Loan Game Plan, which is an online \ninteractive resource that calculates a student's likely debt-to-income \nratio. It walks students through how their borrowing will affect their \nlifestyle in the future and what actions they can take now to reduce \ntheir borrowing. As a result, in the past year 18.2 percent of the \nstudents who participated decreased the amount they planned to borrow \nby an average of $3,680, saving students $2.1 million in additional \nloan debt.\n  My legislation would also require that students receive regular \nstatements about their loan while they are in school, just as they will \nwhen they graduate and start repaying. With just about any other kind \nof loan you can think of, borrowers start receiving statements right \naway and are expected to make payments. With Federal student loans, \npayments are not required until a period of time after graduation and \nno statements are sent out until that time, so students forget about \nthe amount of debt they are accruing until they graduate and get their \nfirst bill.\n  What is more, many Federal student loans still accrue interest while \nthe student is in school, which will be added to the total loan when \nthey start repaying. That means that not only do students forget how \nmuch debt they have while in school, making them less conscientious \nabout living like a student, but their loan may actually be growing \nwhile they are in school. Students have the option to pay that interest \nwhile they are in school so that it isn't capitalized into their loan. \nHowever, few students take advantage of this option. The regular \nstatement my bill calls for would encourage this practice so students \nget used to paying some amount toward their loans even before they \ngraduate. This will also make students more aware of their borrowing \nand less likely to overborrow each time they take out a new loan.\n  A college education generally remains a good investment. However, \nwhen students' academic dreams become a nightmare upon graduation \nbecause they borrowed more from the Federal Government than they can \nafford to repay with the degree they earned, they understandably feel \nsomething is very wrong. The Federal Government, as the lender making \nthese loans, has a responsibility to at least ensure that students know \nwhat they are getting themselves into before they get in over their \nheads. My legislation is intended to deal with that issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to prevent more students \nfrom drowning in Federal student loan debt, and I will introduce that \nbill at this particular time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6703-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2663.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     President Pro Tempore, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Section 202(d) of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312(d), \n     requires the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     (``the Board'') to issue regulations implementing Section 202 \n     of the CAA relating to sections 101 through 105 of the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (``FMLA''), 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2611 through 2615, made applicable to the \n     legislative branch by the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312(a)(1).\n       Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384(b)(1), \n     requires that the Board issue a general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking by transmitting ``such notice to the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of \n     the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the \n     first day of which both Houses are in session following such \n     transmittal.''\n       On behalf of the Board, I am hereby transmitting the \n     attached notice of proposed rulemaking to the President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate. I request that this notice be \n     published in the Senate section of the Congressional Record \n     on the first day on which both Houses are in session \n     following receipt of this transmittal. In compliance with \n     Section 304(b)(2) of the CAA, a comment period of 60 days \n     after the publication of this notice of proposed rulemaking \n     is being provided before adoption of the rules.\n       Any inquiries regarding this notice should be addressed to \n     Barbara J.

Camens,\n\n                                  Chair of the Board of Directors,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n\n        From the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance\n\n\n    NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING (NPRM or Notice), and request for \n                   comments from interested parties.\n\n     Modifications to the rights and protections under the Family \n         and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), Notice of Proposed \n         Rulemaking, as required by 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331, \n         Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, as amended \n         (CAA).\n     Background:\n       The purpose of this Notice is to propose modifications to \n     the existing legislative branch FMLA substantive regulations \n     under section 202 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302 et seq.), \n     which applies the rights and protections of sections 101 \n     through 105 of the FMLA to covered employees. These \n     modifications are necessary in order to bring existing \n     legislative branch FMLA regulations (adopted April 16, 1996) \n     in line with recent statutory changes to the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2601 et seq.\n       What is the authority under the CAA for these proposed \n     substantive regulations?\n       Section 202(a) of the CAA provides that the rights and \n     protections established by sections 101 through 105 of the \n     FMLA (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2611-2615) shall apply to covered \n     employees.\n       Section 202(d)(1) and (2) of the CAA require that the \n     Office of Compliance (OOC) Board of Directors (the Board), \n     pursuant to section 1384 of the CAA, issue regulations \n     implementing the rights and protections of the FMLA and that \n     those regulations shall be ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in the \n     subsection (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] except insofar as \n     the Board may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' The modifications to the regulations issued by the \n     Board herein are on all matters for which section 202 of the \n     CAA requires regulations to be issued.\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n       Are there currently FMLA regulations in effect?\n       Yes. On January 22, 1996, the OOC Board adopted and \n     submitted for publication in the Congressional Record the \n     original FMLA final regulations implementing section 202 of \n     the CAA, which applies certain rights and protections of the \n     FMLA. On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section 304(c) of the \n     CAA, the House and the Senate passed resolutions approving \n     the final regulations. Specifically, the Senate passed S. \n     Res. 242, providing for approval of the final regulations \n     applicable to the Senate and the employees of the Senate; the \n     House passed H. Res. 400 providing for approval of the final \n     regulations applicable to the House and the employees of the \n     House; and the House and the Senate passed S. Con. Res. 51, \n     providing for approval of the final regulations applicable to \n     employing offices and employees other than those offices and \n     employees of the House and the Senate. After the Senate and \n     the House passed these resolutions, the OOC Board formally \n     issued the FMLA regulations on April 19, 1996.\n       What does the FMLA provide?\n       The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers \n     to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate accrued paid leave, for up to a total of 12 \n     workweeks in a 12-month period: for the birth of the \n     employee's son or daughter and to care for the newborn child; \n     for the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for \n     adoption or foster care; to care for the employee's spouse, \n     parent, son, or daughter with a serious health condition; \n     when the employee is unable to work due to the employee's own \n     serious health condition; or for any qualifying exigency \n     arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active \n     duty (``qualifying exigency leave''). An eligible employee \n     may also take up to 26 workweeks of FMLA leave during a \n     ``single 12-month period'' to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness, when the \n     employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin \n     of the servicemember.\n       FMLA leave may be taken in a block, or under certain \n     circumstances, intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     basis. In addition to providing job-protected family and \n     medical leave, employers must also maintain any preexisting \n     group health plan coverage for an employee on FMLA-protected \n     leave under the same conditions that would apply if the \n     employee had not taken leave. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312(a)(1) \n     (incorporating 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2614). Once the leave period is \n     concluded, the employer is required to restore the employee \n     to the same or an equivalent position with equivalent \n     employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of \n     employment. Id. Under the FMLA statute, but not applicable to \n     the legislative branch, if an employee believes that his or \n     her FMLA rights have been violated, the employee may file a \n     complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL) or file a \n     private lawsuit in federal or state court. Under the CAA, a \n     covered employee of the legislative branch may be awarded \n     damages if the employing office has violated the employee's \n     FMLA rights. The employee is entitled to reimbursement for \n     any monetary loss incurred, equitable relief as appropriate, \n     interest, attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and court \n     costs. Liquidated damages also may be awarded. See 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2617.\n       What changes do the proposed amendments make?\n       First, these proposed amendments add the military leave \n     provisions of the FMLA enacted under the National Defense \n     Authorization Acts (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2010 \n     (Pub.L. 110-181, Div. A, Title V Sec. Sec. 585(a)(2), (3)(A)-\n     (D) and Pub.L. 111-84, Div. A, Title V Sec. 565(a)(1)(B) & \n     (4)), which: extend the availability of FMLA leave to family \n     members of the Regular Armed Forces for qualifying exigencies \n     arising out of a servicemember's deployment; define those \n     deployments covered under these provisions; extend FMLA \n     military caregiver leave for family members of current \n     servicemembers to include an injury or illness that existed \n     prior to service and was aggravated in the line of duty on \n     active duty; and extend FMLA military caregiver leave to \n     family members of certain veterans with serious injuries or \n     illnesses. This NPRM also sets forth a proposed revision to \n     the regulation defining ``spouse'' under the FMLA in light of \n     the DOL's February 25, 2015 Final Rule on the definition of \n     spouse and the United States Supreme Court's decision in \n     Obergefell, et al., v. Hodges, No. 14-556, 2015 WL 2473451 \n     (U.S. June 26, 2015), which requires a state to license a \n     marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize \n     a marriage between two people of the same sex when their \n     marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state.\n       Why are these changes to the FMLA regulations necessary?\n       The CAA requires that the FMLA regulations applicable to \n     the legislative branch and promulgated by the OOC, be the \n     same as substantive regulations issued by the Secretary of \n     Labor, unless good cause is shown for deviation therefrom. On \n     March 8, 2013, the DOL issued its Final Rule implementing its \n     amended FMLA regulations (77 FR 8962), which provide for \n     military caregiver leave for a veteran, qualifying exigency \n     leave for parental care, and special leave calculations for \n     flight crew employees. The OOC Board is required pursuant to \n     the CAA to amend its regulations to achieve parity unless \n     there is good cause shown to deviate from the DOL's \n     regulations.\n       In addition, the FMLA amendments providing additional \n     rights and protections for servicemembers and their families \n     were enacted into law by the NDAA for Fiscal Years 2008 and \n     2010. The Congressional committee reports accompanying the \n     bills containing these provisions do not comply with Section \n     102(b)(3) of the CAA in that, while the bills do contain \n     sections relating ``to terms and conditions of employment,'' \n     the accompanying reports do not ``describe the manner in \n     which the provision of the bill [relating to terms and \n     conditions of employment] . . . apply to the legislative \n     branch'' or ``include a statement of the reasons the \n     provision does not apply [to the legislative branch]'' (in \n     the case of a provision not applicable to the legislative \n     branch). 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(3); House Committee on Armed \n     Services, H.Rpt. 110-146 (May 11, 2007), H.Rpt. 111-166 (June \n     18, 2009). Consequently, when the FMLA was amended to add \n     these additional rights and protections, Congress failed to \n     make clear its intent as to whether these additional rights \n     and protections apply to the legislative branch.\\1\\ \n     Therefore, as there is no provision in the CAA that states \n     that the CAA will be considered amended whenever the FMLA is \n     amended, these proposed amendments to the regulations are \n     necessary to resolve any ambiguity regarding the \n     applicability of the 2008 and 2010 FMLA amendments to the \n     legislative branch by ensuring that protections under the CAA \n     are in line with existing public and private sector \n     protections under the FMLA.\\2\\ Accordingly, while these \n     regulations may technically require employing offices to do \n     more than what section 202 of the CAA currently requires, the \n     Board recommends that Congress use its rulemaking authority \n     to clarify that the rights and protections for legislative \n     branch servicemembers and their families have been expanded \n     in a manner consistent with the 2008 and 2010 amendments to \n     the FMLA.\n       What do the military family leave provisions provide?\n       Section 585(a) of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 amends the \n     FMLA to provide leave to eligible employees of covered \n     employers to care for injured servicemembers and for any \n     qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a covered \n     family member is on active duty or has been notified of an \n     impending call to active duty status in support of a \n     contingency operation (collectively referred to herein as \n     ``military family leave''). The provisions of this amendment \n     providing FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     became effective on January 28, 2008, when the law was \n     enacted. The provisions of this amendment providing for FMLA \n     leave due to a qualifying exigency arising out of a covered \n     family member's active duty (or call to active duty) status \n     were effective on January 16, 2009.\n       Section 565(a) of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, enacted on \n     October 28, 2009, amends the military family leave provisions \n     of the FMLA. Pub. Law 111-84. The Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA \n     expands the availability of qualifying exigency leave and \n     military caregiver leave. Qualifying exigency leave, which \n     was made available to family members of the National Guard \n     and Reserve components under the Fiscal Year 2008 NDAA, is \n     expanded to include family members of the Regular Armed \n     Forces. The entitlement to qualifying exigency leave is \n     expanded by substituting the term ``covered active duty'' for \n     ``active duty'' and defining covered active duty for a member \n     of the Regular Armed Forces as ``duty during the deployment \n     of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country'' \n     and for a member of the Reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces as ``duty during the deployment of the member with the \n     Armed Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to \n     active duty under a provision of law referred to in section \n     101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code.'' 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2611(14). Prior to the Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA amendments, \n     there was no requirement that members of the National Guard \n     and Reserves be deployed to a foreign country.\n       The Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA amendments expand the definition \n     of a serious injury or illness for military caregiver leave \n     for current members of the Armed Forces to include an injury \n     or illness that existed prior to service and was aggravated \n     in the line of duty on active duty. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2611(18)(A). These amendments also expand the military \n     caregiver leave provisions of the FMLA to allow family \n     members to take military caregiver leave to care for certain \n     veterans. The definition of a ``covered servicemember,'' \n     which is the term the Act uses to indicate the group of \n     military members for whom military caregiver leave may be \n     taken, is broadened to include a veteran with a serious \n     injury or illness who is receiving medical treatment, \n     recuperation, or therapy, if the veteran was a member of the \n     Armed Forces at any time during the period of five years \n     preceding the date of the medical treatment, recuperation, or \n     therapy. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2611(15)(B). The amendments define a \n     serious injury or illness for a veteran as a ``qualifying (as \n     defined by the Secretary of Labor) injury or illness that was \n     incurred by the member in the line of duty on active duty in \n     the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the \n     member's active duty and was aggravated by service in the \n     line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that \n     manifested itself before or after the member became a \n     veteran.'' 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2611(18)(B).\n       What is the effect of amending the definition of \n     ``spouse''?\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\n       Amending the definition of ``spouse'' brings the \n     regulations in line with the DOL's February 25, 2015 Final \n     Rule and the United States Supreme Court's decision in \n     Obergefell et al. v. Hodges.\n       On February 25, 2015, the DOL published its Final Rule for \n     29 CFR 825 in the Federal Register, Vol. 80, No. 37, 9989. \n     This Final Rule changed the definition of ``spouse'' under \n     the FMLA in light of the United States Supreme Court's \n     decision in United States v. Windsor, which found section 3 \n     of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to be unconstitutional. \n     The DOL's Final Rule amends the definition of spouse so that \n     eligible employees in legal same-sex marriages will be able \n     to take FMLA leave to care for their spouse or family member, \n     regardless of where they live.\n       Also, on June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court \n     issued Obergefell et al. v. Hodges, which requires a state to \n     license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to \n     recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when \n     their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-\n     state.\n       To date, the DOL has not indicated whether it plans to \n     further amend the definition of spouse in light of the United \n     States Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell et al. v. \n     Hodges. Therefore, the Board invites comment regarding \n     whether the Board should adopt the DOL's current definition \n     of spouse or revise the definition of spouse as the Board has \n     proposed in sections 825.102 and 825.122.\n       Minor editorial changes are proposed to sections 825.120, \n     825.121, 825.122, 825.127, 825.201 and 825.202 to make gender \n     neutral references to husbands and wives, and mothers and \n     fathers where appropriate so that they apply equally to \n     opposite-sex and same-sex spouses. The OOC proposes using the \n     terms ``spouses'' and ``parents,'' as appropriate, in these \n     regulations. These editorial changes do not change the \n     availability of FMLA leave but simply clarify its \n     availability for all eligible employees who are legally \n     married.\n     Procedural Summary:\n       How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n     the CAA?\n       Pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384, the \n     procedure for proposing and approving substantive regulations \n     provides that:\n       (1) the Board of Directors proposes substantive regulations \n     and publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the \n     Congressional Record;\n       (2) there be a comment period of at least 30 days after the \n     date of publication of the general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking;\n       (3) after consideration of comments by the Board of \n     Directors, the Board adopts regulations and transmits notice \n     of such action (together with the regulations and a \n     recommendation regarding the method for Congressional \n     approval of the regulations) to the Speaker of the House and \n     President Pro Tempore of the Senate for publication in the \n     Congressional Record;\n       (4) there be committee referral and action on the proposed \n     regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution; and\n       (5) there be final publication of the approved regulations \n     in the Congressional Record, with an effective date \n     prescribed in the final publication.\n       For more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of \n     the outline set forth above.\n       What is the approach taken by these proposed substantive \n     regulations?\n       The Board will follow the procedures as enumerated above \n     and as required by statute. The Board will review and respond \n     to any comments received under step (2) of the outline above, \n     and make any changes necessary to ensure that the regulations \n     fully implement section 210 of the CAA and reflect the \n     practices and policies particular to the legislative branch.\n       Are there substantive differences in the proposed \n     regulations for the House of Representatives, the Senate and \n     other employing offices?\n       No. The Board of Directors has identified no ``good cause'' \n     for varying the text of these regulations. Therefore, if \n     these regulations are approved as proposed, there will be one \n     text applicable to all employing offices and covered \n     employees. See 2 U.S.C.

The CAA, as \n     amended, applies the rights and protections of thirteen \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the legislative branch of the \n     federal government. Section 202 of the CAA applies to \n     employees covered by the CAA, the rights and protections \n     established by sections 101 through 105 of the Family and \n     Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2611-\n     2615. The above provisions of section 202 became effective on \n     January 1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312.\n       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (OOC) is \n     now publishing proposed amended regulations to implement \n     section 202 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438, as \n     applied to covered employees of the House of Representatives, \n     the Senate, and certain Congressional instrumentalities \n     listed below.\n       The purpose of these amended regulations is to implement \n     section 202 of the CAA. In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (NPRM or Notice) the Board proposes that virtually identical \n     regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, and the six Congressional instrumentalities. \n     Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that the amended regulations as \n     described in this Notice be included in the body of \n     regulations that shall apply to entities within the Senate, \n     and this proposal regarding the Senate entities is \n     recommended by the OOC's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     the amended regulations as described in this Notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to \n     entities within the House of Representatives, and this \n     proposal regarding the House of Representatives entities is \n     recommended by the OOC's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that the amended regulations as described in this \n     Notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, \n     the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including the Botanic \n     Garden), the Office of the Attending Physician, and the \n     Office of Compliance; and this proposal regarding these six \n     Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by the OOC's \n     Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 60 days after the date of \n     publication of this Notice in the Congressional Record.\n     Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes to the FMLA \n         Regulations\n       The following is a section-by-section discussion of the \n     proposed revisions. Where a change is proposed to a \n     regulatory section, that section is discussed below. However, \n     as the DOL has significantly reorganized its FMLA \n     regulations, which the OOC's proposed regulations mirror, \n     many of the sections are moved into other areas of the \n     subpart. The OOC as a result will use the proposed section \n     and numbers to provide explanation and analysis of changes. \n     In addition, even if a section is not discussed, there may be \n     minor editorial changes or corrections that do not warrant \n     discussion. The titles to each section of the existing \n     regulations are in the form of a question. The proposal would \n     reword each question into the more common format of a \n     descriptive title, and the OOC invites comments on whether \n     this change is helpful. In addition, several sections have \n     been restructured and reorganized to improve the \n     accessibility of the information (e.g., guidance on leave for \n     pregnancy and birth of a child is addressed in one \n     consolidated section; an employing office's notice \n     obligations are combined in one section).\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\n  \n\n     Section by Section Discussion\n     Subpart A--COVERAGE UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     Section 825.102 Definitions.\n       For the reasons stated below, the Board finds good cause to \n     depart from the DOL regulations with respect to some of the \n     definitions. For example, the term ``Act'' as defined in the \n     DOL regulations and referring to the FMLA can be confused \n     with the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). Accordingly, \n     the definition of ``Act'' is excluded from the Board's \n     proposed regulations. In addition, to avoid any confusion, \n     the definition for ``Administrator'' in the DOL regulations \n     has been deleted. Similarly, as there is no airline flight \n     crew covered under the CAA, the definition of ``airline \n     flight crew employee'' has been deleted in the Board's \n     proposed regulations as have all references to ``airline \n     flight crew employee.''\n       Because the DOL definitions of ``commerce and industry or \n     activity affecting commerce'' and ``applicable monthly \n     guarantee'' involve concepts that do not apply to employing \n     offices covered by the CAA, the Board finds good cause to \n     exclude these definitions from the proposed regulations.\n       Because the DOL's definition of ``eligible employee'' \n     (paragraphs ii(3)(4)(5)(6)(7) in section 825.102) is not \n     consistent with the definition of ``eligible employee'' in \n     CAA section 202(a)(2)(B), the Board finds good cause to keep \n     the definition of ``employee'' that is used in the current \n     version of the OOC FMLA regulations and to exclude the \n     definition in the DOL regulation.\n       Likewise, because the definition of ``employer'' in CAA \n     section 202(a)(2)(A) is inconsistent with the definition in \n     the DOL regulations, the Board finds good cause to keep the \n     definition of ``employing office'' found in the current \n     regulations.\n       In the paragraphs defining ``health care provider,'' to \n     avoid confusion, the Board is substituting ``the Secretary'' \n     with ``the Department of Labor.'' Thus, the OOC FMLA \n     regulations include in the definition of ``health care \n     provider'' as ``any other person determined by the Department \n     of Labor to be capable of providing health care services.'' \n     825.102(1)(ii) (emphasis added).\n       Because these terms are not applicable to employing offices \n     covered by the CAA, the Board has also found good cause to \n     exclude from the proposed OOC regulations the DOL definitions \n     of ``person'' and ``public agency.''\n       Under the paragraph defining ``physical or mental \n     disability,'' the Board has replaced the language from the \n     DOL regulations indicating that 29 CFR part 1630 defines \n     these terms with language that states that regulations at 29 \n     CFR part 1630 issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq., as amended, provide guidance to \n     these terms. (Italics added).\n       The Board is proposing to adopt the following definition of \n     ``spouse'':\n       Spouse means a husband or wife. For purposes of this \n     definition, husband or wife refers to all individuals in \n     lawfully recognized marriages. This definition includes an \n     individual in a same-sex marriage. This definition also \n     includes an individual in a common law marriage that either: \n     (1) was entered into in a State that recognizes such \n     marriages or, (2) if entered into outside of any State, is \n     valid in the place where entered into and could have been \n     entered into in at least one State.\n     Section 825.105 Counting employees for determining coverage.\n       This section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC's regulations.\n     Section 825.106 Joint Employer Coverage.\n       As joint employment relationships are treated differently \n     under the CAA than by the DOL, the Board finds good cause to \n     keep the language in the current OOC regulations in \n     paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Also, as it is \n     not applicable under the CAA, the Board finds good cause to \n     exclude from its definitions language relating to \n     Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) as joint \n     employers. As the DOL has noted, PEOs contract with private \n     small businesses to provide services that large businesses \n     can afford, but small businesses cannot, such as compliance \n     with government standards, employer liability management, \n     retirement benefits, and other employment benefits. Congress \n     already provides these services for its employees.\n     Sections 825.107-825.109 Successor in interest coverage; \n         Public agency coverage; Federal agency coverage.\n       These sections do not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC's regulations. However, the Board invites \n     comment with respect to whether the DOL section 825.107, \n     Successor in interest coverage, should be adopted for the \n     legislative branch.\n     Section 825.110 Eligible employee.\n       The Board sees good cause to exclude from this section the \n     following language from the DOL regulations, which is not \n     applicable to the CAA:\n       ``(3) Is employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees \n     are employed by the employer within 75 miles of that \n     worksite. (See Sec. 825.105(b) regarding employees who work \n     outside the U.S.) ''\n       Similarly, the Board sees good cause to exclude from the \n     OOC regulations the following paragraph:\n       ``(e) Whether 50 employees are employed within 75 miles to \n     ascertain an employee's eligibility for FMLA benefits is \n     determined when the employee gives notice of the need for \n     leave. Whether the leave is to be taken at one time or on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, once an \n     employee is determined eligible in response to that notice of \n     the need for leave, the employee's eligibility is not \n     affected by any subsequent change in the number of employees \n     employed at or within 75 miles of the employee's worksite, \n     for that specific notice of the need for leave. Similarly, an \n     employer may not terminate employee leave that has already \n     started if the employee-count drops below 50. For example, if \n     an employer employs 60 employees in August, but expects that \n     the number of employees will drop to 40 in December, the \n     employer must grant FMLA benefits to an otherwise eligible \n     employee who gives notice of the need for leave in August.''\n     Section 825.111 Determining whether 50 employees are employed \n         within 75 miles.\n       This section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Section 825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth.\n       References in the DOL's regulations to state law in this \n     section and other sections throughout the DOL's regulations \n     have not been adopted by the Board because state law does not \n     apply to the legislative branch.\n       Further, in this section and other sections throughout the \n     DOL regulations, any references to spouses who are employed \n     at two different worksites of an employer located more than \n     75 miles from each other have not been adopted by the Board \n     because such scenarios are not applicable to the legislative \n     branch.\n     Subpart B--EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS UNDER THE FAMILY AND \n         MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     Section 825.206 Interaction with the FLSA.\n       Although the DOL amended its FMLA regulations to add \n     computer employees to the list of exempt employees who do not \n     lose their FLSA exempt status despite being provided unpaid \n     FMLA leave, the Board finds good cause not to include \n     ``computer employees'' to the list of employees who may \n     qualify as exempt from the overtime and minimum wage \n     requirements of the FLSA. In light of the fact that the \n     Board's September 29, 2004 Proposed Regulations implementing \n     exemptions from the overtime pay requirements under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) were never enacted into \n     law and the existing OOC FLSA Regulations do not include \n     exemptions for computer employees, the OOC's FMLA regulations \n     should not include these employees in this section. The Board \n     specifically seeks comments to this departure from the DOL \n     regulations.\n       Further, any references in this section and other sections \n     throughout the DOL regulations which place limitations on an \n     employee who works for an employing office with fewer than 50 \n     employees have not been adopted by the Board because such \n     limitations do not apply to the legislative branch. See \n     825.111.\n     Section 825.207 Substitution of paid leave.\n       The DOL regulations under section 825.207(f) permit an \n     employer to require that an employee's use of paid \n     compensatory time for a FMLA reason can be used against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n       As the Board does not know whether or under what \n     circumstances, employing offices currently allow or require \n     that paid compensatory time be used for a FMLA reason and be \n     counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement, the \n     Board proposes that the comparable OOC FMLA regulation read \n     as follows:\n       Under the FLSA, an employing office always has the right to \n     cash out an employee's compensatory time or to require the \n     employee to use the time. Therefore, if an employee requests \n     and is permitted to use accrued compensatory time to receive \n     pay for time taken off for an FMLA reason, or if the \n     employing office requires such use pursuant to the FLSA, the \n     time taken may be counted against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement.\n       The Board seeks comments from interested parties as to \n     whether such a provision is appropriate for the legislative \n     branch.\n     Section 825.209 Maintenance of employee benefits.\n       The Board has changed what it believes to be a \n     typographical error in the DOL regulations and cross \n     references this section with section 825.102 and not section \n     825.800 when referring to the definition of ``group health \n     plan.''\n     Section 825.215 Equivalent position.\n       Any references from the DOL regulations in this section and \n     other sections to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     (ERISA) have not been adopted by the Board because ERISA does \n     not apply to the legislative branch.\n     Section 825.216 Limitations on employee's right to \n         reinstatement.\n       The Board questions whether the following language in \n     section 825.216(a)(3) of the DOL regulations applies to the \n     legislative branch: ``On the other hand, if an employee was \n     hired to perform work on a contract, and after that contract \n     period the contract was awarded to another contractor, the \n     successor contractor may be required to restore the employee \n     if it is a successor employer. See Sec. 825.107.''\n       The Board proposes that the OOC regulations contain the \n     following language and requests comments from interested \n     parties, especially with respect to caucus or committee\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\n     employees: ``On the other hand, if an employee was hired to \n     perform work for one employing office for a project for a \n     specific time period, and after that time period has ended, \n     the same employee was assigned to work at another employing \n     office on the same project, the successor employing office \n     may be required to restore the employee if it is a successor \n     employing office.''\n     Section 825.217 Key employee, general rule.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Board finds good cause \n     not to follow the DOL changes to section 825.217(b) which \n     exempts computer employees from the minimum wage and overtime \n     requirements of the FLSA. As the language in the FLSA is \n     inconsistent with the OOC FLSA regulations, the Board \n     believes that this exemption should not be included. The \n     Board requests comments from interested parties on this \n     deletion.\n     Section 825.220 Protection for employees who request leave or \n         otherwise assert FMLA rights.\n       Except for the paragraph related to settlements, as noted \n     below, the Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with \n     respect to this section. Section 825.220 provides protection \n     for employees who request leave or otherwise assert FMLA \n     rights and includes new language discussing remedies when an \n     employing office interferes with an employee's rights under \n     the FMLA. This section further clarifies that the prohibition \n     against interference includes prohibitions against \n     retaliation as well as discrimination. The Board believes \n     that there is good cause to make changes to the DOL's \n     clarification of the settlement provision in paragraph (d) of \n     this section. Sections 1414 and 1415 of the CAA govern awards \n     and settlements made as a result of parties proceeding \n     through an OOC process. While the Board recognizes that \n     parties will now have the right to settle or release FMLA \n     claims without the approval of the OOC or a court, parties \n     seeking to release claims which were raised in an OOC process \n     pursuant to CAA sections 1414 and 1415 must still comply with \n     those provisions. Therefore, the Board proposes to insert the \n     following language: ``Except for settlement agreements \n     covered by 1414 and/or 1415 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act, this does not prevent the settlement or \n     release of FMLA claims by employees based on past employing \n     office conduct without the approval of the Office of \n     Compliance or a court.''\n     Subpart C--EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYING OFFICE RIGHTS AND \n         OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CAA.\n     Section 825.300 Employing office notice requirements.\n       The Board proposes to follow the DOL regulations insofar as \n     they consolidate the employing office notice requirements \n     from sections 825.300, 825.301, 825.110 and 825.208 into one \n     comprehensive section addressing an employing office's notice \n     obligations. However, the Board finds good cause not to adopt \n     the DOL regulations in section 825.300(a) General notice, but \n     instead to keep the requirements found in the current OOC \n     regulations under section 825.301(a). The DOL regulations, at \n     section 825.300(a), address the requirement that employing \n     offices post a notice on employee rights and responsibilities \n     under the law and the civil monetary penalty provision in the \n     law for employing offices who willfully violate the posting \n     requirement. In 1995, while developing the current FMLA \n     regulations, the OOC Board determined that ``while the CAA \n     incorporates certain specific sections of the FMLA, the CAA \n     explicitly did not incorporate the notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements of sections 109 and 106(b) of the \n     FMLA. For the reasons discussed with respect to the FLSA, as \n     the CAA has not incorporated the notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements of the FMLA, the Board will not do \n     so.'' As a result, we find no authority that would require \n     employing offices covered under the CAA to provide notice \n     postings of employees' FMLA rights in the workplace. See \n     November 28, 1995 OOC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking S17628. \n     As to the remainder of the paragraphs in this section, the \n     Board finds no reason to depart from the amendments adopted \n     by the DOL.\n       The Board proposes to adopt section 825.300 regarding the \n     eligibility notice (825.300(b)); the rights and \n     responsibility notice (825.300(c)); the designation notice \n     (825.300(d)); and the consequences of failing to provide \n     notice (825.300(e)).\n       (b) Eligibility notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. The Board also proposes to adopt the DOL \n     regulations consolidating existing eligibility notice \n     requirements in current sections 825.110 and 825.301 into one \n     section, section 825.300(b) of the OOC regulations and to \n     strengthen and clarify them. For example, section \n     825.300(b)(1) of the DOL regulations requires an employer to \n     advise an employee of his or her eligibility status when the \n     employee requests leave under the FMLA. The regulations \n     extend the time frame for an employer to respond to an \n     employee's request for FMLA leave from two business days to \n     five business days. Further, the DOL regulations in section \n     825.300(b)(2) specify what information an employer must \n     convey to an employee as to eligibility status. The Board \n     also proposes in its regulations that an employing office \n     must provide reasons to an employee if he or she is not \n     eligible for FMLA leave, as do the DOL regulations. The \n     regulations limit that notification to any one of the \n     potential reasons why an employee fails to meet the \n     eligibility requirements.\n       Further, the proposed OOC regulations require employing \n     offices to include in the eligibility notice an explanation \n     of conditions applicable to the use of paid leave that runs \n     concurrently with unpaid FMLA. While this requirement is in \n     the current regulations, it is expanded to require that \n     employing offices also notify employees of their continuing \n     entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave if they do not comply \n     with an employing office's required conditions for use of \n     paid leave.\n       (c) Rights and responsibilities notice.\n       The Board is following the DOL regulations separating the \n     notice of rights and responsibilities from the notice of \n     eligibility. Accordingly, if the employee is eligible for \n     FMLA leave, section 825.300(c) of the OOC regulations require \n     the employing office to provide the employee with specific \n     notice of his or her rights and obligations under the law and \n     the consequences of failing to meet those obligations.\n       To simplify the timing of the notice of rights and \n     responsibilities and to avoid unnecessary administrative \n     burden on employing offices, section 825.300(c)(1) of the \n     Board's proposed regulations requires employing offices to \n     provide this notice to employees at the same time they \n     provide the eligibility notice. Additionally, if the \n     information in the notice of rights and responsibilities \n     changes, section 825.300(c) requires the employing office to \n     notify the employee of any changes within five business days \n     of the first notice of the need for FMLA leave subsequent to \n     any change. This timing requirement will ensure that \n     employees receive timely notice of the expectations and \n     obligations associated with their FMLA leave each leave year \n     and also receive prompt notice of any change in those rights \n     or responsibilities when leave is needed during the leave \n     year.\n       In this section, employing offices are required to notify \n     employees of the method used for establishing the 12-month \n     period for FMLA entitlement, or, in the case of military \n     caregiver leave, the start date of the ``single 12-month \n     period.''\n       Employing offices are not, however, required to provide the \n     certification form with the notice of rights and \n     responsibilities. Notice of any changes in the rights and \n     responsibilities notice must be provided within five business \n     days of the first notice of an employee's need for leave \n     subsequent to any change. Electronic distribution of the \n     notice of rights and responsibilities is allowed, so long as \n     the employing office can demonstrate that the employee (who \n     may already be on leave and who may not have access to \n     employing office-provided computers) has access to the \n     information electronically.\n       (d) Designation notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this requirement. Section 825.300(d) outlines the \n     requirements of the designation notice an employing office \n     must provide to an employee. Once the employing office has \n     enough information to determine whether the leave qualifies \n     as FMLA leave, the employing office must notify the employee \n     within five business days of making the determination whether \n     the leave has or has not been designated as FMLA leave. This \n     is an increase from the two-day time frame in the current OOC \n     regulations. Further, only one designation notice is required \n     for each FMLA-qualifying reason per leave year, regardless of \n     whether the leave is taken as a continuous block of leave or \n     on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis.\n       Further, the employing office must inform the employee of \n     the number of hours that would be designated as FMLA leave, \n     only upon employee request and no more often than every 30 \n     days if FMLA leave was taken during that period. To the \n     extent it is not possible to provide such information (such \n     as in the case of unforeseeable intermittent leave), the \n     employing office is required to provide such information to \n     the employee every 30 days if the employee took leave during \n     the 30-day period. The employing office is permitted to \n     notify the employee of the hours counted against the FMLA \n     leave entitlement orally and follow up with written \n     notification on a pay stub at the next payday (unless the \n     next payday is in less than one week, in which case the \n     notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). If the \n     employing office requires that paid leave be substituted for \n     unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under an existing \n     leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, the employing office \n     must inform the employee of this designation at the time the \n     leave is designated as FMLA leave.\n       Although the designation notice has to be in writing, it \n     may be in any form, including a notation on the employee's \n     pay stub, and if the leave is not designated as FMLA leave, \n     the notice to the employee may be in the form of a simple \n     written statement. Employing offices can provide an employee \n     with both the eligibility and designation notice at the same \n     time in cases where the employing office has adequate \n     information to designate leave as FMLA leave when an employee \n     requests the leave.\n       Employing offices must provide written notice of any \n     requirement for a fitness-for-duty certification, including \n     whether the fitness-for-duty certification must address the \n     employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the \n     employee's position and, if so, to provide a list of the \n     essential functions of the employee's position with the \n     designation notice. If the employee handbook or\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\n     other written documents clearly provides that a fitness-for-\n     duty certificate will be required, written notice is not \n     required, but oral notice must be provided.\n       Finally, the employing office is required to notify the \n     employee if the information provided in the designation \n     notice changes. For example, if an employee exhausts his or \n     her FMLA leave entitlement and the leave will no longer be \n     designated as FMLA leave, the employing office must provide \n     the employee with written notice of this change consistent \n     with this section.\n       (e) Consequences of failing to provide notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.300(e) clarifies that failure to \n     comply with the notice requirements set forth in this section \n     could constitute interference with, restraint of, or denial \n     of the use of FMLA leave. The Board proposes that the \n     following language be included in the OOC regulations:\n       Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure to \n     follow the notice requirements set forth in this section may \n     constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the \n     exercise of an employee's FMLA rights. An employing office \n     may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable or other relief, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the \n     harm suffered See 825.400(c).\n     Section 825.301 Designation of FMLA leave.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.301 addresses an employing \n     office's obligations regarding timely designation of leave as \n     FMLA-qualifying and reiterates the requirement to notify the \n     employee of the designation within five business days. Among \n     other things, this section requires that the employing \n     office's designation decision be based only on information \n     received from the employee or the employee's representative \n     and also provides that, if the employing office does not have \n     sufficient information about the employee's reason for leave, \n     the employing office should inquire further of the employee \n     or of the employee's spokesperson.\n     Section 825.302 Employee notice requirements for foreseeable \n         FMLA leave.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. In general, Section 825.302 addresses an \n     employee's obligation to provide notice of the need for \n     foreseeable FMLA leave. This includes requiring an employee \n     to give at least 30 days notice when the need for FMLA leave \n     is foreseeable at least 30 days in advance or ``as soon as \n     practicable'' if leave is foreseeable but 30 days notice is \n     not practicable. In such cases, employees must respond to \n     requests from employing offices to explain why it was not \n     possible to give 30 days notice. Further, the language in \n     this section defines ``as soon as practicable'' to be ``as \n     soon as both possible and practical, taking into account all \n     of the facts and circumstances in the individual case.'' This \n     is a change from defining ``as soon as practicable'' as \n     ``ordinarily within one or two business days.''\n       Further, when an employee seeks leave for the first time \n     for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     or even mention the FMLA but must provide: sufficient \n     information that indicates that a condition renders the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the job, or if \n     the leave is for a family member, that the condition renders \n     the family member unable to perform daily activities; the \n     anticipated duration of the absence; and whether the employee \n     or the employee's family member intends to visit a health \n     care provider or has a condition for which the employee or \n     the employee's family member is under the continuing care of \n     a health care provider. The regulations set forth the types \n     of information that an employee may have to provide in order \n     to put an employing office on notice of the employee's need \n     for FMLA-protected leave. Rather than establish a list of \n     information that must be provided in all cases, the \n     regulations provide additional guidance to employees so that \n     they would know what information to provide to their \n     employing offices. The nature of the information necessary to \n     put the employing office on notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     will vary depending on the circumstances.\n       Employees seeking leave for previously certified FMLA leave \n     must inform the employing office that the leave is for a \n     condition, covered servicemember's serious injury or illness, \n     or qualifying exigency that was previously certified or for \n     which the employee has previously taken FMLA leave.\n       While an employee must still comply with the employing \n     office's usual notice and procedural requirements for calling \n     in absences and requesting leave, under the new regulations, \n     language stating that an employing office cannot delay or \n     deny FMLA leave if an employee fails to follow such \n     procedures has been deleted. However, employing offices may \n     need to inquire further to determine for which reason the \n     leave is being taken, and employees will be required to \n     respond to such inquiries.\n       Additionally, the regulations make clear that the \n     requirement that an employee and employing office attempt to \n     work out a schedule without unduly disrupting the employing \n     office's operations applies only to military caregiver leave. \n     It does not apply to qualifying exigency leave.\n     Section 825.303 Employee notice requirements for \n         unforeseeable FMLA leave\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.303 addresses an employee's \n     obligation to provide notice when the need for FMLA leave is \n     unforeseeable. Section 825.303 retains the current standard \n     that employees must provide notice of their need for \n     unforeseeable leave ``as soon as practicable under the facts \n     and circumstances of the particular case,'' but instead of \n     expecting employees to give notice ``within no more than one \n     or two working days of learning of the need for leave,'' in \n     ``unusual circumstances,'' notice should be provided within \n     the time prescribed by the employing office's usual and \n     customary notice requirements applicable to such leave. \n     Section 825.303 also retains the current standard that \n     employees need not assert their rights under the FMLA or even \n     mention the FMLA to put employing offices on notice of the \n     need for unforeseeable FMLA leave, but adds the same language \n     used in proposed section 825.302 clarifying what information \n     must be provided in order to give sufficient notice to the \n     employing office of the need for FMLA leave. New regulations \n     in section 825.303 add that the employee has an obligation to \n     respond to an employing office's questions designed to \n     determine whether leave is FMLA-qualifying, explaining that \n     calling in ``sick,'' without providing additional \n     information, will not be sufficient notice.\n     Section 825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.304 follows the DOL's \n     reorganization of the rules that are applicable to leave \n     foreseeable at least 30 days in advance, leave foreseeable \n     less than 30 days in advance, and unforeseeable leave. This \n     section retains language that FMLA leave cannot be delayed \n     due to lack of required employee notice if the employing \n     office has not complied with its notice requirements.\n     Section 825.305 Certification, general rule.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Under the FMLA, as applied under the CAA, \n     employing offices are permitted to require that employees \n     provide a certification from their health care provider (or \n     their family member's health care provider, as appropriate) \n     to support the need for leave due to a serious health \n     condition. Section 825.305 sets forth the general rules \n     governing employing office requests for medical certification \n     to substantiate an employee's need for FMLA leave due to a \n     serious health condition. Military family leave provisions \n     have been added to permit employing offices to require \n     employees to provide a certification in the case of leave \n     taken for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Section \n     825.305 applies generally to all types of certification. In \n     most cases, for example, former references to ``medical \n     certification'' have been changed to ``certification.''\n       In section 825.305, the employing office should request \n     that an employee furnish certification from a health care \n     provider at the time the employee gives notice of the need \n     for leave or within five business days thereafter, or, in the \n     case of unforeseen leave, within five business days after the \n     leave commences. This time frame has been increased from two \n     to five business days after notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     is provided. Further, the employing office may request \n     certification at some later date if the employing office \n     later has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave \n     or its duration. This section also adds a 15-day time period \n     for providing a requested certification to all cases.\n       Definitions of incomplete and insufficient certifications \n     have been added in this section, as well as a procedure for \n     curing an incomplete or insufficient certification. This \n     procedure requires that an employing office notify the \n     employee in writing as to what additional information is \n     necessary for the medical certification and provides seven \n     calendar days in which the employee must provide the \n     additional information. If an employee fails to submit a \n     complete and sufficient certification, despite the \n     opportunity to cure the deficiency, the employing office may \n     deny the request for FMLA leave.\n       Section 825.305 also deletes an earlier provision that if a \n     less stringent medical certification standard applies under \n     the employing office's sick leave plan, only that lesser \n     standard may be required when the employee substitutes any \n     form of paid leave for FMLA leave and replaces it with a \n     provision allowing employing offices to require a new \n     certification on an annual basis for conditions lasting \n     beyond a single leave year.\n     Section 825.306 Content of medical certification for leave \n         taken because of an employee's own serious health \n         condition or the serious health condition of a family \n         member.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.306 addresses the information an \n     employing office can require in the medical certification to \n     substantiate the existence of a serious health condition (of \n     the employee or a family member) and the employee's need for \n     leave due to the condition, and adds: the health care \n     provider's specialization; guidance as to what may constitute \n     appropriate medical facts, including that a health\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\n     care provider may provide a diagnosis; and whether \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave is medically \n     necessary. Section 825.306 clarifies that where a serious \n     health condition may also be a disability, employing offices \n     are not prevented from following the procedures under the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as applied under the \n     CAA, for requesting medical information. Section 825.306 also \n     contains new language that employing offices may not require \n     employees to sign a release of their medical information as a \n     condition of taking FMLA leave.\n       This section does not apply to the military family leave \n     provisions. The Board's proposed regulations have revised the \n     current optional certification form into two separate \n     optional forms, one for the employee's own serious health \n     condition and one for the serious health condition of a \n     covered family member.\n     Section 825.307 Authentication and clarification of medical \n         certification for leave taken because of an employee's \n         own serious health condition or the serious health \n         condition of a family member; second and third opinions.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL's amendments covered \n     under this section. Section 825.307 addresses the employing \n     office's ability to clarify or authenticate a complete and \n     sufficient FMLA certification. Section 825.307 defines the \n     terms ``authentication'' and ``clarification.'' \n     ``Authentication'' involves providing the health care \n     provider with a copy of the certification and requesting \n     verification that the information on the form was completed \n     and/or authorized by the provider. The regulations add that \n     no additional medical information may be requested and the \n     employee's permission is not required. In contrast, \n     ``clarification'' involves contacting the employee's health \n     care provider in order to understand the handwriting on the \n     medical certification or to understand the meaning of a \n     response. As is the case with authentication, no additional \n     information beyond that included in the certification form \n     may be requested. Any contact with the employee's health care \n     provider must comply with the requirements of the HIPAA \n     Privacy Rule.\n       It is no longer necessary that the employing office utilize \n     a health care provider to make the contact with the \n     employee's health care provider, but the regulations do \n     clarify who may contact the employee's health care provider \n     and ensure that the employee's direct supervisor is not the \n     point of contact. Employee consent to the contact is no \n     longer required. However, before the employing office \n     contacts the employee's health care provider for \n     clarification or authentication of the FMLA certification, \n     the employee must first be given an opportunity to cure any \n     deficiencies in the certification. Section 825.307 also \n     provides requirements for an employing office's request for a \n     second opinion, and adds language requiring the employee or \n     the employee's family member to authorize his or her health \n     care provider to release relevant medical information \n     pertaining to the serious health condition at issue if such \n     information is requested by the second opinion health care \n     provider. Section 825.307 also increases the number of days \n     the employing office has to provide an employee with a \n     requested copy of a second or third opinion from two to five \n     business days. This section of the regulations does not apply \n     to the military family leave provisions.\n     Section 825.308 Recertifications for leave taken because of \n         an employee's own serious health condition or the serious \n         health condition of a family member.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments covered in \n     this section. Section 825.308 of the regulations addresses \n     the employing office's ability to seek recertification of an \n     employee's medical condition. This section has been \n     reorganized to clarify how often employing offices may seek \n     recertification in situations where the minimum duration of \n     the condition, as opposed to the duration of the period of \n     incapacity, exceeds 30 days. Thus, an employing office may \n     request recertification no more often than every 30 days and \n     only in connection with an absence by the employee, unless \n     the medical certification indicates that the minimum duration \n     of the condition is more than 30 days, then an employing \n     office must wait until that minimum duration expires before \n     requesting a recertification. In all cases, an employing \n     office may request a recertification of a medical condition \n     every six months in connection with an absence by the \n     employee. An employing office may request recertification in \n     less than 30 days if, among other things, the employee \n     requests an extension of leave or circumstances described by \n     the previous certification change significantly. This section \n     clarifies that an employing office may request the same \n     information on recertification as required for the initial \n     certification and the employee has the same obligation to \n     cooperate in providing recertification as he or she does in \n     providing the initial certification.\n     Section 825.309 Certification for leave taken because of a \n         qualifying exigency.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL's regulations under \n     this section. Under the military family leave provisions of \n     the DOL regulations, an employing office may require that \n     leave taken because of a qualifying exigency be supported by \n     a certification and require that the employee provide a copy \n     of the covered military member's active duty orders or other \n     documentation issued by the military which indicates that the \n     covered military member is on active duty (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in \n     support of a contingency operation, as well as the dates of \n     the covered military member's active duty service. While a \n     form requesting this basic information may be used by the \n     employing office, no information may be required beyond that \n     specified in this section and in all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the qualifying \n     exigency for which the current need for leave exists. Section \n     825.309 also establishes the verification process for \n     certifications.\n       This section also provides that the information required in \n     a certification need only be provided to the employing office \n     the first time an employee requests leave because of a \n     qualifying exigency arising out of a particular active duty \n     or call to active duty of a covered military member. While \n     additional information may be needed to provide certification \n     for subsequent requests for exigency leave, an employee is \n     only required to give a copy of the active duty orders to the \n     employing office once. A copy of new active duty orders or \n     other documentation issued by the military only needs to be \n     provided to the employing office if the need for leave \n     because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different \n     active duty or call to active duty order of the same or a \n     different covered military member. See DOL (Form WH-384) and \n     OOC regulations proposed Form E.\n       An employing office may contact an appropriate unit of the \n     Department of Defense to request verification that a covered \n     military member has been called to active duty status (or \n     notified of an impending call to active duty status) in \n     support of a contingency operation. Again, no additional \n     information may be requested by the employing office and the \n     employee's permission is not required. This verification \n     process will protect employees from unnecessary intrusion \n     while still providing a useful tool for employing offices to \n     verify the certification information given to them.\n       Consistent with the amendments to section 825.126(b)(6), \n     with respect to Rest and Recuperation qualifying exigency \n     leave, the employing office is permitted to request a copy of \n     the military member's Rest and Recuperation orders, or other \n     documentation issued by the military indicating that the \n     military member has been granted Rest and Recuperation leave, \n     as well as the dates of the leave, in order to determine the \n     employee's specific qualifying exigency leave period \n     available for Rest and Recuperation. Employing offices may \n     also contact the appropriate unit of the DOD to verify that \n     the military member is on active duty or call to active duty \n     status. The employee's permission is not required to conduct \n     such verifications. The employing office may not, however, \n     request any additional information.\n     Section 825.310 Certification for leave taken to care for a \n         covered servicemember (military caregiver leave).\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. While the military family \n     leave provisions of the NDAA amended the FMLA's certification \n     requirements to permit an employer to request certification \n     for leave taken to care for a covered servicemember, the \n     FMLA's existing certification requirements focus on providing \n     information related to a serious health condition--a term \n     that is not necessarily relevant to leave taken to care for a \n     covered servicemember. At the same time, the military family \n     leave provisions of the NDAA do not explicitly require that a \n     sufficient certification for purposes of military caregiver \n     leave provide relevant information regarding the covered \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness. Section 825.310 of \n     the DOL's regulations provide that when leave is taken to \n     care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or \n     illness, an employer may require an employee to support his \n     or her request for leave with a sufficient certification. An \n     employer may require that certain necessary information to \n     support the request for leave be supported by a certification \n     from one of the following authorized health care providers: \n     (1) A DOD health care provider; (2) a VA health care \n     provider; (3) a DOD TRICARE network authorized private health \n     care provider; or (4) a DOD non-network TRICARE authorized \n     private health care provider. Sections 825.310(b)-(c) of the \n     DOL regulations set forth the information an employing office \n     may request from an employee (or the authorized health care \n     provider) in order to support the employee's request for \n     leave. The DOL developed a new optional form, Form WH-385, \n     which the Board adopted for proposed OOC Form F. The Board \n     agrees that OOC Form F may be used to obtain appropriate \n     information to support an employee's request for leave to \n     care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or \n     illness. However, an employing office may use any form \n     containing the following basic information: (1) whether the \n     servicemember has incurred a serious injury or illness; (2) \n     whether the injury or illness may render the servicemember \n     medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's office, \n     grade, rank, or rating; (3) whether the injury or illness was \n     incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty; and \n     (4) whether the servicemember is undergoing medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise on \n     outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary \n     disability retired list. However, as is the case for any \n     required certification for leave taken\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\n     to care for a family member with a serious health condition, \n     no information may be required beyond that specified above. \n     In all instances, the information on any required \n     certification must relate only to the serious injury or \n     illness for which the current need for leave exists.\n       Additionally, section 825.310 of the proposed OOC \n     regulations provides that an employing office requiring an \n     employee to submit a certification for leave to care for a \n     covered servicemember must accept as sufficient certification \n     ``invitational travel orders'' (ITOs) or ``invitational \n     travel authorizations'' (ITAs) issued by the DOD for a family \n     member to join an injured or ill servicemember at his or her \n     bedside. If an employee will need leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember beyond the expiration date specified in an ITO \n     or an ITA, the regulations provide that an employing office \n     may request further certification from the employee. Lastly \n     this section provides that in all instances in which \n     certification is requested, it is the employee's \n     responsibility to provide the employing office with complete \n     and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result \n     in the denial of FMLA leave.\n       The regulations also permit an eligible employee who is a \n     spouse, parent, son, daughter or next of kin of a covered \n     servicemember to submit an ITO or ITA issued to another \n     family member as sufficient certification for the duration of \n     time specified in the ITO or ITA, even if the employee \n     seeking leave is not the named recipient on the ITO or ITA. \n     The regulations further permit an employing office to \n     authenticate and clarify medical certifications submitted to \n     support a request for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember using the procedures applicable to FMLA leave \n     taken to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition. However, unlike the recertification, second and \n     third opinion processes used for other types of FMLA leave, \n     recertification, second and third opinions are not warranted \n     for purposes of military caregiver leave when the \n     certification has been completed by a DOD health care \n     provider, a VA health care provider, a DOD TRICARE network \n     authorized private health care provider, or a DOD non-network \n     TRICARE authorized private health care provider, but are \n     permitted when the certification has been completed by a \n     health care provider who is not affiliated with the DOD, VA, \n     or TRICARE.\n       An employee seeking to take military caregiver leave must \n     provide the requested certification to the employing office \n     within the time frame requested by the employing office \n     (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the \n     employing office's request), unless it is not practicable \n     under the particular circumstances to do so despite the \n     employee's diligent, good faith efforts.\n     Section 825.312 Fitness-for-duty certification.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL's regulations under this section. Section 825.312 \n     addresses the fitness for-duty certification that an employee \n     may be required to submit upon return to work from FMLA \n     leave. This section clarifies that employees have the same \n     obligation to provide a complete certification or provide \n     sufficient authorization to the health care provider in order \n     for that person to provide the information directly to the \n     employing office in the fitness-for-duty certification \n     process as they do in the initial certification process. The \n     employing office may require that the fitness-for-duty \n     certification address the employee's ability to perform the \n     essential functions of the employee's job, as long as the \n     employing office provides the employee with a list of those \n     essential job functions no later than the employing office \n     provides the designation notice. The designation notice must \n     indicate that the certification address the employee's \n     ability to perform those essential functions. An employing \n     office may contact the employee's health care provider \n     directly, consistent with the procedure in proposed section \n     825.307(a), for purposes of authenticating or clarifying the \n     fitness-for-duty certification. The employing office is \n     required to advise the employee in the eligibility notice \n     required by proposed section 825.300(b) if the employing \n     office will require a fitness-for-duty certification to \n     return to work. Employees are not entitled to the \n     reinstatement protections of the Act if they do not provide \n     the required fitness-for-duty certification or request \n     additional FMLA leave.\n       Section 825.312 also requires that the employing office \n     uniformly apply its policies permitting fitness-for-duty \n     certifications to intermittent and reduced schedule leave \n     users when reasonable safety concerns are present, but limits \n     the frequency of such certifications to once in a 30-day \n     period in which intermittent or reduced schedule leave was \n     taken. ``Reasonable safety concerns'' means a reasonable \n     belief of a significant risk of harm to the individual \n     employee or others. In determining whether reasonable safety \n     concerns exist, an employing office should consider the \n     nature and severity of the potential harm and the likelihood \n     that potential harm will occur. This is meant to be a high \n     standard. Thus, the determination that there are reasonable \n     safety concerns must rely on objective factual evidence, not \n     subjective perceptions. Employing offices cannot, under this \n     section, require such certifications in all intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule situations, but only where reasonable \n     safety concerns are present. There is no fitness-for-duty \n     certification form, nor is there any specific format such a \n     certification must follow as long as it contains the required \n     information. An employing office is allowed to require that \n     the fitness-for-duty certification address the employee's \n     ability to perform the essential functions of his or her \n     position. However, the employing office can choose to accept \n     a simple statement in place of the fitness-for-duty \n     certification (or not require a fitness-for-duty \n     certification at all).\n       There is no second and third opinion process for a fitness-\n     for-duty certification. A fitness-for-duty certification need \n     only address the condition for which FMLA leave was taken and \n     the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of \n     the job. The employee's health care provider determines \n     whether a separate examination is required in order to \n     determine the employee's fitness to return to duty under the \n     FMLA. A medical examination at the employing office's expense \n     may be required only after the employee has returned from \n     FMLA leave and must be job-related and consistent with \n     business necessity as required by the ADA. The employing \n     office cannot delay the employee's return to work while \n     arranging for and having the employee undergo a medical \n     examination.\n     Section 825.313 Failure to provide certification.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. Section 825.313 explains \n     the consequences for an employee who fails to provide medical \n     certification in a timely manner. An employing office may \n     ``deny'' FMLA leave until the required certification is \n     provided. This section also addresses the consequences of \n     failing to provide timely recertification. Section 825.313 \n     also clarifies that recertification does not apply to leave \n     taken for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered \n     servicemember.\n       Employees must be provided at least 15 calendar days to \n     provide the requested certification, and are entitled to \n     additional time when they are unable to meet that deadline \n     despite their diligent, good-faith efforts. An employee's \n     certification (or recertification) is not untimely until that \n     period has passed. Employing offices may deny FMLA protection \n     when an employee fails to provide a timely certification or \n     recertification, but it does not require employing offices to \n     do so. Employing offices always have the option of accepting \n     an untimely certification and not denying FMLA protection to \n     any absences that occurred during the period in which the \n     certification was delayed.\n     Subpart D--Enforcement Mechanisms\n     Section 825.400 Enforcement, general rules.\n       The Board finds good cause not to adopt DOL section 825.400 \n     because the enforcement of FMLA violations is different in \n     the legislative branch as opposed to the workforces regulated \n     by the DOL. The OOC section 825.400 remains the same.\n     Sections 825.401-825.404 Filing a complaint with the Federal \n         Government; Violations of the posting requirement; \n         Appealing the assessment of a penalty for willful \n         violation of the posting requirement; Consequences for an \n         employer when not paying the penalty assessment after a \n         final order is issued.\n       These sections do not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Subpart E--Recordkeeping Requirements\n     Section 825.500 Recordkeeping requirements.\n       This section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Subpart F--Special Rules Applicable to Employees of Schools\n     Sections 825.600-825.604 Special rules for school employees, \n         definitions; Special rules for school employees, \n         limitations on intermittent leave; Special rules for \n         school employees, limitations on leave near the end of an \n         academic term; Special rules for school employees, \n         duration of FMLA leave; Special rules for school \n         employees, restoration to an equivalent position.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under these sections. Sections 825.600-\n     825.604 cover the special rules applicable to instructional \n     employees. When an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule basis to \n     care for a covered servicemember, the employee may choose to \n     either (1) take leave for a period or periods of particular \n     duration; or (2) transfer temporarily to an available \n     alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that \n     better accommodates recurring periods of leave.\n       These sections also extend some of the limitations on leave \n     near the end of an academic term to leave requested during \n     this period to care for a covered servicemember. If an \n     instructional employee begins leave for a purpose other than \n     the employee's own serious health condition during the five-\n     week period before the end of the term, the employing office \n     may require the employee to continue taking leave until the \n     end of the term if the leave will last more than two weeks \n     and the employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term. Further, an employing \n     office may require an instructional employee to continue \n     taking leave until the end of the term if the employee begins \n     leave that will last more than five working days for a \n     purpose other than the employee's own serious health \n     condition\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\n     during the three-week period before the end of the term. The \n     types of leave that are subject to the limitations are: (1) \n     leave because of the birth of a son or daughter, (2) leave \n     because of the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or \n     foster care, (3) leave taken to care for a spouse, parent, or \n     child with a serious health condition, and (4) leave taken to \n     care for a covered servicemember.\n     Subpart G--Effect of Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, \n         and Collective Bargaining Agreements on Employee Rights \n         Under FMLA\n     Section 825.700 Interaction with employing office's policies.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. Section 825.700 provides \n     that an employing office may not limit the rights established \n     by the FMLA through an employment benefit program or plan, \n     but an employing office may provide greater leave rights than \n     the FMLA requires. This section also provides that an \n     employing office may amend existing leave programs, so long \n     as they comply with the FMLA, and that nothing in the FMLA is \n     intended to discourage employing offices from adopting or \n     retaining more generous leave policies. The Board proposes to \n     follow the DOL regulations and delete from the current OOC \n     section 825.700(a) the following: ``If an employee takes paid \n     or unpaid leave and the employing office does not designate \n     the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not count \n     against an employee's FMLA entitlement.'' As explained by the \n     DOL, this last sentence of section 825.700(a) was deleted in \n     order to conform to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \n     Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, 535 U.S. 81 (2002), which \n     specifically invalidated this provision.\n     Section 825.701 Interaction with State laws.\n       This DOL section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Section 825.702 Interaction with Federal and State anti-\n         discrimination laws.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. Section 825.702 addresses \n     the interaction between the FMLA and other Federal and State \n     antidiscrimination laws. Section 825.702 discusses the \n     interaction between the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and the FMLA. Under \n     USERRA, a returning servicemember would be entitled to FMLA \n     leave if, after including the hours that he or she would have \n     worked for the civilian employing office during the period of \n     military service, the employee would have met the FMLA \n     eligibility threshold. This is not an expansion of FMLA \n     rights through regulation; this is a requirement of USERRA.\n       With respect to the interaction of the FMLA and ADA, where \n     both laws may apply, the applicability of each statute needs \n     to be evaluated independently.\n       Further, the reference to employers who receive Federal \n     financial assistance and employers who contract with the \n     Federal government in this section has not been adopted by \n     the Board because federal contractor employers are not \n     covered by the CAA.\n       In its final regulations, the DOL removed the following \n     optional-use forms and notices from the Appendix of the \n     regulations, but continued to make them available to the \n     public on the WHD Web site: Forms WH-380-E (Certification of \n     Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health \n     Condition); WH-380-F (Certification of Health Care Provider \n     for Family Member's Serious Health Condition); WH-381 (Notice \n     of Eligibility and Rights & Responsibilities); WH-382 \n     (Designation Notice); WH-384 (Certification of Qualifying \n     Exigency for Military Family Leave); WH-385 (Certification \n     for Serious Injury or Illness of Current Servicemember for \n     Military Family Leave); and WH-385-V (Certification for \n     Serious Injury or Illness of a Veteran for Military Caregiver \n     Leave). The Board proposes to revise its forms and to make \n     the following OOC forms available on its website: Form A: \n     Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious \n     Health Condition; Form B: Certification of Health Care \n     Provider for Family Member's Serious Health Condition; Form \n     C: Notice of Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities; \n     Form D: Designation Notice to Employee of FMLA Leave; Form E: \n     Certification of Qualifying Exigency for Military Family \n     Leave; Form F: Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of \n     Covered Servicemember for Military Family Leave; and Form G: \n     Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of a Veteran for \n     Military Caregiver Leave. The Board's proposed forms now \n     include references to the Genetic Information \n     Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which is made applicable to \n     employees covered under the CAA. The Board invites comment on \n     whether these forms should be included in the regulations, or \n     whether covered employees and employing offices should be \n     directed to the DOL website for the appropriate forms. In any \n     event, the use of a specific set of forms is optional and \n     other forms requiring the same information may be used \n     instead. In proposing these revised forms, the Board \n     recognizes that the use of specific forms play a key role in \n     employing offices' compliance with the FMLA and employees' \n     ability to take FMLA protected leave when needed.\n\n   Substantive Regulations Proposed by the Board of Directors of the \nOffice of Compliance Extending Rights and Protections Under the Family \n                  and Medical Act of 1996, as amended\n\n\n                           FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n     Part 825--Family and Medical Leave\n     825.1 Purpose and Scope.\n     Subpart A--COVERAGE UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     825.100 The Family and Medical Leave Act.\n     825.101 Purpose of the FMLA.\n     825.102 Definitions.\n     825.103 [Reserved]\n     825.104 Covered employing offices.\n     825.105 Counting employees for determining coverage.\n     825.106 Joint employer coverage.\n     825.107 Successor in interest coverage.\n     825.108-825.109 [Reserved]\n     825.110 Eligible employee.\n     825.111 [Reserved]\n     825.112 Qualifying reasons for leave, general rule.\n     825.113 Serious health condition.\n     825.114 Inpatient care.\n     825.115 Continuing treatment.\n     825.116-825.118 [Reserved]\n     825.119 Leave for treatment of substance abuse.\n     825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth.\n     825.121 Leave for adoption or foster care.\n     825.122 Definitions of covered servicemember, spouse, parent, \n         son or daughter, next of kin of a covered servicemember, \n         adoption, foster care, son or daughter on covered active \n         duty or call to covered active duty status, son or \n         daughter of a covered servicemember, and parent of a \n         covered servicemember.\n     825.123 Unable to perform the functions of the position.\n     825.124 Needed to care for a family member or covered \n         servicemember.\n     825.125 Definition of health care provider.\n     825.126 Leave because of a qualifying exigency.\n     825.127 Leave to care for a covered servicemember with a \n         serious injury or illness (military caregiver leave).\n     Subpart B--EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS UNDER THE FAMILY AND \n         MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n     825.200 Amount of leave.\n     825.201 Leave to care for a parent.\n     825.202 Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule.\n     825.203 Scheduling of intermittent or reduced schedule leave.\n     825.204 Transfer of an employee to an alternative position \n         during intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave.\n     825.205 Increments of FMLA leave for intermittent or reduced \n         schedule leave.\n     825.206 Interaction with the FLSA.\n     825.207 Substitution of paid leave.\n     825.208 [Reserved]\n     825.209 Maintenance of employee benefits.\n     825.210 Employee payment of group health benefit premiums.\n     825.211 Maintenance of benefits under multi-employer health \n         plans.\n     825.212 Employee failure to pay health plan premium payments.\n     825.213 Employing office recovery of benefit costs.\n     825.214 Employee right to reinstatement.\n     825.215 Equivalent position.\n     825.216 Limitations on an employee's right to reinstatement.\n     825.217 Key employee, general rule.\n     825.218 Substantial and grievous economic injury.\n     825.219 Rights of a key employee.\n     825.220 Protection for employees who request leave or \n         otherwise assert FMLA rights.\n     Subpart C--EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYING OFFICE RIGHTS AND \n         OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CAA.\n     825.300 Employing office notice requirements.\n     825.301 Designation of FMLA leave.\n     825.302 Employee notice requirements for foreseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n     825.303 Employee notice requirements for unforeseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n     825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.\n     825.305 Certification, general rule.\n     825.306 Content of medical certification for leave taken \n         because of an employee's own serious health condition or \n         the serious health condition of a family member.\n     825.307 Authentication and clarification of medical \n         certification for leave taken because of an employee's \n         own serious health condition or the serious health \n         condition of a family member;

The purpose of this part is \n     to set forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of \n     section 202 of the CAA.\n       (b) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors \n     (Board) of the Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections \n     202(d) and 304 of the CAA, which direct the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing section 202 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown . . . that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' The regulations issued by \n     the Board herein are on all matters for which section 202 of \n     the CAA requires regulations to be issued. Specifically, it \n     is the Board's considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of the promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of regulations adopted \n     and set forth herein, there are no other ``substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 202 of the CAA].''\n       (c) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     SUBPART A--COVERAGE UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     825.100 The Family and Medical Leave Act.\n       (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as \n     made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), allows eligible employees of an employing office to \n     take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued \n     it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months (see \n     825.200(b)) because of the birth of a child and to care for \n     the newborn child, because of the placement of a child with \n     the employee for adoption or foster care, because the \n     employee is needed to care for a family member (child, \n     spouse, or parent) with a serious health condition, because \n     the employee's own serious health condition makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of his or her job, \n     or because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact \n     that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a \n     military member on active duty or call to covered active duty \n     status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to \n     covered active duty). In addition, eligible employees of a \n     covered employing office may take job-protected, unpaid \n     leave, or substitute appropriate paid leave if the employee \n     has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 26 workweeks \n     in a single 12-month period to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness. In certain \n     cases, FMLA leave may be taken on an intermittent basis \n     rather than all at once, or the employee may work a part-time \n     schedule.\n       (b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have \n     health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee \n     had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an \n     employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior \n     to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share \n     during the leave period. The employing office or a disbursing \n     or other financial office of the House of Representatives or \n     [italicized language is in only the House and \n     Instrumentalities versions of the regulations] the Senate may \n     recover its share only if the employee does not return to \n     work for a reason other than the serious health condition of \n     the employee or the employee's covered family member, the \n     serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, or \n     another reason beyond the employee's control.\n       (c) An employee generally has a right to return to the same \n     position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, \n     benefits, and working conditions at the conclusion of the \n     leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of \n     any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n       (d) The employing office generally has a right to advance \n     notice from the employee. In addition, the employing office \n     may require an employee to submit certification to \n     substantiate that the leave is due to the serious health \n     condition of the employee or the employee's covered family \n     member, due to the serious injury or illness of a covered \n     servicemember, or because of a qualifying exigency. Failure \n     to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in \n     the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied \n     policy, the employing office may also require that an \n     employee present a certification of fitness to return to work \n     when the absence was caused by the employee's serious health \n     condition (see 825.312 and 825.313)). The employing office \n     may delay restoring the employee to employment without such \n     certificate relating to the health condition which caused the \n     employee's absence.\n     825.101 Purpose of the FMLA.\n       (a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their \n     work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for \n     medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, for \n     the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious \n     health condition, for the care of a covered servicemember \n     with a serious injury or illness, or because of a qualifying \n     exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, \n     son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered \n     active duty or call to covered active duty status. The FMLA \n     is intended to balance the demands of the workplace with the \n     needs of families, to promote the stability and economic \n     security of families, and to promote national interests in \n     preserving family integrity. It was intended that the FMLA \n     accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the \n     legitimate interests of employing offices, and in a manner \n     consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment in minimizing the potential for employment \n     discrimination on the basis of sex, while promoting equal \n     employment opportunity for men and women.\n       (b) The FMLA was predicated on two fundamental concerns--\n     the needs of the American workforce, and the development of \n     high-performance organizations. Increasingly, America's \n     children and elderly are dependent upon family members who \n     must spend long hours at work. When a family emergency \n     arises, requiring workers to attend to seriously-ill children \n     or parents, or to newly-born or adopted infants, or even to \n     their own serious illness, workers need reassurance that they \n     will not be asked to choose between continuing their \n     employment, and meeting their personal and family obligations \n     or tending to vital needs at home.\n       (c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit \n     employing offices as well as their employees. A direct \n     correlation exists between stability in the family and \n     productivity in the workplace. FMLA will encourage the \n     development of high-performance organizations. When workers \n     can count on durable links to their workplace they are able \n     to make their own full commitments to their jobs. The record \n     of hearings on family and medical leave indicate the powerful \n     productive advantages of stable workplace relationships, and \n     the comparatively small costs of guaranteeing that those \n     relationships will not be dissolved while workers attend to \n     pressing family health obligations or their own serious \n     illness.\n     825.102 Definitions.\n       For purposes of this part:\n       ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq., as amended).\n       CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (Pub.

The first in-\n     person treatment visit must take place within seven days of \n     the first day of incapacity.\n       (iv) Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of \n     continuing treatment is necessary within the 30-day period \n     shall be determined by the health care provider.\n       (v) The term ``extenuating circumstances'' in paragraph (i) \n     means circumstances beyond the employee's control that \n     prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as planned by the \n     health care provider. Whether a given set of circumstances \n     are extenuating depends on the facts. See also 825.115(a)(5).\n       (2) Pregnancy or prenatal care. Any period of incapacity \n     due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care. See also 825.120.\n       (3) Chronic conditions. Any period of incapacity or \n     treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health \n     condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (i) Requires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a \n     year) for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse \n     under direct supervision of a health care provider;\n       (ii) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (iii) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (4) Permanent or long-term conditions. A period of \n     incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition \n     for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or \n     family member must be under the continuing supervision of, \n     but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care \n     provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or \n     the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (5) Conditions requiring multiple treatments. Any period of \n     absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period \n     of recovery therefrom) by a health care provider or by a \n     provider of health care services under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider, for:\n       (i) Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; \n     or\n       (ii) A condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive full calendar days \n     in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (6) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (2) or (3) of this definition qualify for FMLA leave even \n     though the employee or the covered family member does not \n     receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last more than \n     three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an \n     employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to \n     the onset of an asthma attack or because the employee's \n     health care provider has advised the employee to stay home \n     when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee \n     who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of \n     severe morning sickness.\n       Covered active duty or call to covered active duty status \n     means:\n       (1) In the case of a member of the Regular Armed Forces, \n     duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed \n     Forces to a foreign country; and,\n       (2) In the case of a member of the Reserve components of \n     the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment of the member \n     with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a Federal \n     call or order to active duty in support of a contingency \n     operation pursuant to: Section 688 of Title 10 of the United \n     States Code, which authorizes ordering to active duty retired \n     members of the Regular Armed Forces and members of the \n     retired Reserve who retired after completing at least 20 \n     years of active service; Section 12301(a) of Title 10 of the \n     United States Code, which authorizes ordering all reserve \n     component members to active duty in the case of war or \n     national emergency; Section 12302 of Title 10 of the United \n     States Code, which authorizes ordering any unit or unassigned \n     member of the Ready Reserve to active duty; Section 12304 of \n     Title 10 of the United States Code, which authorizes ordering \n     any unit or unassigned member of the Selected Reserve and \n     certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve to active \n     duty; Section 12305 of Title 10 of the United States Code, \n     which authorizes the suspension of promotion, retirement or \n     separation rules for certain Reserve components; Section \n     12406 of Title 10 of the United States Code, which authorizes \n     calling the National Guard into Federal service in certain \n     circumstances; chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States \n     Code, which authorizes calling the National Guard and state \n     military into Federal service in the case of insurrections \n     and national emergencies; or any other provision of law \n     during a war or during a national emergency declared by the \n     President or Congress so long as it is in support of a \n     contingency operation.

Conditions \n     for which cosmetic treatments are administered (such as most \n     treatments for acne or plastic surgery) are not serious \n     health conditions unless inpatient hospital care is required \n     or unless complications develop. Restorative dental or \n     plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous \n     growths are serious health conditions provided all the other \n     conditions of this regulation are met.

As used in the CAA, the term employing \n     office means:\n       (1) The personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator;\n       (2) A committee of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee;\n       (3) Any other office headed by a person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an employee of \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate; or\n       (4) The Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, the \n     United States Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the \n     Office of the Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, \n     and the Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (b) [Reserved]\n       (c) Separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a \n     single employing office for purposes of the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, if they meet the ``integrated \n     employer'' test. Where this test is met, the employees of all \n     entities making up the integrated employer will be counted in \n     determining employer coverage and employee eligibility. A \n     determination of whether or not separate entities are an \n     integrated employer is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be reviewed in its totality. Factors considered in \n     determining whether two or more entities are an integrated \n     employer include:\n       (1) Common management;\n       (2) Interrelation between operations;\n       (3) Centralized control of labor relations; and\n       (4) Degree of common financial control.\n     825.105 [Reserved].\n     825.106 Joint employer coverage.\n       (a) Where two or more employing offices exercise some \n     control over the work or working conditions of the employee, \n     the employing offices may be joint employers under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. Where the employee performs work \n     which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, \n     or works for two or more employing offices at different times \n     during the workweek, a joint employment relationship \n     generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n       (1) Where there is an arrangement between employing offices \n     to share an employee's services or to interchange employees;\n       (2) Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly \n     in the interest of the other employing office in relation to \n     the employee; or\n       (3) Where the employing offices are not completely \n     disassociated with respect to the employee's employment and \n     may be deemed to share control of the employee, directly or \n     indirectly, because one employing office controls, is \n     controlled by, or is under common control with the other \n     employing office.\n       (b) A determination of whether or not a joint employment \n     relationship exists is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be viewed in its totality. For example, joint employment \n     will ordinarily be found to exist when:\n       (1) An employee, who is employed by an employing office \n     other than the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator, is under the actual \n     direction and control of the Member of the House of \n     Representatives or Senator; or\n       (2) Two or more employing offices employ an individual to \n     work on common issues or other matters for both or all of \n     them.\n       (c) When employing offices employ a covered employee \n     jointly, they may designate one of themselves to be the \n     primary employing office, and the other or others to be the \n     secondary employing office(s). Such a designation shall be \n     made by written notice to the covered employee.\n       (d) If an employing office is designated a primary \n     employing office pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, \n     only that employing office is responsible for giving required \n     notices to the covered employee, providing FMLA leave, and \n     maintenance of health benefits. Job restoration is the \n     primary responsibility of the primary employing office, and \n     the secondary employing office(s) may, subject to the \n     limitations in 825.216, be responsible for accepting the \n     employee returning from FMLA leave.\n       (e) If employing offices employ an employee jointly, but \n     fail to designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     paragraph (c) of this section, then all of these employing \n     offices shall be jointly and severally liable for giving \n     required notices to the employee, for providing FMLA leave, \n     for assuring that health benefits are maintained, and for job \n     restoration. The employee may give notice of need for FMLA \n     leave, as described in 825.302 and 825.303, to whichever of \n     these employing offices the employee chooses. If the employee \n     makes a written request for restoration to one of these \n     employing offices, that employing office shall be primarily \n     responsible for job restoration, and the other employing \n     office(s) may, subject to the limitations in 825.216, be \n     responsible for accepting the employee returning from FMLA \n     leave.\n     825.107 [Reserved]\n     825.108 [Reserved]\n     825.109 [Reserved]\n     825.110 Eligible employees.\n       (a) An eligible employee is an employee of a covered \n     employing office who:\n       (1) Has been employed by any employing office for at least \n     12 months, and\n       (2) Has been employed for at least 1,250 hours of service \n     during the 12-month period immediately preceding the \n     commencement of the leave.\n       (b) The 12 months an employee must have been employed by \n     any employing office need not be consecutive months, \n     provided:\n       (1) Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph (b)(2) \n     of this section, employment periods prior to a break in \n     service of seven years or more need not be counted in \n     determining whether the employee has been employed by the \n     employing office for at least 12 months.\n       (2) Employment periods preceding a break in service of more \n     than seven years must be counted in determining whether the \n     employee has been employed by the employing office for at \n     least 12 months where:\n       (i) The employee's break in service is occasioned by the \n     fulfillment of his or her Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301, et\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n     seq., covered service obligation. The period of absence from \n     work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service must be \n     also counted in determining whether the employee has been \n     employed for at least 12 months by the employing office. \n     However, this section does not provide any greater \n     entitlement to the employee than would be available under the \n     USERRA; or\n       (ii) A written agreement, including a collective bargaining \n     agreement, exists concerning the employing office's intention \n     to rehire the employee after the break in service (e.g., for \n     purposes of the employee furthering his or her education or \n     for childrearing purposes).\n       (3) If an employee worked for two or more employing offices \n     sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine \n     whether it equals 12 months.\n       (4) If an employee is maintained on the payroll for any \n     part of a week, including any periods of paid or unpaid leave \n     (sick, vacation) during which other benefits or compensation \n     are provided by the employing office (e.g., Federal \n     Employees' Compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), \n     the week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of \n     determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment \n     qualifies as at least 12 months, 52 weeks is deemed to be \n     equal to 12 months.\n       (5) Nothing in this section prevents employing offices from \n     considering employment prior to a continuous break in service \n     of more than seven years when determining whether an employee \n     has met the 12-month employment requirement. However, if an \n     employing office chooses to recognize such prior employment, \n     the employing office must do so uniformly, with respect to \n     all employees with similar breaks in service.\n       (c)(1) If an employee was employed by two or more employing \n     offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of \n     service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum \n     of 1,250 hours has been reached.\n       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, \n     whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of \n     service is determined according to the principles established \n     under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as applied by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), for determining \n     compensable hours of work. The determining factor is the \n     number of hours an employee has worked for one or more \n     employing offices. The determination is not limited by \n     methods of recordkeeping, or by compensation agreements that \n     do not accurately reflect all of the hours an employee has \n     worked for or been in service to the employing office. Any \n     accurate accounting of actual hours worked under the FLSA's \n     principles may be used.\n       (3) An employee returning from USERRA-covered service shall \n     be credited with the hours of service that would have been \n     performed but for the period of absence from work due to or \n     necessitated by USERRA-covered service in determining the \n     employee's eligibility for FMLA-qualifying leave. \n     Accordingly, a person reemployed following USERRA-covered \n     service has the hours that would have been worked for the \n     employing office added to any hours actually worked during \n     the previous 12-month period to meet the hours of service \n     requirement. In order to determine the hours that would have \n     been worked during the period of absence from work due to or \n     necessitated by USERRA-covered service, the employee's pre-\n     service work schedule can generally be used for calculations.\n       (4) In the event an employing office does not maintain an \n     accurate record of hours worked by an employee, including for \n     employees who are exempt from FLSA's requirement that a \n     record be kept of their hours worked (e.g., bona fide \n     executive, administrative, and professional employees as \n     defined in the FLSA Regulations, 29 CFR part 541, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, the employing office has the burden of \n     showing that the employee has not worked the requisite hours. \n     An employing office must be able to clearly demonstrate, for \n     example, that full-time teachers (see 825.102 for definition) \n     of an elementary or secondary school system, or institution \n     of higher education, or other educational establishment or \n     institution (who often work outside the classroom or at their \n     homes) did not work 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months \n     in order to claim that the teachers are not eligible for FMLA \n     leave.\n       (d) The determination of whether an employee has worked for \n     any employing office for at least 1,250 hours in the past 12 \n     months and has been employed by any employing office for a \n     total of at least 12 months must be made as of the date the \n     FMLA leave is to start. An employee may be on non-FMLA leave \n     at the time he or she meets the 12-month eligibility \n     requirement, and in that event, any portion of the leave \n     taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason after the employee meets \n     the eligibility requirement would be FMLA leave. See \n     825.300(b) for rules governing the content of the eligibility \n     notice given to employees.\n       (e) [Reserved]\n     825.111 [Reserved]\n     825.112 Qualifying reasons for leave, general rule.\n       (a) Circumstances qualifying for leave. Employing offices \n     covered by FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are required to \n     grant leave to eligible employees:\n       (1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the \n     newborn child (see 825.120);\n       (2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care (see 825.121);\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition (see 825.113 and \n     825.122); and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's \n     job (see 825.113 and 825.123);\n       (5) Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the \n     fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is \n     a military member on covered active duty (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to covered active \n     status) (see 825.122 and 825.126); and\n       (6) To care for a covered servicemember with a serious \n     injury or illness if the employee is the spouse, son, \n     daughter, parent, or next of kin of the covered servicemember \n     (see 825.122 and 825.127).\n       (b) Equal Application. The right to take leave under FMLA, \n     as made applicable by the CAA, applies equally to male and \n     female employees. A father, as well as a mother, can take \n     family leave for the birth, placement for adoption, or foster \n     care of a child.\n       (c) Active employee. In situations where the employing \n     office/employee relationship has been interrupted, such as an \n     employee who has been on layoff, the employee must be \n     recalled or otherwise be re-employed before being eligible \n     for FMLA leave. Under such circumstances, an eligible \n     employee is immediately entitled to further FMLA leave for a \n     qualifying reason.\n     825.113 Serious health condition.\n       (a) For purposes of FMLA, serious health condition \n     entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves \n     inpatient care as defined in 825.114 or continuing treatment \n     by a health care provider as defined in 825.115.\n       (b) The term incapacity means inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefore, or recovery \n     therefrom.\n       (c) The term treatment includes (but is not limited to) \n     examinations to determine if a serious health condition \n     exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not \n     include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or \n     dental examinations. A regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment \n     to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). \n     A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of \n     over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, \n     or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (d) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not serious health conditions unless inpatient \n     hospital care is required or unless complications develop. \n     Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the \n     flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other \n     than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, \n     periodontal disease, etc., are examples of conditions that do \n     not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do \n     not qualify for FMLA leave. Restorative dental or plastic \n     surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are \n     serious health conditions provided all the other conditions \n     of this regulation are met. Mental illness or allergies may \n     be serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions \n     of this section are met.\n     825.114 Inpatient care.\n       Inpatient care means an overnight stay in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity as defined in 825.113(b), or any \n     subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care.\n     825.115 Continuing treatment.\n       A serious health condition involving continuing treatment \n     by a health care provider includes any one or more of the \n     following:\n       (a) Incapacity and treatment. A period of incapacity of \n     more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any \n     subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the \n     same condition, that also involves:\n       (1) Treatment two or more times, within 30 days of the \n     first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances \n     exist, by a health care provider, by a nurse under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of \n     health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders \n     of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (3) The requirement in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this \n     section for treatment by a health care provider means an in-\n     person visit to a health care provider. The first (or only) \n     in-person treatment visit must take place within seven days \n     of the first day of incapacity.\n       (4) Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of \n     continuing treatment is necessary within the 30-day period \n     shall be determined by the health care provider.\n       (5) The term extenuating circumstances in paragraph (a)(1) \n     of this section means circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\n     that prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as planned by \n     the health care provider. Whether a given set of \n     circumstances are extenuating depends on the facts. For \n     example, extenuating circumstances exist if a health care \n     provider determines that a second in-person visit is needed \n     within the 30-day period, but the health care provider does \n     not have any available appointments during that time period.\n       (b) Pregnancy or prenatal care. Any period of incapacity \n     due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care. See also 825.120.\n       (c) Chronic conditions. Any period of incapacity or \n     treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health \n     condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (1) Requires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a \n     year) for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse \n     under direct supervision of a health care provider;\n       (2) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (3) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (d) Permanent or long-term conditions. A period of \n     incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition \n     for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or \n     family member must be under the continuing supervision of, \n     but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care \n     provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or \n     the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (e) Conditions requiring multiple treatments. Any period of \n     absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period \n     of recovery therefrom) by a health care provider or by a \n     provider of health care services under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider, for:\n       (1) Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; \n     or\n       (2) A condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days \n     in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), or kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (f) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (b) or (c) of this section qualify for FMLA leave even though \n     the employee or the covered family member does not receive \n     treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and \n     even if the absence does not last more than three \n     consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an employee \n     with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the onset \n     of an asthma attack or because the employee's health care \n     provider has advised the employee to stay home when the \n     pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is \n     pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe \n     morning sickness.\n     825.116 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.117 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.118 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.119 Leave for treatment of substance abuse.\n       (a) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of 825.113 through 825.115 are met. However, \n     FMLA leave may only be taken for treatment for substance \n     abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of health \n     care services on referral by a health care provider. On the \n     other hand, absence because of the employee's use of the \n     substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) Treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an \n     employing office from taking employment action against an \n     employee. The employing office may not take action against \n     the employee because the employee has exercised his or her \n     right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the \n     employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-\n     discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all \n     employees, that provides under certain circumstances an \n     employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to \n     that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the \n     employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also \n     take FMLA leave to care for a covered family member who is \n     receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office \n     may not take action against an employee who is providing care \n     for a covered family member receiving treatment for substance \n     abuse.\n     825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth.\n       (a) General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA \n     leave for pregnancy or birth of a child as follows:\n       (1) Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave for the birth \n     of their child.\n       (2) Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave to be with the \n     healthy newborn child (i.e., bonding time) during the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of birth. An employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA leave for a birth expires at the end of \n     the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth. If \n     the employing office permits bonding leave to be taken beyond \n     this period, such leave will not qualify as FMLA leave. Under \n     this section, both parents are entitled to FMLA leave even if \n     the newborn does not have a serious health condition.\n       (3) Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are \n     employed by the same employing office may be limited to a \n     combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken for birth of the employee's son \n     or daughter or to care for the child after birth, for \n     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption \n     or foster care or to care for the child after placement, or \n     to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition. This limitation on the total weeks of leave \n     applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as \n     the spouses are employed by the same employing office. It \n     would apply, for example, even though the spouses are \n     employed at two different worksites of an employing office. \n     On the other hand, if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA \n     leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 12 weeks \n     of FMLA leave. Where spouses both use a portion of the total \n     12-week FMLA leave entitlement for either the birth of a \n     child, for placement for adoption or foster care, or to care \n     for a parent, the spouses would each be entitled to the \n     difference between the amount he or she has taken \n     individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other purposes. \n     For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to care \n     for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an additional \n     six weeks due to his or her own serious health condition or \n     to care for a child with a serious health condition. Note, \n     too, that many state pregnancy disability laws specify a \n     period of disability either before or after the birth of a \n     child; such periods would also be considered FMLA leave for a \n     serious health condition of the birth mother, and would not \n     be subject to the combined limit.\n       (4) The expectant mother is entitled to FMLA leave for \n     incapacity due to pregnancy, for prenatal care, or for her \n     own serious health condition following the birth of the \n     child. An expectant mother may take FMLA leave before the \n     birth of the child for prenatal care or if her condition \n     makes her unable to work. The expectant mother is entitled to \n     leave for incapacity due to pregnancy even though she does \n     not receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last for more than \n     three consecutive calendar days.\n       (5) A spouse is entitled to FMLA leave if needed to care \n     for a pregnant spouse who is incapacitated or if needed to \n     care for her during her prenatal care, or if needed to care \n     for her following the birth of a child if she has a serious \n     health condition. See 825.124.\n       (6) Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave if needed to \n     care for a child with a serious health condition if the \n     requirements of 825.113 through 825.115 and 825.122(d) are \n     met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of FMLA leave if \n     needed to care for their newborn child with a serious health \n     condition, even if both are employed by the same employing \n     office, provided they have not exhausted their entitlements \n     during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave period.\n       (b) Intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An eligible \n     employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave after \n     the birth to be with a healthy newborn child only if the \n     employing office agrees. For example, an employing office and \n     employee may agree to a part-time work schedule after the \n     birth. If the employing office agrees to permit intermittent \n     or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a child, the \n     employing office may require the employee to transfer \n     temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced \n     leave schedule is required, to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified and which better \n     accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the \n     employee's regular position. Transfer to an alternative \n     position may require compliance with any applicable \n     collective bargaining agreement and federal law (such as the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the \n     CAA). Transfer to an alternative position may include \n     altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's \n     need for intermittent or reduced leave. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required for intermittent leave \n     required by the serious health condition of the expectant \n     mother or newborn child. See 825.202-825.205 for general \n     rules governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule \n     leave. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for adoption or \n     foster care. See 825.601 for special rules applicable to \n     instructional employees of schools.\n     825.121 Leave for adoption or foster care.\n       (a) General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA \n     leave for placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care as follows:\n       (1) Employees may take FMLA leave before the actual \n     placement or adoption of a child if an absence from work is \n     required for the placement for adoption or foster care to \n     proceed. For example, the employee may be required to attend \n     counseling sessions, appear in court, consult with his or her \n     attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth parent, \n     submit to a physical examination, or travel to another \n     country to complete an adoption. The source of an adopted \n     child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency or \n     otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for \n     leave for this purpose.\n       (2) An employee's entitlement to leave for adoption or \n     foster care expires at the end of the 12-month period \n     beginning on the date of the placement. If the employing \n     office permits leave for adoption or foster care to be taken \n     beyond this period, such leave will not qualify as FMLA \n     leave. Under this section, the employee is entitled to FMLA \n     leave even if the adopted or foster child does not have a \n     serious health condition.\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\n       (3) Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are \n     employed by the same covered employing office may be limited \n     to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken for the placement of the \n     employee's son or daughter or to care for the child after \n     placement, for the birth of the employee's son or daughter or \n     to care for the child after birth, or to care for the \n     employee's parent with a serious health condition. This \n     limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken \n     for the reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed \n     by the same employing office. It would apply, for example, \n     even though the spouses are employed at two different \n     worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one \n     spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would \n     be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where spouses \n     both use a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave \n     entitlement for either the birth of a child, for placement \n     for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent, the \n     spouses would each be entitled to the difference between the \n     amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA \n     leave for other purposes. For example, if each spouse took \n     six weeks of leave to care for a healthy, newly placed child, \n     each could use an additional six weeks due to his or her own \n     serious health condition or to care for a child with a \n     serious health condition.\n       (4) An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA leave in order \n     to care for an adopted or foster child with a serious health \n     condition if the requirements of 825.113 through 825.115 and \n     825.122(d) are met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave if needed to care for an adopted or foster child \n     with a serious health condition, even if both are employed by \n     the same employing office, provided they have not exhausted \n     their entitlements during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave \n     period.\n       (b) Use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An \n     eligible employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule \n     leave after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or \n     foster care only if the employing office agrees. Thus, for \n     example, the employing office and employee may agree to a \n     part-time work schedule after the placement for bonding \n     purposes. If the employing office agrees to permit \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the placement for \n     adoption or foster care, the employing office may require the \n     employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an \n     available alternative position for which the employee is \n     qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of \n     leave than does the employee's regular position. Transfer to \n     an alternative position may require compliance with any \n     applicable collective bargaining agreement and federal law \n     (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, as made \n     applicable by the CAA). Transfer to an alternative position \n     may include altering an existing job to better accommodate \n     the employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave. The \n     employing office's agreement is not required for intermittent \n     leave required by the serious health condition of the adopted \n     or foster child. See 825.202-825.205 for general rules \n     governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. \n     See 825.120 for general rules governing leave for pregnancy \n     and birth of a child. See 825.601 for special rules \n     applicable to instructional employees of schools.\n     825.122 Definitions of covered servicemember, spouse, parent, \n         son or daughter, next of kin of a covered servicemember, \n         adoption, foster care, son or daughter on covered active \n         duty or call to covered active duty status, son or \n         daughter of a covered servicemember, and parent of a \n         covered servicemember.\n       (a) Covered servicemember means:\n       (1) A current member of the Armed Forces, including a \n     member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing \n     medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in \n     outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary \n     disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or\n       (2) A covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, \n     recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness. \n     Covered veteran means an individual who was a member of the \n     Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or \n     Reserves), and was discharged or released under conditions \n     other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year \n     period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes \n     FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. See \n     825.127(b)(2).\n       (b) Spouse, as defined in the FMLA and as made applicable \n     by the CAA, means a husband or wife. For purposes of this \n     definition, husband or wife refers to all individuals in \n     lawfully recognized marriages. This definition includes an \n     individual in a same-sex marriage. This definition also \n     includes an individual in a common law marriage that either:\n       (1) was entered into in a State that recognizes such \n     marriages or,\n       (2) if entered into outside of any State, is valid in the \n     place where entered into and could have been entered into in \n     at least one State.\n       (c) Parent. Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or \n     foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in \n     loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a son or \n     daughter as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. This \n     term does not include parents ``in law.''\n       (d) Son or daughter. For purposes of FMLA leave taken for \n     birth or adoption, or to care for a family member with a \n     serious health condition, son or daughter means a biological, \n     adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a \n     child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either \n     under age 18, or age 18 or older and ``incapable of self-care \n     because of a mental or physical disability'' at the time that \n     FMLA leave is to commence.\n       (1) Incapable of self-care means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in three or more of the activities of daily living \n     (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). \n     Activities of daily living include adaptive activities such \n     as caring appropriately for one's grooming and hygiene, \n     bathing, dressing and eating. Instrumental activities of \n     daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking \n     public transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, \n     using telephones and directories, using a post office, etc.\n       (2) Physical or mental disability means a physical or \n     mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of \n     the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 \n     CFR 1630.2(h), (i), and (j), issued by the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission under the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these terms.\n       (3) Persons who are ``in loco parentis'' include those with \n     day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially \n     support a child, or, in the case of an employee, who had such \n     responsibility for the employee when the employee was a \n     child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n       (e) Next of kin of a covered servicemember means the \n     nearest blood relative other than the covered servicemember's \n     spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following order of \n     priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody \n     of the covered servicemember by court decree or statutory \n     provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and \n     uncles, and first cousins, unless the covered servicemember \n     has specifically designated in writing another blood relative \n     as his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of military \n     caregiver leave under the FMLA. When no such designation is \n     made, and there are multiple family members with the same \n     level of relationship to the covered servicemember, all such \n     family members shall be considered the covered \n     servicemember's next of kin and may take FMLA leave to \n     provide care to the covered servicemember, either \n     consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation has \n     been made, the designated individual shall be deemed to be \n     the covered servicemember's only next of kin. See \n     825.127(d)(3).\n       (f) Adoption means legally and permanently assuming the \n     responsibility of raising a child as one's own. The source of \n     an adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement \n     agency or otherwise) is not a factor in determining \n     eligibility for FMLA leave. See 825.121 for rules governing \n     leave for adoption.\n       (g) Foster care means 24-hour care for children in \n     substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. \n     Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State \n     as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or \n     guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant \n     to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, \n     and involves agreement between the State and foster family \n     that the foster family will take care of the child. Although \n     foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action \n     is involved in the removal of the child from parental \n     custody. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for foster \n     care.\n       (h) Son or daughter on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status means the employee's biological, \n     adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child \n     for whom the employee stood in loco parentis, who is on \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, \n     and who is of any age. See 825.126(a)(5).\n       (i) Son or daughter of a covered servicemember means the \n     covered servicemember's biological, adopted, or foster child, \n     stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered \n     servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age. \n     See 825.127(d)(1).\n       (j) Parent of a covered servicemember means a covered \n     servicemember's biological, adoptive, step or foster father \n     or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis \n     to the covered servicemember. This term does not include \n     parents ``in law.'' See 825.127(d)(2).\n       (k) Documenting relationships. For purposes of confirmation \n     of family relationship, the employing office may require the \n     employee giving notice of the need for leave to provide \n     reasonable documentation or statement of family relationship. \n     This documentation may take the form of a simple statement \n     from the employee, or a child's birth certificate, a court \n     document, etc. The employing office is entitled to examine \n     documentation such as a birth certificate, etc., but the \n     employee is entitled to the return of the official document \n     submitted for this purpose.\n     825.123 Unable to perform the functions of the position.\n       (a) Definition. An employee is unable to perform the \n     functions of the position where the health care provider \n     finds that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n     to perform any one of the essential functions of the \n     employee's position within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and made applicable by \n     Section 201(a) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)). An employee \n     who must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for \n     a serious health condition is considered to be unable to \n     perform the essential functions of the position during the \n     absence for treatment.\n       (b) Statement of functions. An employing office has the \n     option, in requiring certification from a health care \n     provider, to provide a statement of the essential functions \n     of the employee's position for the health care provider to \n     review. A sufficient medical certification must specify what \n     functions of the employee's position the employee is unable \n     to perform so that the employing office can then determine \n     whether the employee is unable to perform one or more \n     essential functions of the employee's position. For purposes \n     of FMLA, the essential functions of the employee's position \n     are to be determined with reference to the position the \n     employee held at the time notice is given or leave commenced, \n     whichever is earlier. See 825.306.\n     825.124 Needed to care for a family member or covered \n         servicemember.\n       (a) The medical certification provision that an employee is \n     needed to care for a family member or covered servicemember \n     encompasses both physical and psychological care. It includes \n     situations where, for example, because of a serious health \n     condition, the family member is unable to care for his or her \n     own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, \n     or is unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor. \n     The term also includes providing psychological comfort and \n     reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or \n     parent with a serious health condition who is receiving \n     inpatient or home care.\n       (b) The term also includes situations where the employee \n     may be needed to substitute for others who normally care for \n     the family member or covered servicemember, or to make \n     arrangements for changes in care, such as transfer to a \n     nursing home. The employee need not be the only individual or \n     family member available to care for the family member or \n     covered servicemember.\n       (c) An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave \n     schedule necessary to care for a family member or covered \n     servicemember includes not only a situation where the \n     condition of the family member or covered servicemember \n     itself is intermittent, but also where the employee is only \n     needed intermittently--such as where other care is normally \n     available, or care responsibilities are shared with another \n     member of the family or a third party. See 825.202-825.205 \n     for rules governing the use of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave.\n     825.125 Definition of health care provider.\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, defines health \n     care provider as:\n       (1) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in \n     which the doctor practices; or\n       (2) Any other person determined by the Office of Compliance \n     to be capable of providing health care services.\n       (3) In making a determination referred to in subparagraph \n     (a)(2), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the \n     Office of Compliance will follow any determination made by \n     the Department of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of FMLA (29 \n     U.S.C. 2611(6)(B))) that a person is capable of providing \n     health care services, provided the determination by the \n     Department of Labor was not made at the request of a person \n     who was then a covered employee.\n       (b) Others capable of providing health care services \n     include only:\n       (1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law;\n       (2) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical social \n     workers and physician assistants who are authorized to \n     practice under State law and who are performing within the \n     scope of their practice as defined under State law;\n       (3) Christian Science Practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. Where \n     an employee or family member is receiving treatment from a \n     Christian Science practitioner, an employee may not object to \n     any requirement from an employing office that the employee or \n     family member submit to examination (though not treatment) to \n     obtain a second or third certification from a health care \n     provider other than a Christian Science practitioner except \n     as otherwise provided under applicable State or local law or \n     collective bargaining agreement;\n       (4) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or the employing office's group health plan's benefits \n     manager will accept certification of the existence of a \n     serious health condition to substantiate a claim for \n     benefits; and\n       (5) A health care provider listed above who practices in a \n     country other than the United States, who is authorized to \n     practice in accordance with the law of that country, and who \n     is performing within the scope of his or her practice as \n     defined under such law.\n       (c) The phrase authorized to practice in the State as used \n     in this section means that the provider must be authorized to \n     diagnose and treat physical or mental health conditions.\n     825.126 Leave because of a qualifying exigency.\n       (a) Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for a qualifying \n     exigency while the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent (the military member or member) is on covered active \n     duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to covered active \n     duty).\n       (1) Covered active duty or call to covered active duty \n     status in the case of a member of the Regular Armed Forces \n     means duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed \n     Forces to a foreign country. The active duty orders of a \n     member of the Regular components of the Armed Forces will \n     generally specify if the member is deployed to a foreign \n     country.\n       (2) Covered active duty or call to covered active duty \n     status in the case of a member of the Reserve components of \n     the Armed Forces means duty during the deployment of the \n     member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a \n     Federal call or order to active duty in support of a \n     contingency operation pursuant to: Section 688 of Title 10 of \n     the United States Code, which authorizes ordering to active \n     duty retired members of the Regular Armed Forces and members \n     of the retired Reserve who retired after completing at least \n     20 years of active service; Section 12301(a) of Title 10 of \n     the United States Code, which authorizes ordering all reserve \n     component members to active duty in the case of war or \n     national emergency; Section 12302 of Title 10 of the United \n     States Code, which authorizes ordering any unit or unassigned \n     member of the Ready Reserve to active duty; Section 12304 of \n     Title 10 of the United States Code, which authorizes ordering \n     any unit or unassigned member of the Selected Reserve and \n     certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve to active \n     duty; Section 12305 of Title 10 of the United States Code, \n     which authorizes the suspension of promotion, retirement or \n     separation rules for certain Reserve components; Section \n     12406 of Title 10 of the United States Code, which authorizes \n     calling the National Guard into Federal service in certain \n     circumstances; chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States \n     Code, which authorizes calling the National Guard and state \n     military into Federal service in the case of insurrections \n     and national emergencies; or any other provision of law \n     during a war or during a national emergency declared by the \n     President or Congress so long as it is in support of a \n     contingency operation. See 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)(B).\n       (i) For purposes of covered active duty or call to covered \n     active duty status, the Reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces include the Army National Guard of the United States, \n     Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air \n     National Guard of the United States, Air Force Reserve and \n     Coast Guard Reserve, and retired members of the Regular Armed \n     Forces or Reserves who are called up in support of a \n     contingency operation pursuant to one of the provisions of \n     law identified in paragraph (a)(2).\n       (ii) The active duty orders of a member of the Reserve \n     components will generally specify if the military member is \n     serving in support of a contingency operation by citation to \n     the relevant section of Title 10 of the United States Code \n     and/or by reference to the specific name of the contingency \n     operation and will specify that the deployment is to a \n     foreign country.\n       (3) Deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a \n     foreign country means deployment to areas outside of the \n     United States, the District of Columbia, or any Territory or \n     possession of the United States, including international \n     waters.\n       (4) A call to covered active duty for purposes of leave \n     taken because of a qualifying exigency refers to a Federal \n     call to active duty. State calls to active duty are not \n     covered unless under order of the President of the United \n     States pursuant to one of the provisions of law identified in \n     paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n       (5) Son or daughter on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status means the employee's biological, \n     adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child \n     for whom the employee stood in loco parentis, who is on \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, \n     and who is of any age.\n       (b) An eligible employee may take FMLA leave for one or \n     more of the following qualifying exigencies:\n       (1) Short-notice deployment.

Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc. As with all instances of qualifying \n     exigency leave, the military member must be the spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent of the employee requesting qualifying \n     exigency leave.\n       (i) To arrange for alternative care for a parent of the \n     military member when the parent is incapable of self-care and \n     the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status \n     of the military member necessitates a change in the existing \n     care arrangement for the parent;\n       (ii) To provide care for a parent of the military member on \n     an urgent, immediate need basis (but not on a routine, \n     regular, or everyday basis) when the parent is incapable of \n     self-care and the need to provide such care arises from the \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of \n     the military member;\n       (iii) To admit to or transfer to a care facility a parent \n     of the military member when admittance or transfer is \n     necessitated by the covered active duty or call to covered \n     active duty status of the military member; and\n       (iv) To attend meetings with staff at a care facility, such \n     as meetings with hospice or social service providers for a \n     parent of the military member, when such meetings are \n     necessary due to circumstances arising from the covered \n     active duty or call to covered active duty status of the \n     military member but not for routine or regular meetings;\n       (9) Additional activities. To address other events which \n     arise out of the military member's covered active duty or \n     call to covered active duty status provided that the \n     employing office and employee agree that such leave shall \n     qualify as an exigency, and agree to both the timing and \n     duration of such leave.\n     825.127 Leave to care for a covered servicemember with a \n         serious injury or illness (military caregiver leave).\n       (a) Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA leave to care \n     for a covered servicemember with a serious illness or injury.\n       (b) Covered servicemember means:\n       (1) A current member of the Armed Forces, including a \n     member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing \n     medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in \n     outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary \n     disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. \n     Outpatient status means the status of a member of the Armed \n     Forces assigned to either a military medical treatment \n     facility as an outpatient or a unit established for the \n     purpose of providing command and control of members of the \n     Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients.\n       (2) A covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, \n     recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. \n     Covered veteran means an individual who was a member of the \n     Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or \n     Reserves), and was discharged or released under conditions \n     other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year \n     period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes \n     FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. An eligible \n     employee must commence leave to care for a covered veteran \n     within five years of the veteran's active duty service, but \n     the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of \n     this section may extend beyond the five-year period.\n       (i) For an individual who was a member of the Armed Forces \n     (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) and \n     who was discharged or released under conditions other than \n     dishonorable prior to the effective date of this Final Rule, \n     the period between October 28, 2009 and the effective date of \n     this Final Rule shall not count towards the determination of \n     the five-year period for covered veteran status.\n       (c) A serious injury or illness means:\n       (1) In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, \n     including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, means \n     an injury or illness that was incurred by the covered \n     servicemember in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces or that existed before the beginning of the member's \n     active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty \n     on active duty in the Armed Forces, and that may render the \n     member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's \n     office, grade, rank or rating; and,\n       (2) In the case of a covered veteran, means an injury or \n     illness that was incurred by the member in the line of duty \n     on active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the \n     beginning of the member's active duty and was aggravated by \n     service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces), and manifested itself before or after the member \n     became a veteran, and is:\n       (i) A continuation of a serious injury or illness that was \n     incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member \n     of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember unable to \n     perform the duties of the servicemember's office, grade, \n     rank, or rating; or\n       (ii) A physical or mental condition for which the covered \n     veteran has received a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or \n     greater, and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, \n     on the condition precipitating the need for military \n     caregiver leave; or\n       (iii) A physical or mental condition that substantially \n     impairs the covered veteran's ability to secure or follow a \n     substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or \n     disabilities related to military service, or would do so \n     absent treatment; or\n       (iv) An injury, including a psychological injury, on the \n     basis of which the covered veteran has been enrolled in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive \n     Assistance for Family Caregivers.\n       (d) In order to care for a covered servicemember, an \n     eligible employee must be the spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember.\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\n       (1) Son or daughter of a covered servicemember means the \n     covered servicemember's biological, adopted, or foster child, \n     stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered \n     servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age.\n       (2) Parent of a covered servicemember means a covered \n     servicemember's biological, adoptive, step or foster father \n     or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis \n     to the covered servicemember. This term does not include \n     parents ``in law.''\n       (3) Next of kin of a covered servicemember means the \n     nearest blood relative, other than the covered \n     servicemember's spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the \n     following order of priority: blood relatives who have been \n     granted legal custody of the servicemember by court decree or \n     statutory provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, \n     aunts and uncles, and first cousins, unless the covered \n     servicemember has specifically designated in writing another \n     blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative for \n     purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA. When no \n     such designation is made, and there are multiple family \n     members with the same level of relationship to the covered \n     servicemember, all such family members shall be considered \n     the covered servicemember's next of kin and may take FMLA \n     leave to provide care to the covered servicemember, either \n     consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation has \n     been made, the designated individual shall be deemed to be \n     the covered servicemember's only next of kin. For example, if \n     a covered servicemember has three siblings and has not \n     designated a blood relative to provide care, all three \n     siblings would be considered the covered servicemember's next \n     of kin. Alternatively, where a covered servicemember has a \n     sibling(s) and designates a cousin as his or her next of kin \n     for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is \n     eligible as the covered servicemember's next of kin. An \n     employing office is permitted to require an employee to \n     provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the \n     covered servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k).\n       (e) An eligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of \n     leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious \n     injury or illness during a single 12-month period.\n       (1) The single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) \n     of this section begins on the first day the eligible employee \n     takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends \n     12 months after that date, regardless of the method used by \n     the employing office to determine the employee's 12 workweeks \n     of leave entitlement for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an \n     eligible employee does not take all of his or her 26 \n     workweeks of leave entitlement to care for a covered \n     servicemember during this single 12-month period, the \n     remaining part of his or her 26 workweeks of leave \n     entitlement to care for the covered servicemember is \n     forfeited.\n       (2) The leave entitlement described in paragraph (e) of \n     this section is to be applied on a per-covered-servicemember, \n     per-injury basis such that an eligible employee may be \n     entitled to take more than one period of 26 workweeks of \n     leave if the leave is to care for different covered \n     servicemembers or to care for the same servicemember with a \n     subsequent serious injury or illness, except that no more \n     than 26 workweeks of leave may be taken within any single 12-\n     month period. An eligible employee may take more than one \n     period of 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember with more than one serious injury or illness \n     only when the serious injury or illness is a subsequent \n     serious injury or illness. When an eligible employee takes \n     leave to care for more than one covered servicemember or for \n     a subsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered \n     servicemember, and the single 12-month periods corresponding \n     to the different military caregiver leave entitlements \n     overlap, the employee is limited to taking no more than 26 \n     workweeks of leave in each single 12-month period.\n       (3) An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of \n     26 workweeks of leave for any FMLA-qualifying reason during \n     the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this \n     section, provided that the employee is entitled to no more \n     than 12 workweeks of leave for one or more of the following: \n     because of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and \n     in order to care for such son or daughter; because of the \n     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption \n     or foster care; in order to care for the spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; because \n     of the employee's own serious health condition; or because of \n     a qualifying exigency. Thus, for example, an eligible \n     employee may, during the single 12-month period, take 16 \n     workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     and 10 workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child. \n     However, the employee may not take more than 12 weeks of FMLA \n     leave to care for the newborn child during the single 12-\n     month period, even if the employee takes fewer than 14 \n     workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember.\n       (4) In all circumstances, including for leave taken to care \n     for a covered servicemember, the employing office is \n     responsible for designating leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-\n     qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to the \n     employee as provided in 825.300. In the case of leave that \n     qualifies as both leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     and leave to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition during the single 12-month period described in \n     paragraph (e) of this section, the employing office must \n     designate such leave as leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember in the first instance. Leave that qualifies as \n     both leave to care for a covered servicemember and leave \n     taken to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition during the single 12-month period described in \n     paragraph (e) of this section must not be designated and \n     counted as both leave to care for a covered servicemember and \n     leave to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition. As is the case with leave taken for other \n     qualifying reasons, employing offices may retroactively \n     designate leave as leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     pursuant to 825.301(d).\n       (f) Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are \n     employed by the same covered employing office may be limited \n     to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the \n     single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this \n     section if the leave is taken for birth of the employee's son \n     or daughter or to care for the child after birth, for \n     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption \n     or foster care, or to care for the child after placement, to \n     care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness. This limitation on the total weeks \n     of leave applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as \n     long as the spouses are employed by the same employing \n     office. It would apply, for example, even though the spouses \n     are employed at two different worksites. On the other hand, \n     if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse \n     would be entitled to a full 26 workweeks of FMLA leave.\n     Subpart B--EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS UNDER THE FAMILY AND \n         MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n     825.200 Amount of Leave.\n       (a) Except in the case of leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness, an eligible \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement is limited to a total of 12 \n     workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for any one, or \n     more, of the following reasons:\n       (1) The birth of the employee's son or daughter, and to \n     care for the newborn child;\n       (2) The placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed \n     child;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition;\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of his or her job; and\n       (5) Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the \n     fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is \n     a military member on covered active duty status (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to active duty).\n       (b) An employing office is permitted to choose any one of \n     the following methods for determining the 12-month period in \n     which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement described in \n     paragraph (a) of this section occurs:\n       (1) The calendar year;\n       (2) Any fixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year or \n     a year starting on an employee's anniversary date;\n       (3) The 12-month period measured forward from the date any \n     employee's first FMLA leave under paragraph (a) begins; or\n       (4) A ``rolling'' 12-month period measured backward from \n     the date an employee uses any FMLA leave as described in \n     paragraph (a).\n       (c) Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this \n     section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. \n     An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the \n     end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the \n     following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this \n     section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave \n     during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is \n     taken; the next 12-month period would begin the first time \n     FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month \n     period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, \n     the ``rolling'' 12-month period, each time an employee takes \n     FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any \n     balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the \n     immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an employee \n     has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 months, an \n     additional four weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee \n     used four weeks beginning February 1, 2008, four weeks \n     beginning June 1, 2008, and four weeks beginning December 1, \n     2008, the employee would not be entitled to any additional \n     leave until February 1, 2009. However, beginning on February \n     1, 2009, the employee would again be eligible to take FMLA \n     leave, recouping the right to take the leave in the same \n     manner and amounts in which it was used in the previous year. \n     Thus, the employee would recoup (and be entitled to use) one \n     additional day of FMLA leave each day for four weeks, \n     commencing February 1, 2009. The employee would also begin to \n     recoup additional days beginning on June 1, 2009, and \n     additional days beginning on December 1, 2009. Accordingly, \n     employing offices using the rolling 12-month period may\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\n     need to calculate whether the employee is entitled to take \n     FMLA leave each time that leave is requested, and employees \n     taking FMLA leave on such a basis may fall in and out of FMLA \n     protection based on their FMLA usage in the prior 12 months. \n     For example, in the example above, if the employee needs six \n     weeks of leave for a serious health condition commencing \n     February 1, 2009, only the first four weeks of the leave \n     would be FMLA-protected.\n       (d)(1) Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for the \n     leave entitlements described in paragraph (a) of this section \n     provided the alternative chosen is applied consistently and \n     uniformly to all employees. An employing office wishing to \n     change to another alternative is required to give at least 60 \n     days notice to all employees, and the transition must take \n     place in such a way that the employees retain the full \n     benefit of 12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords \n     the greatest benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances \n     may a new method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA's \n     FMLA leave requirements.\n       (2) [Reserved]\n       (e) If an employing office fails to select one of the \n     options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the \n     12-month period for the leave entitlements described in \n     paragraph (a), the option that provides the most beneficial \n     outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office \n     may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-\n     day notice to all employees of the option the employing \n     office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day \n     period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the \n     option providing the most beneficial outcome to that \n     employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the \n     employing office may implement the selected option.\n       (f) An eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is \n     limited to a total of 26 workweeks of leave during a single \n     12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness. An employing office shall \n     determine the single 12-month period in which the 26 weeks of \n     leave entitlement described in this paragraph occurs using \n     the 12-month period measured forward from the date an \n     employee's first FMLA leave to care for the covered \n     servicemember begins. See 825.127(e)(1).\n       (g) During the single 12-month period described in \n     paragraph (f), an eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement \n     is limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of FMLA leave \n     for any qualifying reason. See 825.127(e)(3).\n       (h) For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by \n     an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the \n     week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted \n     as a week of FMLA leave. However, if an employee is using \n     FMLA leave in increments of less than one week, the holiday \n     will not count against the employee's FMLA entitlement unless \n     the employee was otherwise scheduled and expected to work \n     during the holiday. Similarly, if for some reason the \n     employing office's business activity has temporarily ceased \n     and employees generally are not expected to report for work \n     for one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing two weeks for \n     the Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or an \n     employing office closing the office for repairs), the days \n     the employing office's activities have ceased do not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for \n     determining an employee's 12-week leave entitlement are also \n     described in 825.205.\n       (i)(1) If employing offices jointly employ an employee, and \n     if they designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     825.106(c), the primary employing office may choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for \n     measuring the 12-month period, provided that the alternative \n     chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees \n     of the primary employing office including the jointly \n     employed employee.\n       (2) If employing offices fail to designate a primary \n     employing office pursuant to 825.106(c), an employee jointly \n     employed by the employing offices may, by so notifying one of \n     the employing offices, select that employing office to be the \n     primary employing office of the employee for purposes of the \n     application of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.\n     825.201 Leave to care for a parent.\n       (a) General rule. An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA \n     leave if needed to care for the employee's parent with a \n     serious health condition. Care for parents-in-law is not \n     covered by the FMLA. See 825.122(c) for definition of parent.\n       (b) Same employing office limitation. Spouses who are \n     eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same covered \n     employing office may be limited to a combined total of 12 \n     weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is \n     taken to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition, for the birth of the employee's son or daughter or \n     to care for the child after the birth, or for placement of a \n     son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care \n     or to care for the child after placement. This limitation on \n     the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken for the \n     reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed by the \n     same employing office. It would apply, for example, even \n     though the spouses are employed at two different worksites of \n     an employing office. On the other hand, if one spouse is \n     ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled \n     to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where the spouses both use \n     a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for \n     either the birth of a child, for placement for adoption or \n     foster care, or to care for a parent, the spouses would each \n     be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she \n     has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other \n     purposes. For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave \n     to care for a parent, each could use an additional six weeks \n     due to his or her own serious health condition or to care for \n     a child with a serious health condition. See also 825.127(d).\n     825.202 Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule.\n       (a) Definition. FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or \n     on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances. \n     Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of \n     time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave \n     schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual \n     number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A \n     reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule \n     for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.\n       (b) Medical necessity. For intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule taken because of one's own serious \n     health condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or \n     daughter with a serious health condition, or to care for a \n     covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, there \n     must be a medical need for leave and it must be that such \n     medical need can be best accommodated through an intermittent \n     or reduced leave schedule. The treatment regimen and other \n     information described in the certification of a serious \n     health condition and in the certification of a serious injury \n     or illness, if required by the employing office, addresses \n     the medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule. See 825.306, 825.310. Leave may be \n     taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when \n     medically necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical \n     treatment of a serious health condition or of a covered \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness, or for recovery \n     from treatment or recovery from a serious health condition or \n     a covered servicemember's serious injury or illness. It may \n     also be taken to provide care or psychological comfort to a \n     covered family member with a serious health condition or a \n     covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.\n       (1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health \n     condition of a spouse, parent, son, or daughter, for the \n     employee's own serious health condition, or a serious injury \n     or illness of a covered servicemember which requires \n     treatment by a health care provider periodically, rather than \n     for one continuous period of time, and may include leave of \n     periods from an hour or more to several weeks. Examples of \n     intermittent leave would include leave taken on an occasional \n     basis for medical appointments, or leave taken several days \n     at a time spread over a period of six months, such as for \n     chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may take leave \n     intermittently for prenatal examinations or for her own \n     condition, such as for periods of severe morning sickness. An \n     example of an employee taking leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule is an employee who is recovering from a serious \n     health condition and is not strong enough to work a full-time \n     schedule.\n       (2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for \n     absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated \n     or unable to perform the essential functions of the position \n     because of a chronic serious health condition or a serious \n     injury or illness of a covered servicemember, even if he or \n     she does not receive treatment by a health care provider. See \n     825.113 and 825.127.\n       (c) Birth or placement. When leave is taken after the birth \n     of a healthy child or placement of a healthy child for \n     adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the \n     employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might \n     occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing \n     office's agreement, works part-time after the birth of a \n     child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required, however, for leave during \n     which the expectant mother has a serious health condition in \n     connection with the birth of her child or if the newborn \n     child has a serious health condition. See 825.204 for rules \n     governing transfer to an alternative position that better \n     accommodates intermittent leave. See also 825.120 (pregnancy) \n     and 825.121 (adoption and foster care).\n       (d) Qualifying exigency. Leave due to a qualifying exigency \n     may be taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule \n     basis.\n     825.203 Scheduling of intermittent or reduced schedule leave.\n       Eligible employees may take FMLA leave on an intermittent \n     or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary due to the \n     serious health condition of a covered family member or the \n     employee or the serious injury or illness of a covered \n     servicemember. See 825.202. Eligible employees may also take \n     FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis when \n     necessary because of a qualifying exigency. If an employee \n     needs leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for \n     planned medical treatment, then the employee must make a \n     reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to \n     disrupt unduly the employing office's operations.\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\n  \n\n     825.204 Transfer of an employee to an alternative position \n         during intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave.\n       (a) Transfer or reassignment. If an employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule that \n     is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment for the \n     employee, a family member, or a covered servicemember, \n     including during a period of recovery from one's own serious \n     health condition, a serious health condition of a spouse, \n     parent, son, or daughter, or a serious injury or illness of a \n     covered servicemember, or if the employing office agrees to \n     permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth \n     of a child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care, the employing office may require the employee to \n     transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule is required, to an available \n     alternative position for which the employee is qualified and \n     which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than \n     does the employee's regular position. See 825.601 for special \n     rules applicable to instructional employees of schools.\n       (b) Compliance. Transfer to an alternative position may \n     require compliance with any applicable collective bargaining \n     agreement and Federal law (such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to \n     an alternative position may include altering an existing job \n     to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or \n     reduced scheduled leave.\n       (c) Equivalent pay and benefits. The alternative position \n     must have equivalent pay and benefits. An alternative \n     position for these purposes does not have to have equivalent \n     duties. The employing office may increase the pay and \n     benefits of an existing alternative position, so as to make \n     them equivalent to the pay and benefits of the employee's \n     regular job. The employing office may also transfer the \n     employee to a part-time job with the same hourly rate of pay \n     and benefits, provided the employee is not required to take \n     more leave than is medically necessary. For example, an \n     employee desiring to take leave in increments of four hours \n     per day could be transferred to a half-time job, or could \n     remain in the employee's same job on a part-time schedule, \n     paying the same hourly rate as the employee's previous job \n     and enjoying the same benefits. The employing office may not \n     eliminate benefits which otherwise would not be provided to \n     part-time employees; however, an employing office may \n     proportionately reduce benefits such as vacation leave where \n     an employing office's normal practice is to base such \n     benefits on the number of hours worked.\n       (d) Employing office limitations. An employing office may \n     not transfer the employee to an alternative position in order \n     to discourage the employee from taking leave or otherwise \n     work a hardship on the employee. For example, a white collar \n     employee may not be assigned to perform laborer's work; an \n     employee working the day shift may not be reassigned to the \n     graveyard shift; an employee working in the headquarters \n     facility may not be reassigned to a branch a significant \n     distance away from the employee's normal job location. Any \n     such attempt on the part of the employing office to make such \n     a transfer will be held to be contrary to the prohibited acts \n     provisions of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) Reinstatement of employee. When an employee who is \n     taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     and has been transferred to an alternative position no longer \n     needs to continue on leave and is able to return to full-time \n     work, the employee must be placed in the same or equivalent \n     job as the job he or she left when the leave commenced. An \n     employee may not be required to take more leave than \n     necessary to address the circumstance that precipitated the \n     need for leave.\n     825.205 Increments of FMLA leave for intermittent or reduced \n         schedule leave.\n       (a) Minimum increment. (1) When an employee takes FMLA \n     leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, the \n     employing office must account for the leave using an \n     increment no greater than the shortest period of time that \n     the employing office uses to account for use of other forms \n     of leave provided that it is not greater than one hour and \n     provided further that an employee's FMLA leave entitlement \n     may not be reduced by more than the amount of leave actually \n     taken. An employing office may not require an employee to \n     take more leave than is necessary to address the \n     circumstances that precipitated the need for the leave, \n     provided that the leave is counted using the shortest \n     increment of leave used to account for any other type of \n     leave. See also 825.205(a)(2) for the physical impossibility \n     exception, and 825.600 and 825.601 for special rules \n     applicable to employees of schools. If an employing office \n     uses different increments to account for different types of \n     leave, the employing office must account for FMLA leave in \n     the smallest increment used to account for any other type of \n     leave. For example, if an employing office accounts for the \n     use of annual leave in increments of one hour and the use of \n     sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave \n     use must be accounted for using increments no larger than \n     one-half hour. If an employing office accounts for use of \n     leave in varying increments at different times of the day or \n     shift, the employing office may also account for FMLA leave \n     in varying increments, provided that the increment used for \n     FMLA leave is no greater than the smallest increment used for \n     any other type of leave during the period in which the FMLA \n     leave is taken. If an employing office accounts for other \n     forms of leave use in increments greater than one hour, the \n     employing office must account for FMLA leave use in \n     increments no greater than one hour. An employing office may \n     account for FMLA leave in shorter increments than used for \n     other forms of leave. For example, an employing office that \n     accounts for other forms of leave in one hour increments may \n     account for FMLA leave in a shorter increment when the \n     employee arrives at work several minutes late, and the \n     employing office wants the employee to begin work \n     immediately. Such accounting for FMLA leave will not alter \n     the increment considered to be the shortest period used to \n     account for other forms of leave or the use of FMLA leave in \n     other circumstances. In all cases, employees may not be \n     charged FMLA leave for periods during which they are working.\n       (2) Where it is physically impossible for an employee using \n     intermittent leave or working a reduced leave schedule to \n     commence or end work mid-way through a shift, such as where a \n     flight attendant or a railroad conductor is scheduled to work \n     aboard an airplane or train, or a laboratory employee is \n     unable to enter or leave a sealed ``clean room'' during a \n     certain period of time and no equivalent position is \n     available, the entire period that the employee is forced to \n     be absent is designated as FMLA leave and counts against the \n     employee's FMLA entitlement. The period of the physical \n     impossibility is limited to the period during which the \n     employing office is unable to permit the employee to work \n     prior to a period of FMLA leave or return the employee to the \n     same or equivalent position due to the physical impossibility \n     after a period of FMLA leave. See 825.214.\n       (b) Calculation of leave. (1) When an employee takes leave \n     on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, only the amount \n     of leave actually taken may be counted toward the employee's \n     leave entitlement. The actual workweek is the basis of leave \n     entitlement. Therefore, if an employee who would otherwise \n     work 40 hours a week takes off eight hours, the employee \n     would use one-fifth (\\1/5\\) of a week of FMLA leave. \n     Similarly, if a full-time employee who would otherwise work \n     eight hour days works four-hour days under a reduced leave \n     schedule, the employee would use one half (\\1/2\\) week of \n     FMLA leave each week. Where an employee works a part-time \n     schedule or variable hours, the amount of FMLA leave that an \n     employee uses is determined on a pro rata or proportional \n     basis. If an employee who would otherwise work 30 hours per \n     week, but works only 20 hours a week under a reduced leave \n     schedule, the employee's 10 hours of leave would constitute \n     one-third (1/3) of a week of FMLA leave for each week the \n     employee works the reduced leave schedule. An employing \n     office may convert these fractions to their hourly equivalent \n     so long as the conversion equitably reflects the employee's \n     total normally scheduled hours. An employee does not accrue \n     FMLA-protected leave at any particular hourly rate. An \n     eligible employee is entitled to up to a total of 12 \n     workweeks of leave, or 26 workweeks in the case of military \n     caregiver leave, and the total number of hours contained in \n     those workweeks is necessarily dependent on the specific \n     hours the employee would have worked but for the use of \n     leave. See also 825.601 and 825.602 on special rules for \n     schools.\n       (2) If an employing office has made a permanent or long-\n     term change in the employee's schedule (for reasons other \n     than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA leave), \n     the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for \n     making this calculation.\n       (3) If an employee's schedule varies from week to week to \n     such an extent that an employing office is unable to \n     determine with any certainty how many hours the employee \n     would otherwise have worked (but for the taking of FMLA \n     leave), a weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 \n     months prior to the beginning of the leave period (including \n     any hours for which the employee took leave of any type) \n     would be used for calculating the employee's leave \n     entitlement.\n       (c) Overtime. If an employee would normally be required to \n     work overtime, but is unable to do so because of a FMLA-\n     qualifying reason that limits the employee's ability to work \n     overtime, the hours which the employee would have been \n     required to work may be counted against the employee's FMLA \n     entitlement. In such a case, the employee is using \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave. For example, if an \n     employee would normally be required to work for 48 hours in a \n     particular week, but due to a serious health condition the \n     employee is unable to work more than 40 hours that week, the \n     employee would utilize eight hours of FMLA-protected leave \n     out of the 48-hour workweek, or one-sixth (\\1/6\\) of a week \n     of FMLA leave. Voluntary overtime hours that an employee does \n     not work due to an FMLA-qualifying reason may not be counted \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n     825.206 Interaction with the FLSA.\n       (a) Leave taken under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as made applicable by the CAA, as a \n     salaried executive, administrative, or professional\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n     employee (under regulations issued by the Board, at part \n     541), providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an \n     employee will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA \n     exemption. This means that under regulations currently in \n     effect, where an employee meets the specified duties test, is \n     paid on a salary basis, and is paid a salary of at least the \n     amount specified in the regulations, the employing office may \n     make deductions from the employee's salary for any hours \n     taken as intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within a \n     workweek, without affecting the exempt status of the \n     employee. The fact that an employing office provides FMLA \n     leave, whether paid or unpaid, and maintains records \n     regarding FMLA leave, will not be relevant to the \n     determination whether an employee is exempt within the \n     meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541.\n       (b) For an employee paid in accordance with a fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime, where permitted by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), the employing office, \n     during the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule \n     FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate an \n     employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the \n     employee works, including time and one-half the employee's \n     regular rate for overtime hours. The change to payment on an \n     hourly basis would include the entire period during which the \n     employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks in \n     which no leave is taken. The hourly rate shall be determined \n     by dividing the employee's weekly salary by the employee's \n     normal or average schedule of hours worked during weeks in \n     which FMLA leave is not being taken. If an employing office \n     chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment, the employing office must do so \n     uniformly, with respect to all employees paid on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis for whom FMLA leave is taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis. If an employing \n     office does not elect to convert the employee's compensation \n     to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave \n     absences. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled \n     leave is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis.\n       (c) This special exception to the salary basis requirements \n     of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek payment \n     requirements applies only to employees of covered employing \n     offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave which \n     qualifies as FMLA leave. Hourly or other deductions which are \n     not in accordance with the Board's FLSA regulations at part \n     541 or with a permissible fluctuating workweek method of \n     payment for overtime may not be taken, for example, where the \n     employee has not worked long enough to be eligible for FMLA \n     leave without potentially affecting the employee's \n     eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions which are not \n     permitted by the Board's FLSA regulations at part 541 or by a \n     permissible fluctuating workweek method of payment for \n     overtime be taken from such an employee's salary for any \n     leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for example, \n     deductions from an employee's pay for leave required under an \n     employing office's policy or practice for a reason which does \n     not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for a \n     grandparent or for a medical condition which does not qualify \n     as a serious health condition; or for leave which is more \n     generous than provided by the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, such as leave in excess of 12 weeks in a year. Employing \n     offices may comply with the employing office's own policy/\n     practice under these circumstances and maintain the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating \n     workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from \n     the employee's pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, or may take such deductions, \n     treating the employee as an hourly employee and pay overtime \n     premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n     825.207 Substitution of paid leave.\n       (a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid. However, under the \n     circumstances described in this section, FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose \n     to substitute accrued paid leave for FMLA leave. If an \n     employee does not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, \n     the employing office may require the employee to substitute \n     accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave. The term substitute \n     means that the paid leave provided by the employing office, \n     and accrued pursuant to established policies of the employing \n     office, will run concurrently with the unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Accordingly, the employee receives pay pursuant to the \n     employing office's applicable paid leave policy during the \n     period of otherwise unpaid FMLA leave. An employee's ability \n     to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms \n     and conditions of the employing office's normal leave policy. \n     When an employee chooses, or an employing office requires, \n     substitution of accrued paid leave, the employing office must \n     inform the employee that the employee must satisfy any \n     procedural requirements of the paid leave policy only in \n     connection with the receipt of such payment. See 825.300(c). \n     If an employee does not comply with the additional \n     requirements in an employing office's paid leave policy, the \n     employee is not entitled to substitute accrued paid leave, \n     but the employee remains entitled to take unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Employing offices may not discriminate against employees on \n     FMLA leave in the administration of their paid leave \n     policies.\n       (b) If neither the employee nor the employing office elects \n     to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the \n     above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain \n     entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued \n     under the terms of the employing office's plan.\n       (c) If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances \n     which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. For example, \n     paid sick leave used for a medical condition which is not a \n     serious health condition or serious injury or illness does \n     not count against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (d) Leave taken pursuant to a disability leave plan would \n     be considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and \n     counted in the leave entitlement permitted under FMLA if it \n     meets the criteria set forth above in 825.112 through \n     825.115. In such cases, the employing office may designate \n     the leave as FMLA leave and count the leave against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Because leave pursuant to \n     a disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the provision for \n     substitution of the employee's accrued paid leave is \n     inapplicable, and neither the employee nor the employing \n     office may require the substitution of paid leave. However, \n     employing offices and employees may agree to have paid leave \n     supplement the disability plan benefits, such as in the case \n     where a plan only provides replacement income for two-thirds \n     of an employee's salary.\n       (e) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, provides that \n     a serious health condition may result from injury to the \n     employee on or off the job. If the employing office \n     designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance with \n     825.300(d), the leave counts against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. Because the workers' compensation absence \n     is not unpaid, the provision for substitution of the \n     employee's accrued paid leave is not applicable, and neither \n     the employee nor the employing office may require the \n     substitution of paid leave. However, employing offices and \n     employees may agree, to have paid leave supplement workers' \n     compensation benefits, such as in the case where workers' \n     compensation only provides replacement income for two-thirds \n     of an employee's salary. If the health care provider treating \n     the employee for the workers' compensation injury certifies \n     the employee is able to return to a light duty job but is \n     unable to return to the same or equivalent job, the employee \n     may decline the employing office's offer of a light duty job. \n     As a result, the employee may lose workers' compensation \n     payments, but is entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA leave \n     until the employee's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted. As \n     of the date workers' compensation benefits cease, the \n     substitution provision becomes applicable and either the \n     employee may elect or the employing office may require the \n     use of accrued paid leave. See also 825.210(f), 825.216(d), \n     825.220(d), 825.307(a) and 825.702 (d)(1) and (2) regarding \n     the relationship between workers' compensation absences and \n     FMLA leave.\n       (f) Under the FLSA, as made applicable by the CAA, an \n     employing office always has the right to cash out an \n     employee's compensatory time or to require the employee to \n     use the time. Therefore, if an employee requests and is \n     permitted to use accrued compensatory time to receive pay for \n     time taken off for an FMLA reason, or if the employing office \n     requires such use pursuant to the FLSA, the time taken may be \n     counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n     825.208 [Removed and reserved]\n     825.209 Maintenance of employee benefits.\n       (a) During any FMLA leave, an employing office must \n     maintain the employee's coverage under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined \n     in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) \n     on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided \n     if the employee had been continuously employed during the \n     entire leave period. All employing offices are subject to the \n     requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to \n     maintain health coverage. The definition of group health plan \n     is set forth in 825.102. For purposes of FMLA, the term group \n     health plan shall not include an insurance program providing \n     health coverage under which employees purchase individual \n     policies from insurers provided that:\n       (1) No contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) Participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) The sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) The employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and\n       (5) The premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       (b) The same group health plan benefits provided to an \n     employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during \n     the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is \n     provided to an employee, family\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n     member coverage must be maintained during the FMLA leave. \n     Similarly, benefit coverage during FMLA leave for medical \n     care, surgical care, hospital care, dental care, eye care, \n     mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, etc., \n     must be maintained during leave if provided in an employing \n     office's group health plan, including a supplement to a group \n     health plan, whether or not provided through a flexible \n     spending account or other component of a cafeteria plan.\n       (c) If an employing office provides a new health plan or \n     benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an \n     employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the \n     new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the \n     employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing \n     office changes a group health plan so that dental care \n     becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave \n     must be given the same opportunity as other employees to \n     receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan \n     changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) \n     which apply to all employees of the workforce would also \n     apply to an employee on FMLA leave.\n       (d) Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits \n     must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group \n     health plan permits an employee to change from single to \n     family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add \n     new family members, such a change in benefits must be made \n     available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee \n     requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the \n     employing office.\n       (e) An employee may choose not to retain group health plan \n     coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns \n     from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the \n     same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or \n     dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical \n     examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See \n     825.212(c).\n       (f) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable, and for key employees (as discussed \n     below), an employing office's obligation to maintain health \n     benefits during leave (and to restore the employee to the \n     same or equivalent employment) under FMLA ceases if and when \n     the employment relationship would have terminated if the \n     employee had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if the employee's \n     position is eliminated as part of a nondiscriminatory \n     reduction in force and the employee would not have been \n     transferred to another position); an employee informs the \n     employing office of his or her intent not to return from \n     leave (including before starting the leave if the employing \n     office is so informed before the leave starts); or the \n     employee fails to return from leave or continues on leave \n     after exhausting his or her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-\n     month period.\n       (g) If a key employee (see 825.218) does not return from \n     leave when notified by the employing office that substantial \n     or grievous economic injury will result from his or her \n     reinstatement, the employee's entitlement to group health \n     plan benefits continues unless and until the employee advises \n     the employing office that the employee does not desire \n     restoration to employment at the end of the leave period, or \n     the FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or reinstatement is \n     actually denied.\n       (h) An employee's entitlement to benefits other than group \n     health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday \n     pay) is to be determined by the employing office's \n     established policy for providing such benefits when the \n     employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as \n     appropriate).\n     825.210 Employee payment of group health benefit premiums.\n       (a) Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the \n     same basis as coverage would have been provided if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums \n     which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must \n     continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave \n     period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would \n     be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of \n     health insurance policies which are not a part of the \n     employing office's group health plan, as described in \n     825.209(a), are the sole responsibility of the employee. The \n     employee and the insurer should make necessary arrangements \n     for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid FMLA leave.\n       (b) If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the \n     employee's share of premiums must be paid by the method \n     normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll \n     deduction.\n       (c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a \n     number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. \n     The employing office may require that payment be made to the \n     employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no \n     additional charge may be added to the employee's premium \n     payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may \n     require employees to pay their share of premium payments in \n     any of the following ways:\n       (1) Payment would be due at the same time as it would be \n     made if by payroll deduction;\n       (2) Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments \n     are made under COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is \n     applicable;\n       (3) Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan \n     at the employee's option;\n       (4) The employing office's existing rules for payment by \n     employees on leave without pay would be followed, provided \n     that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., prior to the \n     commencement of the leave) of the premiums that will become \n     due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or payment of higher \n     premiums than if the employee had continued to work instead \n     of taking leave; or\n       (5) Another system voluntarily agreed to between the \n     employing office and the employee, which may include \n     prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll \n     deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n       (d) The employing office must provide the employee with \n     advance written notice of the terms and conditions under \n     which these payments must be made. See 825. 300(c).\n       (e) An employing office may not require more of an employee \n     using unpaid FMLA leave than the employing office requires of \n     other employees on leave without pay.\n       (f) An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a \n     workers' compensation injury must make arrangements with the \n     employing office for payment of group health plan benefits \n     when simultaneously taking FMLA leave. See 825.207(e).\n     825.211 Maintenance of benefits under multi-employer health \n         plans.\n       (a) A multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more \n     than one employing office is required to contribute, and \n     which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective \n     bargaining agreements between employee organization(s) and \n     the employing offices.\n       (b) An employing office under a multi-employer plan must \n     continue to make contributions on behalf of an employee using \n     FMLA leave as though the employee had been continuously \n     employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision \n     for maintaining coverage such as through pooled contributions \n     by all employing offices party to the plan.\n       (c) During the duration of an employee's FMLA leave, \n     coverage by the group health plan, and benefits provided \n     pursuant to the plan, must be maintained at the level of \n     coverage and benefits which were applicable to the employee \n     at the time FMLA leave commenced.\n       (d) An employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use \n     banked hours or pay a greater premium than the employee would \n     have been required to pay if the employee had been \n     continuously employed.\n       (e) As provided in 825.209(f) of this part, group health \n     plan coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA \n     leave until:\n       (1) The employee's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted;\n       (2) The employing office can show that the employee would \n     have been laid off and the employment relationship \n     terminated; or\n       (3) The employee provides unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work.\n     825.212 Employee failure to pay health plan premium payments.\n       (a)(1) In the absence of an established employing office \n     policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office's \n     obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under \n     FMLA if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days \n     late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose \n     premium payment is late, the employing office must provide \n     written notice to the employee that the payment has not been \n     received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least \n     15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage \n     will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after \n     the date of the letter unless the payment has been received \n     by that date. If the employing office has established \n     policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide \n     for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to \n     the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing \n     office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in \n     accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was \n     given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the \n     employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day grace \n     period, where the required 15-day notice has been provided.\n       (2) An employing office has no obligation regarding the \n     maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a group \n     health plan. See 825.209(a).\n       (3) All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA \n     would continue; for example, the employing office continues \n     to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return \n     from leave.\n       (b) The employing office may recover the employee's share \n     of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA \n     leave period during which the employing office maintains \n     health coverage by paying the employee's share after the \n     premium payment is missed.\n       (c) If coverage lapses because an employee has not made \n     required premium payments, upon the employee's return from \n     FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the \n     employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the \n     employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the \n     premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or \n     dependent coverage. See 825.215(d)(1)-(5). In such case, an \n     employee may not be required to meet any qualification \n     requirements imposed by the plan, including any new \n     preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open \n     season, or to pass a medical examination to obtain \n     reinstatement of coverage. If an employing office\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\n     terminates an employee's insurance in accordance with this \n     section and fails to restore the employee's health insurance \n     as required by this section upon the employee's return, the \n     employing office may be liable for benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable relief tailored to the harm suffered.\n     825.213 Employing office recovery of benefit costs.\n       (a) In addition to the circumstances discussed in \n     825.212(b), an employing office may recover its share of \n     health plan premiums during a period of unpaid FMLA leave \n     from an employee if the employee fails to return to work \n     after the employee's FMLA leave entitlement has been \n     exhausted or expires, unless the reason the employee does not \n     return is due to:\n       (1) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of either a \n     serious health condition of the employee or the employee's \n     family member, or a serious injury or illness of a covered \n     servicemember, which would otherwise entitle the employee to \n     leave under FMLA; or\n       (2) Other circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n     Examples of other circumstances beyond the employee's control \n     are necessarily broad. They include such situations as where \n     a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child who has a \n     serious health condition; an employee's spouse is \n     unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles \n     from the employee's worksite; a relative or individual other \n     than a covered family member has a serious health condition \n     and the employee is needed to provide care; the employee is \n     laid off while on leave; or, the employee is a key employee \n     who decides not to return to work upon being notified of the \n     employing office's intention to deny restoration because of \n     substantial and grievous economic injury to the employing \n     office's operations and is not reinstated by the employing \n     office. Other circumstances beyond the employee's control \n     would not include a situation where an employee desires to \n     remain with a parent in a distant city even though the parent \n     no longer requires the employee's care, or a parent chooses \n     not to return to work to stay home with a well, newborn \n     child.\n       (3) When an employee fails to return to work because of the \n     continuation, recurrence, or onset of either a serious health \n     condition of the employee or employee's family member, or a \n     serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, thereby \n     precluding the employing office from recovering its (share \n     of) health benefit premium payments made on the employee's \n     behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may require medical certification of the employee's or \n     the family member's serious health condition or the covered \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness. Such certification \n     is not required unless requested by the employing office. The \n     cost of the certification shall be borne by the employee, and \n     the employee is not entitled to be paid for the time or \n     travel costs spent in acquiring the certification. The \n     employee is required to provide medical certification in a \n     timely manner which, for purposes of this section, is within \n     30 days from the date of the employing office's request. For \n     purposes of medical certification, the employee may use the \n     optional forms developed for this purpose. See 825.306(b), \n     825.310(c)-(d) and Forms A, B, and F. If the employing office \n     requests medical certification and the employee does not \n     provide such certification in a timely manner (within 30 \n     days), or the reason for not returning to work does not meet \n     the test of other circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control, the employing office may recover 100 percent of the \n     health benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) Under some circumstances an employing office may elect \n     to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability \n     insurance, etc., by paying the employee's (share of) premiums \n     during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure \n     the employing office can meet its responsibilities to provide \n     equivalent benefits to the employee upon return from unpaid \n     FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums be paid \n     continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the employing \n     office elects to maintain such benefits during the leave, at \n     the conclusion of leave, the employing office is entitled to \n     recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee's \n     share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to \n     work.\n       (c) An employee who returns to work for at least 30 \n     calendar days is considered to have returned to work. An \n     employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to \n     retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the \n     employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n       (d) When an employee elects or an employing office requires \n     paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or \n     other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA \n     leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided \n     under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including \n     workers' compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health \n     insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave.\n       (e) The amount that self-insured employing offices may \n     recover is limited to only the employing office's share of \n     allowable premiums as would be calculated under COBRA, \n     excluding the two percent fee for administrative costs.\n       (f) When an employee fails to return to work, any health \n     and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the \n     regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt \n     owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. \n     The existence of this debt caused by the employee's failure \n     to return to work does not alter the employing office's \n     responsibilities for health benefit coverage and, under a \n     self-insurance plan, payment of claims incurred during the \n     period of FMLA leave. To the extent recovery is allowed, the \n     employing office may recover the costs through deduction from \n     any sums due to the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation \n     pay, etc.), provided such deductions do not otherwise violate \n     applicable wage payment or other laws. Alternatively, the \n     employing office may initiate legal action against the \n     employee to recover such costs.\n     825.214 Employee right to reinstatement.\n       General Rule. On return from FMLA leave, an employee is \n     entitled to be returned to the same position the employee \n     held when leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with \n     equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of \n     employment. An employee is entitled to such reinstatement \n     even if the employee has been replaced or his or her position \n     has been restructured to accommodate the employee's absence. \n     See also 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices \n     that are joint employers.\n     825.215 Equivalent position.\n       (a) Equivalent position. An equivalent position is one that \n     is virtually identical to the employee's former position in \n     terms of pay, benefits and working conditions, including \n     privileges, prerequisites and status. It must involve the \n     same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities, \n     which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, \n     responsibility, and authority.\n       (b) Conditions to qualify. If an employee is no longer \n     qualified for the position because of the employee's \n     inability to attend a necessary course, renew a license, \n     etc., as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a \n     reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon \n     return to work.\n       (c) Equivalent Pay. (1) An employee is entitled to any \n     unconditional pay increases which may have occurred during \n     the FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay \n     increases conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or \n     work performed must be granted in accordance with the \n     employing office's policy or practice with respect to other \n     employees on an equivalent leave status for a reason that \n     does not qualify as FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to be \n     restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay \n     premiums, such as a shift differential. If an employee \n     departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and \n     corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is \n     ordinarily entitled to such a position on return from FMLA \n     leave.\n       (2) Equivalent pay includes any bonus or payment, whether \n     it is discretionary or non-discretionary, made to employees \n     consistent with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this \n     section. However, if a bonus or other payment is based on the \n     achievement of a specified goal such as hours worked, \n     products sold or perfect attendance, and the employee has not \n     met the goal due to FMLA leave, then the payment may be \n     denied, unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent \n     leave status for a reason that does not qualify as FMLA \n     leave. For example, if an employee who used paid vacation \n     leave for a non-FMLA purpose would receive the payment, then \n     the employee who used paid vacation leave for an FMLA-\n     protected purpose also must receive the payment.\n       (d) Equivalent benefits. Benefits include all benefits \n     provided or made available to employees by an employing \n     office, including group life insurance, health insurance, \n     disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational \n     benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such benefits \n     are provided by a practice or written policy of an employing \n     office through an employee benefit plan.\n       (1) At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must \n     be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as \n     provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in \n     benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of \n     FMLA leave affecting the entire work force, unless otherwise \n     elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an \n     employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the \n     employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or \n     dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered \n     by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not \n     covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any \n     qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in \n     order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. \n     Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to \n     modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to \n     restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from \n     FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of costs \n     to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay \n     these costs subject to recovery from the employee on return \n     from leave. See 825.213(b).\n       (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any \n     additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., \n     paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not \n     substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee \n     upon return from leave.\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\n       (3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to \n     continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types \n     of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing \n     office is required to follow established policies or \n     practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of \n     leave without pay. If the employing office has no established \n     policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged \n     to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins.\n       (4) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any \n     period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or \n     counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and \n     eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an \n     employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be \n     credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or \n     participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on \n     that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. \n     However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as \n     credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and \n     eligibility to participate.\n       (5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if \n     they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit \n     plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except \n     those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during \n     the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to \n     the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had \n     been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on \n     a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the \n     employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking \n     unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, \n     825.209 addresses health benefits.)\n       (e) Equivalent terms and conditions of employment. An \n     equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, \n     conditions, responsibilities, privileges and status as the \n     employee's original position.\n       (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a \n     geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not \n     involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) \n     from where the employee had previously been employed. If the \n     employee's original worksite has been closed, the employee is \n     entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been \n     on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an \n     employing office transfers all employees from a closed \n     worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee \n     on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same \n     conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed.\n       (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the \n     same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n       (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent \n     opportunity for bonuses, and other similar discretionary and \n     non-discretionary payments.\n       (4) FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from \n     accommodating an employee's request to be restored to a \n     different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the \n     employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a \n     promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot \n     be induced by the employing office to accept a different \n     position against the employee's wishes.\n       (f) De minimis exception. The requirement that an employee \n     be restored to the same or equivalent job with the same or \n     equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of \n     employment does not extend to de minimis, intangible, or \n     unmeasurable aspects of the job.\n     825.216 Limitations on an employee's right to reinstatement.\n       (a) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. An employing office must be able to show that an \n     employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time \n     reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to \n     employment. For example:\n       (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking \n     FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing \n     office's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain \n     group health plan benefits and restore the employee ceases at \n     the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing \n     office has no continuing obligations under a collective \n     bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would \n     have the burden of proving that an employee would have been \n     laid off during the FMLA leave period and, therefore, would \n     not be entitled to restoration. Restoration to a job slated \n     for lay-off when the employee's original position is not \n     would not meet the requirements of an equivalent position.\n       (2) If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been \n     decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to \n     work that shift or the original overtime hours upon \n     restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night \n     shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is \n     entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before \n     taking FMLA leave.\n       (3) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to \n     perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has \n     no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term \n     or project is over and the employing office would not \n     otherwise have continued to employ the employee. On the other \n     hand, if an employee was hired to perform work for one \n     employing office for a specific time period, and after that \n     time period has ended, the work was assigned to another \n     employing office, the successor employing office may be \n     required to restore the employee if it is a successor \n     employing office. See 825.107.\n       (b) In addition to the circumstances explained above, an \n     employing office may deny job restoration to salaried \n     eligible employees (key employees, as defined in 825.217(c)), \n     if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the operations of the employing \n     office; or may delay restoration to an employee who fails to \n     provide a fitness-for-duty certificate to return to work \n     under the conditions described in 825.312.\n       (c) If the employee is unable to perform an essential \n     function of the position because of a physical or mental \n     condition, including the continuation of a serious health \n     condition or an injury or illness also covered by workers' \n     compensation, the employee has no right to restoration to \n     another position under the FMLA. The employing office's \n     obligations may, however, be governed by the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by \n     the CAA. See 825.702.\n       (d) An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an \n     employing office is not protected by the job restoration or \n     maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy \n     governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy \n     may continue to apply to an employee while on FMLA leave. An \n     employing office which does not have such a policy may not \n     deny benefits to which an employee is entitled under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, on this basis unless the FMLA \n     leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (d) of this \n     section.\n     825.217 Key employee, general rule.\n       (a) A key employee is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee who \n     is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees \n     employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the \n     employee's worksite.\n       (b) The term salaried means paid on a salary basis, within \n     the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541, \n     implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), \n     regarding employees who may qualify as exempt from the \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, as executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees).\n       (c) A key employee must be among the highest paid 10 \n     percent of all the employees--both salaried and non-salaried, \n     eligible and ineligible--who are employed by the employing \n     office within 75 miles of the worksite.\n       (1) In determining which employees are among the highest \n     paid 10 percent, year- to-date earnings are divided by weeks \n     worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave \n     was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive \n     pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. \n     Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined \n     at some future date, e.g., benefits or prerequisites.\n       (2) The determination of whether a salaried employee is \n     among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than \n     10 percent of the employing office's employees within 75 \n     miles of the worksite may be key employees.\n     825.218 Substantial and grievous economic injury.\n       (a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an \n     employing office must determine that the restoration of the \n     employee to employment will cause substantial and grievous \n     economic injury to the operations of the employing office, \n     not whether the absence of the employee will cause such \n     substantial and grievous injury.\n       (b) An employing office may take into account its ability \n     to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) \n     the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is \n     unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be \n     considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous \n     economic injury will occur from restoration; in other words, \n     the effect on the operations of the employing office of \n     reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n       (c) A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship \n     or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If \n     the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic \n     viability of the employing office, that would constitute \n     substantial and grievous economic injury. A lesser injury \n     which causes substantial, long-term economic injury would \n     also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and costs that the \n     employing office would experience in the normal course would \n     certainly not constitute substantial and grievous economic \n     injury.\n       (d) FMLA's substantial and grievous economic injury \n     standard is different from and more stringent than the undue \n     hardship test under the ADA. See also 825.702.\n     825.219 Rights of a key employee\n       (a) An employing office that believes that reinstatement \n     may be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to \n     the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if \n     earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the \n     same time, the employing office must also fully inform the \n     employee of the potential consequences with respect to \n     reinstatement and\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\n     maintenance of health benefits if the employing office should \n     determine that substantial and grievous economic injury to \n     the employing office's operations will result if the employee \n     is reinstated from FMLA leave. If such notice cannot be given \n     immediately because of the need to determine whether the \n     employee is a key employee, it shall be given as soon as \n     practicable after being notified of a need for leave (or the \n     commencement of leave, if earlier). It is expected that in \n     most circumstances there will be no desire that an employee \n     be denied restoration after FMLA leave and, therefore, there \n     would be no need to provide such notice. However, an \n     employing office who fails to provide such timely notice will \n     lose its right to deny restoration even if substantial and \n     grievous economic injury will result from reinstatement.\n       (b) As soon as an employing office makes a good faith \n     determination, based on the facts available, that substantial \n     and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if \n     a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing \n     office shall notify the employee in writing of its \n     determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it \n     intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of \n     the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office \n     will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the \n     employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this \n     notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice \n     must explain the basis for the employing office's finding \n     that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, \n     and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a \n     reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into \n     account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave \n     and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n       (c) If an employee on leave does not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notification of intent to \n     deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to \n     maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may \n     not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key \n     employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until the \n     employee either gives notice that he or she no longer wishes \n     to return to work, or the employing office actually denies \n     reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period.\n       (d) After notice to an employee has been given that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the \n     employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still \n     entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave \n     period even if the employee did not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notice. The employing \n     office must then again determine whether there will be \n     substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, \n     based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the \n     employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in \n     person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n     825.220 Protection for employees who request leave or \n         otherwise assert FMLA rights.\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits \n     interference with an employee's rights under the law, and \n     with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee's \n     rights. More specifically, the law contains the following \n     employee protections:\n       (1) An employing office is prohibited from interfering \n     with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to \n     exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA.\n       (2) An employing office is prohibited from discharging or \n     in any other way discriminating against any covered employee \n     (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or \n     complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (3) All employing offices are prohibited from discharging \n     or in any other way discriminating against any covered \n     employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that \n     covered employee has--\n       (i) Filed any charge, or has instituted (or caused to be \n     instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA;\n       (ii) Given, or is about to give, any information in \n     connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA;\n       (iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or \n     proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, \n     restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. An employing office \n     may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable or other relief, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the \n     harm suffered. See 825.400(c). Interfering with the exercise \n     of an employee's rights would include, for example, not only \n     refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but discouraging an \n     employee from using such leave. It would also include \n     manipulation by a covered employing office to avoid \n     responsibilities under FMLA, for example:\n       (1) [Reserved]\n       (2) Changing the essential functions of the job in order to \n     preclude the taking of leave; or\n       (3) Reducing hours available to work in order to avoid \n     employee eligibility.\n       (c) The FMLA's prohibition against interference prohibits \n     an employing office from discriminating or retaliating \n     against an employee or prospective employee for having \n     exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights. For example, \n     if an employee on leave without pay would otherwise be \n     entitled to full benefits (other than health benefits), the \n     same benefits would be required to be provided to an employee \n     on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, employing offices \n     cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in \n     employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or \n     disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under no \n     fault attendance policies. See 825.215.\n       (d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices \n     induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For \n     example, employees (or their collective bargaining \n     representatives) cannot trade off the right to take FMLA \n     leave against some other benefit offered by the employing \n     office. Except for settlement agreements covered by 1414 and/\n     or 1415 of the Congressional Accountability Act, this does \n     not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by \n     employees based on past employing office conduct without the \n     approval of the Office of Compliance or a court. Nor does it \n     prevent an employee's voluntary and uncoerced acceptance (not \n     as a condition of employment) of a light duty assignment \n     while recovering from a serious health condition. See \n     825.702(d). An employee's acceptance of such light duty \n     assignment does not constitute a waiver of the employee's \n     prospective rights, including the right to be restored to the \n     same position the employee held at the time the employee's \n     FMLA leave commenced or to an equivalent position. The \n     employee's right to restoration, however, ceases at the end \n     of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.\n       (e) Individuals, and not merely covered employees, are \n     protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., filing a \n     complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly \n     protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably \n     believe to be a violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA, or regulations.\n     Subpart C--EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYING OFFICE RIGHTS AND \n         OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE CAA\n     825.300 Employing office notice requirements.\n       (a)(1) If an employing office has any eligible employees \n     and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee \n     benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, \n     information concerning both entitlements and employee \n     obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     must be included in the handbook or other document. For \n     example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook \n     to all employees that describes the employing office's \n     policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar \n     matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA \n     rights and responsibilities and the employing office's \n     policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. \n     Informational publications describing the provisions of the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, are available from the \n     Office of Compliance and may be incorporated in such \n     employing office handbooks or written policies.\n       (2) If such an employing office does not have written \n     policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits \n     and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide \n     written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee's \n     rights and obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time \n     notice is given pursuant to paragraph (c), and in accordance \n     with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may \n     duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact \n     Sheet available from the Office of Compliance to provide such \n     guidance.\n       (b) Eligibility notice. (1) When an employee requests FMLA \n     leave, or when the employing office acquires knowledge that \n     an employee's leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, the \n     employing office must notify the employee of the employee's \n     eligibility to take FMLA leave within five business days, \n     absent extenuating circumstances. See 825.110 for definition \n     of an eligible employee. Employee eligibility is determined \n     (and notice must be provided) at the commencement of the \n     first instance of leave for each FMLA-qualifying reason in \n     the applicable 12-month period. See 825.127(c) and \n     825.200(b). All FMLA absences for the same qualifying reason \n     are considered a single leave and employee eligibility as to \n     that reason for leave does not change during the applicable \n     12-month period.\n       (2) The eligibility notice must state whether the employee \n     is eligible for FMLA leave as defined in 825.110. If the \n     employee is not eligible for FMLA leave, the notice must \n     state at least one reason why the employee is not eligible, \n     including as applicable the number of months the employee has \n     been employed by the employing office and the hours of \n     service with the employing office during the 12-month period. \n     Notification of eligibility may be oral or in writing; \n     employing offices may use Form C to provide such notification \n     to employees. The employing office is obligated to translate \n     this notice in\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n     any situation in which it is obligated to do so in \n     825.300(a)(4).\n       (3) If, at the time an employee provides notice of a \n     subsequent need for FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month \n     period due to a different FMLA-qualifying reason, and the \n     employee's eligibility status has not changed, no additional \n     eligibility notice is required. If, however, the employee's \n     eligibility status has changed (e.g., if the employee has not \n     met the hours of service requirement in the 12 months \n     preceding the commencement of leave for the subsequent \n     qualifying reason), the employing office must notify the \n     employee of the change in eligibility status within five \n     business days, absent extenuating circumstances.\n       (c) Rights and responsibilities notice. (1) Employing \n     offices shall provide written notice detailing the specific \n     expectations and obligations of the employee and explaining \n     any consequences of a failure to meet these obligations. The \n     employing office is obligated to translate this notice in any \n     situation in which it is obligated to do so in 825.300(a)(4). \n     This notice shall be provided to the employee each time the \n     eligibility notice is provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of \n     this section. If leave has already begun, the notice should \n     be mailed to the employee's address of record. Such specific \n     notice must include, as appropriate:\n       (i) That the leave may be designated and counted against \n     the employee's annual FMLA leave entitlement if qualifying \n     (see 825.300(c) and 825.301) and the applicable 12-month \n     period for FMLA entitlement (see 825.127(c), 825.200(b), (f), \n     and (g));\n       (ii) Any requirements for the employee to furnish \n     certification of a serious health condition, serious injury \n     or illness, or qualifying exigency arising out of active duty \n     or call to active duty status, and the consequences of \n     failing to do so (see 825.305, 825.309, 825.310, 825.313);\n       (iii) The employee's right to substitute paid leave, \n     whether the employing office will require the substitution of \n     paid leave, the conditions related to any substitution, and \n     the employee's entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave if the \n     employee does not meet the conditions for paid leave (see \n     825.207);\n       (iv) Any requirement for the employee to make any premium \n     payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for \n     making such payments (see 825.210), and the possible \n     consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely \n     basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may \n     lapse);\n       (v) The employee's status as a key employee and the \n     potential consequence that restoration may be denied \n     following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for \n     such denial (see 825.218);\n       (vi) The employee's right to maintenance of benefits during \n     the FMLA leave and restoration to the same or an equivalent \n     job upon return from FMLA leave (see 825.214 and 825.604); \n     and\n       (vii) The employee's potential liability for payment of \n     health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during \n     the employee's unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to \n     return to work after taking FMLA leave (see 825.213).\n       (2) The notice of rights and responsibilities may include \n     other information--e.g., whether the employing office will \n     require periodic reports of the employee's status and intent \n     to return to work--but is not required to do so.\n       (3) The notice of rights and responsibilities may be \n     accompanied by any required certification form.\n       (4) If the specific information provided by the notice of \n     rights and responsibilities changes, the employing office \n     shall, within five business days of receipt of the employee's \n     first notice of need for leave subsequent to any change, \n     provide written notice referencing the prior notice and \n     setting forth any of the information in the notice of rights \n     and responsibilities that has changed. For example, if the \n     initial leave period was paid leave and the subsequent leave \n     period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need \n     to give notice of the arrangements for making premium \n     payments.\n       (5) Employing offices are also expected to responsively \n     answer questions from employees concerning their rights and \n     responsibilities under the FMLA, as made applicable under the \n     CAA.\n       (6) A prototype notice of rights and responsibilities may \n     be obtained in Form C, or from the Office of Compliance. \n     Employing offices may adapt the prototype notice as \n     appropriate to meet these notice requirements. The notice of \n     rights and responsibilities may be distributed electronically \n     so long as it otherwise meets the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (d) Designation notice. (1) The employing office is \n     responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as \n     FMLA-qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to \n     the employee as provided in this section. When the employing \n     office has enough information to determine whether the leave \n     is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason (e.g., after \n     receiving a certification), the employing office must notify \n     the employee whether the leave will be designated and will be \n     counted as FMLA leave within five business days absent \n     extenuating circumstances. Only one notice of designation is \n     required for each FMLA-qualifying reason per applicable 12-\n     month period, regardless of whether the leave taken due to \n     the qualifying reason will be a continuous block of leave or \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave. If the employing \n     office determines that the leave will not be designated as \n     FMLA-qualifying (e.g., if the leave is not for a reason \n     covered by FMLA or the FMLA leave entitlement has been \n     exhausted), the employing office must notify the employee of \n     that determination. If the employing office requires paid \n     leave to be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, or that paid \n     leave taken under an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA \n     leave, the employing office must inform the employee of this \n     designation at the time of designating the FMLA leave.\n       (2) If the employing office has sufficient information to \n     designate the leave as FMLA leave immediately after receiving \n     notice of the employee's need for leave, the employing office \n     may provide the employee with the designation notice at that \n     time.\n       (3) If the employing office will require the employee to \n     present a fitness-for-duty certification to be restored to \n     employment, the employing office must provide notice of such \n     requirement with the designation notice. If the employing \n     office will require that the fitness-for-duty certification \n     address the employee's ability to perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, the employing office \n     must so indicate in the designation notice, and must include \n     a list of the essential functions of the employee's position. \n     See 825.312. If the employing office's handbook or other \n     written documents (if any) describing the employing office's \n     leave policies clearly provide that a fitness-for-duty \n     certification will be required in specific circumstances \n     (e.g., by stating that fitness-for-duty certification will be \n     required in all cases of back injuries for employees in a \n     certain occupation), the employing office is not required to \n     provide written notice of the requirement with the \n     designation notice, but must provide oral notice no later \n     than with the designation notice.\n       (4) The designation notice must be in writing. A prototype \n     designation notice is contained in Form D or may be obtained \n     from the Office of Compliance. If the leave is not designated \n     as FMLA leave because it does not meet the requirements of \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, the notice to the \n     employee that the leave is not designated as FMLA leave may \n     be in the form of a simple written statement.\n       (5) If the information provided by the employing office to \n     the employee in the designation notice changes (e.g., the \n     employee exhausts the FMLA leave entitlement), the employing \n     office shall provide, within five business days of receipt of \n     the employee's first notice of need for leave subsequent to \n     any change, written notice of the change.\n       (6) The employing office must notify the employee of the \n     amount of leave counted against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. If the amount of leave needed is known at the \n     time the employing office designates the leave as FMLA-\n     qualifying, the employing office must notify the employee of \n     the number of hours, days, or weeks that will be counted \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement in the \n     designation notice. If it is not possible to provide the \n     hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement (such as in the case of \n     unforeseeable intermittent leave), then the employing office \n     must provide notice of the amount of leave counted against \n     the employee's FMLA leave entitlement upon the request by the \n     employee, but no more often than once in a 30-day period and \n     only if leave was taken in that period. The notice of the \n     amount of leave counted against the employee's FMLA \n     entitlement may be oral or in writing. If such notice is \n     oral, it shall be confirmed in writing no later than the \n     following payday (unless the payday is less than one week \n     after the oral notice, in which case the notice must be no \n     later than the subsequent payday). Such written notice may be \n     in any form, including a notation on the employee's pay stub.\n       (e) Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure to \n     follow the notice requirements set forth in this section may \n     constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the \n     exercise of an employee's FMLA rights. An employing office \n     may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable or other relief, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the \n     harm suffered. See 825.400(c).\n     825.301 Designation of FMLA leave.\n       (a) Employing office responsibilities. The employing \n     office's decision to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying must \n     be based only on information received from the employee or \n     the employee's spokesperson (e.g., if the employee is \n     incapacitated, the employee's spouse, adult child, parent, \n     doctor, etc., may provide notice to the employing office of \n     the need to take FMLA leave). In any circumstance where the \n     employing office does not have sufficient information about \n     the reason for an employee's use of leave, the employing \n     office should inquire further of the employee or the \n     spokesperson to ascertain whether leave is potentially FMLA-\n     qualifying. Once the employing office has acquired knowledge \n     that the leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason, \n     the employing office must notify the employee as provided in \n     825.300(d).\n       (b) Employee responsibilities. An employee giving notice of \n     the need for FMLA leave does not need to expressly assert \n     rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\n     CAA, or even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation \n     to provide notice, though the employee would need to state a \n     qualifying reason for the needed leave and otherwise satisfy \n     the notice requirements set forth in 825.302 or 825.303 \n     depending on whether the need for leave is foreseeable or \n     unforeseeable. An employee giving notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to \n     allow the employing office to determine whether the leave \n     qualifies under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If \n     the employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be \n     denied. In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a \n     request to use leave, especially when the need for the leave \n     was unexpected or unforeseen, an employee will provide \n     sufficient information for the employing office to designate \n     the leave as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid leave \n     may in some cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or \n     their plans for using their accrued leave. However, if an \n     employee requesting to use paid leave for a FMLA-qualifying \n     reason does not explain the reason for the leave and the \n     employing office denies the employee's request, the employee \n     will need to provide sufficient information to establish a \n     FMLA-qualifying reason for the needed leave so that the \n     employing office is aware that the leave may not be denied \n     and may designate that the paid leave be appropriately \n     counted against (substituted for) the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. Similarly, an employee using accrued paid \n     vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid leave for a \n     FMLA-qualifying reason will need to state the reason. If this \n     is due to an event which occurred during the period of paid \n     leave, the employing office may count the leave used after \n     the FMLA-qualifying reason against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement.\n       (c) Disputes. If there is a dispute between an employing \n     office and an employee as to whether leave qualifies as FMLA \n     leave, it should be resolved through discussions between the \n     employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the \n     decision must be documented.\n       (d) Retroactive designation. If an employing office does \n     not designate leave as required by 825.300, the employing \n     office may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with \n     appropriate notice to the employee as required by 825.300 \n     provided that the employing office's failure to timely \n     designate leave does not cause harm or injury to the \n     employee. In all cases where leave would qualify for FMLA \n     protections, an employing office and an employee can mutually \n     agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.\n       (e) Remedies. If an employing office's failure to timely \n     designate leave in accordance with 825.300 causes the \n     employee to suffer harm, it may constitute an interference \n     with, restraint of, or denial of the exercise of an \n     employee's FMLA rights. An employing office may be liable for \n     compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation, \n     for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result \n     of the violation, and for appropriate equitable or other \n     relief, including employment, reinstatement, promotion, or \n     any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. See \n     825.400(c). For example, if an employing office that was put \n     on notice that an employee needed FMLA leave failed to \n     designate the leave properly, but the employee's own serious \n     health condition prevented him or her from returning to work \n     during that time period regardless of the designation, an \n     employee may not be able to show that the employee suffered \n     harm as a result of the employing office's actions. However, \n     if an employee took leave to provide care for a son or \n     daughter with a serious health condition believing it would \n     not count toward his or her FMLA entitlement, and the \n     employee planned to later use that FMLA leave to provide care \n     for a spouse who would need assistance when recovering from \n     surgery planned for a later date, the employee may be able to \n     show that harm has occurred as a result of the employing \n     office's failure to designate properly. The employee might \n     establish this by showing that he or she would have arranged \n     for an alternative caregiver for the seriously-ill son or \n     daughter if the leave had been designated timely.\n     825.302 Employee notice requirements for foreseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n       (a) Timing of notice. An employee must provide the \n     employing office at least 30 days advance notice before FMLA \n     leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable \n     based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster \n     care, planned medical treatment for a serious health \n     condition of the employee or of a family member, or the \n     planned medical treatment for a serious injury or illness of \n     a covered servicemember. If 30 days notice is not \n     practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of \n     approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change \n     in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice must be \n     given as soon as practicable. For example, an employee's \n     health condition may require leave to commence earlier than \n     anticipated before the birth of a child. Similarly, little \n     opportunity for notice may be given before placement for \n     adoption. For foreseeable leave due to a qualifying exigency, \n     notice must be provided as soon as practicable, regardless of \n     how far in advance such leave is foreseeable. Whether FMLA \n     leave is to be continuous or is to be taken intermittently or \n     on a reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one \n     time, but the employee shall advise the employing office as \n     soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave change or are \n     extended, or were initially unknown. In those cases where the \n     employee is required to provide at least 30 days notice of \n     foreseeable leave and does not do so, the employee shall \n     explain the reasons why such notice was not practicable upon \n     a request from the employing office for such information.\n       (b) As soon as practicable means as soon as both possible \n     and practical, taking into account all of the facts and \n     circumstances in the individual case. When an employee \n     becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in \n     advance, it should be practicable for the employee to provide \n     notice of the need for leave either the same day or the next \n     business day. In all cases, however, the determination of \n     when an employee could practicably provide notice must take \n     into account the individual facts and circumstances.\n       (c) Content of notice. An employee shall provide at least \n     verbal notice sufficient to make the employing office aware \n     that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the \n     anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Depending on \n     the situation, such information may include that a condition \n     renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the \n     job; that the employee is pregnant or has been hospitalized \n     overnight; whether the employee or the employee's family \n     member is under the continuing care of a health care \n     provider; if the leave is due to a qualifying exigency, that \n     a military member is on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status (or has been notified of an \n     impending call or order to covered active duty), and that the \n     requested leave is for one of the reasons listed in \n     825.126(b); if the leave is for a family member, that the \n     condition renders the family member unable to perform daily \n     activities, or that the family member is a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness; and the \n     anticipated duration of the absence, if known. When an \n     employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying \n     reason, the employee need not expressly assert rights under \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or even mention the \n     FMLA. When an employee seeks leave due to a FMLA-qualifying \n     reason, for which the employing office has previously \n     provided FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically \n     reference the qualifying reason for leave or the need for \n     FMLA leave. In all cases, the employing office should inquire \n     further of the employee if it is necessary to have more \n     information about whether FMLA leave is being sought by the \n     employee, and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be \n     taken. In the case of medical conditions, the employing \n     office may find it necessary to inquire further to determine \n     if the leave is because of a serious health condition and may \n     request medical certification to support the need for such \n     leave. See 825.305. An employing office may also request \n     certification to support the need for leave for a qualifying \n     exigency or for military caregiver leave. See 825.309, \n     825.310. When an employee has been previously certified for \n     leave due to more than one FMLA-qualifying reason, the \n     employing office may need to inquire further to determine for \n     which qualifying reason the leave is needed. An employee has \n     an obligation to respond to an employing office's questions \n     designed to determine whether an absence is potentially FMLA-\n     qualifying. Failure to respond to reasonable employing office \n     inquiries regarding the leave request may result in denial of \n     FMLA protection if the employing office is unable to \n     determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.\n       (d) Complying with the employing office policy. An \n     employing office may require an employee to comply with the \n     employing office's usual and customary notice and procedural \n     requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual \n     circumstances. For example, an employing office may require \n     that written notice set forth the reasons for the requested \n     leave, the anticipated duration of the leave, and the \n     anticipated start of the leave. An employee also may be \n     required by an employing office's policy to contact a \n     specific individual. Unusual circumstances would include \n     situations such as when an employee is unable to comply with \n     the employing office's policy that requests for leave should \n     be made by contacting a specific number because on the day \n     the employee needs to provide notice of his or her need for \n     FMLA leave there is no one to answer the call-in number and \n     the voice mail box is full. Where an employee does not comply \n     with the employing office's usual notice and procedural \n     requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the \n     failure to comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or \n     denied. However, FMLA-protected leave may not be delayed or \n     denied where the employing office's policy requires notice to \n     be given sooner than set forth in paragraph (a) of this \n     section and the employee provides timely notice as set forth \n     in paragraph (a) of this section.\n       (e) Scheduling planned medical treatment. When planning \n     medical treatment, the employee must consult with the \n     employing office and make a reasonable effort to schedule the \n     treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employing office's \n     operations, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to consult with \n     their employing offices prior to the scheduling of treatment \n     in order to work out a treatment schedule which best suits \n     the needs of both the employing office and the employee. For \n     example, if an employee who provides notice of the need to \n     take FMLA\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n     leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical treatment \n     neglects to consult with the employing office to make a \n     reasonable effort to arrange the schedule of treatments so as \n     not to unduly disrupt the employing office's operations, the \n     employing office may initiate discussions with the employee \n     and require the employee to attempt to make such \n     arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider. See 825.203 and 825.205.\n       (f) Intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule \n     must be medically necessary due to a serious health condition \n     or a serious injury or illness. An employee shall advise the \n     employing office, upon request, of the reasons why the \n     intermittent/reduced leave schedule is necessary and of the \n     schedule for treatment, if applicable. The employee and \n     employing office shall attempt to work out a schedule for \n     such leave that meets the employee's needs without unduly \n     disrupting the employing office's operations, subject to the \n     approval of the health care provider.\n       (g) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     requirements. See 825.304.\n     825.303 Employee notice requirements for unforeseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n       (a) Timing of notice. When the approximate timing of the \n     need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide \n     notice to the employing office as soon as practicable under \n     the facts and circumstances of the particular case. It \n     generally should be practicable for the employee to provide \n     notice of leave that is unforeseeable within the time \n     prescribed by the employing office's usual and customary \n     notice requirements applicable to such leave. See 825.303(c). \n     Notice may be given by the employee's spokesperson (e.g., \n     spouse, adult family member, or other responsible party) if \n     the employee is unable to do so personally. For example, if \n     an employee's child has a severe asthma attack and the \n     employee takes the child to the emergency room, the employee \n     would not be required to leave his or her child in order to \n     report the absence while the child is receiving emergency \n     treatment. However, if the child's asthma attack required \n     only the use of an inhaler at home followed by a period of \n     rest, the employee would be expected to call the employing \n     office promptly after ensuring the child has used the \n     inhaler.\n       (b) Content of notice. An employee shall provide sufficient \n     information for an employing office to reasonably determine \n     whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request. Depending on \n     the situation, such information may include that a condition \n     renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the \n     job; that the employee is pregnant or has been hospitalized \n     overnight; whether the employee or the employee's family \n     member is under the continuing care of a health care \n     provider; if the leave is due to a qualifying exigency, that \n     a military member is on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status (or has been notified of an \n     impending call or order to covered active duty), that the \n     requested leave is for one of the reasons listed in \n     825.126(b), and the anticipated duration of the absence; or \n     if the leave is for a family member that the condition \n     renders the family member unable to perform daily activities \n     or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness; and the anticipated duration of \n     the absence, if known. When an employee seeks leave for the \n     first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need \n     not expressly assert rights under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, or even mention the FMLA. When an \n     employee seeks leave due to a qualifying reason, for which \n     the employing office has previously provided the employee \n     FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically \n     reference either the qualifying reason for leave or the need \n     for FMLA leave. Calling in ``sick'' without providing more \n     information will not be considered sufficient notice to \n     trigger an employing office's obligations under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. The employing office will be \n     expected to obtain any additional required information \n     through informal means. An employee has an obligation to \n     respond to an employing office's questions designed to \n     determine whether an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying. \n     Failure to respond to reasonable employing office inquiries \n     office regarding the leave request may result in denial of \n     FMLA protection if the employing office is unable to \n     determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.\n       (c) Complying with employing office policy. When the need \n     for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with \n     the employing office's usual and customary notice and \n     procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual \n     circumstances. For example, an employing office may require \n     employees to call a designated number or a specific \n     individual to request leave. However, if an employee requires \n     emergency medical treatment, he or she would not be required \n     to follow the call-in procedure until his or her condition is \n     stabilized and he or she has access to, and is able to use, a \n     phone. Similarly, in the case of an emergency requiring leave \n     because of a FMLA-qualifying reason, written advance notice \n     pursuant to an employing office's internal rules and \n     procedures may not be required when FMLA leave is involved. \n     If an employee does not comply with the employing office's \n     usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual \n     circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-protected \n     leave may be delayed or denied.\n     825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.\n       (a) Proper notice required. In all cases, in order for the \n     onset of an employee's FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack \n     of required notice, it must be clear that the employee had \n     actual notice of the FMLA notice requirements. This condition \n     would be satisfied by the employing office's proper posting, \n     at the worksite where the employee is employed, of the \n     information regarding the FMLA provided (pursuant to section \n     301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1381(h)(2)) by the Office of \n     Compliance to the employing office in a manner suitable for \n     posting.\n       (b) Foreseeable leave--30 days. When the need for FMLA \n     leave is foreseeable at least 30 days in advance and an \n     employee fails to give timely advance notice with no \n     reasonable excuse, the employing office may delay FMLA \n     coverage until 30 days after the date the employee provides \n     notice. The need for leave and the approximate date leave \n     would be taken must have been clearly foreseeable to the \n     employee 30 days in advance of the leave. For example, \n     knowledge that an employee would receive a telephone call \n     about the availability of a child for adoption at some \n     unknown point in the future would not be sufficient to \n     establish the leave was clearly foreseeable 30 days in \n     advance.\n       (c) Foreseeable leave--less than 30 days. When the need for \n     FMLA leave is foreseeable fewer than 30 days in advance and \n     an employee fails to give notice as soon as practicable under \n     the particular facts and circumstances, the extent to which \n     an employing office may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends \n     on the facts of the particular case. For example, if an \n     employee reasonably should have given the employing office \n     two weeks' notice but instead only provided one week's \n     notice, then the employing office may delay FMLA-protected \n     leave for one week (thus, if the employing office elects to \n     delay FMLA coverage and the employee nonetheless takes leave \n     one week after providing the notice (i.e., a week before the \n     two week notice period has been met) the leave will not be \n     FMLA-protected).\n       (d) Unforeseeable leave. When the need for FMLA leave is \n     unforeseeable and an employee fails to give notice in \n     accordance with 825.303, the extent to which an employing \n     office may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends on the facts \n     of the particular case. For example, if it would have been \n     practicable for an employee to have given the employing \n     office notice of the need for leave very soon after the need \n     arises consistent with the employing office's policy, but \n     instead the employee provided notice two days after the leave \n     began, then the employing office may delay FMLA coverage of \n     the leave by two days.\n       (e) Waiver of notice. An employing office may waive \n     employees' FMLA notice obligations or the employing office's \n     own internal rules on leave notice requirements. If an \n     employing office does not waive the employee's obligations \n     under its internal leave rules, the employing office may take \n     appropriate action under its internal rules and procedures \n     for failure to follow its usual and customary notification \n     rules, absent unusual circumstances, as long as the actions \n     are taken in a manner that does not discriminate against \n     employees taking FMLA leave and the rules are not \n     inconsistent with 825.303(a).\n     825.305 Certification, general rule.\n       (a) General. An employing office may require that an \n     employee's leave to care for the employee's covered family \n     member with a serious health condition, or due to the \n     employee's own serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, be supported by a \n     certification issued by the health care provider of the \n     employee or the employee's family member. An employing office \n     may also require that an employee's leave because of a \n     qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember \n     with a serious injury or illness be supported by a \n     certification, as described in 825.309 and 825.310, \n     respectively. An employing office must give notice of a \n     requirement for certification each time a certification is \n     required; such notice must be written notice whenever \n     required by 825.300(c). An employing office's oral request to \n     an employee to furnish any subsequent certification is \n     sufficient.\n       (b) Timing. In most cases, the employing office should \n     request that an employee furnish certification at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within \n     five business days thereafter, or, in the case of unforeseen \n     leave, within five business days after the leave commences. \n     The employing office may request certification at some later \n     date if the employing office later has reason to question the \n     appropriateness of the leave or its duration. The employee \n     must provide the requested certification to the employing \n     office within 15 calendar days after the employing office's \n     request, unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts or the employing office provides more than 15 \n     calendar days to return the requested certification.\n       (c) Complete and sufficient certification. The employee \n     must provide a complete and sufficient certification to the \n     employing office if required by the employing office in \n     accordance with 825.306, 825.309, and 825.310. The employing \n     office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office \n     finds a certification incomplete or insufficient, and\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\n     shall state in writing what additional information is \n     necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient. \n     A certification is considered incomplete if the employing \n     office receives a certification, but one or more of the \n     applicable entries have not been completed. A certification \n     is considered insufficient if the employing office receives a \n     complete certification, but the information provided is \n     vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive. The employing office \n     must provide the employee with seven calendar days (unless \n     not practicable under the particular circumstances despite \n     the employee's diligent good faith efforts) to cure any such \n     deficiency. If the deficiencies specified by the employing \n     office are not cured in the resubmitted certification, the \n     employing office may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in \n     accordance with 825.313. A certification that is not returned \n     to the employing office is not considered incomplete or \n     insufficient, but constitutes a failure to provide \n     certification.\n       (d) Consequences. At the time the employing office requests \n     certification, the employing office must also advise an \n     employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee's \n     failure to provide adequate certification. If the employee \n     fails to provide the employing office with a complete and \n     sufficient certification, despite the opportunity to cure the \n     certification as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, \n     or fails to provide any certification, the employing office \n     may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in accordance with \n     825.313. It is the employee's responsibility either to \n     furnish a complete and sufficient certification or to furnish \n     the health care provider providing the certification with any \n     necessary authorization from the employee or the employee's \n     family member in order for the health care provider to \n     release a complete and sufficient certification to the \n     employing office to support the employee's FMLA request. This \n     provision will apply in any case where an employing office \n     requests a certification permitted by these regulations, \n     whether it is the initial certification, a recertification, a \n     second or third opinion, or a fitness-for-duty certificate, \n     including any clarifications necessary to determine if such \n     certifications are authentic and sufficient. See 825.306, \n     825.307, 825.308, and 825.312.\n       (e) Annual medical certification. Where the employee's need \n     for leave due to the employee's own serious health condition, \n     or the serious health condition of the employee's covered \n     family member, lasts beyond a single leave year (as defined \n     in 825.200), the employing office may require the employee to \n     provide a new medical certification in each subsequent leave \n     year. Such new medical certifications are subject to the \n     provisions for authentication and clarification set forth in \n     825.307, including second and third opinions.\n     825.306 Content of medical certification for leave taken \n         because of an employee's own serious health condition or \n         the serious health condition of a family member.\n       (a) Required information. When leave is taken because of an \n     employee's own serious health condition, or the serious \n     health condition of a family member, an employing office may \n     require an employee to obtain a medical certification from a \n     health care provider that sets forth the following \n     information:\n       (1) The name, address, telephone number, and fax number of \n     the health care provider and type of medical practice/\n     specialization;\n       (2) The approximate date on which the serious health \n     condition commenced, and its probable duration;\n       (3) A statement or description of appropriate medical facts \n     regarding the patient's health condition for which FMLA leave \n     is requested. The medical facts must be sufficient to support \n     the need for leave. Such medical facts may include \n     information on symptoms, diagnosis, hospitalization, doctor \n     visits, whether medication has been prescribed, any referrals \n     for evaluation or treatment (physical therapy, for example), \n     or any other regimen of continuing treatment;\n       (4) If the employee is the patient, information sufficient \n     to establish that the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's job as well as the nature of any \n     other work restrictions, and the likely duration of such \n     inability (see 825.123(b) and (c));\n       (5) If the patient is a covered family member with a \n     serious health condition, information sufficient to establish \n     that the family member is in need of care, as described in \n     825.124, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the \n     leave required to care for the family member;\n       (6) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment of the \n     employee's or a covered family member's serious health \n     condition, information sufficient to establish the medical \n     necessity for such intermittent or reduced schedule leave and \n     an estimate of the dates and duration of such treatments and \n     any periods of recovery;\n       (7) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis for the employee's serious health \n     condition, including pregnancy, that may result in \n     unforeseeable episodes of incapacity, information sufficient \n     to establish the medical necessity for such intermittent or \n     reduced schedule leave and an estimate of the frequency and \n     duration of the episodes of incapacity; and\n       (8) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis to care for a covered family member \n     with a serious health condition, a statement that such leave \n     is medically necessary to care for the family member, as \n     described in 825.124 and 825.203(b), which can include \n     assisting in the family member's recovery, and an estimate of \n     the frequency and duration of the required leave.\n       (b) The Office of Compliance has developed two optional \n     forms (Form A and Form B) for use in obtaining medical \n     certification, including second and third opinions, from \n     health care providers that meets FMLA's certification \n     requirements, as made applicable by the CAA. (See Forms A and \n     B.) Optional Form A is for use when the employee's need for \n     leave is due to the employee's own serious health condition. \n     Optional Form B is for use when the employee needs leave to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition. \n     These optional forms reflect certification requirements so as \n     to permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate \n     medical information. Forms A and B are modeled closely on \n     Form WH-380E and Form WH-380F, as revised, which were \n     developed by the Department of Labor (see 29 C.F.R. Part \n     825). The employing office may use the Office of Compliance's \n     forms, or Form WH-380E and Form WH-380F, as revised, or \n     another form containing the same basic information; however, \n     no information may be required beyond that specified in \n     825.306, 825.307, and 825.308. In all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the serious \n     health condition for which the current need for leave exists.\n       (c) If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently \n     with a workers' compensation absence, and the provisions of \n     the workers' compensation statute permit the employing office \n     or the employing office's representative to request \n     additional information from the employee's workers' \n     compensation health care provider, the FMLA does not prevent \n     the employing office from following the applicable workers' \n     compensation provisions and information received under those \n     provisions may be considered in determining the employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA-protected leave. Similarly, an employing \n     office may request additional information in accordance with \n     a paid leave policy or disability plan that requires greater \n     information to qualify for payments or benefits, provided \n     that the employing office informs the employee that the \n     additional information only needs to be provided in \n     connection with receipt of such payments or benefits. Any \n     information received pursuant to such policy or plan may be \n     considered in determining the employee's entitlement to FMLA-\n     protected leave. If the employee fails to provide the \n     information required for receipt of such payments or \n     benefits, such failure will not affect the employee's \n     entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave. See 825.207(a).\n       (d) If an employee's serious health condition may also be a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by \n     the CAA, the FMLA does not prevent the employing office from \n     following the procedures for requesting medical information \n     under the ADA. Any information received pursuant to these \n     procedures may be considered in determining the employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA-protected leave.\n       (e) While an employee may choose to comply with the \n     certification requirement by providing the employing office \n     with an authorization, release, or waiver allowing the \n     employing office to communicate directly with the health care \n     provider of the employee or his or her covered family member, \n     the employee may not be required to provide such an \n     authorization, release, or waiver. In all instances in which \n     certification is requested, it is the employee's \n     responsibility to provide the employing office with complete \n     and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result \n     in the denial of FMLA leave. See 825.305(d).\n     825.307 Authentication and clarification of medical \n         certification for leave taken because of an employee's \n         own serious health condition or the serious health \n         condition of a family member; second and third opinions.\n       (a) Clarification and authentication. If an employee \n     submits a complete and sufficient certification signed by the \n     health care provider, the employing office may not request \n     additional information from the health care provider. \n     However, the employing office may contact the health care \n     provider for purposes of clarification and authentication of \n     the medical certification (whether initial certification or \n     recertification) after the employing office has given the \n     employee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies as set forth \n     in 825.305(c). To make such contact, the employing office \n     must use a health care provider, a human resources \n     professional, a leave administrator, or a management \n     official. Under no circumstances, however, may the employee's \n     direct supervisor contact the employee's health care \n     provider.\n       For purposes of these regulations, authentication means \n     providing the health care provider with a copy of the \n     certification and requesting verification that the \n     information contained on the certification form was completed \n     and/or authorized by the health care provider who signed the \n     document; no additional medical information may be requested. \n     Clarification means contacting the health care provider to \n     understand the handwriting on the medical certification or to \n     understand the meaning of a response. Employing offices may \n     not ask health care providers\n\n[[Page S6734]]\n\n     for additional information beyond that required by the \n     certification form. The requirements of the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, (see \n     45 CFR parts 160 and 164), which governs the privacy of \n     individually-identifiable health information created or held \n     by HIPAA-covered entities, must be satisfied when \n     individually-identifiable health information of an employee \n     is shared with an employing office by a HIPAA-covered health \n     care provider. If an employee chooses not to provide the \n     employing office with authorization allowing the employing \n     office to clarify the certification with the health care \n     provider, and does not otherwise clarify the certification, \n     the employing office may deny the taking of FMLA leave if the \n     certification is unclear. See 825.305(d). It is the \n     employee's responsibility to provide the employing office \n     with a complete and sufficient certification and to clarify \n     the certification if necessary.\n       (b) Second Opinion. (1) An employing office that has reason \n     to doubt the validity of a medical certification may require \n     the employee to obtain a second opinion at the employing \n     office's expense. Pending receipt of the second (or third) \n     medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to \n     the benefits of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     including maintenance of group health benefits. If the \n     certifications do not ultimately establish the employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA leave, the leave shall not be designated \n     as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or unpaid leave \n     under the employing office's established leave policies. In \n     addition, the consequences set forth in 825.305(d) will apply \n     if the employee or the employee's family member fails to \n     authorize his or her health care provider to release all \n     relevant medical information pertaining to the serious health \n     condition at issue if requested by the health care provider \n     designated to provide a second opinion in order to render a \n     sufficient and complete second opinion.\n       (2) The employing office is permitted to designate the \n     health care provider to furnish the second opinion, but the \n     selected health care provider may not be employed on a \n     regular basis by the employing office. The employing office \n     may not regularly contract with or otherwise regularly \n     utilize the services of the health care provider furnishing \n     the second opinion unless the employing office is located in \n     an area where access to health care is extremely limited \n     (e.g., a rural area where no more than one or two doctors \n     practice in the relevant specialty in the vicinity).\n       (c) Third opinion. If the opinions of the employee's and \n     the employing office's designated health care providers \n     differ, the employing office may require the employee to \n     obtain certification from a third health care provider, again \n     at the employing office's expense. This third opinion shall \n     be final and binding. The third health care provider must be \n     designated or approved jointly by the employing office and \n     the employee. The employing office and the employee must each \n     act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on whom to \n     select for the third opinion provider. If the employing \n     office does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the \n     employing office will be bound by the first certification. If \n     the employee does not attempt in good faith to reach \n     agreement, the employee will be bound by the second \n     certification. For example, an employee who refuses to agree \n     to see a doctor in the specialty in question may be failing \n     to act in good faith. On the other hand, an employing office \n     that refuses to agree to any doctor on a list of specialists \n     in the appropriate field provided by the employee and whom \n     the employee has not previously consulted may be failing to \n     act in good faith. In addition, the consequences set forth in \n     825.305(d) will apply if the employee or the employee's \n     family member fails to authorize his or her health care \n     provider to release all relevant medical information \n     pertaining to the serious health condition at issue if \n     requested by the health care provider designated to provide a \n     third opinion in order to render a sufficient and complete \n     third opinion.\n       (d) Copies of opinions. The employing office is required to \n     provide the employee with a copy of the second and third \n     medical opinions, where applicable, upon request by the \n     employee. Requested copies are to be provided within five \n     business days unless extenuating circumstances prevent such \n     action.\n       (e) Travel expenses. If the employing office requires the \n     employee to obtain either a second or third opinion the \n     employing office must reimburse an employee or family member \n     for any reasonable ``out of pocket'' travel expenses incurred \n     to obtain the second and third medical opinions. The \n     employing office may not require the employee or family \n     member to travel outside normal commuting distance for \n     purposes of obtaining the second or third medical opinions \n     except in very unusual circumstances.\n       (f) Medical certification abroad. In circumstances in which \n     the employee or a family member is visiting in another \n     country, or a family member resides in another country, and a \n     serious health condition develops, the employing office shall \n     accept a medical certification as well as second and third \n     opinions from a health care provider who practices in that \n     country. Where a certification by a foreign health care \n     provider is in a language other than English, the employee \n     must provide the employing office with a written translation \n     of the certification upon request.\n     825.308 Recertifications for leave taken because of an \n         employee's own serious health condition or the serious \n         health condition of a family member.\n       (a) 30-day rule. An employing office may request \n     recertification no more often than every 30 days and only in \n     connection with an absence by the employee, unless paragraphs \n     (b) or (c) of this section apply.\n       (b) More than 30 days. If the medical certification \n     indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is more \n     than 30 days, an employing office must wait until that \n     minimum duration expires before requesting a recertification, \n     unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. For example, if \n     the medical certification states that an employee will be \n     unable to work, whether continuously or on an intermittent \n     basis, for 40 days, the employing office must wait 40 days \n     before requesting a recertification. In all cases, an \n     employing office may request a recertification of a medical \n     condition every six months in connection with an absence by \n     the employee. Accordingly, even if the medical certification \n     indicates that the employee will need intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave for a period in excess of six months (e.g., \n     for a lifetime condition), the employing office would be \n     permitted to request recertification every six months in \n     connection with an absence.\n       (c) Less than 30 days. An employing office may request \n     recertification in less than 30 days if:\n       (1) The employee requests an extension of leave;\n       (2) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency \n     of the absence, the nature or severity of the illness, \n     complications). For example, if a medical certification \n     stated that an employee would need leave for one to two days \n     when the employee suffered a migraine headache and the \n     employee's absences for his or her last two migraines lasted \n     four days each, then the increased duration of absence might \n     constitute a significant change in circumstances allowing the \n     employing office to request a recertification in less than 30 \n     days. Likewise, if an employee had a pattern of using \n     unscheduled FMLA leave for migraines in conjunction with his \n     or her scheduled days off, then the timing of the absences \n     also might constitute a significant change in circumstances \n     sufficient for an employing office to request a \n     recertification more frequently than every 30 days; or\n       (3) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence or \n     the continuing validity of the certification. For example, if \n     an employee is on FMLA leave for four weeks due to the \n     employee's knee surgery, including recuperation, and the \n     employee plays in company softball league games during the \n     employee's third week of FMLA leave, such information might \n     be sufficient to cast doubt upon the continuing validity of \n     the certification allowing the employing office to request a \n     recertification in less than 30 days.\n       (d) Timing. The employee must provide the requested \n     recertification to the employing office within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 calendar days after the employing office's request), \n     unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts.\n       (e) Content. The employing office may ask for the same \n     information when obtaining recertification as that permitted \n     for the original certification as set forth in 825.306. The \n     employee has the same obligations to participate and \n     cooperate (including providing a complete and sufficient \n     certification or adequate authorization to the health care \n     provider) in the recertification process as in the initial \n     certification process. See 825.305(d). As part of the \n     information allowed to be obtained on recertification for \n     leave taken because of a serious health condition, the \n     employing office may provide the health care provider with a \n     record of the employee's absence pattern and ask the health \n     care provider if the serious health condition and need for \n     leave is consistent with such a pattern.\n       (f) Any recertification requested by the employing office \n     shall be at the employee's expense unless the employing \n     office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on \n     recertification may be required.\n     825.309 Certification for leave taken because of a qualifying \n         exigency.\n       (a) Active Duty Orders. The first time an employee requests \n     leave because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or \n     notification of an impending call or order to covered active \n     duty) of a military member (see 825.126(a)), an employing \n     office may require the employee to provide a copy of the \n     military member's active duty orders or other documentation \n     issued by the military which indicates that the military \n     member is on covered active duty or call to covered active \n     duty status, and the dates of the military member's covered \n     active duty service. This information need only be provided \n     to the employing office once. A copy of new active duty \n     orders or other documentation issued by the military may be \n     required by the employing office if the need for leave \n     because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or \n     notification of an impending call or order to covered active\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n     duty) of the same or a different military member;\n       (b) Required information. An employing office may require \n     that leave for any qualifying exigency specified in 825.126 \n     be supported by a certification from the employee that sets \n     forth the following information:\n       (1) A statement or description, signed by the employee, of \n     appropriate facts regarding the qualifying exigency for which \n     FMLA leave is requested. The facts must be sufficient to \n     support the need for leave. Such facts should include \n     information on the type of qualifying exigency for which \n     leave is requested and any available written documentation \n     which supports the request for leave; such documentation, for \n     example, may include a copy of a meeting announcement for \n     informational briefings sponsored by the military, a document \n     confirming an appointment with a counselor or school \n     official, or a copy of a bill for services for the handling \n     of legal or financial affairs;\n       (2) The approximate date on which the qualifying exigency \n     commenced or will commence;\n       (3) If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying \n     exigency for a single, continuous period of time, the \n     beginning and end dates for such absence;\n       (4) If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying \n     exigency on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, an \n     estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying \n     exigency;\n       (5) If the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a \n     third party, appropriate contact information for the \n     individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting (such \n     as the name, title, organization, address, telephone number, \n     fax number, and email address) and a brief description of the \n     purpose of the meeting; and\n       (6) If the qualifying exigency involves Rest and \n     Recuperation leave, a copy of the military member's Rest and \n     Recuperation orders, or other documentation issued by the \n     military which indicates that the military member has been \n     granted Rest and Recuperation leave, and the dates of the \n     military member's Rest and Recuperation leave.\n       (c) The Office of Compliance has developed an optional form \n     (Form E) for employees' use in obtaining a certification that \n     meets FMLA's certification requirements. (See Form E). This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the employee to furnish appropriate information to \n     support his or her request for leave because of a qualifying \n     exigency. Form E, or another form containing the same basic \n     information, may be used by the employing office; however, no \n     information may be required beyond that specified in this \n     section.\n       (d) Verification. If an employee submits a complete and \n     sufficient certification to support his or her request for \n     leave because of a qualifying exigency, the employing office \n     may not request additional information from the employee. \n     However, if the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a \n     third party, the employing office may contact the individual \n     or entity with whom the employee is meeting for purposes of \n     verifying a meeting or appointment schedule and the nature of \n     the meeting between the employee and the specified individual \n     or entity. The employee's permission is not required in order \n     to verify meetings or appointments with third parties, but no \n     additional information may be requested by the employing \n     office. An employing office also may contact an appropriate \n     unit of the Department of Defense to request verification \n     that a military member is on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status (or has been notified of an \n     impending call or order to covered active duty); no \n     additional information may be requested and the employee's \n     permission is not required.\n     825.310 Certification for leave taken to care for a covered \n         servicemember (military caregiver leave).\n       (a) Required information from health care provider. When \n     leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness, an employing office may require an \n     employee to obtain a certification completed by an authorized \n     health care provider of the covered servicemember. For \n     purposes of leave taken to care for a covered servicemember, \n     any one of the following health care providers may complete \n     such a certification:\n       (1) A United States Department of Defense (``DOD'') health \n     care provider;\n       (2) A United States Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'') \n     health care provider;\n       (3) A DOD TRICARE network authorized private health care \n     provider;\n       (4) A DOD non-network TRICARE authorized private health \n     care provider; or\n       (5) Any health care provider as defined in 825.125.\n       (b) If the authorized health care provider is unable to \n     make certain military-related determinations outlined below, \n     the authorized health care provider may rely on \n     determinations from an authorized DOD representative (such as \n     a DOD recovery care coordinator) or an authorized VA \n     representative. An employing office may request that the \n     health care provider provide the following information:\n       (1) The name, address, and appropriate contact information \n     (telephone number, fax number, and/or email address) of the \n     health care provider, the type of medical practice, the \n     medical specialty, and whether the health care provider is \n     one of the following:\n       (i) A DOD health care provider;\n       (ii) A VA health care provider;\n       (iii) A DOD TRICARE network authorized private health care \n     provider;\n       (iv) A DOD non-network TRICARE authorized private health \n     care provider; or\n       (v) A health care provider as defined in 825.125.\n       (2) Whether the covered servicemember's injury or illness \n     was incurred in the line of duty on active duty or, if not, \n     whether the covered servicemember's injury or illness existed \n     before the beginning of the servicemember's active duty and \n     was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty;\n       (3) The approximate date on which the serious injury or \n     illness commenced, or was aggravated, and its probable \n     duration;\n       (4) A statement or description of appropriate medical facts \n     regarding the covered servicemember's health condition for \n     which FMLA leave is requested. The medical facts must be \n     sufficient to support the need for leave.\n       (i) In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, \n     such medical facts must include information on whether the \n     injury or illness may render the covered servicemember \n     medically unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember's \n     office, grade, rank, or rating and whether the member is \n     receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy;\n       (ii) In the case of a covered veteran, such medical facts \n     must include:\n       (A) Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness \n     that is the continuation of an injury or illness that was \n     incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member \n     of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember medically \n     unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember's office, \n     grade, rank, or rating; or\n       (B) Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness \n     that is a physical or mental condition for which the covered \n     veteran has received a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or \n     greater, and that such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in \n     part, on the condition precipitating the need for military \n     caregiver leave; or\n       (C) Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness \n     that is a physical or mental condition that substantially \n     impairs the covered veteran's ability to secure or follow a \n     substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or \n     disabilities related to military service, or would do so \n     absent treatment; or\n       (D) Documentation of enrollment in the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for \n     Family Caregivers.\n       (5) Information sufficient to establish that the covered \n     servicemember is in need of care, as described in 825.124, \n     and whether the covered servicemember will need care for a \n     single continuous period of time, including any time for \n     treatment and recovery, and an estimate as to the beginning \n     and ending dates for this period of time;\n       (6) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment \n     appointments for the covered servicemember, whether there is \n     a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have \n     such periodic care and an estimate of the treatment schedule \n     of such appointments;\n       (7) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis to care for a covered servicemember \n     other than for planned medical treatment (e.g., episodic \n     flare-ups of a medical condition), whether there is a medical \n     necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic \n     care, which can include assisting in the covered \n     servicemember's recovery, and an estimate of the frequency \n     and duration of the periodic care.\n       (c) Required information from employee and/or covered \n     servicemember. In addition to the information that may be \n     requested under 825.310(b), an employing office may also \n     request that such certification set forth the following \n     information provided by an employee and/or covered \n     servicemember:\n       (1) The name and address of the employing office of the \n     employee requesting leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember, the name of the employee requesting such \n     leave, and the name of the covered servicemember for whom the \n     employee is requesting leave to care;\n       (2) The relationship of the employee to the covered \n     servicemember for whom the employee is requesting leave to \n     care;\n       (3) Whether the covered servicemember is a current member \n     of the Armed Forces, the National Guard or Reserves, and the \n     covered servicemember's military branch, rank, and current \n     unit assignment;\n       (4) Whether the covered servicemember is assigned to a \n     military medical facility as an outpatient or to a unit \n     established for the purpose of providing command and control \n     of members of the Armed Forces receiving medical care as \n     outpatients (such as a medical hold or warrior transition \n     unit), and the name of the medical treatment facility or \n     unit;\n       (5) Whether the covered servicemember is on the temporary \n     disability retired list;\n       (6) Whether the covered servicemember is a veteran, the \n     date of separation from military service, and whether the \n     separation was other than dishonorable. The employing office \n     may require the employee to provide documentation issued by \n     the military which indicates that the covered servicemember \n     is\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\n     a veteran, the date of separation, and that the separation is \n     other than dishonorable. Where an employing office requires \n     such documentation, an employee may provide a copy of the \n     veteran's Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active \n     Duty issued by the U.S. Department of Defense (DD Form 214) \n     or other proof of veteran status. See 825.127(c)(2).\n       (7) A description of the care to be provided to the covered \n     servicemember and an estimate of the leave needed to provide \n     the care.\n       (d) The Office of Compliance has developed an optional form \n     (Form F) for employees' use in obtaining certification that \n     meets FMLA's certification requirements. (See Form F). This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the employee to furnish appropriate information to \n     support his or her request for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Form F, or \n     Form WH-385 (developed by the Department of Labor), or \n     another form containing the same basic information, may be \n     used by the employing office; however, no information may be \n     required beyond that specified in this section. In all \n     instances the information on the certification must relate \n     only to the serious injury or illness for which the current \n     need for leave exists. An employing office may seek \n     authentication and/or clarification of the certification \n     under 825.307. However, second and third opinions under \n     825.307 are not permitted for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember. Additionally, recertifications under 825.308 \n     are not permitted for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember. An employing office may require an employee to \n     provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the \n     seriously injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(j) \n     of the FMLA.\n       (e) An employing office requiring an employee to submit a \n     certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     must accept as sufficient certification, in lieu of the \n     Office of Compliance's optional certification form (Form F) \n     or an employing office's own certification form, invitational \n     travel orders (ITOs) or invitational travel authorizations \n     (ITAs) issued to any family member to join an injured or ill \n     servicemember at his or her bedside. An ITO or ITA is \n     sufficient certification for the duration of time specified \n     in the ITO or ITA. During that time period, an eligible \n     employee may take leave to care for the covered servicemember \n     in a continuous block of time or on an intermittent basis. An \n     eligible employee who provides an ITO or ITA to support his \n     or her request for leave may not be required to provide any \n     additional or separate certification that leave taken on an \n     intermittent basis during the period of time specified in the \n     ITO or ITA is medically necessary. An ITO or ITA is \n     sufficient certification for an employee entitled to take \n     FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember regardless of \n     whether the employee is named in the order or authorization.\n       (1) If an employee will need leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember beyond the expiration date specified in an ITO \n     or ITA, an employing office may request that the employee \n     have one of the authorized health care providers listed under \n     825.310(a) complete the Office of Compliance optional \n     certification form (Form F) or an employing office's own \n     form, as requisite certification for the remainder of the \n     employee's necessary leave period.\n       (2) An employing office may seek authentication and \n     clarification of the ITO or ITA under 825.307. An employing \n     office may not utilize the second or third opinion process \n     outlined in 825.307 or the recertification process under \n     825.308 during the period of time in which leave is supported \n     by an ITO or ITA.\n       (3) An employing office may require an employee to provide \n     confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously \n     injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) when an \n     employee supports his or her request for FMLA leave with a \n     copy of an ITO or ITA.\n       (f) An employing office requiring an employee to submit a \n     certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     must accept as sufficient certification of the \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness documentation \n     indicating the servicemember's enrollment in the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for \n     Family Caregivers. Such documentation is sufficient \n     certification of the servicemember's serious injury or \n     illness to support the employee's request for military \n     caregiver leave regardless of whether the employee is the \n     named caregiver in the enrollment documentation.\n       (1) An employing office may seek authentication and \n     clarification of the documentation indicating the \n     servicemember's enrollment in the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family \n     Caregivers under 825.307. An employing office may not utilize \n     the second or third opinion process outlined in 825.307 or \n     the recertification process under 825.308 when the \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness is shown by \n     documentation of enrollment in this program.\n       (2) An employing office may require an employee to provide \n     confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously \n     injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) when an \n     employee supports his or her request for FMLA leave with a \n     copy of such enrollment documentation. An employing office \n     may also require an employee to provide documentation, such \n     as a veteran's Form DD-214, showing that the discharge was \n     other than dishonorable and the date of the veteran's \n     discharge.\n       (g) Where medical certification is requested by an \n     employing office, an employee may not be held liable for \n     administrative delays in the issuance of military documents, \n     despite the employee's diligent, good-faith efforts to obtain \n     such documents. See 825.305(b). In all instances in which \n     certification is requested, it is the employee's \n     responsibility to provide the employing office with complete \n     and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result \n     in the denial of FMLA leave. See 825.305(d).\n     825.311 Intent to return to work.\n       (a) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intent to return to work. The employing office's policy \n     regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must \n     take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances \n     related to the individual employee's leave situation.\n       (b) If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work, the employing office's obligations under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health \n     benefits (subject to COBRA requirements or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable) and to restore the employee cease. \n     However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates \n     he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a \n     continuing desire to do so.\n       (c) It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave \n     than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may \n     discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have \n     changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no \n     longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take \n     more FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave. In both of these \n     situations, the employing office may require that the \n     employee provide the employing office reasonable notice \n     (i.e., within two business days) of the changed circumstances \n     where foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain \n     information on such changed circumstances through requested \n     status reports.\n     825.312 Fitness-for-duty certification.\n       (a) As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA \n     leave was occasioned by the employee's own serious health \n     condition that made the employee unable to perform the \n     employee's job, an employing office may have a uniformly-\n     applied policy or practice that requires all similarly-\n     situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same serious \n     health condition) who take leave for such conditions to \n     obtain and present certification from the employee's health \n     care provider that the employee is able to resume work. The \n     employee has the same obligations to participate and \n     cooperate (including providing a complete and sufficient \n     certification or providing sufficient authorization to the \n     health care provider to provide the information directly to \n     the employing office) in the fitness-for-duty certification \n     process as in the initial certification process. See \n     825.305(d).\n       (b) An employing office may seek a fitness-for-duty \n     certification only with regard to the particular health \n     condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The \n     certification from the employee's health care provider must \n     certify that the employee is able to resume work. \n     Additionally, an employing office may require that the \n     certification specifically address the employee's ability to \n     perform the essential functions of the employee's job. In \n     order to require such a certification, an employing office \n     must provide an employee with a list of the essential \n     functions of the employee's job no later than with the \n     designation notice required by 825.300(d), and must indicate \n     in the designation notice that the certification must address \n     the employee's ability to perform those essential functions. \n     If the employing office satisfies these requirements, the \n     employee's health care provider must certify that the \n     employee can perform the identified essential functions of \n     his or her job. Following the procedures set forth in \n     825.307(a), the employing office may contact the employee's \n     health care provider for purposes of clarifying and \n     authenticating the fitness-for-duty certification. \n     Clarification may be requested only for the serious health \n     condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing \n     office may not delay the employee's return to work while \n     contact with the health care provider is being made. No \n     second or third opinions on a fitness-for-duty certification \n     may be required.\n       (c) The cost of the certification shall be borne by the \n     employee, and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the \n     time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification.\n       (d) The designation notice required in 825.300(d) shall \n     advise the employee if the employing office will require a \n     fitness-for-duty certification to return to work and whether \n     that fitness-for-duty certification must address the \n     employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the \n     employee's job.\n       (e) An employing office may delay restoration to employment \n     until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty \n     certification unless the employing office has failed to \n     provide the notice required in paragraph (d) of this section. \n     If an employing office provides the notice required, an \n     employee who does\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\n     not provide a fitness-for-duty certification or request \n     additional FMLA leave is no longer entitled to reinstatement \n     under the FMLA. See 825.313(d).\n       (f) An employing office is not entitled to a certification \n     of fitness to return to duty for each absence taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule. However, an employing \n     office is entitled to a certification of fitness to return to \n     duty for such absences up to once every 30 days if reasonable \n     safety concerns exist regarding the employee's ability to \n     perform his or her duties, based on the serious health \n     condition for which the employee took such leave. If an \n     employing office chooses to require a fitness-for-duty \n     certification under such circumstances, the employing office \n     shall inform the employee at the same time it issues the \n     designation notice that for each subsequent instance of \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the employee will be \n     required to submit a fitness-for-duty certification unless \n     one has already been submitted within the past 30 days. \n     Alternatively, an employing office can set a different \n     interval for requiring a fitness-for-duty certification as \n     long as it does not exceed once every 30 days and as long as \n     the employing office advises the employee of the requirement \n     in advance of the employee taking the intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave. The employing office may not terminate the \n     employment of the employee while awaiting such a \n     certification of fitness to return to duty for an \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave absence. Reasonable \n     safety concerns means a reasonable belief of significant risk \n     of harm to the individual employee or others. In determining \n     whether reasonable safety concerns exist, an employing office \n     should consider the nature and severity of the potential harm \n     and the likelihood that potential harm will occur.\n       (g) If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \n     govern an employee's return to work, those provisions shall \n     be applied.\n       (h) Requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by the CAA, apply. \n     After an employee returns from FMLA leave, the ADA requires \n     any medical examination at an employing office's expense by \n     the employing office's health care provider be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity. For example, an \n     attorney could not be required to submit to a medical \n     examination or inquiry just because her leg had been \n     amputated. The essential functions of an attorney's job do \n     not require use of both legs; therefore such an inquiry would \n     not be job related. An employing office may require a \n     warehouse laborer, whose back impairment affects the ability \n     to lift, to be examined by an orthopedist, but may not \n     require this employee to submit to an HIV test where the test \n     is not related to either the essential functions of his or \n     her job or to his/her impairment. If an employee's serious \n     health condition may also be a disability within the meaning \n     of the ADA, as made applicable by the CAA, the FMLA does not \n     prevent the employing office from following the procedures \n     for requesting medical information under the ADA.\n     825.313 Failure to provide certification.\n       (a) Foreseeable leave. In the case of foreseeable leave, if \n     an employee fails to provide certification in a timely manner \n     as required by 825.305, then an employing office may deny \n     FMLA coverage until the required certification is provided. \n     For example, if an employee has 15 days to provide a \n     certification and does not provide the certification for 45 \n     days without sufficient reason for the delay, the employing \n     office can deny FMLA protections for the 30-day period \n     following the expiration of the 15-day time period, if the \n     employee takes leave during such period.\n       (b) Unforeseeable leave. In the case of unforeseeable \n     leave, an employing office may deny FMLA coverage for the \n     requested leave if the employee fails to provide a \n     certification within 15 calendar days from receipt of the \n     request for certification unless not practicable due to \n     extenuating circumstances. For example, in the case of a \n     medical emergency, it may not be practicable for an employee \n     to provide the required certification within 15 calendar \n     days. Absent such extenuating circumstances, if the employee \n     fails to timely return the certification, the employing \n     office can deny FMLA protections for the leave following the \n     expiration of the 15-day time period until a sufficient \n     certification is provided. If the employee never produces the \n     certification, the leave is not FMLA leave.\n       (c) Recertification. An employee must provide \n     recertification within the time requested by the employing \n     office (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the \n     request) or as soon as practicable under the particular facts \n     and circumstances. If an employee fails to provide a \n     recertification within a reasonable time under the particular \n     facts and circumstances, then the employing office may deny \n     continuation of the FMLA leave protections until the employee \n     produces a sufficient recertification. If the employee never \n     produces the recertification, the leave is not FMLA leave. \n     Recertification does not apply to leave taken for a \n     qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember.\n       (d) Fitness-for-duty certification. When requested by the \n     employing office pursuant to a uniformly applied policy for \n     similarly-situated employees, the employee must provide \n     medical certification, at the time the employee seeks \n     reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave taken for the \n     employee's serious health condition, that the employee is fit \n     for duty and able to return to work (see 825.312(a)) if the \n     employing office has provided the required notice (see \n     825.300(e)); the employing office may delay restoration until \n     the certification is provided. Unless the employee provides \n     either a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical \n     certification for a serious health condition at the time FMLA \n     leave is concluded, the employee may be terminated.

If a covered employee misses this \n     deadline, the covered employee will be unable to obtain a \n     remedy under the CAA.\n       (b) The following procedures are available under title IV \n     of the CAA for covered employees who believe that their \n     rights under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, have been \n     violated:\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint, filed with the Office of \n     Compliance, and a hearing before a hearing officer, subject \n     to review by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and judicial review in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures are found at www.compliance.gov.\n     825.401 [Reserved]\n     825.402 [Reserved]\n     825.403 [Reserved]\n     825.404 [Reserved]\n     SUBPART E--[RESERVED]\n     SUBPART F--SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYEES OF SCHOOLS\n     825.600 Special rules for school employees, definitions.\n       (a) Certain special rules apply to employees of local \n     educational agencies, including public school boards and \n     elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private \n     elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not \n     apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as \n     colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n       (b) Educational institutions are covered by FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual \n     requirements for employees to be eligible do apply.\n       (c) The special rules affect the taking of intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the \n     end of an academic term (semester), by instructional \n     employees. Instructional employees are those whose principal \n     function is to teach and instruct students in a class, a \n     small group, or an individual setting. This term includes not \n     only teachers, but also athletic coaches, driving \n     instructors, and special education assistants such as signers \n     for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and the \n     special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or aides \n     who do not have as their principal job actual teaching or \n     instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such as \n     counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It also \n     does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, or \n     bus drivers.\n       (d) Special rules which apply to restoration to an \n     equivalent position apply to all employees of local \n     educational agencies.\n     825.601 Special rules for school employees, limitations on \n         intermittent leave.\n       (a) Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year \n     and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively \n     rather than intermittently. The period during the summer \n     vacation when the employee would not have been required to \n     report for duty is not counted against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA \n     leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any \n     benefits over the summer vacation that employees would \n     normally receive if they had been working at the end of the \n     school year.\n       (1) If an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition, to \n     care for a covered servicemember, or for the employee's own \n     serious health condition, which is foreseeable based on \n     planned medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave \n     for more than 20 percent of the total number of working days \n     over the period the leave would extend, the employing office \n     may require the employee to choose either to:\n       (i) Take leave for a period or periods of a particular \n     duration, not greater than the duration of the planned \n     treatment; or\n       (ii) Transfer temporarily to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified, which has \n     equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates \n     recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular \n     position.\n       (2) These rules apply only to a leave involving more than \n     20 percent of the working days during the period over which \n     the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee \n     who normally works five days each week needs to take two days \n     of FMLA leave per week over a period of several weeks, the\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\n     special rules would apply. Employees taking leave which \n     constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the \n     leave period would not be subject to transfer to an \n     alternative position. Periods of a particular duration means \n     a block, or blocks, of time beginning no earlier than the \n     first day for which leave is needed and ending no later than \n     the last day on which leave is needed, and may include one \n     uninterrupted period of leave.\n       (b) If an instructional employee does not give required \n     notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (see 825.302) to be taken \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the employing \n     office may require the employee to take leave of a particular \n     duration, or to transfer temporarily to an alternative \n     position. Alternatively, the employing office may require the \n     employee to delay the taking of leave until the notice \n     provision is met.\n     825.602 Special rules for school employees, limitations on \n         leave near the end of an academic term.\n       (a) There are also different rules for instructional \n     employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end \n     of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and \n     less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules \n     apply except in circumstances when:\n       (1) An instructional employee begins leave more than five \n     weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last at least three weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the three-\n     week period before the end of the term.\n       (2) The employee begins leave during the five-week period \n     before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or \n     daughter; the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or \n     foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent \n     with a serious health condition; or to care for a covered \n     servicemember. The employing office may require the employee \n     to continue taking leave until the end of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last more than two weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term.\n       (3) The employee begins leave during the three-week period \n     before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or \n     daughter; the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or \n     foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent \n     with a serious health condition; or to care for a covered \n     servicemember. The employing office may require the employee \n     to continue taking leave until the end of the term if the \n     leave will last more than five working days.\n       (b) For purposes of these provisions, academic term means \n     the school semester, which typically ends near the end of the \n     calendar year and the end of spring each school year. In no \n     case may a school have more than two academic terms or \n     semesters each year for purposes of FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these \n     provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of \n     leave to care for a family member which will begin three \n     weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the \n     employing office could require the employee to stay out on \n     leave until the end of the term.\n     825.603 Special rules for school employees, duration of FMLA \n         leave.\n       (a) If an employee chooses to take leave for periods of a \n     particular duration in the case of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count \n     as FMLA leave.\n       (b) In the case of an employee who is required to take \n     leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of \n     leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work \n     shall be charged against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. The employing office has the option not to \n     require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the \n     school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the \n     employing office to the end of the school term is not counted \n     as FMLA leave; however, the employing office shall be \n     required to maintain the employee's group health insurance \n     and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job \n     including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n     825.604 Special rules for school employees, restoration to an \n         equivalent position.\n       The determination of how an employee is to be restored to \n     an equivalent position upon return from FMLA leave will be \n     made on the basis of ``established school board policies and \n     practices, private school policies and practices, and \n     collective bargaining agreements.'' The ``established \n     policies'' and collective bargaining agreements used as a \n     basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known \n     to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must \n     clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return \n     from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis \n     for restoration of an employee to an equivalent position must \n     provide substantially the same protections as provided in the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated \n     employees. See 825.215. In other words, the policy or \n     collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration \n     to an equivalent position with equivalent employment \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     For example, an employee may not be restored to a position \n     requiring additional licensure or certification.\n     SUBPART G--EFFECT OF OTHER LAWS, EMPLOYING OFFICE PRACTICES, \n         AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ON EMPLOYEE RIGHTS \n         UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE CAA.\n     825.700 Interaction with employing office's policies.\n       (a) An employing office must observe any employment benefit \n     program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave \n     rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. \n     Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any \n     employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision \n     of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for \n     reinstatement to a position that is not equivalent because of \n     seniority (e.g., provides lesser pay) is superseded by FMLA. \n     If an employing office provides greater unpaid family leave \n     rights than are afforded by FMLA, the employing office is not \n     required to extend additional rights afforded by FMLA, such \n     as maintenance of health benefits (other than through COBRA \n     or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable), to the \n     additional leave period not covered by FMLA.\n       (b) Nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and \n     employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage \n     employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous \n     leave policies.\n     825.701 [Reserved]\n     825.702 Interaction with anti-discrimination laws, as applied \n         by section 201 of the CAA.\n       (a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \n     color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the \n     Pregnancy Discrimination Act and as made applicable by the \n     CAA). FMLA's legislative history explains that FMLA is ``not \n     intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have \n     been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990 [as amended] or the regulations \n     issued under that act. Thus, the leave provisions of the \n     [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation \n     obligations of employers covered under the [ADA] . . . or the \n     Federal government itself. The purpose of the FMLA, as \n     applied by the CAA, is to make leave available to eligible \n     employees and [employing offices] within its coverage, and \n     not to limit already existing rights and protection.'' S. \n     Rep. No. 3, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1993). An employing \n     office must therefore provide leave under whichever statutory \n     provision provides the greater rights to employees. When an \n     employer violates both FMLA and a discrimination law, an \n     employee may be able to recover under either or both statutes \n     (double relief may not be awarded for the same loss; when \n     remedies coincide a claimant may be allowed to utilize \n     whichever avenue of relief is desired. Laffey v. Northwest \n     Airlines, Inc., 567 F.2d 429, 445 (D.C. Cir. 1976), cert. \n     denied, 434 U.S. 1086 (1978).\n       (b) If an employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), the employing office must make \n     reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in \n     accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing \n     office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights. ADA's \n     ``disability'' and FMLA's ``serious health condition'' are \n     different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA \n     entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-\n     month period due to their own serious health condition, \n     whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount of leave, \n     barring undue hardship, as a reasonable accommodation. FMLA \n     requires employing offices to maintain employees' group \n     health plan coverage during FMLA leave on the same conditions \n     as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been \n     continuously employed during the leave period, whereas ADA \n     does not require maintenance of health insurance unless other \n     employees receive health insurance during leave under the \n     same circumstances.\n       (c)(1) A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be \n     accomplished by providing an individual with a disability \n     with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the \n     employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance \n     for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an \n     employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the \n     equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group \n     health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits \n     an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who \n     is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     to an alternative position, whereas the ADA allows an \n     accommodation of reassignment to an equivalent, vacant \n     position only if the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's present position and an \n     accommodation is not possible in the employee's present \n     position, or an accommodation in the employee's present \n     position would cause an undue hardship. The examples in the \n     following paragraphs of this section demonstrate how the two \n     laws would interact with respect to a qualified individual \n     with a disability.\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\n       (2) A qualified individual with a disability who is also an \n     eligible employee entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 weeks of \n     medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which the \n     employing office grants because it is not an undue hardship. \n     The employing office advises the employee that the 10 weeks \n     of leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and will \n     count towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. This \n     designation does not prevent the parties from also treating \n     the leave as a reasonable accommodation and reinstating the \n     employee into the same job, as required by the ADA, rather \n     than an equivalent position under FMLA, if that is the \n     greater right available to the employee. At the same time, \n     the employee would be entitled under FMLA to have the \n     employing office maintain group health plan coverage during \n     the leave, as that requirement provides the greater right to \n     the employee.\n       (3) If the same employee needed to work part-time (a \n     reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same \n     job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have \n     group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of \n     the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, \n     notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time \n     employees do not receive health insurance. This employee \n     would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations \n     to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of \n     the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is \n     working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, \n     the FMLA's provision for temporary assignment to a different \n     alternative position would not apply. Once the employee has \n     exhausted his or her remaining FMLA leave entitlement while \n     working the reduced (part-time) schedule, if the employee is \n     a qualified individual with a disability, and if the employee \n     is unable to return to the same full-time position at that \n     time, the employee might continue to work part-time as a \n     reasonable accommodation, barring undue hardship; the \n     employee would then be entitled to only those employment \n     benefits ordinarily provided by the employing office to part-\n     time employees.\n       (4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing \n     office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in \n     the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and \n     benefits, to that which the employee held when leave \n     commenced. The employing office's FMLA obligations would be \n     satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an \n     equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to \n     perform the essential functions of that equivalent position \n     even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, \n     the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable \n     accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work \n     part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant \n     position, barring undue hardship.\n       (d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing \n     office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an \n     employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. \n     However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an \n     employee the opportunity to take such a position. An \n     employing office may not change the essential functions of \n     the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See 825.220(b).\n       (2) An employee may be on a workers' compensation absence \n     due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies \n     as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers' \n     compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently \n     (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing \n     office). At some point the health care provider providing \n     medical care pursuant to the workers' compensation injury may \n     certify the employee is able to return to work in a light \n     duty position. If the employing office offers such a \n     position, the employee is permitted but not required to \n     accept the position. See 825.220(d). As a result, the \n     employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers' \n     compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to \n     continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is \n     able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee \n     left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is \n     exhausted. See 825.207 (e). If the employee returning from \n     the workers' compensation injury is a qualified individual \n     with a disability, he or she will have rights under the ADA.\n       (e) If an employing office requires certifications of an \n     employee's fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted \n     by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA \n     requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity.\n       (f) Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n     amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the \n     same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing \n     office provides to other employees with short-term \n     disabilities. Because Title VII does not require employees to \n     be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an \n     employee employed for less than 12 months by the employing \n     office (and, therefore, not an ``eligible'' employee under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA) may not be denied \n     maternity leave if the employing office normally provides \n     short-term disability benefits to employees with the same \n     tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.\n       (g) Under the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301, et \n     seq., veterans are entitled to receive all rights and \n     benefits of employment that they would have obtained if they \n     had been continuously employed. Therefore, under USERRA, a \n     returning servicemember would be eligible for FMLA leave if \n     the months and hours that he or she would have worked for the \n     civilian employing office during the period of absence due to \n     or necessitated by USERRA-covered service, combined with the \n     months employed and the hours actually worked, meet the FMLA \n     eligibility threshold of 12 months of employment and the \n     hours of service requirement.

Mr. President, this generation is at the forefront of \ntechnological advances. In fact, it is making the United States and \nthis generation that lives here one of the best networked in history, \nin fact, not only here but around the world.\n  The need for new and better technology to accommodate such a \ngeneration has also left a gaping hole in the security of our country. \nIn recent years, cyber security attacks and breaches have multiplied \nand left American citizens incredibly vulnerable. Make no mistake, the \ncyber security of the United States is in great danger. But, \nunfortunately, proper precautions and reforms needed to set a better \ncourse have yet to be taken.\n  Just look at last week's headlines. USA Today recently reported \nhackers have attempted to compromise the Department of Energy over \n1,100 times between 2010 and 2014, and these attackers have been \nsuccessful over 150 times.\n  In a 2013 breach these attackers gained access to the information of \nover 104,000 Energy Department employees. After these attacks, the \nauditors noted ``unclear lines of responsibility'' and ``lack of \nawareness by responsible officials.'' Yet nothing was done to mitigate \nthe potential for future attacks.\n  Our government needs to stop being content with simply being reactive \nto serious cyber threats. There are no deterrents or consequences to \nthese foreign attackers. Not one person at the Department of Energy has \nfaced consequences. The CIO of the Office of Personnel Management, or \nOPM, remains in charge after one of the largest hacks on Federal \nemployees.\n  In an age ruled by technology, it is our responsibility to make sure \nwe take the necessary steps to protect the information of the American \npeople.\n  This past Monday I held the first biannual Montana High Tech Jobs \nSummit in my hometown of Bozeman at my alma mater, Montana State \nUniversity. We had over 600 Montanans attend.\n  We need to be more disruptive of the status quo in the technology \nsector, rather than passively sitting by as other nations innovate and \nleave us behind. We need to encourage STEM education in our classrooms \nand bring more people into the science and technology sector.\n  In my home State of Montana, high-tech jobs are growing 10 times \nfaster than the statewide job growth rate. Last year alone, 40 percent \nof the wage growth in our entire State took place in Gallatin County, \nthe county where Bozeman is located, and it has become a hub of \ntechnology. Yet too often Montana kids have to leave to find work. We \nneed more high-paying technology jobs in Montana.\n  During my time at the cloud computing company RightNow Technologies, \nwhich was founded, started up, and grew to a company that was acquired \nby Oracle for $1.8 billion, over the 12 years I was there, I saw \nfirsthand how Montana is becoming a leading hub for innovation and \nhigh-tech job growth. Montana has a qualified workforce and an \nunparalleled quality of life that makes our State a wise investment for \ntech companies. In fact, where the campus of our software company is \nlocated in Bozeman we are just minutes away from the Gallatin River. \nThe Gallatin River is where the movie ``A River Runs Through It'' was \nfilmed, where Brad Pitt made his debut, and directed by Robert Redford.\n  This tech summit showcased the great work done in our State, a State \nwhere we can combine the quality of life of fishing, hunting, \nbackpacking, mountain climbing, spending time with family outdoors with \ntechnology and create a world-class high-tech company, because \nmillennials want to have that quality of life, but they also want to \nhave a world-class career in building global companies.\n  This tech summit allowed our Nation's tech leaders to share their \nviews and experiences and encouraged our future tech leaders to lead. \nIt provided a unique opportunity for our State's tech and business \nleaders to learn from one another. We had a great slate of speakers and \npanelists from across the technology industry: Laef Olson, the senior \nVP for cloud operations at Oracle; Dr. Dava Newman, a Montana native \nand the new Deputy Administrator at NASA. We had two of the five FCC \nCommissioners, Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly. We had Doug Burgum, the \nformer CEO and chairman of Great Plains Software. Great Plains Software \nwas started up in North Dakota. He grew that company. It was acquired \nby Microsoft in 2001 for $1.1 billion, the largest acquisition at that \ntime for Microsoft. Now Doug is cofounder and partner of Arthur \nVentures and chairman of the Kilbourne Group. We had Craig Barrett. Dr. \nCraig Barrett received his undergrad, master's, and Ph.D. at Stanford \nand was a professor at Stanford for 10 years in metallurgical \nengineering and then went to this small company in 1974 called Intel. \nThere, he rose all the way to CEO, and in fact, worked with Gordon \nMoore, who became CEO of Intel and who is famous for Moore's law.\n  Mike Goguen, the managing director of Sequoia Capital, a company that \nwas an early initial investor in companies such as Google, YouTube, \nApple, PayPal. We had Will Lansing, a former board member of RightNow \nTechnologies who is now the CEO of FICO. We had Matt Rose, the BNSF \nRailway executive chairman.\n  We had panelists as well who explored issues of critical importance \nto our technology sector, cyber security infrastructure, and our \neconomy. All convened in Bozeman on Monday. One doesn't think of the \nGallatin Valley as being a hub of technology--maybe the Silicon \nValley--but as the world is changing, as technology removes geography \nas a constraint, you have a quality of life that is exceptional, where\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\nyou are an hour away from Yellowstone National Park and can grow world-\nclass tech companies there.\n  We heard from cyber security professionals from Microsoft and \nFacebook that we need not only to run faster, technically speaking, but \nwork together between the private and public sectors to fend off \npotential hackers.\n  We heard how technology is removing geography as a constraint. We \nheard how companies are adopting innovative cyber security practices to \nkeep information safe while maintaining global competitiveness. We \nlearned about the importance of maintaining and advancing our \ntechnology infrastructure and the factors that affect start-up \ncompanies willing to grow, attract investments, and create jobs.\n  We have great technology leaders moving our country forward and \nworking to protect our country, but we need to run faster than those \nseeking to destroy us. We need to ensure that we don't have burdensome \nregulations facing our entrepreneurs and our companies. We need to \ncontinue to encourage policies that drive innovation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/senate-section/article/S6766-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
