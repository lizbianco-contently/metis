Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to take \nanother step forward on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \nor CARA, a critically important and bipartisan bill to address the \ngrowing prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\n  As we have worked through debate on this legislation, we have heard \nnumerous stories from across our Nation about the toll this crisis is \ntaking on Americans. Today, I want to take a moment to address the \ndifference CARA can make in my home State of Kentucky, which has been \namong the hardest hit by this epidemic.\n  More people are dying from drug overdoses than car crashes in the \nCommonwealth, and that is largely due to prescription opioids and \nheroin. We know education and prevention programs can help reduce the \nnumber of people who experience drug addiction and overdose. One \nprogram I have been proud to support is the Drug-Free Community \nProgram, which provides funding to local communities so they can \npromote education and awareness about the dangers of substance abuse.\n  I wrote letters of support on behalf of Oldham and Carter Counties, \nwhich have both received drug-free community grants. This funding helps \nthem train community members, parents, and school officials in \npreventing youth substance abuse.\n  There are other programs in CARA that can help build on these efforts \nthrough community-based coalition grants that address local drug \ncrises. Education is incredibly important, and it is great to see what \nwe are achieving on that front. But for Kentuckians and Americans \ncurrently struggling with addiction, the cycle can be very difficult to \nbreak.\n  We have seen a staggering number of people lose their lives to \noverdose, and we know more must be done to stop that terrible trend. \nFortunately, groups like the Harm Reduction Coalition are providing \noverdose prevention and naloxone training for drug treatment programs, \nrecovery advocates, and health departments across Kentucky and several \nother States. Through State demonstration and first responder grants, \nthe group says CARA can give them a ``stronger foundation to move from \ntraining to action.''\n  Prescription drug monitoring programs are also instrumental in saving \nlives, and I have been a strong supporter of Kentucky's own program, \ncalled KASPER. Just last fall, I received confirmation from the CDC \nthat the Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center had been \nawarded funds to combat the prescription drug and heroin epidemic in \nKentucky. These funds are being used to improve KASPER, as well as \ntarget interventions in counties such as Jefferson, Fayette, Boone, \nKenton, and Campbell--counties that have seen some of the highest rates \nof overdose deaths in the Commonwealth. The bill we are considering \ntoday also places an emphasis on prescription drug monitoring programs \nand will strengthen efforts already in place.\n  Perhaps one of the most heartbreaking aspects of this epidemic is its \neffect on newborns. Just last year, I sponsored the Protecting Our \nInfants Act to address this specific issue and was proud to see it \nbecome law. Our work to protect these fragile lives continues with the \nlegislation we have before us today. CARA would improve treatment for \nboth pregnant and postpartum women by reauthorizing an existing grant \nprogram. It would also authorize a pilot program to enhance treatment \noptions for this specific population.\n  CARA can make positive strides in terms of keeping communities safe, \ntoo. It would bolster the efforts of law enforcement through the \nauthorization of grant programs for collaborative investigative units. \nWhat that means is Kentucky's outstanding drug task forces stand to \nbenefit when it comes to investigating illegal trafficking and \ndistribution of heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids. I have \nstrongly supported each of these efforts to intensify the \nCommonwealth's fight\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\nagainst our prescription opioid and heroin crisis.\n  So because of efforts like those I mentioned--to strengthen education \nand treatment programs, to improve prescription drug monitoring tools, \nand to enhance law enforcement efforts--differences are already being \nmade in the lives of many Kentuckians. With the passage of CARA, we can \nbuild upon these and other initiatives that can help shore up the fight \nagainst prescription opioid and heroin addiction.\n  Kim Moser, Director of the Northern Kentucky Office of Drug Control \nPolicy, says CARA will ``address the growing needs'' of Kentucky \ncommunities and ``expand treatment resources for those suffering.'' She \ngoes on to say that CARA ``will allow individuals, families and \ncommunities to heal from this scourge.''\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, for working with Senators to move this bill by voice vote in \na timely manner, and I want to also acknowledge Senator Portman and \nSenator Ayotte for their responsiveness to this urgent problem and for \ntheir dedication to advancing the bipartisan bill that is before us \nnow.\n  Remember, although this is an authorization bill, Congress has \nalready appropriated $400 million--funds that are still available \ntoday--for opioid-specific programs. We will have more opportunities \nfor funding through the next appropriations process, but it is \nimportant we act on this legislation right now.\n  CARA will bring us closer to ending a national epidemic. It will help \nlift communities like those in Kentucky out of the throes of \nprescription opioids and heroin addiction. It will help save lives.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1244-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have heard my friend the Republican leader \nthe last couple of days talking about what a good bill we have here. He \nis right. It is something that is important to do. We have this opioid \nproblem sweeping the Nation. It is in Nevada, as well as in all other \nStates. All the other 49 States have the problem. So I understand the \nimportance of this legislation. I only wish the Republicans had joined \nwith us yesterday in voting for the Shaheen amendment, which would have \nprovided real money to meet the requirements of this legislation, if it \npasses.\n  I also know my friend keeps talking about the money we have already \nappropriated. We did it because there was an emergency then, and there \nis one now. The programs we have appropriated money for are totally \nseparate and apart from this legislation. That is why Senator Shaheen \noffered her amendment. It was emergency funding that we badly need. So \nit is too bad my friends on the other side of the aisle are talking \nabout taking money from other programs and funding this program. That \nisn't how it should be.\n  This is a scourge sweeping the country. We have programs in this new \nlegislation that need to be funded, otherwise it won't have any meaning \nwhatsoever to the problem we are facing in the country.\n  A number of Democrats have also tried to offer amendments. To this \npoint, they have been able to offer one amendment and vote on one \namendment. We have had more than 60 amendments filed over here. I know \nwe are not going to have the ability to debate and vote on 60 \namendments, but my friend the Republican leader has been out here \nboasting time and again about this robust amendment process, and it is \nonly talk. We haven't had a robust amendment process.\n  I wouldn't think robust would mean having seven or eight amendments. \nWe would accept a new definition of robust, I guess, if we got to offer \na few amendments, but we should be able to offer amendments on this \nlegislation.\n  So I hope the Senate will be able to have a full and open amendment \nprocess on this legislation. If not, we may not be able to proceed to \nvote on this legislation, and it would be too bad. Even though the \nlegislation is not funded properly, we should pass it. We are not going \nto pass it if we get jammed, and that is what is happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1244-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1244-S1245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, listen to these words: fair, respectful, \ndeliberative, and thorough. These are the words the senior Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, once used to describe the way Supreme Court \nnominations should be considered by the Senate--fair, respectful, \ndeliberative, and thorough.\n  In June 2010, he said something more:\n\n       I have always been of the opinion that the Senate needs to \n     conduct a comprehensive and careful review of Supreme Court \n     nominees. It is important that the nominee be given a fair, \n     respectful, and also deliberative hearing.\n\n  That same month, in June 2010, he also said:\n\n       I am committed to ensuring that this process is fair and \n     respectful but also thorough. The Constitution tasks our \n     Senate with conducting a comprehensive review of the \n     nominee's record and qualifications.\n\n  Fair, respectful, deliberative, and thorough. I don't think refusing \nto meet with a nominee, refusing to hold a hearing of a nominee, \nrefusing to vote on a nominee is fair, respectful, deliberative, and \ncertainly not thorough.\n  He was not yet chairman of the Judiciary Committee when the senior \nSenator from Iowa made those comments. As I have noted, he has said on \nmore than one occasion that the Constitution tasks our Senate with \nconducting a ``comprehensive review of the nominee's record and \nqualifications.'' He made those statements when he wasn't chairman of \nthe committee. He is now chairman of the committee--the committee he \nhas served on for decades. Now his response for the Senate's \nconsideration of Supreme Court nominations sets the standard. He runs \nthat big and powerful committee, and he has chosen an approach that \ncould not be further from the fair, respectful, deliberative, and \nthorough that he has urged on more than one occasion.\n  Instead of exercising his once-respected independence, my friend the \nsenior Senator from Iowa is taking his marching orders from the \nRepublican leader and refusing to give President Obama's Supreme Court \nnominee a meeting, a hearing, or a vote.\n  Within an hour after Justice Scalia's death was announced, the \nRepublican leader hijacked the Supreme Court nomination process in the \nSenate by declaring that the Republicans would not consider the \nPresident's nominee.\n  Then the Republican leader decided to seize control of the Judiciary \nCommittee--I don't know if he twisted arms, but that certainly conveys \nthe message I want to convey--twisting the arms of the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa and his committee members to get them to forfeit their \nindependence and fall in line. Behind closed doors, the Republican \nleader compelled the 11 Republicans who make up the majority of the \ncommittee on the Judiciary to sign a loyalty oath. This loyalty oath, \nwhich abdicated the role of this once-dignified committee, took the \nform of a letter promising to follow the Republican leader's demands \nand block consideration of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n  Earlier this week, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, discussed the \narm-twisting that took place. During an interview on Tuesday on an NBC \naffiliate in Iowa, he was asked whether undue influence had been \nexerted by Republican leadership. This is what he said: ``Some had \nreluctance, but all signed.'' Again, ``Some had reluctance, but all \nsigned'' on when asked whether undue influence had been exerted by \nRepublican leadership.\n  I don't blame Senator Grassley's colleagues for their reluctance. The \nJudiciary Committee once had a proud history of independence. This \ncommittee is 200 years old and is one of 11 committees that were formed \nwhen this body came into being. So their reluctance is understandable. \nIt is understandable that the Republican members don't want to abdicate \ntheir independence. I don't blame those Senators for being reluctant to \nfollow the Republican leader's orders for refusal to do their jobs. I \ndon't blame them for their reluctance to banish the independence of the \nJudiciary Committee's past, ensuring that this once powerful, \nindependent, strong committee's reputation is now nothing but a memory.\n  I wish the Judiciary Committee Republicans had been a bit more \nreluctant to sign on to the McConnell-Grassley letter, a pledge not to \ndo their jobs. It appears most voters also think they should not have \nsigned the letter. According to a new CNN poll that came out last \nnight, two-thirds of Republicans want hearings on the President's \nSupreme Court nominee--almost 70 percent. Senate Republicans' pledge to \nobstruct doesn't make sense to the Republicans' own base.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa's blind adherence to the dictates of \nleadership doesn't stop there. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nwas too timid to even meet with President Obama without the Republican \nleader's consent. He refused to go to the White House without the \nRepublican leader by his side. When we all finally did meet with \nPresident Obama on Tuesday--the Republican leader, Democratic leader, \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee--at that meeting, the chairman wouldn't commit to \nmeeting the nominee or holding hearings. He wouldn't do that. He \nwouldn't give the nominee a vote. That is what he told the President.\n  This is not what Senator Grassley advocated before his party assumed \nthe majority. Back in January 2015, on the Senate floor, the Senator \nfrom Iowa said:\n\n       We must get back to what we in the Senate call regular \n     order. I would say do things the way Madison intended.\n\n  Everything the chairman has done since assuming the role runs counter \nto those words and what Madison intended and obviously what the senior \nSenator from Iowa had intended.\n  Allowing 11 Republican members of the Judiciary Committee--and they \nare all men--to decide on behalf of 100 Senators and 300 million \nAmericans that they will not even meet with or hold a hearing or vote \non the Supreme Court nominee is certainly not regular order. This is \nabout as irregular order as you can have. Given the opportunity to \npreside over a fair process, the chairman chose blind obedience to his \nparty leaders instead. Nothing the Judiciary Committee chairman has \ndone in the wake of this Supreme Court vacancy can be identified as \nregular order. It is about as irregular order as you can have.\n  Working behind closed doors is becoming the theme for Senator \nGrassley and the Judiciary Committee. He sought to move a committee \nmarkup scheduled for today--a meeting that normally takes place in the \nfull view of the public--behind closed doors. Everyone, think about \nthat. This hearing has been scheduled for a long time, but the \nRepublican leader wants to do it secretly. When Democrats objected, the \nchairman postponed the meeting altogether. No public hearing, a closed \ndoor hearing, Democrats objected, so he just canceled the meeting. This \nisn't transparency; this is obstruction and chaos.\n  Even Republicans agree--or at least some of them. Last week, the \njunior Senator from West Virginia said:\n\n       Do I worry that this would make the Senate look \n     dysfunctional? That's a slight worry for me.\n\n  It may be a slight worry for the Senator from West Virginia, but it \nis a huge worry for the American people.\n  Again:\n\n       Do I worry that this would make the Senate look \n     dysfunctional? That's a slight worry for me.\n\n  Well, it may be a slight worry for the Senator from West Virginia, \nbut it is not a slight worry for the American people. It is a big, huge \nworry for the people of West Virginia.\n  The good news is that this can all be remedied very quickly. All my \nfriend from Iowa needs to do is use the authority he has as the \nJudiciary Committee chair and give the President's nominee a meeting \nand a hearing. This would be what Iowa deserves and what this country \ndeserves. All he needs to do is live up to his own words and be \n``fair,'' ``respectful,'' ``deliberative,'' and ``thorough.'' Simply \nput, he needs to stop blindly following the Republican leader and just \ndo his job.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1245-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 524, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to award \n     grants to address the national epidemics of prescription \n     opioid abuse and heroin use.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Grassley amendment No. 3378, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Grassley (for Donnelly/Capito) modified amendment No. 3374 \n     (to amendment No. 3378), to provide follow-up services to \n     individuals who have received opioid overdose reversal drugs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the year was 1936. President Franklin \nRoosevelt had just been reelected with an overwhelming majority, and he \ndecided he had had enough of the U.S. Supreme Court. They had been \nstriking down some key pieces of legislation in his New Deal package. \nSo he came up with a bold plan in February of 1937. That bold plan was \nto add enough new Justices to the Supreme Court to tip the balance his \nway.\n  He presented this plan to change the Supreme Court for his political \npurposes to a Democratic Congress and a Democratic U.S. Senate, \nbelieving, with his big reelection majority and the fact that most of \nthe Members of Congress had supported his New Deal agenda, that they \nwould stand by him when it came to changing the Supreme Court so that \nit would start ruling his way. He was wrong. What happened then was \nthat Members of the Senate decided to stand up to their President and \nto stand up for the Constitution.\n  A little-known Senator from Arizona, Henry Ashurst, was the chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. He deliberately delayed the FDR \nCourt-packing proposal to a point where, when it was finally called, it \nwas overwhelmingly defeated.\n  Think about that in the context of our current debate about filling \nthis Supreme Court vacancy created by the untimely death of Justice \nScalia. In that case, in 1937, the Senate Judiciary Committee and its \nchairman stood up for the Constitution first, over and above even the \nPresident of their own political party. This was a popular President; \nyet they believed the Constitution was more important than any \npolitical issue when it came to the New Deal.\n  So where are we today? We are in a situation where we have a vacancy \non the Supreme Court. The Court still continues to hear cases of great \nhistoric moment--yesterday, the case involving abortion and I am sure, \nin weeks ahead, even more controversial issues. It is a Court that is \nat least limited by the fact that there are only eight Justices. In \nmany instances, this Court is likely to end up with a tie--a decision \nwhich doesn't decide the law but leaves it still unresolved.\n  So what is our responsibility as this Senate at this time as we \nreflect on the Senate of 1937? Well, we only have to\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\nturn to the U.S. Constitution--the Constitution which each of us, each \nand every one of us as Senators, Democratic and Republican, stood in \nthe well and swore to uphold.\n  The second article in this Constitution relates to the powers of the \nPresidency. In this book, it is only three pages, but the people who \nwrote the Constitution, our Founding Fathers, tried to put in those \nthree pages the critically important elements to make sure that our \ndemocracy would continue. They tried to envision the possibilities and \nto authorize branches of government to do certain things.\n  In article II, section 2, when it comes to the powers of the \nPresident, it says:\n\n     he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \n     the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.\n\n  Did it say he may appoint? No. The language is explicit. He shall \nappoint, and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall fill the \nvacancies on the Supreme Court.\n  So what faces us today? An announcement by the Republican leadership, \nSenator McConnell, within hours of the announcement of the death of \nJustice Scalia, that for the first time in the history of the United \nStates Senate, for the first time in our Nation's history, the \nRepublicans have announced that they will not only refuse to fill this \nvacancy, they will not even allow a hearing on a Presidential nominee. \nAnd Senator McConnell went a step further and said he will not even \nmeet with a nominee offered by the President to fill this vacancy. That \nis a clear violation of the constitutional responsibility which this \nSenate has. The Constitution doesn't require us to approve any nominee, \nno; it is advise and consent, not consent only. We can certainly vote \nno if we feel that vote is warranted. But the Constitution is very \nclear that we can't walk away from our constitutional responsibility \nwhen it comes to a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  If the Senate Republicans have their way, this vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt will continue on until the next calendar year. It will be the \nlongest vacancy on the Supreme Court since the Civil War, when this \nNation was torn apart. If there was any excuse in those days for not \nfilling the vacancy, there is no excuse today.\n  There is the argument made: Let the people decide. Let the people \ndecide in the next election who the next Supreme Court Justice will be. \nBut that ignores the obvious: There is a sitting President, elected for \n4 years, with the constitutional authority every President has, and one \nof those authorities is to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  They argue: Well, the people will decide in November what will happen \nnext year. I might remind them that the people decided in the year 2012 \nby a margin of 5 million votes that Barack Obama would be President of \nthe United States--not for 3 years, not for 3 years and 2 months, but \nfor 4 years. And to argue that he is somehow now unable, unwilling, or \ncannot be called on to exercise his Presidential authority flies in the \nface of reality--a reality which most Republicans will readily concede, \nat least in private.\n  The Republicans think they are winning this debate. I think they are \nlosing. They think their ``let the people decide'' approach to this is \nreally carrying the day. I think our approach to this--saying to our \nRepublican colleagues: Do your job--is carrying the day.\n  How is this playing in Peoria, IL? I want to read from an editorial \nof the February 28 edition of the Peoria Journal-Star:\n  The most worthless Congress in memory became more so last week, with \nSenate Republicans doubling down on their decision not to even hold \nhearings for any Obama nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the \nScalia vacancy.\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Even as awful as Congress is, it's not often that its \n     members combine dereliction of constitutional duty--(see \n     Article II, Section 2)--with political cravenness (the \n     aversion to tough decisions in an election year) in one fell \n     swoop, but so Senate Republicans have here. Not only have \n     they unconstitutionally changed a president's term from four \n     to three years, not only are they renouncing their ``advice \n     and consent'' role, not only are they effectively suggesting \n     the Constitution be amended to popularly elect Supreme Court \n     justices, but even more lame are the lengths Republicans went \n     to in order to rationalize their decision.\n\n  No more excuses. The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate should \ndo their job. When the President submits a nominee, we should give that \nnominee a fair and thorough hearing--a fair, respectful, and thorough \nhearing, as one Republican said over and over again--in full view of \nthe American people and then vote.\n  A fair warning to my Senate Republicans. They said the American \npeople should decide. They will decide--they will decide in November \nthat the Republicans in the Senate should do their job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator may well recall--he was here \nwhen I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001 during President \nBush's administration, the ranking member was then Senator Hatch--we \nput together an agreement about how the committee would consider \nSupreme Court nominees. We wrote: The Judiciary Committee's traditional \npractice has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once \nthe committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even \nin cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Does the Senator recall that at that time the Republican leader of \nthe Senate, Senator Lott, even read that letter into the Record to say \nthat this is the way the Senate should operate?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do remember that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning because \nof the important subject that is before us, the bill that deals with \nthe opioid epidemic, the follow-on heroin problem, a bill that was \nreported out of committee unanimously, a very important piece of \nlegislation. Right now we have unfortunate political gamesmanship that \nhas overtaken some of my Democratic colleagues at the very same time \nthat everybody on the Judiciary Committee knows we need to pass the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that goes by the acronym CARA \nfor short.\n  It happens, though, that the opioid epidemic is not a political game. \nIt is a real problem out there. A massive hearing we had in committee \ndemonstrates that. I am very proud the Senate has taken up the CARA \nbill, after this public health crisis festered for so long while the \nSenate was controlled by the Democrats.\n  For example, tragically heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from \n2010 to 2014. All the while, the Democratic leadership simply did not \nmake it a priority to move a bill like CARA. It is a bipartisan bill \nthat addresses the public health crisis of heroin and prescription \nopioid abuse.\n  Through the hard work of many on both sides of the aisle because it \nis a bipartisan bill, as I said, it passed out of our committee--and \nyou can't say so often--unanimously. Everybody at the grassroots level \nof America thinks everything here is always partisan between \nRepublicans and Democrats--not when it comes to the opioid issue or a \nlot of other issues. This bill came out of committee unanimously, and \nwe ought to get it to the House of Representatives as fast as we can \nand to the President. Just a few weeks after it came out of committee, \nhere we are working on it with an opportunity to pass it.\n  This reflects the Senate working in a very constructive, bipartisan \nway on behalf of the American people and the people who are addicted to \nheroin and opioids. This is very much unlike the way the Senate acted \nwhen the Democrats controlled it. This issue was not brought up. For \npolitical reasons, that is not a narrative some Democrats want the \nAmerican people to hear, and so we are having this game today.\n  Yesterday, there was a manufactured controversy over the amount of \nfunding. Of course, the opioid crisis demands resources, and \nsignificant resources are being directed to it, both by the \nAppropriations Committee and the programs laid out in this bill before \nus right now. In fact, according to the\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nOffice of National Drug Control Policy, the Appropriations Act passed \nin December provides more than $400 million in funding specifically to \naddress the opioid epidemic. This is an increase of more than $100 \nmillion over the previous year. None of that money has been spent yet. \nAll of that money is still available today.\n  This bill authorizes so many activities to combat the crisis, but it \nwas never intended to appropriate funding. That is what we have \nAppropriations Committees for. That is why we have an appropriations \nprocess. Through the appropriations process, we can evaluate competing \npriories, evaluate tradeoffs, and in the end ensure that adequate \nresources are directed to this epidemic while at the same time \nmaintaining fiscal discipline.\n  I am glad the Senate rejected that attempt to inject gamesmanship \ninto the debate over ways to improve this bill. That vote happened \nyesterday. Now the minority in the Senate, the Democrats, are setting \nup additional procedural roadblocks. We tried to set up additional \nvotes this morning to move this very important bill along so we can \nhelp the people of the various States, and particularly New England, \nsolve this opioid addition and heroin problem--also a problem in the \neastern part of my State--but somehow the Democrats would not agree.\n  Because we have this bill on the floor, I also asked the Democrats on \nthe committee to hold our weekly Judiciary Committee business meeting \nover here in the Capitol Building instead of in the committee room, \nright off the floor of this Senate, as we do quite regularly, \nparticularly when we have so much business here.\n  That was a routine accommodation I asked them to make, similar to the \naccommodation I gave to them when we had a hearing scheduled earlier \nthis week on the EB-5 immigration bill, when they asked to cancel that \nbecause this bill was on the floor of the Senate. So I accommodated \nthem. Would they give me the accommodation of holding this meeting off \nthe floor of the Senate so we could take up the business of voting out \nsome judges? There was not any legislation on our agenda, but we could \nhave voted out some judges. How often do we hear that the Judiciary \nCommittee is not moving judges? We had a chance to do that probably in \na 10-minute meeting right in the President's Room, just a few feet from \nwhere I am standing right now.\n  I gave them an accommodation, but now I am running into trouble \nbecause I canceled a meeting because we have this important bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. I understand they are protesting the Judiciary \nCommittee's lack of action on a Supreme Court nomination, which \nnomination we could not even possibly consider if the President does \nnot send it up.\n  I imagine this is just the first of several problems we are going to \nhave in the next few weeks. While they do that this morning, I want you \nto know I am going to be on the Senate floor trying to get this very \nimportant opioid addiction bill--heroin addiction bill--passed, and I \nwill be thinking about so many people CARA will help once this bill is \nsigned by the President.\n  At our Judiciary Committee hearing we had on this very important \nproblem, we heard from Nick Willard, chief of the Manchester New \nHampshire Police Department. His officers will benefit from the \ntraining the bill authorizes to use naloxone, a drug that can save \nlives after an overdose.\n  At that hearing, we also heard from Tonda DaRae, a courageous Ohio \nwoman who lost a daughter to an overdose and who founded a support \ngroup for those in recovery called Holly's Song of Hope. Her group may \nprofit from this legislation's grants aimed at building communities of \nrecovery.\n  I will be thinking about the many Iowans I have heard about who have \nbeen impacted by this crisis. I spoke earlier this week about Kim Brown \nof Davenport, who lost her son Andy to an overdose. She now speaks out \nacross the State about the epidemic.\n  There is Carla Richards, of Waukee, IA, who lost her daughter Anna to \nan overdose as well. She founded an organization to promote awareness \ncalled Anna's Warriors. There are all kinds of tragic stories that \nevery Senator in this body could talk about that highlight the \nrationale behind this legislation and the $400 million that is waiting \nto be spent to overcome the opioid addiction.\n  There is a seed of hope in many of them, hope that we can act to \naddress this epidemic, each in our own way. I will be thinking of these \nstories today as we try to move CARA one step closer to becoming law. \nSo why would a bill that got out of committee unanimously have this \nsort of shenanigans going on, on the floor of the Senate, at a time \nwhen people are dying--44,000 people in the most recent statistical \nyear, more than automobile accidents and gun crimes together. This is a \nreal problem. We need to get this bill passed, and we are working on \naccommodating amendments and moving it forward. It is not the time for \nthe go-slow approach we are seeing already on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee for \n30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one, so we fully understand, we are \nperfectly willing to have--even though we don't hold Judiciary \nCommittee meetings every week as we used to--we would be perfectly \nwilling to have a meeting that was not in a backroom but open so the \npress would see it.\n  It is important to have such meetings open, for the press and anybody \nwho wants to come in. It is unfortunate that we have had--with the \nSupreme Court vacancy--there has been a closed-door, back-room meeting. \nThat is when a small handful of Republican Senators decided, with the \nRepublican leader, to say the President should not follow his \nconstitutional duty and nominate a Supreme Court nominee, and, in an \nunprecedented fashion, the Senate Judiciary Committee would not follow \nits constitutional obligation of advice and consent.\n  In that small closed-door meeting, it was decided that Senators \nshould not follow the solemn oath they have taken on this floor when \nthey say they will uphold the Constitution ``so help me God.'' We have \nhad enough closed-door meetings, especially closed-door meetings that \ntell us to violate an oath where they said ``so help me God'' and to \nnot follow the Constitution.\n  I think it is important that we have these meetings since the \nuntimely passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. There is certainly a \ndisagreement over how to move forward in filling the Supreme Court \nvacancy, but I think the American people want us to do our job. This is \na time we should have an open conversation about it, not closed-door \nmeetings, where afterward self-serving press releases are issued, which \nmay or may not accurately represent what went on in those meetings.\n  The American people deserve to have us do our job, hear us discuss \nand debate the committee's next steps in fulfilling our constitutional \nduty.\n  Last night, my friend, the senior Senator from Iowa, decided to \npostpone this meeting rather than have it in public. Now we have to \nwait another week before the committee can sit down in public so the \nAmerican people can discuss an issue that is so important. The move to \npostpone today's meeting is troubling, given that last week's meeting--\na meeting that should have happened with the participation of all the \ncommittee members in a room open to the public, showing us doing our \njobs--was also postponed. So we didn't have a meeting in public. We \nweren't doing our job.\n  Instead, last week the committee's Republicans decided to meet behind \nclosed doors--the public couldn't follow what they were doing--without \nany Democrats so they could hatch a partisan plan to obstruct any \neffort to consider the next nominee to the Supreme Court and do that no \nmatter what the Constitution says. There was no consultation with any \nDemocrats serving on the committee. There was no public discussion of \nany kind.\n  Certainly, in my 40 years here, whether Republicans have been in \ncontrol of the Senate or Democrats, I cannot think of any precedent for \nthis kind of closed-door discussion of how we avoid doing our job. \nInstead, 11 Republican Senators unilaterally decided the Senate would \nabdicate its responsibility and block all of us from fulfilling\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\nour constitutional obligation of advice and consent. They block all of \nus from doing our job.\n  Supreme Court nominations are a unique priority for the Judiciary \nCommittee. Since I have served in the Senate--I voted on every member \ncurrently on the Supreme Court and on several who have since retired--\nthe Judiciary Committee has always held hearings on Supreme Court \nnominees, and they have always reported them to the full Senate for \nconsideration.\n  When I took over as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001, \nGeorge W. Bush was President. I did not agree with much of what his \nadministration was already doing--I was very frank in discussions with \nPresident Bush to tell him that--and I was not sure if I would approve \nof any Supreme Court nominations he might have the opportunity to make, \nbut even with those reservations, I wrote a letter with then-ranking \nmember Senator Hatch memorializing an agreement we reached--which \nRepublicans gave their word to follow--about how the Judiciary \nCommittee would consider Supreme Court nominees.\n  In that letter that Senator Hatch and I wrote, he gave his word and I \ngave mine:\n\n       The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to \n     report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the \n     Committee has completed its considerations. This has been \n     true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed \n     by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Senator Hatch and I gave our word on that. The Republican leader at \nthe time, Senator Lott, then read our letter into the Congressional \nRecord to ensure that it was available to all Americans to see, and I \ntook the word of Republicans in this body that they believed what they \nwere saying. It showed the long understanding of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's commitment to an open, fair process, even when the majority \ndoes not agree with the opposing party's President.\n  The priority of the Judiciary Committee has afforded Supreme Court \nnominees is exemplified by its consideration of two of the most \ncontentious nominations to the Court: Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.\n  In both instances, then-Chairman Biden moved the nominations to the \nfull Senate, even though a majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee \ndid not support the nominations. In other words, the majority did not \nsupport the nomination, but we still moved them forward.\n  In Robert Bork's case, a committee vote to report out his nomination \nfavorably failed by a vote of 5 to 9, with both Republicans and \nDemocrats voting against it. At the time, the Reagan administration was \nquietly asking him to withdraw his name, but he still wanted to have a \nvote, and the committee then voted to report his nomination with an \nunfavorable recommendation. He was reported out unfavorably by a vote \nof 9 to 5 so the full Senate could consider him. Some Democrats voted \nfor him. Many Democrats voted against him. Some Republicans voted for \nhim. Many Republicans voted against him, but he had his vote.\n  In Clarence Thomas's case, the committee voted to report out his \nnomination favorably. That failed by a vote of 7 to 7. The committee \nthen voted to report his nomination without recommendation, and by 13 \nto 1 we voted to give him a chance to be heard on the floor.\n  Even when a majority of committee members have not supported a \nnominee, as was the case with Robert Bork or Clarence Thomas, we have \nnot denied the full Senate--or the American people--the opportunity to \ndebate and consider a Supreme Court nominee. We were not going to say \nthis Senate shouldn't do its job.\n  The Judiciary Committee has a strong tradition of transparency. I \nremember when I first came on, there was one of the most conservative \nSenators as chairman, Jim Eastland. We have done it with all who have \nbeen chairs. I believe the American people have a right to see and hear \nwhat we are doing. They have a right to know whether we are doing our \njob. They have a right to weigh in on the decisions we make. Nowhere \ndoes transparency matter more than a lifetime appointment to the \nhighest Court in our land. You can't decide a question of somebody \ngoing on the highest Court of our land, with a lifetime appointment, \nand do it with a small group behind closed doors. That is not doing our \njob. There is no place for backroom deals for something so important. \nPublic confirmation hearings are a vital part of our democracy. That is \nnot just about us.\n  Public hearings are how Americans meet the nominee. Public hearings \nallow every American the opportunity to watch and listen to this person \nwhose decisions may have a lasting impact on their lives. Ultimately, \nwhat this small group of Republican members of the committee meeting \nbehind closed doors unilaterally decided last week was to reject the \nlongstanding tradition of public hearings. In doing so, they are \ndenying Americans--all Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike--the \nchance to participate in the consideration of a nominee. They deny \nAmericans a chance to have us do our job.\n  The Judiciary Committee is one of the busiest in the Senate. It \nconsiders some of the most consequential issues affecting millions of \nAmericans. When we commit ourselves to what brought us here, to do our \njob and work together for our constituents, we can achieve great \nthings. This is what happened 3 years ago when the Senate passed \ncomprehensive immigration reform. After six hearings and 3 weeks of \nmarkups--many lasting until very late at night--each of the 18 Senators \nserving on the committee participated in the process to draft that \nlegislation. I allowed everybody who had an amendment to bring it up. \nWe would go back and forth--one Democrat, one Republican, back and \nforth. We did this day after day, late at night sometimes, but all in \npublic. It was all covered by television. Not all of us supported the \nbill, but all of us had a chance to debate and amend it. Even the \nstaunchest opponents of the legislation, including some in the Chamber \nright now, praised the Judiciary Committee's transparent and fair \nprocess for consideration of that bill. A Vermont editorial at the time \ncalled our committee proceedings--because they were open, because \neverybody had a chance to participate, because the American people \ncould see what we were doing, because we were doing our job--``a lesson \nin democracy.'' I think it is time for a refresher course.\n  The legal issues before the Supreme Court are significant, and its \nimportance in our constitutional democracy cannot be overstated, nor \ncan the responsibility of both the President to follow his \nconstitutional duty to nominate and the Judiciary Committee's \nresponsibility to fairly consider a nominee to serve in the highest \nCourt in the land.\n  It is with deep concern I come to the floor. I urge my friend, the \nchairman, and all members of the Judiciary Committee to renew their \ncommitment to transparency and regular order. I ask that you withhold \njudgment. I ask those who met behind closed doors to withhold your \njudgment until you can review the record of whomever the President \nnominates. I ask you to give the next nominee to the Supreme Court a \nfair hearing, as we have done in this body--the body should be the \nconscience of the Nation--for the last 100 years. The American people \nexpect us to do our job.\n  Senator Coons is on the floor. The distinguished Senator from \nDelaware is the ranking member of the Court Subcommittee. I wish to ask \nSenator Coons, through the Chair, what his understanding of the role of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee with regard to the next Supreme Court \nnominee is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I emphasize how important I think the role \nis of the Senate Judiciary Committee. As many present know, my \npredecessor, now Vice President Biden, is a former chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  As my good friend and colleague from the State of Vermont just \nreminded us, there is a long and important history on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that I think bears repeating; that since its \nformation a century ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee has provided a \nhearing, a vote or both for every single Supreme Court nominee. The \nonly exceptions being those that went straight to the floor because \ntheir confirmations were supported so broadly.\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\n  I also think there is a second important point, if I could briefly \ntouch on it; that even in those instances where a nominee did not enjoy \nmajority support on the committee, even in those instances just cited \nby the Senator from Vermont, where a majority of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee voted against a nomination, that nomination proceeded to the \nfloor of the Senate to ensure that advice and consent--our \nconstitutional duty--could be carried forward.\n  If I might ask for the forbearance of the Senator from Vermont for \none moment, I also want to set the record straight about what my friend \nand predecessor then-Senator, now-Vice President Biden actually said in \na floor speech back in 1992, a floor speech that has been widely cited \nas evidence of some new set of so-called Biden rules that are somehow a \nbasis for the obstructionism we now see--a refusal to even meet with a \nSupreme Court nominee, let alone give them a fair hearing.\n  I want to take this moment because then-Senator Biden has been quoted \nout of context. He gave--I am sure this will not surprise some in the \nChamber--a somewhat long and winding speech. There was no Supreme Court \nvacancy at the time. He was simply observing what might happen if there \nwere to be a vacancy. While he did, early in the speech, give some \ncomments that have been now used, he also gave at the end of his speech \na section I want to read. To quote directly:\n\n       I believe that so long as the public continues to split its \n     confidence between the branches, compromise is the \n     responsible course both for the White House and for the \n     Senate. Therefore I stand by my position, Mr. President, if \n     the President [then President George H.W. Bush] consults and \n     cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent \n     consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support, as did \n     Justices Kennedy and Souter.\n\n  In conclusion, let me remark that what then-Chairman Biden did speaks \nmore loudly even than what he said. I believe his record as chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee is unmistakable. In case after case, he \nconvened and held timely hearings, even in the election year of 1988. \nIt means he considered and confirmed 64 judicial nominees, as late as \nSeptember in a Presidential election year. It means he voted in favor \nof Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter, nominated by Republican \nPresidents, and it means that in his speech, in the section I quoted, I \nthink he sent a clear request to then-President George H.W. Bush to \nwork with the Senate, send us a moderate nominee, and I will consider \nsupporting them.\n  I urge the chairman and ranking member, all of us who are members of \nthis important and august committee, to follow the actual Biden \nrules by working across the aisle, by consulting, and by offering a \nfair, open, and timely hearing for any nominee who should be proffered \nby our President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nclearing that up. I don't normally discuss what is said in meetings \nwith the President, but so much has been reported by the two \nRepublicans who were there, the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the \ndistinguished Republican leader. Vice President Biden was also there, \nand he was very clear as to what he meant so that there would be no \nquestion. He also pointed out that right through September, 64 of the \nRepublican President's nominees went through. I think during President \nBush's last 2 years, I was chairman, and I moved 68 judges.\n  We see a double standard by our friends from the Republican Party \nwhen it comes to the courts of appeals judges as well as district \njudges. In the majority, they have allowed only 16 of President Obama's \njudges. Facts do speak louder than words.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware for clearing up that \nmatter.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island also has something \nhe wishes to say, and I will yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for that \ncourtesy. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states quite \nclearly that the President shall nominate a candidate when there is a \nvacancy in the United States Supreme Court. I would like the record of \nthis discussion to reflect that the term ``shall,'' as defined in the \nMerriam-Webster dictionary--the relevant definition--is A, used to \nexpress a command or exhortation, and, B, used in laws, regulations, or \ndirectives to express what is mandatory.\n  Under the Constitution that we are all sworn to uphold, the President \nof the United States has a mandatory duty. I think it is important that \nhe accomplish it and nominate a candidate.\n  I ask my colleagues to imagine if there were another mandatory duty \nof the President of the United States that this President refused to \nperform--imagine the cavalcade of Republican Senators to the studios of \nFox News to decry and condemn this President for that omission. This \nshould be no different.\n  The President must and will do his constitutional duty. If and when \nhe does that, then the constitutional burden of duty moves from the \nPresident to the U.S. Senate, and we will then have to decide whether \nwe will abide by our constitutional duty, whether to follow the regular \norder that so many of us have articulated as an important goal, whether \nto follow the precedents of previous nominees, whether to act fairly, \nwhether we are going to be an organization here, an institution, that \nwill prejudge a nominee before we even know who he or she is. Prejudge \nis at the heart of prejudice; it is not a good thing for the Senate to \nbe doing. Finally, we will have to decide what kind of example we want \nto set to the rest of the world--of a country that follows the regular \norder as established in its constitution and has its institutions of \ngovernment do their duty or as a country that will bend, twist, and \ndodge those responsibilities because of the demands of immediate \npolitics.\n  Those are choices I will address when they come to us. For now I wish \nonly to say that the President's mandatory duty is clear, and no one \nshould be surprised that he performs it.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. He \nis a former attorney general of his State as well as a former U.S. \nattorney and is well familiar with what the Constitution requires, and \nI appreciate his urging the U.S. Senate to do its job and follow the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, at this point I will yield to the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and our ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee not only for his friendship and his \narticulateness but his great work on this issue.\n  Just as the President has a constitutional responsibility to name a \nnominee to the Court, the Senate has its constitutional duty to provide \nadvice and consent on the nominee. It is our job. It is the job of this \nbody and specifically the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on that \nnominee.\n  This chart says, ``America to Senate Republicans: Do your job.'' \nToday we might be saying, ``America to the Judiciary Committee: Do your \njob.'' The American people expect us to do our job in the Senate and in \nthe committees and do what we are supposed to be doing.\n  As my colleague from Vermont has noted, the Judiciary Committee \nshould be meeting right now at this moment, as we do every Thursday. \nThis would have been the first opportunity for all members of this \ncommittee to debate in public the Republican chairman's unilateral \ndecision to issue a blanket hold on an unnamed Supreme Court nominee. \nWe hold Judiciary meetings on Thursday all the time while legislation \nis being debated on the floor. There were no votes scheduled. We meet \nevery Thursday. We know why they are not meeting today. They are afraid \nto discuss the issue. They cannot win the argument that we shouldn't be \ndoing our job in a public debate. They can't win the argument that the \nJudiciary Committee shouldn't be holding hearings. We had the meeting \nabruptly canceled at the last minute not because CARA is being debated \non the floor--CARA is important--but because people didn't want to \ndebate the issue of the Supreme Court. Let's face it; that is the \ntruth.\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n  We are not asking the Senate or the Judiciary Committee to be a \nrubber stamp.\n  I have one more point on the Judiciary Committee. We are asking our \nRepublican colleagues to simply do their job. Hold this body and the \nJudiciary Committee in some regard. We can disagree on the politics, we \ncan disagree on a nominee, but hold a hearing and hold a vote. That is \nwhat our constituents sent us here to do.\n  I will remind my dear friend from Iowa, and he is a dear friend, what \nhis own Web site--the Judiciary Committee's Web site--says is its job. \nThis was pointed out by Senator Durbin a few days ago, but I think it \nis worth repeating. This is a copy of the Web site of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Here is part of what it says when it comes to nominations.\n\n       When a vacancy occurs on the Supreme Court, the President \n     of the United States is given the authority, under Article II \n     of the United States Constitution, to nominate a person to \n     fill the vacancy. The nomination is referred to the United \n     States Senate, where the Senate Judiciary Committee holds a \n     hearing where the nominee provides testimony and responds to \n     questions from members of the panel. Traditionally, the \n     committee refers the nomination to the full Senate for a \n     vote.\n\n  This is the Web page of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It does not \nsay you hold a hearing when you want to. It does not say you hold a \nhearing when you like the nominee or only when your party has the \nPresidency. It says: ``The nomination is''--not may be; is--``referred \nto the United States Senate, where the Senate Judiciary Committee holds \na hearing where the nominee provides testimony and responds to \nquestions from members of the panel.'' It doesn't say the Senate \nJudiciary Committee might hold a hearing or could at its whim hold a \nhearing. It says hold a hearing, no qualifiers.\n  We ought to be holding a hearing and we ought to be debating on \nwhether to hold a hearing now in the Chamber of the Judiciary Committee \non Thursday at 10 a.m., as we have done week after week after week when \nother important issues are being debated on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. We can do both. We can move CARA--I admit it doesn't have the \nfunding I would like to see there at this point--and we can meet in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I don't understand the decision by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who I believe holds the same reverence that I do and the \nsame reverence that the ranking member and former chairman, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, does for its profound and historic standing in the \nSenate. I would like to hear directly from the chairman about the \nthinking behind his decision to unilaterally decide that this committee \nwill have no voice, no ability to examine a nominee's record and \nqualifications.\n  Earlier this week, the chairman indicated that there are some members \nof his committee majority who might like to see us hold hearings. He \nsaid: As any chairman ought to do, I went to the members of my \ncommittee. They all agreed with me for different reasons, not just \nbecause I am chairman. Some had reluctance, but all signed.\n  The chairman indicated he would consider breaking ranks with his \nparty leader by meeting the potential nominee, Eighth Circuit Court \nJudge Jane Kelly from his home State of Iowa. He was reluctant to issue \nthe same across-the-board denial. I understand his reluctance. He is a \ngood man. Chuck Grassley is a good man. He comes from the heartland of \nAmerica and represents its finest values. I regret to say it, but I \nthink politics are pulling him off course here, and I hope he will \nreturn because he is a good man and I understand the reluctance of \nSenators to sign that letter. Senators did not come to Washington to do \nthat. The Senators know the folks out there want them to do their job.\n  Editorial boards across the country have castigated this policy of \nobstruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Almost every poll shows the majority of Americans favor \naction.\n  Mr. President, just one more point.\n  It is not right to do what the committee is doing, and I sincerely \nhope the chairman will reconsider his position. If Republicans truly \nrespect the Constitution, they should follow it and consider a \nnomination from the sitting President rather than play political games.\n  I yield back to my dear friend, our outstanding leader on the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize our time has expired, but I ask \nunanimous consent that I be able to yield the floor for my colloquy but \nthat I be followed for 5 minutes by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut and that he be followed by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Minnesota for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). I am in the Chair and probably \ncan't participate, but I want to make it clear that I want the manager \nof the bill to speak so----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, could we have regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am exercising my prerogative. If I don't \nhave that prerogative, then I object.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, may I make a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I didn't have any intention to speak today, but one of \nthe blessings of being a freshman Member is you get the opportunity to \npreside and hear the arguments that are going on in the Chamber and the \ndiscussion about the SCOTUS nomination. We are going to have to agree \nto disagree with our friends from across the aisle on the SCOTUS \nnomination.\n  Let's take a look at what is going on here.\n  In North Carolina, over the past 24 hours, some four people have died \nof a drug overdose. We had more deaths associated with drug overdoses \nthan we had with car accidents last year.\n  So what is going on here? Back in 2008, there was an opioid epidemic. \nThere was a supermajority in the U.S. Senate. There was a Democrat in \nthe White House and a majority in the House of Representatives. No \naction. In 2010, the epidemic was growing. In places in New England, in \nthe Midwest, down in the South, people were dying. Yet there was no \naction.\n  Now this Congress has taken action. I think it is time to move the \nCARA bill. To hold hostage the CARA bill and shift the discussion to a \ngenuine disagreement we have with the minority on SCOTUS is literally \ncosting lives.\n  For those who sit here and want to hold up the CARA bill for the \npurposes of discussing the SCOTUS nomination, we don't even have a \nnominee yet. There is going to be plenty of time in committee and \nplenty of time on the floor to debate this difference of opinion \nbetween the minority and the majority. But in the meantime, for people \nwho would hold up passing the CARA bill over the SCOTUS nomination, \nwhat are you going to tell the two people--last week, two friends of \nmine, when they heard my speech on the Senate floor, came to me and \nsaid: Thank you for moving this bill. I lost my son a year and a half \nago.\n  Two of my friends have told me: Thank you for helping us increase the \nvisibility and get to a point to where we are saving these lives.\n  Those who would hold up the CARA bill, what are you going the tell \nthe first responders who, if they had naloxone, could have potentially \nsaved the life of somebody who has fallen on the floor and died? What \nare you going to tell them? What are you going to tell the law \nenforcement officers who are trying to help people live who have \nsuccumbed to addiction and opioid abuse? What are you going to tell \nthem by holding up this bill? What are you going to tell the parents \nwho are struggling, who need help with education, who need help with \ntheir incarcerated children who may have succumbed to addiction, who \ndid a wrong thing and are in prison and now need help? They need to be \nrehabilitated. They need to be saved.\n  At some point, we need to recognize that we do need to do things \nseparately. We need to recognize that it is disgraceful to hold up the \nCARA bill over a genuine disagreement we are going to have for months.\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\n  I am one of the Senators in the Judiciary Committee who signed the \nletter. I do not believe that until we hear the vote of the people, we \nshould hear a SCOTUS nomination. But I am not here to talk about SCOTUS \ntoday. I am here to talk about saving lives. I am here to talk about \naddressing the addiction problem that is growing. I am here to talk \nabout the sad, heartbreaking stories of families across this Nation who \nare starving for help.\n  This bill helps. This bill appropriates over $100 million that can be \nspent between now and the end of September to save lives. If I come to \nthe floor tomorrow, I am going to be talking about four more lives that \nhave been lost in North Carolina, some that could have been saved if we \nwould just do our job. There is a lot of discussion about doing our \njob, right? Let's do our job and get CARA passed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from North Carolina to \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. TILLIS. I yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. I appreciate the courtesy. I so understand \nwhat you are saying. A week ago, I held in my arms a father whose son \nhad committed suicide while waiting for treatment, so I understand the \nimportance of the bill we have before us.\n  I don't see why we can't do both things at once. The Senator from \nNorth Carolina has sat with me while we debated important bills on the \nfloor and met in the Judiciary Committee, and all of a sudden, at the \nlast minute, the rug is pulled out from under that meeting. It was \nscheduled. The CARA bill was scheduled to be debated, and we could meet \nin the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am sure my colleague will admit that the issue with the Supreme \nCourt is important, too, just as CARA is. So could he explain to me why \nwe couldn't do both--have our meeting in the Judiciary Committee and \nlet those who want to be in the Judiciary Committee speak there and let \nthose who want to speak on CARA speak here? No votes were scheduled. I \nam right about that, correct? So just explain how one delays the other.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I actually was speaker of the house in \nNorth Carolina for 4 years. I like a good scrap. I don't have any \nproblem with going to a committee hearing and explaining why I have \ntaken the position I have on the judicial nomination. But that is not \nwhat I am talking about today. I am talking about over the next 24 \nhours, four more people are going to die from overdoses in North \nCarolina. I am trying to figure out what I say to that mother and that \nfather to say, well, gosh, you know, things got gummed up here because \nwe decided to connect two unrelated issues. One has to do with the \nSupreme Court nomination, and that is very important. It is critically \nimportant. I get that. But what is more important than saving lives of \npeople who we know are going to die? The data is compelling.\n  Folks, we have to get to a point where we get Washington working \nagain, and you don't do it by playing chess. I am not an attorney. I am \nnot a constitutional scholar. But I am a father and somebody who spends \na lot of time in my State. I think we have reached a point where we \nneed to get serious with it. We are creating obstacles on CARA that \ndon't exist. People are absolutely costing lives by failing to move on \nthis bill.\n  Let's have a fight. Let's have a committee hearing. I like a good \nscrap. I am looking forward to having that debate. I am looking forward \nto the history of other positions that have been taken by my friends \nacross the aisle on how to dispose of nominations from the President. I \nam happy to do that. But I want this bill passed. I want to be able to \ngo back to the people in North Carolina and say: We are doing \neverything we possibly can to save lives. That is what CARA does. That \nis why we need to act.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks the floor?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I seek to ask another question of my friend from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, we were supposed to be here moving the \nbill forward. We need to make it clear that we were going to vote on \namendments on CARA today to draw down the backlog and move the bill. \nThe Presiding Officer decided to have the meeting off the floor so that \nwe could move judicial nominations. We weren't going to take up \nlegislation there.\n  I think what we need to do is get back to the work of disposing of \namendments, making the bill better potentially, and getting it to the \nHouse and getting it to the President's desk. That is what I am talking \nabout. This is the capacity. We have limited capacity in this Chamber. \nYou all know the procedural games you can play around here. The \nlimitations of time are numerous. We are just creating more of that. We \nare gumming up the works while people are dying. One person every 6 \nhours in the State of North Carolina is dying from a drug overdose. If \nwe delay by 6 hours, we are responsible for a life in North Carolina. \nThese are lives we can save. We need to dispose of the amendments on \nthis bill and move it to the House.\n  Mr. President, I apologize if I am angry, but when lives are \ninvolved, when youth is involved, I think it is time for us to do our \njob. Our job is to dispose of amendments and move this bill to the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TILLIS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask my colleague, is it true that we have had debates \nin the committee in the committee room while important discussions have \nbeen carried on here in other instances? Is that true or false?\n  Mr. TILLIS. I say to Senator Schumer, it is true.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.\n  Mr. TILLIS. But I don't see its relevance to the task at hand. That \nis the problem----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TILLIS. If I may completely answer the question, that is the \nproblem with this process. I hear that. I see the Kabuki dances going \non. What I want to do is dispose of the amendments on the CARA bill and \ndo our job. Let's do our job. Our job is to pass legislation and in \nthis case save lives. So I get that we need to do the other things, but \nlet's get to the task at hand. Let's do our job. I am prepared to do \nthe job. I will stay here all weekend long. I will work 24/7 until this \nbill gets passed. Why don't we focus on that and introduce a little \nhumanity into the discussion? I get the procedural issues. We need to \nhave the debates in Judiciary. I am perfectly happy to do that. I want \nthis bill passed. I want Members to come down to this floor, pass \namendments, draw down the queue, and send this bill to the President's \ndesk.\n  Let's do our job. I am prepared to do my job today, tomorrow, \nSaturday, Sunday, and through all of next week if that is what it takes \nto get this done. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill be too.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded the floor.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as one who has held a lot of hearings on \nopioids, as one who has brought together law enforcement, the medical \ncommunity, parents, the faith community, and physicians in my State on \nthe opioid matter, I am perfectly happy that the Republicans control \nthe schedule and perfectly happy that they want to stay here today, \ntomorrow, the next day, and go forth.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for one more question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would just ask you, our ranking member, haven't we been able in the \npast to hold meetings in the Judiciary Committee and debate bills on \nthe floor?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We did hate crimes legislation on the floor at the same \ntime we were doing a Supreme Court nomination. Those are pretty \nsignificant things. It can be done.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. One more question to my colleague. Has the leader filed \ncloture, which would move this to a conclusion? As best to your \nknowledge, has the leader filed cloture? Because if\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\nhe hasn't, we are not holding up anything.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest to my colleague from North Carolina \nthat if he wants to move the bill quickly, he ought to go to the leader \nand say ``File cloture,'' not say ``Delay a meeting in the Judiciary \nCommittee''; is that right?\n  Have you heard of the leader filing cloture yet?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my understanding is that cloture has not \nbeen filed.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would agree with the Presiding Officer. I will stay here \nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday and vote and pass this, I would hope with \nactually putting money in it so we are not just passing something \nsymbolically without teeth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would ask the Senator from Vermont a question, if he \nwould take it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I \nyield to answer the question, yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I heard what they said about the meeting \nbeing canceled today, because we could have held the meeting off the \nfloor and voted out three judges. So somehow that interfered with what \nthey wanted to do in the Judiciary Committee meeting. I asked for an \naccommodation. I asked the ranking member for the same accommodation I \ngave his side when we canceled a hearing on the EB-5 Program earlier \nthis week. And a hearing obviously doesn't take the same time away from \nthe floor as a markup might. So consequently I am asking the ranking \nmember if that accommodation isn't worth the accommodation that I asked \ntoday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, addressing the distinguished Member through \nthe Chair, he is well aware of my concern and the difference between \nEB-5, which we debate all the time, and a Supreme Court nomination. \nThis goes beyond apples and oranges. There is absolutely no comparison.\n  I think the Republicans having had a closed-door meeting where a \nsmall percentage of the Senate decided there should be no debate or \ndiscussion on a Supreme Court nomination--there is no way that having a \nclosed-door meeting off the floor is something that--it wouldn't pass \nthe giggle test. I think all of us, both Democrats and Republicans, \nwould have been rightly criticized by the press if we had done that. \nThis is anything but routine. We are talking about the Supreme Court.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Connecticut and then 5 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am always honored to be in this Chamber, and I feel \nimmensely privileged to participate in any debate. But I must say, Mr. \nPresident, that the average American listening to the colloquy that has \nbeen conducted just within the past few minutes would regard it \nsomewhat in disbelief, maybe dismay, because the Presiding Officer is \nabsolutely right that the people of our States are literally dying as a \nresult of the heroin and opioid epidemic that has created a public \nhealth hurricane, a crisis of untold proportion.\n  This body should and hopefully will pass a bill that will help to \naddress that public health crisis. It is only a downpayment, only a \nfirst step, and only effective if accompanied by funding, an emergency \nsupplemental necessary to provide the real resources to address this \nproblem. But this body is capable of passing that bill and still \ndebating whether there should be a hearing and vote on the President's \nSupreme Court nominee.\n  The voting on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, also \nknown as CARA, is within the control of the majority. That is a simple \nfact. As Ronald Reagan said, facts are stubborn things. The fact is \nthat control of the votes on that measure are within the prerogative of \nthe majority.\n\n  In the meantime, the majority also has the power and authority to say \nwe will have a hearing and a vote on the President's Supreme Court \nnominee; we will do our job. That is what Senators are elected to do. \nThat is why we have come to the floor of the Senate to say that the \nSenate must do its job. It has a constitutional duty. It has no \ndiscretion whether it should wait for a politically opportune time to \ndo its job or whether it should hear from its base politically. It \nshould do its job when the President submits his nominee.\n  What may be most regrettable about this debate and about the majority \nleadership's refusal to have a hearing and a vote on the President's \nnominee is that it demonstrates political machination--game playing--\nthat threatens the Supreme Court as an institution. It endangers its \ncredibility and trust. The Supreme Court has no armies or police force. \nIt depends, for the enforceability of its decisions, on its credibility \nand trust. And when it is demeaned in the eyes of the public, when its \nstature is diminished, when it is dragged into the political morass of \na partisan debate and partisan paralysis, its credibility and trust and \nits stature are vastly diminished, and its powers and institution are \nin danger.\n  I am dismayed that these machinations tend to diminish and demean \nthis institution where I worked for a year as a law clerk for Supreme \nCourt Justice Harry Blackmun, where I argued cases when I was attorney \ngeneral, and where I was yesterday on those steps with the same awe and \nadmiration and, indeed, reverence that the American people should feel \nfor an institution above politics, higher than the ordinary give-and-\ntake and contention that occurs on this floor and throughout the \npolitical institution. The refusal to even consider having a hearing, \nhaving a vote, having a meeting with the President's nominee endangers \nthis institution.\n  Elections have consequences. We all say so. Obstruction has \nconsequences too. The failure to consider these nominees means that \ncritical decisions will be left undecided.\n  I urge my colleagues to enable us to have a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. May I have just 1 more minute?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBlumenthal be granted three more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I want to close with the words of Justice Scalia, \nwho said, when he was asked to recuse himself, that leaving the Court \npotentially equally divided 4 to 4--that a 4-to-4 vote was to be \navoided if possible. He said:\n\n       With eight justices [it] rais[es] the possibility that, by \n     reason of a tie vote, [the Court] will find itself unable to \n     resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case. . \n     . . Even one unnecessary recusal impairs the functioning of \n     the Court.\n\n  Even one unnecessary 4-to-4 vote impairs the stature and credibility \nand the effectiveness of the Court.\n  I urge all of us to move forward with the President's nominee when it \nis made.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut, especially since he brings a wealth of knowledge \nhere. He was one of the most noted attorneys general of his State. \nAlso, he has that very unique knowledge of one of the most highly \nsought positions--a clerk to a member of the U.S. Supreme Court. In \nmany ways, these are the people who have a closer view. So Senator \nBlumenthal's experience as a clerk of the Supreme Court is something \nnone of us should ignore.\n  Madam President, I ask to be able to yield to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from Vermont \nfor the opportunity to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to discuss the United States and \ncoalition strategy to bring about a lasting\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\ndefeat of the terrorist group ISIS, often known by different acronyms, \nsuch as ISIL, as well as Daesh. I will use the acronym ISIS.\n  We know that ISIS proposes a direct threat to our partners in the \nMiddle East and is exporting its distorted, hateful ideology to other \nnations, including here in the United States. Beginning in 2014, I have \npressed the administration to take action against the financial and \nfacilitation networks that support ISIS. The administration has done \ngood work, but much more remains to be done.\n  In mid-February, I traveled to a number of countries in the region, \nincluding Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey to conduct oversight \nof our strategy to cut off the financial networks that support \nterrorist groups like ISIS. I found that the events of the last 2 years \nhave brought the issue of terrorism financing into sharper focus, and \ncertainly into sharper focus for the countries in the region. ISIS \nattacks in places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar should be a wakeup call \nfor gulf countries. Terrorist financiers not only support ISIS, but \nthey present a direct threat to their own internal security and \nstability--the security and stability of these gulf countries--as well \nas other countries the world over.\n  While coalition partners are taking steps in the right direction, \nmuch more work remains to be done. We need to see more investigations \nturn into more arrests, more prosecutions, more sentencing, and more \naccountability in these countries that will take these criminals and \nterrorists off the streets. It also became clear to me on my visit to \nthe region that we need to improve upon the international architecture \nthat cuts off terrorist financiers and facilitators from the \ninternational financial system. As a first step, countries should seek \nto meet the requirements to be a member in good standing of the \nFinancial Action Task Force, known by the acronym FATF. This is a \nmultinational, intergovernmental organization tasked with addressing \nmoney laundering and financial crimes.\n  Countries also need to take steps to address the ways terrorist \nfinanciers use the black market and the gray market to facilitate their \nwork. For example, in Turkey, my last stop on my visit to the region, I \ncame away with the impression that the Turkish Government is not \nadequately prioritizing efforts to stop foreign fighter movements and \nthe illicit smuggling of cash, oil, antiquities, and IED precursor \ncomponents across its southern border. As terrorist financiers' tactics \nevolve, our strategies must improve and respond. For example, more work \nneeds to be done to regulate and to cut off the informal exchange \nhouses in countries bordering ISIS-occupied territory, which may be the \nprimary way that ISIS gains access to the international financial \nsystem.\n  Much more work remains to be done, and the United States should \ncontinue leading the effort. At every stop, I was impressed by the good \nwork of our U.S. military personnel and diplomats. One of the \nhighlights of my trip was the afternoon I spent at the Al Udeid Air \nBase in Doha.\n  I spent time at the Combined Air Operations Center, known as the \nCAOC, where elements from all U.S. services and representatives of many \nof our coalition partners worked together to coordinate and execute air \noperations against ISIS. I also received a classified briefing from the \nAFCENT commander, Lt. Gen. Brown, which, of course, I cannot detail \nhere. But General Brown has said publicly: ``Successful strikes on oil \nfacilities and on monetary centers have resulted in Daesh cutting pay \nto their fighters and increased the amount of money available to \nconduct and fund their operations.''\n  This is an important development. It is important to note that U.S.-\nled air strikes are having a profound impact on ISIS's financial \noperations.\n  As lawmakers, we must continue to critically evaluate and develop \nconstructive policies to bring about a lasting defeat of ISIS. We \ncannot abdicate our oversight responsibilities. To my colleagues who \nsay we are doing ``nothing'' to fight ISIS, I encourage them to go to a \nplace like the Al Udeid Air Base, meet directly with senior leaders who \nare bringing the fight to ISIS, and see firsthand the incredible work \nof our servicemembers, just as I did in the middle of February. We need \nto hear directly from military commanders and national security experts \nbefore offering prescriptions like increasing troop levels in Iraq or \nexpanding the mission sets our military is currently executing.\n  We owe it to these men and women to have a robust, bipartisan debate \nabout this strategy and to vote on an authorization for the use of \nmilitary force, vote on legislation to cut off financing, vote on bills \nto promote humanitarian aid--all of the elements of this strategy.\n  Rather than conducting oversight by sound bite and oversight by \ncategorical condemnation, let's have a serious debate on this critical \nnational security issue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have had quite a discussion this \nmorning on why the Judiciary Committee didn't meet.\n  We were prepared to meet the same way we often meet when there is \njust maybe 5 minutes of business. We meet off the Senate floor so that \nwe can do both the work of the entire Senate and the work of the \nJudiciary committee. That happens often. And that's the accommodation I \nasked for from the minority. But they objected. Of course, they asked \nme to accommodate them on a hearing that I had scheduled for earlier \nthis week on the EB 5 immigration issue. I postponed that hearing \nbecause minority members of the Judiciary Committee didn't want to have \nthat hearing when this very important opioid addiction bill was on the \nfloor. The heroin addiction bill is before the United States Senate \nwith 44,000 lives being lost in a year because of that addiction. And \nwe're considering important legislation to solve that problem. I did \nnot get that accommodation, so I canceled the meeting.\n  So what we heard on the floor here, while my colleagues were holding \nup the opioid bill, all this talk about having a debate about the next \nnominee to the Supreme Court--a nominee that hasn't even been made yet.\n  So I come to the floor now to respond to just a couple ridiculous \narguments that my friends made this morning.\n  First of all, we are going to have a debate about the Supreme Court \nand the proper role of a Supreme Court Justice in our constitutional \nsystem. We are going to debate whether or not the American people want \nyet another Justice who decides cases based on what is in his or her \nheart or whether they want a Justice who will decide cases based on the \nConstitution and the law. That is not my estimation of the debate; that \nis exactly what this President said regarding previous judges and \nJustices. He said he was looking for somebody who would have empathy \nfor people who came before the Court. Having empathy for people that \ncome before the Court means that you are supposed to do something \ndifferent than what judges are supposed to do. Judges are supposed to \nlook at the facts and the law and base their decisions on the law. They \naren't supposed to base their decisions on personal feelings. We are a \nnation based on the rule of law. So this is what the American people \nhave to think about and decide. They need to have a voice in this \nprocess. As Senator Biden said in 1992 or as Senator Schumer said in \n2007--we are not going to consider a Supreme Court nominee during a \nheated Presidential election. So we have an opportunity to have a \nnational debate. This whole debate is about whether we are going to \nhave Justices who decide cases based on empathy rather than the letter \nof the Constitution and the letter of the statute.\n  On the second point, we have heard a lot of complaining around here--\nand I suspect we are going to hear a lot more--because Senate judiciary \nRepublicans met and then made public our decision not to hold hearings \non the Supreme Court nomination during a heated Presidential election \nyear. Give me a break.\n  We made a decision based on history and our intention to protect the \nability of the American people to make their voices heard. We didn't \nplay games, just as Senator Biden wasn't playing games when he gave \nthat 20,000-word speech in 1992 where he said that we shouldn't have a \nlameduck President make a nomination during a Presidential election \ncampaign, just like\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nSenator Schumer said in 2007 before the American Constitution Society, \n18 months before George W. Bush was out of office. So that is the \nhistorical approach. Very plain and open, both Democrats and \nRepublicans taking the same tone so the people could make their voices \nheard. The American people should be heard not only on who is going to \nfill Justice Scalia's seat, but also on the proper role of the Supreme \nCourt and whether or not the Court ought to be a legislative body.\n  Like I said, we made that decision and immediately made it public. I \ndon't remember being invited to the secret meetings that the Democrats \nheld before they walked onto the Senate floor in November of 2013 and \ninvoked the nuclear option so they could pack the D.C. circuit. We \nwanted to save taxpayer money. The D.C. circuit is the least worked \ncircuit court in the country. Everyone knew you didn't need three more \njudges. That court was fairly evenly divided between liberals and \nconservatives. But because that court reviews the President's Executive \norders and regulations, this President wanted to make sure he had \nenough judges on that court, so that when the court reviews the actions \nhe takes with his pen and phone, he would get favorable rulings. So \nthey packed the D.C. circuit, so that is why we had the nuclear option, \nbecause the other side had to get around the 60-vote rule that we had \nhere for the approval of judges.\n  I also keep hearing this claim Senator Biden, when he was chairman of \nthe committee, should be praised for how he handled the Bork-Kennedy \nepisode. Now, I happened to be here in 1987. I saw what happened to \nRobert Bork. I saw how he was smeared. And because he was smeared, that \nseat remained open and was filled in early 1988. If that is the other \nside's argument, then I think we all know how weak their position is.\n  Finally, let me say this. I said yesterday and I want to say it \nagain, the other side knows that this nominee isn't going to get \nconfirmed. Everyone knows it. The only reason that they are complaining \nabout a hearing on the nominee is because they want to make the process \nas political as possible. And that goes to the heart of the matter.\n  We are not going to politicize this process in the middle of a \nPresidential election year. We are going to let the people have a \nvoice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I listened with great attentiveness to the \nvery distinguished chair of the Judiciary Committee, whom I have the \nutmost respect for, but I feel that I must respond, given this \nimportant question that is not before this body but should be.\n  The first point this Senator would make is that the term ``lameduck'' \nis being used rather loosely. Lameduck, as I have always understood it, \nis the period between the election and a swearing-in of a successor. A \nlameduck Congress is the Congress before November and January. A \nlameduck President is the President's term between November and \nJanuary. I think, as I have always understood the use of that term, to \napply it to a President who is in the middle part or early part of the \nfourth year of his or her term is not an accurate characterization or \nusage of the term ``lameduck.''\n  The distinguished chairman said we are going to have a debate. I am \ndelighted to hear that. The question is, When? I wasn't here in 1992. I \nwasn't here in 1987. I wasn't here in 2007. So I am trying to figure \nout how to respond to this situation, how to understand this situation, \nwith reference to the Constitution.\n  There are lots of provisions in the Constitution that are subject to \nwindy law review articles, to lengthy court decisions, to \ninterpretation, to characterization of what they actually mean, what \nwas the original intent of the Framers, and all of those complicated \nissues of discussion, dissection, and explication. But the word \n``four,'' as in one, two, three, four, and the word ``shall,'' as in \n``shall do something,'' are not among those confusing terms.\n  I would submit that the President has a constitutional obligation to \nsubmit a nominee to this body and this body has a constitutional \nobligation to consider that nomination--not an obligation to confirm, \nnot an obligation to say yes, but an obligation to consider it.\n  The Presidential term is 4 years; it is not 3 years and 1 month. That \nis in the Constitution. Article II, section 2, says the President \n``shall nominate . . . Ministers . . . Judges of the supreme Court . . \n. with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.''\n  I would not for a minute presuppose what the decision of the Senate \nshould be, but to argue that the Senate will not even hear the \nnomination, will not discuss it, will not debate it--in fact, some of \nthe Members have said they will not even meet the person, with no \nknowledge whatsoever of who this person is. The President may nominate \na person who is a combination of Aristotle, Thomas Jefferson, and St. \nThomas of Aquinas, but he or she is not even going to be met with. I \ndon't understand that as a matter of interpretation of the \nConstitution.\n  There is a lot of discussion about the people ``should have a role'' \nin this decision. The Constitution makes that clear. They do have that \nrole when they elect the President of the United States for a 4-year \nterm, not for a 3-year, 1-month term.\n  I can see no wiggle room on the President's obligation to submit a \nnominee to this body. This decision to stall this nomination, to not \nmeet with a nominee, to not hold hearings, to not hold a debate, to not \nhold a discussion, has profound implications for the Court because the \nreality is this means the Court will be without a Justice for \nessentially two terms.\n  We lost Justice Scalia in February. The term of the Court doesn't end \nuntil later this spring. He will not be present for the final \ndecisionmaking on the matters that have been before the Court this \nterm. Then, if we wait until a new President is elected, the new \nPresident comes into office on January 20, 2017, and submits a new \nnomination almost immediately. Let's say it is within the first 2 weeks \nof his or her taking office. The average time for consideration of a \nJustice is between 60 and 90 days. We are into February, March, April, \nand that is into the next term of the U.S. Supreme Court. By delaying \nthis decision, we are basically going to leave the Court without a \nJustice, in contravention to the explicit provision of the \nConstitution, for what amounts to two terms.\n  This Senator wants to be very clear: I am not saying that there is \nany constitutional obligation on this body to approve the President's \nnominee, but I believe there is a constitutional obligation to consider \nthat nominee. That is really what we are debating.\n  I am delighted to hear the distinguished chairman say we are going to \nhave this debate, but we ought to have it now, under the Constitution, \nwhich requires the President to submit a nominee and, I would argue, \nrequires this body to at least consider that nominee, to hold hearings, \nto let the people hear who the nominee is, to hear what their views \nare, and to make the decision within this body whether this nominee \nshould be approved for this incredibly important, august, and solemn \nobligation to undertake as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Again, ``four'' and ``shall'' are not debatable propositions. Whether \nor not the Senate should confirm is clearly within the discretion of \nevery Senator in this body, but to say that we will not have the \nopportunity to make that decision I think is contrary to the \nConstitution. It is contrary to the best interests of the American \npeople, and I am surprised, frankly, that my colleagues are taking this \nposition. Nobody is saying how they have to vote. If they don't like \nthe nominee, they can vote them down, but why not have a hearing, why \nnot have a debate, why not have a discussion, why not find out who this \nperson is? The President may nominate someone who is of great appeal to \nboth sides of this body.\n  I would hope that the distinguished chair of the committee would \nreconsider his decision--the committee's decision--to not even hold a \nhearing and to carry out what I believe is the obligation to at least \nhear the nomination--not approve it, but to at least\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nhear it--and therefore let the American people participate in this \ndiscussion. Therefore, let the American people participate in this \ndiscussion. But let's also follow the explicit provisions of the \nConstitution that require the President to submit a nominee and, I \nbelieve, require us to at least consider it, if not approve.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about the \npending legislation, which is very important. It actually enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, and I am optimistic we can get it done.\n  Before I talk about that, I wish to comment on some of the things \nthat have been said on the floor with regard to the vacancy created by \nthe death of Antonin Scalia.\n  First, the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, clearly wants to apply a \ndifferent set of rules when Republicans are in the majority than he did \nwhen Democrats were in the majority. That is very clear.\n  People may get lost in some of the arcane and convoluted nature of \nthe arguments we make on the floor, but the American people understand \nhypocrisy when they see it. Clearly, in 2005, when President George W. \nBush was President, Senator Reid made this statement:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote.\n\n  We actually agreed with Senator Reid then. But to have him come to \nthe floor and lambaste the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nothers in a very personal way is surely beneath the dignity of this \nbody and of any Senator. Somehow the Democratic leader feels as if the \nrules that apply to the rest of us simply don't apply to him. He comes \nto the floor and tries to provoke fights.\n  We actually have some important work to get done, and we will get it \ndone on this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the so-called \nCARA Act.\n  I wish to make another point clear. Republicans on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee agreed in a united way to the same principle that \nour Democratic colleagues have argued for decades. During an election \nyear, a Supreme Court nominee should not be confirmed. I previously had \nspoken about Senator Joe Biden making that point when he was chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee back in 1992. In 2005, Senator Reid made \nthat point. In 2007, Senator Schumer, the heir apparent to the \nDemocratic leadership, made the same point. But, again, they feel that \nnow the rules should apply differently under a Democratic majority than \nthey do under a Republican majority.\n  We are not a rubberstamp for the President of the United States. The \nConstitution says as much. We can grant consent or we can withhold \nconsent. I, for one, am for withholding consent to the confirmation of \nanother liberal on the U.S. Supreme Court. We have seen the types of \nJustices that President Obama has nominated: Justice Kagan, Justice \nSotomayor--clearly on the left in terms of the balance of power on the \nU.S. Supreme Court. To simply give President Obama the ability to \nappoint somebody who is going to change the balance of the Supreme \nCourt to tilt left for the next 25 or 30 years is simply unacceptable.\n  So it really doesn't make any difference who the President nominates. \nI am sure they will be very much in the same mold as the two Justices \nthat he has already nominated: Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor. I \nsay that with respect to them as people. They are entitled to their \nopinions just as we are, but their decisions make fundamental changes \nin the United States. And it is not just for a term of office; it is \nliterally for a generation. We are not going to stand by and allow \nPresident Obama--on his way out the door as a lameduck President--to \nchange the balance of power on the Supreme Court for the next 25 to 30 \nyears.\n  Madam President, now to a more pleasant topic. I actually have been \nencouraged, despite the disagreement we have with our friends across \nthe aisle on the Supreme Court, to see that there is interest in \nactually getting some work done. I hope that does not cause us to fail \nto do our duty when it comes to places we agree on, such as the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  This bill has been the result of a lot of hard work and bipartisan \ndiscussions. I thank the leadership and chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, as he made this a priority. This wasn't \njust for Republicans who were proposing we move on this legislation. \nSenator Klobuchar and Senator Whitehouse on the Democratic side, and \nSenator Portman, Senator Toomey and Senator Ayotte on the Republican \nside brought this to everyone's attention, primarily because of the \ndevastating impact of the opioid prescription drug abuse problem and \nthe heroin problem in their parts of the country, but it affects the \nwhole country.\n  I am thankful that the Democratic leadership understands that this \nlegislation should not be taken as a partisan hostage because it is \nabout helping to restore communities and families from the effects of \ndrug addiction and it is about stemming the tide of a massive epidemic \nof opioid drug use and addiction that continues to claim lives across \nthe country. It is an example of how in the 114th Congress, since the \nbeginning of last year, we have actually been able to work together \nwith our colleagues across the aisle.\n  Before that, under the leadership of the Senator from Nevada, this \ninstitution was deadlocked. It wasn't just when Republicans were in the \nmajority. When Democrats were in the majority, even they could not get \nvotes on amendments. It is pretty hard to explain that back home: Yes I \nam in the majority, but it doesn't make any difference in terms of my \nability to get things done for the people I represent.\n  I actually am very pleased that we have been working our way through \nthis legislation and other legislation that could help advance good \npolicies that positively impact the lives of the American people on a \ndaily basis.\n  Madam President, another effort we have worked on in the Judiciary \nCommittee has to do with the intersection of mental illness and the \ncriminal justice system. I recently met with a number of major county \nsheriffs, and I was introduced to the sheriff of Los Angeles County. He \nsaid: I am the largest mental health provider in the country--the \nsheriff of Los Angeles. The fact is, after we deinstitutionalized \npeople with mental illness, basically there was no safety net for them, \nno continuing treatment for their needs, so they either end up in jails \nor living homeless on our streets.\n  I have introduced legislation, and Chairman Grassley allowed us to \nhave a hearing on it. I think it was very instructive. It was also very \ninteresting. I say this to my friend from Maine: It is one of the few \ntimes we have actually had a consensus panel of witnesses. I think on \nsome committees in the Senate that is a common practice, but usually in \nthe Judiciary Committee things are so polarized that we rarely have a \nconsensus panel. But we did on the issue of mental illness.\n  Reforming our country's mental health system has become an area of \nreal bipartisan consensus as well, along with criminal justice reform. \nIn order to protect our communities and to get help to the people with \nmental illness, we actually need to act.\n  What has also become clear is that many people who struggle with \nmental illness suffer from addiction and substance abuse. In many \ninstances they self-medicate. They have a mental illness, they cannot \ndeal with it, they are not getting the prescriptions they need from \ntheir doctors, so they end up drinking or taking drugs. These are so-\ncalled co-occurring disorders. It is estimated that more than 10 \nmillion Americans suffer from both addiction and mental health \ndisorders--co-occurring disorders. Unfortunately, many mental health \nservices such as specialty courts--drug courts, veterans courts, and \nthe like--have operated on separate tracks and treat only one aspect of \nthe problem. Someone with a history of drug abuse and mental illness \nmay be sent to a drug court where their mental health needs are not \ntaken into account. By definition, a drug court deals with people with \ndrug problems, not necessarily mental health issues. When that happens, \nthe underlying problem isn't addressed at all.\n  I have submitted an amendment to this legislation that will address \nthis\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\ncommon link between mental illness and substance abuse in the criminal \njustice system. It would direct existing programs to apply to co-\noccurring disorders as well, so that people suffering from both \naddiction and mental health problems are not seen and treated for just \none of those problems. It seems as if it makes sense.\n  It would also expand substance abuse and transitional services to \nhelp people suffering from co-occurring disorders to receive the \nappropriate treatment they need in order to get back on their feet.\n  This amendment has been cosponsored by the chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the senior Senator from \nTennessee, whom I thank for his important contribution to this effort. \nIt also has the support of many stakeholders around the country, \nincluding the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations.\n  I hope, when the time comes, our colleagues will support this \namendment as a commonsense measure that will help those suffering from \nboth mental health and addiction problems, and I believe it will make \nthe underlying bill that much stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the vacancy \non the U.S. Supreme Court. Following the passing of Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia--and our condolences to his family and our \ngratitude for all his hard work on behalf of his country--the time has \nnow come for the President to nominate a new Justice and for the Senate \nto do its job and to review, consider, and either confirm or reject the \nPresident's nominee. That is our job.\n  Hoosiers don't ask much, but they do expect common sense. Do your \njob; treat people fairly. That is what we expect from neighbors, \nfriends, and family, and it is certainly what we expect from those \nelected to serve us in Washington.\n  Back home in Indiana, we have a proud tradition of Senators who have \nembodied that approach by looking beyond partisanship and giving full \nand fair consideration to a President's nominee. They don't have to \nvote yes, they don't have to vote no, but we should at least listen and \ndo our job. That is what the people of Indiana elected me to do. That \nis what people across the country elect my colleagues in the Senate to \ndo, even when the timing is inconvenient for one side or the other.\n  The confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice should not be taken \nlightly, and it deserves careful consideration and open debate.\n  Senators, using their best judgment, are free to ultimately reject \nwhomever the President nominates. But to refuse to hold a hearing? To \nrefuse to consider any candidate? I know my colleague from Maine talk \nabout Aristotle or Aquinas. They might be two good candidates for the \nSupreme Court. But to not consider any candidate before the President \nhas even chosen a nominee is a dereliction of our most basic duty to \nfaithfully serve our country.\n  Some of my colleagues have been steadfast in promising they would not \nmeet with a nominee, let alone hold a hearing or allow a vote--would \nnot even meet. Common sense tells you that is not right. I hope they \nwill reconsider their position.\n  U.S. Senators, myself included, were elected to do a job, to do a job \nfor our Nation--not only when it is convenient, but every day, every \nday we have been hired by the people back home to work here to stand \nfor our country. That job includes considering and voting on nominees \nto the Supreme Court. Let's do the job we were elected to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate about the current vacancy on the \nSupreme Court. Democrats want to fill it immediately. Republicans are \nmuch more interested in making sure the American people have an \nopportunity to weigh in on this very important decision.\n  This is a lifetime appointment--a lifetime appointment--and the \nstakes could not be higher for our country. So it is perfectly \nreasonable to wait for the next President to make this critical \nnomination. It is also exactly the precedent that Democrats in this \nbody, in the Senate, created for situations just like this one.\n  First of all, let's remember it is not uncommon for there to be a \nvacancy on the Court. Sometimes the seat can be empty for even more \nthan a year. There are eight Justices now. Two of them have already \nsaid they can handle the work that is available in front of them now \nwith the seat vacant.\n  Justice Alito said so, as did Justice Breyer. Now Justice Breyer, of \ncourse, was appointed by President Clinton. When Justice Breyer was \nasked the other day about the death of Justice Scalia, he said: ``We'll \nmiss him, but we'll do our work.'' He has said: ``For the most part, it \nwill not change.'' So there is no urgency to fill this vacancy on the \nSupreme Court right now.\n  Second, we should acknowledge that the process of nominating and \nconfirming a Supreme Court Justice has become very partisan. It has \nalso become very political. Some Democrats in this Senate have spent \nthe last three decades undermining the way these appointments used to \nbe made. It started in 1987, when Senate Democrats launched an all-out \nassault against the nomination of Judge Robert Bork. It got so bad that \nthe dictionary even created a new word. The word was to ``bork'' \nsomeone. It means to obstruct someone by ``systematically defaming or \nvilifying'' them.\n  Then, in 1992, Senate Joe Biden came down to floor of the Senate to \nexplain his rule, the Biden rule, for Supreme Court nominations. He \nsaid that once the Presidential election is underway, ``action on a \nSupreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election \ncampaign is over.'' That is the Biden rule.\n  You can't get any clearer than that. Joe Biden was the chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee at that time when he announced the Biden \nrule. You know, he was not all that worried about having only eight \nJustices for a while. Senator Biden said that a temporary vacancy on \nthe Court ``was quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, the \nPresident, the Senate, and our nation would have to pay for what would \nassuredly be a bitter fight.''\n  Well, if the fight would have been bitter in 1992, it would be even \nworse today. Today, we have had another 24 years of Democrats \ncontinuing to politicize the process. Just days after George W. Bush \nbecame President, Senate Democrats vowed that they would use--in their \nwords--``whatever means necessary'' to block the President's judicial \nnominations.\n  Democrats went so far as to try to filibuster a Supreme Court \nnominee. That was the first time in the history of the Senate that they \never tried to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee. It was the nomination \nof Justice Alito in 2006. The Democrats failed. Even though they \nfailed, it set a new precedent.\n  Some of the leaders of that filibuster were Senator Barack Obama, now \nPresident; Senator Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, now-\nPresidential candidate; and Senator Joe Biden, now-Vice President of \nthe United States. Senator Reid voted to filibuster as did current \nSenators Durbin, Leahy, and Schumer, all part of the filibuster of the \nSupreme Court nomination of Justice Alito by George W. Bush.\n  That is the history of how our confirmation process became so \npolitical; that is, three decades of Democrats politicizing the \nprocess. That is the precedent for where we are today. Those are the \nrules we will follow today.\n  On top of all of that, President Obama has spent 7 years ignoring \nCongress. He has made the confirmation process more confrontational and \nmore contentious every step along the way. The President illegally made \nwhat he called recess appointments to the National Labor Relations \nBoard. He even\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\ndid it though Congress was not in recess.\n  I use the word ``illegal'' because the Supreme Court struck down this \naction by President Obama. The vote was 9 to 0 that the President acted \nillegally. Even Democrats in Congress have said they think the \nPresident has gone too far with some of his Executive actions. So it is \nclear that Senate Democrats and President Obama have been injecting \npolitics into the confirmation process for many years.\n  Today they seem to wish that they hadn't done it. Well, these are the \nrules they wrote and these are the standards they set. The Senate will \nfollow these rules. We should wait until next year to take up this \nimportant decision. Let the American people consider it as part of \ndeciding who to support in November. Let the new President make this \nlasting decision without the political influence of the election \nhanging over it. It is not the job of the U.S. Senate to rubberstamp \nthe President's nomination. The job of the Senate is to protect the \nConstitution and to serve the American people. That is the oath every \none of us has taken in this body. We have a process for nominating and \nconfirming Justices to the Supreme Court. It is a system the Democrats \ncreated and now they should be willing to follow the rules they wrote \nthemselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to speak for the second time \nabout the Supreme Court vacancy, and I do so not callously, not \nspontaneously but after 23 years of service on the committee. I like to \nbelieve I have some experience and some knowledge about how these \nmatters have been handled in the past.\n  I truly believe we have an obligation to consider a President's \njudicial nominees no matter when, and I wish to speak about why that \nduty is so important--particularly for the Supreme Court--and the \nconsequences of not fulfilling it. To be very candid, I am shocked at \nthe supreme nature of what is happening because of what I believe its \nimpact is going to be in the next year.\n  Since the Judiciary Committee started holding hearings on Supreme \nCourt nominations in 1916, not a single nominee for a vacancy has been \ndenied a hearing--ever. Even during Presidential election years, the \nSenate has done its job.\n  In 1988, President Reagan's final year in office, Senate Democrats \nconfirmed Justice Kennedy. Three years later, 1991, Justice Thomas was \nconfirmed after the Presidential campaign had begun. Democrats could \nhave said no hearing, no committee work, no vote, no consideration by \nthe full Senate, but that didn't happen. The nominations were processed \nand they were confirmed.\n  So why is it so important that we do our job? Why is an eight-member \nCourt unable to function to the highest and best use of the U.S. \nSupreme Court? Ties in the Supreme Court create uncertainty in the law. \nImportant legal questions go unanswered. The law varies then, \nthroughout the country, and people and businesses often fail to receive \njustice. I wish to review just some of the examples where an incomplete \nCourt was unable to levy justice. There are several examples of the \nimportance of nine Justices, if one looks at recusals over the past few \nyears.\n  No. 1, in 2010, Justice Kagan recused herself from Flores-Villar v. \nUnited States. This case was going to decide whether a United States \ncitizen father must reside in the United States longer than a United \nStates citizen mother in order to confer citizenship to his child born \nabroad. The court deadlocked 4 to 4. The result is a child in one part \nof the United States may be considered a citizen while another in the \nexact same situation in a different judicial circuit may not be a \ncitizen. This issue remains unresolved today.\n  No. 2, in 2000, Justice O'Connor recused herself from Free v. Abbott \nLabs. The court should have determined how many plaintiffs in a Federal \nclass action suit must meet a certain damage threshold for the case to \nproceed in Federal court. Again, the Court deadlocked 4 to 4. Because \nthe case was left undecided, a later Eighth Circuit case--the circuit \ncovering Iowa and other Midwest States--was thrown out. That meant \n30,000 individuals claiming damages from a nearby refinery were denied \njustice in the Federal court; this, even though the company admitted \nreleasing lead and other pollutants into the air. The issue was \nresolved by another Supreme Court case, but it was 5 years later and \nthat was little consolation to families who didn't receive justice in \nFederal court in the interim period.\n  No. 3, in 2007, Chief Justice Roberts recused himself from Warner-\nLambert v. Kent. This case was meant to decide whether individuals can \nsue for injuries caused by defective pharmaceuticals when the drugmaker \nallegedly hid information from Federal regulators. The 4-to-4 tie in \nthat case failed to clarify the law, which still varies across the \ncountry today.\n  Let me give an example. Plaintiffs in the Sixth Circuit are now \nunable to sue for personal injury in this situation, while individuals \nharmed in the same way by the same drug in States covered by the Second \nCircuit are allowed to do so.\n  No. 4, in another case in 2007, New York City Board of Education \nversus Tom F., Justice Kennedy recused himself. The deadlocked Court \nfailed to rule on whether special needs children must first attend \npublic school before they receive tuition reimbursements to attend a \nprivate school better equipped to help them learn. This meant courts in \ndifferent States treated these children differently. The issue was \neventually resolved, 2 years later--2 vital years of schooling that \nchildren may have missed out on.\n  No. 5, in 1987, before Justice Kennedy took his seat, the Court heard \nU.S. v. Carpenter and Winans. The case, which came in advance of that \nyear's stock market crash, involved defendants convicted of securities \nfraud based on allegations they misused information from a Wall Street \nJournal investment advice column. The Supreme Court failed to determine \nwhether the action could be a basis for prosecution. The law was left \nunclear for 10 years, during which time some lower courts overturned \ncriminal convictions for this sort of fraud.\n  These are just a handful of cases that illustrate how an incomplete \nCourt can't fulfill its duty and why the Senate must do its job and \nfairly consider this President's nominee. To leave the Supreme Court in \nthis situation for a year and some months is, in my view, \nunconscionable.\n  So why is it happening? I actually can't come up with any reason to \nrefuse to review Obama's nominee other than politics. The only \nexplanation is that Senate Republicans want to deny this President the \nability to fulfill his constitutional obligations, and this isn't the \nonly evidence of such targeted obstruction. It has been a sustained \ncourse of action for more than a decade now.\n  During the Clinton administration, more than 60 nominees to the \nFederal courts were blocked by a Republican Senate. Many weren't even \ngiven a hearing. A comparison with the final years of President Bush's \nterm is particularly telling. In the 2 final years of the Bush \nPresidency, the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 68 judicial \nnominees. That included 10 confirmations in September of his final year \nin office. So 8 months from now, back in the Bush years, the Democrats \nin control were confirming Bush appointments. So far, over President \nObama's final 2 years, Republicans have allowed confirmation votes on \nonly 16 judicial nominees. Think about that--11 confirmations in \nPresident Obama's second-to-last year versus 10 confirmations just 4 \nmonths before President Bush left the White House. I think the \ninequality here must sink in. People must begin to understand that.\n  The length of the process has also ballooned. Under President Bush, \nthe median number of days between committee and floor votes was 14 \ndays--2 weeks--for circuit court nominees and 19 days--3 weeks--for \ndistrict court nominees.\n  For President Obama, the corresponding length between committee\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nand floor votes for circuit court nominees was 84 days--2\\1/2\\ months--\nand for district court nominees, 98 days. So we see immediately the \ndifference between how the sides are handling judicial appointments of \na President that may have been in the other party.\n  Most of these nominees were eventually confirmed by unanimous or \nnear-unanimous votes. So that shows no need for extended delays. There \nwere no problems with the nominees to deserve extended delays. When \nPresident Bush left office, there were 34 vacancies. That is a vacancy \nrate of 3.9 percent. Today there are more than 81 judicial vacancies, \nnearly 10 percent of all article III judges.\n  Republicans have clearly decided not to do their job, and the \nAmerican justice system is going to suffer for it.\n  One thing I don't like to do or make is anything that can be \ndescribed as a threat, but I will be candid with you because I don't \nthink I am a firebrand. I don't think I am that partisan, but when this \nis done with the Supreme Court, it signals a whole other level of \nmalevolent obstruction. One thing I have learned in my 20 years is what \ngoes around comes around.\n  To do this, to keep this seat vacant for over a year because it is \nthe fourth year of President Obama's term makes no sense at all. As I \nsaid, it is unconscionable. If you don't think an eight-member Court is \na problem, you really don't need to take my word for it. Let's listen \nto the Justices themselves. Justice Scalia, in deciding not to recuse \nhimself from a case in 2004, said the Court would be ``unable to \nresolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.'' He pointed \nto the Court's own recusal policy, which remains in effect today. It \nsays that ``even one unnecessary recusal'' limits the Court's ability \nto function.\n  One can interpret from that that by not doing their job, the \nRepublican side of this aisle is certainly limiting the Court's ability \nto function. I am not sure the other side should want that on their \nshoulders. I am not sure what may come up this next year--the degree to \nwhich justice would be denied in a 4-to-4 Court, but justice would \ncertainly be denied, and it is probably going to happen.\n  Judge Rehnquist said it in 1972--when he warned that a divided Court \n``would lay down one rule in Athens, and another rule in Rome.''\n  So here is the conclusion. A President is elected to a 4-year term--\nboth sides of this aisle know that--but today Republicans are in effect \nsaying that a Democratic President only gets 3 years of judicial \nconfirmations if a Supreme Court vacancy comes before it. That is not \nwhat the Constitution says. All of us swore an oath to fulfill the \nConstitution, and I truly hope my Republican colleagues will stop, will \nthink about this, will think about what will happen next year if this \nPresident is denied this appointment for the remainder of this year and \na judgeship is certainly delayed way past that point. I think to deny \nthis goes against both the spirit and the letter of our duties as \nspelled out in the Constitution of the United States.\n  Once again, I would say, please, Republicans in this House, do your \njob.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am pleased to see that on the floor \nwe continue to make progress on the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act. The legislation before us today, yesterday, and this week \nhas been about how to deal with this growing problem we have around the \ncountry. It is at epidemic levels of heroin and prescription drug \nabuse, addiction, and overdoses.\n  Today, while we are talking about this legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate, we expect over 100 Americans will die--die from overdoses \nof addiction, overdoses of heroin or prescription drugs. This is a \nproblem that doesn't just affect my State of Ohio, although we are one \nof those States that is most severely impacted. It affects every single \nState represented by everyone in this Chamber. That is why, over the \npast few years, you have seen this body together, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, to address the problem.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I have been the coauthors of this effort, but \nso many others have been involved. Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, \nSenator Feinstein--who is on the floor right now--have been supportive \nof the legislation but also improved the legislation with an amendment \nwhich was accepted earlier this week dealing with the international \ndrug cartels. There is an effort in this body to take on this issue, \nnot in a partisan way but in a totally nonpartisan way.\n  Last week I was in Ohio meeting with groups, talking about various \nissues. Every single place I went this issue came up. I was on a plant \ntour, and people talked to me about it. We had a townhall meeting at \nthat factory. At the end of the townhall meeting--after talking about \ntaxes, energy, health care policy, and other issues--I asked for a \nsimple show of hands of how many people have been affected where their \nfamilies or friends have been affected by this new opiate addiction \nissue, heroin and prescription drugs. Half the hands in the room went \nup. They went up because this is something that is tearing at our \nfamilies and our communities. It is devastating so many of our \ncommunities. The cost to the taxpayers is also tremendous.\n  I went to a hospital and what they wanted to talk about was how the \nemergency rooms are being filled with people who are overdosing or \nabusing drugs. I have been to three different hospitals in our State \nthat are doing amazing things to care for those babies who are being \nborn with addictions. There has been a huge increase in my State of \nbabies who were born with an addiction to opiates because of their \nmothers being addicted during the pregnancy. They have to take these \nbabies--some of whom are so small they can fit into the palm of your \nhand--through the withdrawal process. We don't know what the long-term \nconsequences are for many of these babies because this is such a new \nissue, but we know this is something that is tearing at our \ncommunities. It is time to address this issue. There has been a \nrecognition of that, and I am very encouraged by the progress we have \nmade this week on this legislation. I hope we can find a way to get to \nthe final amendments and get the legislation passed because it is \nurgent we deal with this.\n  The House of Representatives has their own legislation. It is also \ncalled CARA--Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. It is bipartisan \nalso. We believe if we can pass this bill with a strong vote--and we \nhad an 89-to-0 vote to get on the bill itself to move to the \nlegislation, which was very encouraging--Senator Whitehouse and I \nbelieve we will get a strong vote in the House as well, and we can get \nit to the President's desk for his signature and begin to reverse this \ntrend.\n  The legislation is something that went through a unique process \naround here, which is bipartisan or even nonpartisan from the start and \na process of bringing in experts from all around the country. Rather \nthan us saying we know all the answers, we are going to write this \nlegislation, we said let's hear from others. Senator Whitehouse and I, \nSenator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar and others held a series of summits \nhere in Washington. We brought in people. Many of us have done this in \nour States as well, but here in Washington alone we had five of these \nconferences in 2014 and 2015. We brought experts in from around the \ncountry, but we also relied on expertise from the administration.\n  In April of 2014, we held a forum on criminal justice and how it is \naffected by this issue and treatment and alternatives to incarceration. \nOne of the things this legislation does is it encourages diversion out \nof the criminal justice system for those who are addicts and gets them \ninto treatment. It was an excellent forum. It featured Michael \nBotticelli. In my view, he has been a very effective Director of the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy. He is called the drug czar. \nThis is within the White House.\n  Michael Botticelli came as a representative of the White House but so \ndid a representative from the Drug Enforcement Agency and gave his \ngreat input.\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\n  In July of 2014, we held another forum. This was on how women are \nimpacted by this drug epidemic, looking at addiction and treatment \nresponses. We talked about pregnant women being addicted and their \nbabies. Again, this forum featured Michael Botticelli, who is Director \nof the White House Office of Drug Control Policy.\n  In December 2014, at the end of the year, we held another forum. This \nwas on the science of addiction and how we can potentially address the \ncollateral consequences of addiction. This forum featured Dr. Nora \nVolkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the Obama \nadministration. It also included the Department of Justice and \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration officials. \nSAMHSA was there. DOJ was there. By the way, again, Director Botticelli \nwas there as well. I appreciate him coming to that forum, which was \nvery helpful to us.\n  Last year, in April of 2015, we held a forum on our youth and how we \ncan better promote drug prevention as well as to develop communities of \nrecovery for those who are suffering from addiction. Prevention and \neducation is a big part of our legislation. Clearly, we need to do a \nbetter job to get people to make the right decisions to avoid getting \ninto the funnel of addiction in the first place. This forum featured \nofficials from the Office of National Drug Control Policy in the Obama \nadministration. It also had officials from the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse.\n  Lastly, in July of 2015, we held a forum on the impact of substance \nabuse and PTSD on our veterans. It focused a lot on the issue of \naddiction and the high rates we see sometimes of mental health and \naddiction coming from some of our returning veterans. This forum \nfeatured one of the giants in this field, GEN Barry McCaffrey. General \nMcCaffrey and I have worked together since his days as Director of the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy in the Clinton administration. \nHe is not just a giant in this field, but he gave us great input as to \nhow to write good legislation to help us with regard to veterans \ncourts, which we have as part of this legislation where veterans can \nget the help they need to get their lives back on track. That forum \nalso featured officials from the Department of Defense, Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n  From all these participants in this process, we received a lot of \ngreat feedback. It helped guide us as we wrote this legislation. In \nfact, we went back and forth with legislative language with all these \nexperts in the Obama administration, as well as experts from around the \ncountry. This legislation is supported by over 130 groups--including \nthose representing people who were in the trenches--providing \ntreatment, providing services on prevention, law enforcement, and \ndoctors. Those who are involved directly in this issue have given us a \nlot of guidance, but that included the expertise of these experts in \nthe Obama administration. I am appreciative for that expertise and for \ntheir support of our efforts.\n  Because it was such an inclusive process, because it was a bipartisan \nprocess, because of the encouragement and the assistance we received \nfrom the drug experts in the Obama administration, when we introduced \nthis bill, we actually said: OK. Here is our final product. After the \nback-and-forth on all the legislative language and with all the \nexperts, this bill received a lot of support immediately on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  As I said earlier, indeed, 130 national anti-drug groups now support \nit in part because they helped write it, in part because some of those \nwho might not have been intimately involved in the process are looking \nat this problem and realizing this is a solution that will really help.\n  We also have dozens of groups from my home State of Ohio that support \nit, in addition to the 130 national groups, from the Fraternal Order of \nPolice to the National Attorneys General Association, to the folks who \nare involved day-to-day in helping to deal with this issue at their \nlocal level.\n  I believe it was the day before yesterday that we received a \nStatement of Administration Policy from the political officials at the \nWhite House on the CARA bill, and I have talked about how the \nadministration and their experts have been so helpful, but despite all \nthe work they have done to support this bill, the White House did not \nissue a Statement of Administration Policy that supported the \nlegislation. It didn't oppose the legislation, but instead it said that \nthe drug epidemic would not be greatly affected by this legislation \nunless there was substantial new funding provided. This is kind of \nincredible given that this is the legislation we all worked on \ntogether. I know there is a difference between the political folks at \nthe White House and the people who actually know the issue and are \nexperts on the issue, but I hope we can get a strong statement of \nadministration support for a bill that was drafted with them on a \nbipartisan basis with myself, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Klobuchar, \nand others, but we will see.\n  I support additional funding over and above the $80 million of new \nfunding that CARA provides for, and not just for this year but for next \nyear and the year after that and the year after that. It is an \nauthorization bill that is extremely important. I supported the Shaheen \namendment yesterday, but it is factually wrong to say, as some of my \ncolleagues have claimed and the White House seems to be saying, that \nthere is not funding for these CARA programs. In fact, we have already \nappropriated, as my colleagues know, significantly more spending for \nthis opioid problem for this fiscal year that we are in. Not a penny of \nthat has been spent yet, by the way--over $120 million of additional \nspending. That $120 million of additional spending is targeted on ways \nto spend the money more wisely through CARA because we worked with the \nappropriators and the Judiciary Committee to ensure that was the case.\n  Again, having said that, I would have loved to have seen more funding \nover and beyond that provided by an amendment that was offered by my \ncolleague Senator Shaheen yesterday because I think that would have \nhelped even more, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't strongly support \nthe underlying CARA bill. In fact, my colleagues who endorsed it and \nvoted with us, as well as my coauthor Senator Whitehouse and others, \nagree with that because this bipartisan bill ensures that more Federal \nresources will be devoted to evidence-based education, treatment, and \nrecovery programs that we know actually work. It is not just throwing \nmoney at the problem. This is actually legislation that we know works \nto address the problem based on all the background I just mentioned \nabout getting all the expertise.\n  Again, these groups out there that are in the trenches every day \nworking on this issue are the ones who will tell you why it is going to \nwork, but what they will say is it is going to help these young mothers \nbattling addiction. It will help those veterans who return home from \nduty and desperately need our help. It will help young people make the \nright decision. It will help that teenager struggling with drug abuse. \nIt will help in terms of dealing with this problem we have right now \nwhere people can't get treatment because there is not enough access to \ntreatment. It will help in terms of ensuring that we get prescription \ndrugs off the bathroom shelves so they are not being used to get people \naddicted to opioids and then move on to heroin. It will be helpful to \nensure that we have a drug monitoring program nationally so we know who \nis being overprescribed and who is not. These are changes in law that \nare part of this legislation.\n  Again, I thank the experts in the Obama administration who deal with \nthis issue every day and strongly support CARA. On January 27, 2016--so \nat the end of January this year--the Judiciary Committee held a hearing \non our bill. I was able to testify, as well as others, including \nexperts. Here is what some of the leading administration experts said. \nFirst, Michael Botticelli--again, a guy who I think has been a very \neffective Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the \nWhite House--said:\n\n       There is clear evidence that a comprehensive response \n     looking at multidimensional aspects of this that are embedded \n     in the CARA Act are tremendously important. We know we need \n     to do more, and I think that all of those components put \n     forward in the bill are critically important to make headway \n     in terms of this epidemic.\n\n  Again, that was the Director of ONDCP.\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\n  Dr. Nora Volkow, the Director of the administration's National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse, and a real expert, said:\n\n       We support the comprehensive program delineated, and it is \n     one of the strategies to address the problem.\n\n  Here is Ms. Kana Enomoto. She is the Acting Administrator of SAMSHA, \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. She \nsaid:\n\n       At SAMSHA we are so excited to be able to implement \n     programs like medication-assisted treatment, prescription \n     drug and opioid addiction, which Congress appropriated in \n     2015 and then another increase in 2016, which is very similar \n     to some of the programs that were described in the CARA Act. \n     Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, for your leadership on this \n     issue and continued support of our mission. We believe that \n     the public health approach of the CARA Act is vitally \n     important to moving forward on this issue.\n\n  The next statement I have is by Mr. Milione. He is the Deputy \nAssistant Administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration Office \nof Diversion Control. He said:\n\n       I am happy to work with you or anyone on any legislation \n     that will help with this epidemic.\n\n  Again, I am thankful for these experts in the Obama administration \nwho have put politics aside to work to support CARA. They helped us to \ncome up with better legislation, and they support it because they know \nit will help support education and prevention so we can stop drug abuse \nbefore it begins. They support CARA because they know it will help with \ntreatment and recovery and will help to reduce overdoses which will \nhelp to save lives. They support CARA because they know it will help \nour veterans as well as women and babies who are suffering from \naddiction. They also support CARA because they know there are more than \n130 national groups out there that understand the importance of this \nbill and support it, including the National Association of Addiction \nTreatment Providers, Faces and Voices of Recovery, Children's Health, \nChildren's Hospital Association, the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, \nFraternal Order of Police--again, I thank our law enforcement for \nstepping up on this--the National District Attorneys Association, and \nthe Major Counties Sheriff's Association.\n  I understand that some folks in Washington like to play politics with \neverything around here, but politics has never been a part of this \nbill. It has been inclusive from the start and it has been bipartisan \nfrom the start. We are here to help those suffering from addiction and \nto save lives, and that is exactly what this measure will do. Let's get \non with it and pass this legislation so we can get it to the \nPresident's desk for signature and it can begin to help.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to call up Manchin amendment No. 3420; that at 1:45 p.m. today \nthe Senate vote in relation to the Manchin amendment No. 3420; and that \nthere be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, last Thursday I was on the floor \nhonoring the victims of the mass shooting in Kalamazoo, MI, another \nshooting spree that left six people dead and two others injured, and on \nthat very same day another shooting spree broke out in Kansas that \nforever changed another town--another community in this country like \nthe change that has overcome Sandy Hook, CT, since that fateful day in \nDecember of 2012.\n  This was a shooting spree in Kansas that spanned several miles in \nnearly 30 minutes. Three people were killed. It could have been a lot \nmore. Fourteen were wounded. The shooting spree took place in two \nlocations as well as the Kansas workplace.\n  The gunman had multiple felony convictions which prohibited him from \nbuying a firearm, but he used his former girlfriend as a straw \npurchaser to buy yet another military-style semiautomatic weapon that \nhe used in the shootings. It sounds a lot like many of the other \nshootings I talked about on the floor.\n  As has been the case, I try to come down to the floor, seemingly \nevery week, to tell the stories of who these victims are because the \nnumbers don't seem to be moving my colleagues--31,000 a year, 2,600 a \nmonth, and 86 a day are being killed by guns in this country. My hope \nis that by learning who these people are and learning the ripples of \ntragedy that unfold after a family member is killed by guns, that maybe \nthat psychology and connection to the emotion of these shootings will \nmove my colleagues to do something--anything at this point--to address \nthis epidemic.\n  Brian Sadowsky was 44 years old when he was killed in the shooting. \nHe was one of three people who were killed at their workplace, Excel \nIndustries, in Hesston, KS. Brian was remembered by his coworkers as a \nvery outgoing guy who was always telling jokes, always fun to be \naround, and had a biting sense of humor. He rabidly rooted for the \nPittsburgh Steelers. He wore Pittsburgh Steelers paraphernalia and gear \nto work almost every day. He would drop whatever he was doing in order \nto help his friends who were in need.\n  A friend of Brian's remembered him as being ``a little rough around \nthe edges'' at times, but he was the kind soul who was ``always there \nto help. He was a big teddy bear once you got to know him.''\n  His friends said he was a recovering addict who was clean and sober \nfor many years and was instrumental in helping a lot of others overcome \naddiction.\n  Renee Benjamin was 30 years old when she was killed. Her friend \nremembered her by saying that ``she's smart, she's beautiful. She was \ndedicated to Excel. She loved that job. She loved the people. I \nremember the way she loved people.''\n  ``If you ever saw someone smile from the inside out, she was an \ninside out person,'' one of her friends remembered.\n  Another friend said:\n\n       She is a person who always gave her all into whatever she \n     did and whoever she loved. She was so smart, but shy about \n     it. She was so funny, so beautiful, inside and out. She was \n     my best friend. We shared everything. We shared a life. . . . \n     All she wanted was to love and be loved.\n\n  Josh Higbee was just a year older. He was 31. People who knew Josh \nsaid he was a loving, hard-working man. He loved to fish and spend time \nwith his fiance and his 4-year-old son. His older brother said that \nJosh was `` `Mr. Fix-It.' He loved tractors and toy cars, anything \nautomotive. He was a car guy. He liked to work with his hands.''\n  His sister-in-law said that Josh was ``taught to be a very loving, \nkind man. He has a son that he adores, takes care of. . . . Josh would \ngive you the shirt off his back and worked long, hard hours to take \ncare of his family.''\n  We pay a lot of attention to these victims of mass shootings because \nthey tend to make the news. We see them on TV, but every single day \nthere are 86 people who are being killed by guns. A lot of them are \nsuicides, but many of them are homicides. It is happening all across \nthis country, and not all of them make the national news.\n  Andre Lamont O'Neal, Jr., died earlier this year in Louisville, KY. \nAndre was 8 years old and his babysitter was grilling and also had a \ngun in his pocket. He had slippery fingers, and when he attempted to \nremove the gun from his pocket, it accidentally fired. It struck \nAndre's arm and chest. His babysitter panicked and apparently put Andre \nin a car and took him to a nearby hospital, but it was too late.\n  Andre's father, as you can imagine, was overwhelmed. He was ``a good \nlittle boy,'' he told reporters.\n  A few weeks later, Nicholas Hawkins, 19 years old and from Winfield, \nAL, told his mother that someone was trying to kill him. That was the \nlast time anybody heard from Nicholas. Four days later his body was \nfound shot to death.\n  He left high school because of bullying and was only 2 weeks away \nfrom completing his GED. He intended to go into cosmetology or a \nrelated field. He loved to dance, sing, write music, and play guitar. \nHe was good with hair and makeup and described as very funny, quirky, \nand had a bubbly personality. His friends said he often stole the show.\n  Every day 86 people die in this country. You don't hear about all of \nthem because this has just kind of become the wallpaper of American \nnews.\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nShootings have become routine. This doesn't happen anywhere else in the \nworld, and I just want to finish by talking a little bit about this \nunfortunate, tragic American exceptionalism.\n  America has 4.4 percent of the world's population, but we have 42 \npercent of the civilian-owned guns in the world. We have 4 percent of \nthe population, but nearly half of all of the guns are in this country. \nIt used to be that about half of Americans own guns. Today only about \none-third of Americans own guns, but a small number of Americans own a \nlot of weapons. There are more high-powered guns, like the one that was \nused in Kansas, than ever before.\n  Why does this matter? Well, it is because the United States also has \nmore gun deaths than any other nation in the developed world, and it is \nnot even close. This chart shows the figures of homicides by firearm \nper 1 million people. Australia, New Zealand, and Germany have less \nthan two. Switzerland gets all the way up to 7.7. In the United States \nit is 29.7. There is no other country in the world that comes close to \nthe United States when it comes to the number of homicides in this \ncountry. This isn't aggregate numbers. This is per 1 million people.\n\n  The reason I show you these two charts is that when you put it \ntogether, it tells a pretty interesting and simple story. Here is the \nchart correlating guns per 100,000 people and gun-related deaths per \n100,000 people. Here is the line of correlation. It is a pretty simple \nstory.\n  With a handful of outliers such as Argentina and Cyprus, the story is \nthat the more guns you have in a country, the more gun homicides are \ngoing to occur. Here is the United States on the line, but it is an \noutlier in terms of the number of guns and the number of deaths--simply \nan extrapolation of a story that all of our other first world \ncompetitors could tell by themselves. This rebuts this ridiculous \nmythology by the gun industry, which tells us that if you have more \nguns, you are going to be safer. The solution in Sandy Hook was just \nthat the Sandy Hook Elementary School didn't have enough firearms. If \nall the teachers had had weapons, that shooter would have been killed, \nand the best way to stop a shooter from attacking you is to arm \nyourself. That is not what the evidence tells us. The evidence tells \nus: The more guns there are in a community, the more people get killed.\n  I will show at another time this same chart on a State-by-State \nbasis, and it will tell you the exact same story. A State that has more \nfirearms has more gun homicides. You are more likely to be the victim \nof gun violence if you have a gun in your house than if you don't have \na gun in your house.\n  Now, the Second Amendment is an incredibly important, vital, integral \npiece of the fabric of the U.S. Constitution, and I honor people's \ndecisions to buy a weapon in order to protect themselves. Some people \nlive in violent places. Some people live in very isolated places, and \nthey have made that choice, and that is theirs to make. Of course, \nthere are millions of Americans who own weapons in order to hunt, in \norder to shoot for sport, a pastime they enjoy and have the right to. \nBut they should purchase those weapons with the understanding that \nthere is no data that tells them they are safer with a weapon in their \narm, no data that suggests that the more guns you have in a particular \nplace, the less likely there are to be homicides and gun deaths. It is \nexactly the opposite.\n  Every single day there are 86 people who are killed in this country \nfrom guns, 2,600 a month, 31,000 a year--another mass shooting in \nKansas, another one in Kalamazoo. My entire point is just to say that \nat some point we have to recognize that our silence has become \ncomplicity in these murders. If we are not willing to forge political \nconsensus in this session on legislation that changes gun laws, then at \nleast let's make a commitment to fix our mental health system to make \nsure law enforcement has the resources they need, to make sure we make \nstraw purchasing illegal so the method by which the shooter in Kansas \ngot the gun has consequences at the Federal level, potentially, as well \nas at the State level. Let us do something to honor the thousands of \nvoices of victims that mount by the day.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                               Mahan Air\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I begin by calling attention to a \nprivate Iranian airline, designated by the U.S. Department of Treasury \nfor its support for terrorism and funneling of weapons to Hezbollah and \nto the Assad regime in Syria. This airline continues to operate and \neven expand its international business network, despite tough words \nfrom the administration. But this kind of tough language is \ninsufficient.\n  The time to impose sanctions on Mahan Air is now. The time to impose \nsanctions on Mahan Air is clearly now. I have called on the \nadministration in a letter, which I helped to lead and on which I am \njoined by a number of my colleagues, in late February--February 29--to \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. Sanctions might be forthcoming against \nthis airline if this body were to approve Adam Szubin to be Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, but so far we have \nfailed to do so. His confirmation has been blocked. I regret it. \nWhether or not he is confirmed, sanctions should be imposed on this \nairline. Mahan Air relies on a host of local partners who provide \nfinancial and other services for it to maintain this robust \ninternational flight network.\n  So taking this action against Mahan Air will not only send a signal, \nit will end actions by Mahan Air that are against international law and \nsupport terrorism and the funneling of weapons to some terrorist groups \nthat can do harm to the United States as well as to our allies and \npartners abroad.\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk about the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act. Hopefully, we will vote today in support of it. It is \na great bipartisan bill. I am privileged to have worked on it as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. I thank all of the members of that \ncommittee and others, most especially Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nLeahy, for incorporating provisions that I have helped to offer in this \nbill.\n  We heard from our colleagues around the country about the public \nhealth crisis that we face today. It is more than a crisis. It is a \nhurricane--almost like a public health hurricane--a natural disaster \nthat requires us to act now. Abuse and addiction are crippling our \ncommunities, shattering our families, carrying enormous financial and \nhuman costs. The overdose deaths have steadily increased. They now \nsurpass automobile accidents as the leading cause of injury-related \ndeaths for Americans between the age of 25 and 64.\n  The United States consumes over 80 percent of prescription opioids, \neven though we make up only 4.6 percent of the world's population. In \nConnecticut, I have held roundtables across our State, and I hear again \nand again the tragic stories of young people who begin taking powerful \npainkillers when they break a leg or a wrist in a sports injury or when \nthey have wisdom teeth removed and they receive a prescription for 30 \ndays. They only need 3 days' worth of painkillers, if they need them at \nall. But the overprescription and the abuse that results from it often \nleads to addiction.\n  The gateway to addiction is these powerful painkillers that provide \nthe beginnings of the problem. One university counselor wrote to me \nrecently:\n\n       When I first began this position 14 years ago, it was \n     extremely uncommon to be working with a student who abused a \n     substance besides alcohol. Today, I have a recovery house and \n     a program full of students battling addiction from \n     [prescription opioids].\n\n  I have heard from mothers and families, from teachers and counselors \nwho have struggled to find quality substance abuse treatment programs \nand behavioral health services for their loved ones. One mother wrote \nto me about her two sons. Some 8 years ago, her oldest son died from a \nheroin overdose after a prescription program released him early. Her \nyounger son continues to struggle with addiction but was recently told \nby his insurance company that he lacked a long enough history of \nsubstance abuse to qualify for inpatient treatment.\n  We must address these problems, and the solution is multifaceted. \nSupporting law enforcement is part of the solution, with resources and \nwith other measures that will enable interdiction\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\nof the supplies of heroin and cracking down on the illicit supplies of \npainkillers. But law enforcement has told me, as a former colleague, \nthat we are not going to arrest our way out of this problem. The jails \nand prisons alone do not provide a solution.\n  There is a need for more treatment and services. I hear that point \nagain and again and again, but that source of solution alone will not \nbe the panacea. There is no one solution. Education for our doctors and \nproviders and prescribers is part of what is needed. Again, alone, no \nsingle solution is sufficient.\n  I want to thank the bill sponsors for incorporating the provision \nthat I wrote with Senator Coats, the Expanding Access to Prescription \nDrug Monitoring Programs Act. This provision would allow nurse \npractitioners and physician assistants to access the information they \nneed. Specifically, they would be able to access State prescription \ndrug monitoring programs to consult a patient's prescription opioid \nhistory and determine if that patient has a history of addiction or is \nreceiving multiple prescriptions from multiple sources. It is critical \nthat we recognize the key role that nurse practitioners and physician \nassistants play in curbing prescription drug abuse and diversion.\n  I propose a number of amendments that attack other elements of this \nproblem. I am going to continue to advocate for them, whether they are \nin the final package or not--and some of them may well be. I will \ncontinue the effort to make them real and adopt them as law, whether or \nnot they are included in this measure.\n  Over and again, we have heard that many struggling with addiction \nstart by abusing those prescription drugs after receiving a legitimate \nprescription. That is why Senator Markey and I have submitted amendment \nNo. 3382, which would cut down on overprescribing opioids by requiring \nproviders, when they apply for a license from the DEA to prescribe \nthese controlled substances, to first complete education programs so \nthey are encouraged to adopt responsible prescribing practices. Those \npractices can be as simple as keeping track and scrutinizing the use of \nthese painkillers. Every licensee, every provider, every nurse \npractitioner, everyone writing out a slip of paper that enables \nsomebody to purchase these powerful prescription painkillers would have \nto take a course and complete this training.\n  In Blumenthal amendment No. 3327, a separate measure that I am \nproposing as ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, there \nwould be better access to naloxone, known as Narcan, by veterans. We \nhave seen how naloxone or Narcan is a lifesaver. It can bring people \nback from the brink of death. There should be more of it. It should be \nmore available to our police, firefighters, and first responders on the \nstreets of Connecticut and in neighborhoods and communities across the \ncountry. It is insufficiently available. It has skyrocketed in price, \nand there have been shortages. But I have seen how the opioid epidemic \nhas affected, particularly, our veterans, and often, again, with \noverprescriptions in certain parts of the country.\n  We have moved to address that problem. In Wisconsin, for example, and \nwith the great help of Senator Baldwin, my colleague on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, we have worked to craft legislation that will help \ncontain and cut that abusive prescription of opioids. I believe that \nthis measure will give information to veterans and the tools they need \nalso to prevent deaths in case of an overdose.\n\n  Much of the work of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is focused on the \nopioid epidemic and the Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act we \nare working to pass into law. But safe prescribing of opioids is vital \nbecause many veterans, even when legitimately prescribed, have serious \npain issues that can lead to abuse once those issues are addressed.\n  So I have filed this amendment that would eliminate the requirement \nthat veterans pay a copay for naloxone kits and for education for \nproviders as to how to use them. In other words, the providers will \nprovide education, along with providing the prescriptions, as to how to \nuse the Narcan kits that veterans could receive without any copay. \nNaloxone is necessary for those first responders, and the underlying \nbill includes provisions that would help to provide it, but this \nmeasure would focus particularly on veterans, where the need is great \nand growing greater.\n  I wish to point out that the cost of this measure would be less than \n$100,000 per year. The savings in dollars long term would vastly exceed \nthat amount, and the savings in lives more than justifies this, even \nwithout the savings in dollars. We are talking here about the ability \nto save veterans' lives. We have an obligation to leave no veteran \nbehind, to keep faith with our veterans, and to make sure that a \nminimum amount of spending will enable the saving of lives.\n  I appreciate again the work of my colleagues in crafting this bill. I \nhope we will move forward in passing it and that the amendments I have \nsuggested will be adopted to strengthen it even further.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Roberta Jacobson\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it has now been 7 months since the United \nStates has had an Ambassador to Mexico. As we all know, Mexico is our \nthird largest trading partner. Bilateral trade totals more than half a \ntrillion dollars. There is more than $1 billion in two-way trader \nexchanges between the United States and Mexico every day.\n  The border States obviously enjoy a close relationship and robust \ntrade with Mexico. My home State of Arizona exports about $9.2 billion \nin goods every year. Arizona has expanded its trade relationship with \nMexico by reopening a trade office in Mexico City. Mexico has \nreciprocated by opening an office in Arizona. Yet, for more than half \nof the year, we have not had a representative in place with the Mexican \nGovernment to deal with issues of mutual cooperation, issues of \nimportance and concern.\n  The bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico is \nnot the only issue of importance, obviously, between our two countries. \nTransportation issues, security threats, national resource management, \nand environmental issues are just a few of the fronts on which we can \ncooperate with Mexico, and such cooperation requires a close \npartnership between our countries. The longer we go without an \nAmbassador there, the more this partnership will suffer.\n  The relationship between the United States and Mexico has \nhistorically been important, and previous administrations have \nacknowledged this by appointing top-notch candidates to serve as our \nenvoy to Mexico. The current nominee to serve in Mexico is no exception \nto this historical trend. As a career member of the Senior Executive \nService, Roberta Jacobson has spent more than three decades working on \nLatin American policy for Presidents on both sides of the aisle. She is \nobviously fluent in Spanish. She has earned the respect of her \ncolleagues. I can attest to her professionalism and her experience. She \nwas reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee by a vote of 12 to \n7 in November; yet the post with Mexico City remains open 3 months \nlater.\n  Our relationship with Mexico is far too important to let this post go \nvacant any longer, particularly when we have a qualified candidate who \nhas been vetted by the Foreign Relations Committee and reported to the \nSenate with a majority of its members. I urge the Senate to take up \nthis matter expeditiously.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3420 to Amendment No. 3378\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3420.\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Manchin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3420 to amendment No. 3378.\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strengthen consumer education about the risks of opioid \n                          abuse and addiction)\n\n       On page 14, line 10, insert ``consumers,'' after \n     ``patients,''.\n       On page 14, line 12, strike ``prescribed.'' and insert \n     ``prescribed, including opioid and methadone abuse. Such \n     education and awareness campaigns shall include information \n     on the dangers of opioid abuse, how to prevent opioid abuse \n     including through safe disposal of prescription medications \n     and other safety precautions, and detection of early warning \n     signs of addiction.''.\n       On page 16, line 22, strike ``or''.\n       On page 17, line 2, insert ``or'' at the end.\n       On page 17, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(C) a sudden increase in opioid-related deaths, as \n     documented by local data;\n       On page 18, line 23, strike ``1997.'' and insert ``1997, \n     and may also include an evaluation of the effectiveness at \n     reducing abuse of opioids, methadone, or methamphetamines.''.\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of my amendment No. 3420 to the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act of 2015.\n  As my colleagues know, our country is facing a prescription drug \nepidemic. Every one of our States--all 50--is having a horrific \nproblem. The CARA Act that we are working on and are about to pass is a \ngood start to addressing this crisis, which is why I am a proud \ncosponsor.\n  My amendment simply does what you would think common sense would \nalready entail. My amendment improves the bill by helping those on the \nfrontlines of this terrible epidemic provide their communities with the \ninformation they need to help stop the spread of opioid addiction and \nhelp seek treatment.\n  It will better enable us to educate individuals about the dangers of \nopioid abuse, practices to help prevent opioid abuse, including the \nsafe disposal of unused medication, and how to detect the early warning \nsigns of addiction.\n  This amendment will help to save lives by raising awareness about the \ndangers of prescription opioid medications to prevent opiate addiction \nin the first place and ensuring that loved ones will know how to help \nwhen a friend or family member becomes addicted.\n  We have over 2 million Americans who are addicted to opioids. Many of \nthese individuals began the road to addiction with a seemingly innocent \nprescription and little or no warning about the dangers from their \nphysicians. Or it began when a friend offered a pill that they thought \ncouldn't be that dangerous because it was prescribed by their doctor.\n\n  There is simply too little understanding about the dangers of these \ndrugs. Too many people get sucked into opioid addiction because they \ndon't understand the risks. Likewise, the people close to them don't \nrecognize the signs of addiction or know how to access the resources to \nhelp their loved ones.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank Senator Murray, Senator Alexander, Senator \nGrassley, and all the people who have helped me in considering this \nbipartisan amendment with a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  If we want to stop opioid addiction, we ought to start by preventing \nit. Preventing it starts with information and education that people do \nnot have today. This helps every one of us in all parts of this great \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), the \nSenator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Toomey).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) \nwould have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 365; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Rubio, from \nthe great State of Florida, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Roberta Jacobson\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, my good friend, Senator Jeff Flake from \nArizona, appeared here just an hour or so before and also spoke on the \nissue that I am going to speak about today. That issue is the \nambassadorship to Mexico and the woman who has been nominated by \nPresident Obama, Roberta Jacobson. Senator Flake made a very strong \ncase. It has been a pleasure working with him in a bipartisan way. We \nbelieve this nomination has very strong bipartisan support, and we look \nforward to working together to get this to the floor and get an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  So I rise again today to urge support for Roberta Jacobson. She is a \ndedicated public servant. She is more than ready to be our Ambassador \nto Mexico. The Los Angeles Times has called Roberta Jacobson ``among \nthe most qualified people ever to be tapped to represent the U.S. in \nMexico.''\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\n  We have a distinguished candidate, a career member of the Senior \nExecutive Service. She is ready to serve. We have strong support for \nher on both sides of the aisle. What we need now is an up-or-down vote. \nOnce again, we failed to get one.\n  It is hard to explain this dysfunction when I talk to my constituents \nin New Mexico. They just don't understand this kind of dysfunction. \nThey don't understand it, and, frankly, neither do I. We are a border \nState. This is a critical position. It is critical to our security, and \nit is critical to our economy.\n  Earlier today, Senators Flake, Klobuchar, Heinrich, and I met with \nthe Hispanic Chamber of Commerce about the urgent need to confirm this \nnomination. Our business leaders in New Mexico, Arizona, and every \nother State in our country are telling us they need an ambassador in \nMexico City. We have ongoing border-related business issues that need \nattention. From time to time, we will call on the Mexican government to \ntake some action, to work with us on coordinating with ports of entry, \ninfrastructure, and other important issues. We are at a disadvantage \nwithout an advocate for America in Mexico City. It is very frustrating.\n  This is not the first time we have faced this kind of dysfunction. I \npushed for reform of the Senate rules in the last two Congresses, and \nwe did change the rules to allow majority votes for executive and \njudicial nominees to the lower courts. But that does no good if they \nremain blocked, and that is what is happening in this Congress. The \nline gets longer and longer of perfectly qualified nominees who are \ndenied a vote, denied an opportunity to be heard.\n  Roberta Jacobson was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee months ago with bipartisan support. Yet the weeks go by, and \nstill we wait. What is holding up her nomination? It isn't her \nqualifications; those aren't the problem. A big part of the problem is \nPresidential politics and the policy differences with the \nadministration over her work with Cuba.\n  This year, we reopened diplomatic relations between the United States \nand Cuba. As the Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, \nRoberta helped negotiate on behalf of the administration. After 50 \nyears of failed policy toward Cuba, we have opened a 21st-century \nrelationship with the people of Cuba, one that is already seeing change \nas more Cubans enter the private sector. And more Americans, who are \nour best diplomats, continue to increase their engagement with the \nCuban people. I congratulate the President for leading this historic \nchange. Some disagree. I understand that. But their objection is with \nthe President's Cuba policy. We are talking here about Mexico and an \nimportant position that has been unfilled since last summer because a \nfew Senators would rather return to the failed policies of yesterday \nand are using Roberta to make a political point.\n\n\n                             Fair Elections\n\n  Mr. President, just when we think things can't get any worse, they \ndo. Now a seat on the Supreme Court is empty, and the majority leader \nis actually arguing that it should stay empty for over a year, no \nmatter who is nominated by the President. This isn't governing; this is \na failure to do one's job.\n  Is it any wonder that the American people are frustrated, fed up with \npolitical games, with obstruction in the Senate, with special deals for \ninsiders, and with campaigns that are being sold to the highest bidder? \nThey see this obstruction as just another example of how our democracy \nis being taken away from the people.\n  Each year we have a Student Leadership Institute in my State. High \nschool juniors and seniors attend to learn about and discuss the \nchallenges affecting our State and the Nation. I always look forward to \nmeeting with these bright, young people. They are smart and committed, \nand they raise thoughtful points about how government works and how \nsometimes it doesn't work. One thing we talked about this year was how \nimportant it is to listen. This is one of the most underrated virtues, \nespecially in politics--stating your views but also listening to the \nviews of others. I am always optimistic when I see students engaged in \nthat process. I only wish we could see more of it in Washington.\n  The art of politics is standing your ground, but also finding common \nground and listening to the American people. Our democracy depends on \nevery voice being heard and on every vote being counted. We are losing \nthat. We have to get it back or we will continue to pay a heavy price. \nWe can be sure of one thing: Beyond all the money, beyond all the \nspecial interests, these students and all Americans deserve to be \nheard, and they deserve a democracy that works.\n  Campaigns should be about the best ideas, not the biggest checkbooks \nor rigged districts. The U.S. Supreme Court created a Wild West of \ncampaign finance regulations with their decision in Citizens United and \ntheir 2014 McCutcheon decision. It opened a fire sale of super PACs \ntrying to buy elections nationwide. We are seeing the results--from the \nIowa caucuses to local elections in Las Cruces, NM.\n  We need to overturn those bad decisions. That is why I have led \nefforts to amend the Constitution to restore power to Congress and to \nthe States to pass commonsense campaign finance laws. We need to listen \nto the voters, not to the billionaires hiding in dark corners. That is \nwhy earlier this week I introduced legislation to abolish the broken \nFederal Election Commission.\n  Congress created the Federal Election Commission to fight political \ncorruption when they created it after Watergate. But today, partisan \ngridlock leaves the agency powerless and dysfunctional. It even fails \nto enforce the few campaign finance laws remaining on the books. The \nFederal Election Administration Act would create a new agency, with \nfive members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. A \nchair would lead the agency, and the remaining members would equally \nrepresent both political parties. It is modeled after a bipartisan \nproposal previously introduced by Senator John McCain and former \nSenator Russ Feingold.\n  Super Tuesday was just 2 days ago. Once again, we are seeing record \nspending, including millions of dollars in undisclosed dark money. \nWithout a strong watchdog looking over their shoulders, super PACs and \nbillionaire donors have free rein to push the limits.\n  It is clear that the FEC has outlived its usefulness. We need a new \nagency, one with the power and the will to crack down on campaign \nfinance violations.\n  The Supreme Court has put billionaires and other special interests on \na galloping horse. They are running away with our democracy--running \naway with our elections. We have created a dark money, special \ninterest, gerrymandered train wreck, and the losers are the American \npeople. That is why I have also introduced the Fairness and \nIndependence in Redistricting Act, because part of that train wreck is \nthe secretive and highly partisan congressional redistricting process, \nand we need to end it.\n  The President highlighted this issue in his State of the Union \naddress, saying, ``We've got to end the practice of drawing our \ncongressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and \nnot the other way around.'' In most States today, congressional maps \nare drawn behind closed doors by partisan lawmakers. Their aim is to \nkeep incumbents in office, and they do that. Pick almost any district \nin the country, and we will see that almost every one is skewed to \nfavor one party or another.\n  We can end the gerrymandering status quo. Redistricting commissions \nshould be independent. They should be led by citizens, not politicians. \nArizona and California voted for reform, and they are already bringing \nnew faces to Congress. The American people deserve fair elections--\nelections that are free of unlimited and hidden special interest money \nand free of rigged district lines.\n  Next year, I will meet again with students in my State. We will talk \nabout leadership, about challenges, and about how government works. I \nhope I will be able to say to them that we have moved forward; we have \nreformed a broken system. I hope I can say to them that we have done \nour job and made sure that voters, not powerful elites, have their say.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment \nNo. 3391 to the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015. I am \nproud to join Senator Daines in filing this important amendment.\n  The Daines-Peters amendment would make it possible for certain \ndishonorably discharged veterans to be eligible for veterans treatment \ncourts. Specifically, the amendment would allow the Attorney General to \ndetermine veterans treatment court eligibility on a case-by-case basis \nfor dishonorably discharged veterans who have been diagnosed with \nservice-connected post-traumatic stress disorder, military sexual \ntrauma, or traumatic brain injuries.\n  Currently, veterans treatment courts are open to any veteran with a \ndischarge other than dishonorable or a dishonorable discharge that can \nbe attributed to substance abuse. However, studies have shown a direct \nconnection to PTSD, TBI, and MST are a leading cause of substance abuse \ndisorder. In general, drug courts reduce correctional costs, protect \ncommunity safety, and improve public welfare. Veterans treatment courts \ntake the work of drug courts one step further.\n\n  According to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, \nveterans treatment courts bring the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \nhealth care networks, the Veterans Benefits Administration, the State \ndepartments of veterans affairs, volunteer veteran mentors and veterans \nfamily support organizations together in one place in order to provide \nsupport for veterans. These are resources that speak to the unique \nneeds of this Nation's veterans.\n  In my home State of Michigan, Judge Michelle Friedman Appel's \nveterans treatment court in Oak Park is the site of weekly \naccountability, encouragement, and rehabilitation, and I commend her \nwork.\n  Our veterans treatment court judges are committed to the well-being \nof this Nation's veterans, connecting them to services they need to \nreach their full potential. Servicemembers suffering from the invisible \nwounds of war who are discharged, regardless of the characterization of \nthat discharge, truly need the assistance provided by veterans \ntreatment courts. That is why the Daines-Peters amendment is so \nimportant. Former servicemembers, particularly those suffering from \nPTSD, TBI, and MST should have access to veterans treatment centers and \ncourts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Daines-Peters amendment No. 3391.\n\n\n                       Fairness For Veterans Act\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to stay on the subject of veterans for a moment \nlonger. Behavioral changes are often seen in individuals suffering from \nmental traumas, such as PTSD and traumatic brain injury, or TBI. \nUnfortunately, those individuals will often receive a less-than-\nhonorable discharge, also known as a bad paper discharge rather than an \nhonorable discharge. This discharge status makes veterans ineligible \nfor certain benefits, including GI benefits and VA home loans. This is \nsimply unacceptable, and we need to make a change. Our Nation's heroes \nwho honorably serve their country deserve access to the care and \nbenefits they have earned, and that is why I introduced the Fairness \nfor Veterans Act, which will help these veterans.\n  The Fairness for Veterans Act will create a presumption in favor of \nthe veteran with a bad paper discharge when petitioning the Secretary \nof Defense for an upgrade in discharge status based on hard medical \nevidence that is certified by the VA or appropriate medical \nprofessional. This bill has the support of both parties in both \nChambers.\n  I introduced the Fairness for Veterans Act with my Republican \ncolleagues, Steve Daines from Montana and Thom Tillis from North \nCarolina. I appreciate the many Senators who have cosponsored the bill \nsince its introduction, particularly Senator Gillibrand, who has been a \nchampion for the bill on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Today, in the House of Representatives, Mike Coffman, a Republican \nfrom Colorado; Tim Walz, a Democrat from Minnesota; Lee Zeldin, a \nRepublican from New York; and Kathleen Rice, a Democrat from New York, \nled a number of Members introducing the bipartisan bill.\n  This legislation is also supported by a number of veterans groups, \nincluding Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign \nWars, Disabled Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the American Legion, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Vietnam \nVeterans of America, the Veterans Health Council, United Soldiers and \nSailors of America, and the Military-Veterans Advocacy, Inc.\n  Improperly discharged servicemembers should not lose access to the \nbenefits they have earned through their service. That is why we must \nensure they are getting the fairness they deserve when petitioning for \nan upgraded discharge status. This is a nonpartisan issue, and I am \ncommitted to fighting on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the bill we are debating today is an \nimportant step forward in helping to combat addiction and opioid abuse.\n  According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, 20 percent of \nveterans with PTSD also have a substance abuse disorder. Let me repeat \nthat statistic. In our country, 20 percent of veterans, or one in five, \nwith PTSD have a substance abuse disorder, and that is why we need to \nensure that they have all the avenues to care and treatments available \nto them. We cannot allow them to suffer in silence. That is why I have \noffered two amendments to the bill that will help our veterans \nstruggling with the invisible wounds of war.\n  My first amendment, No. 3390, makes sure that these veterans are not \nforgotten, including their struggles in the findings. My second \namendment, No. 3391, allows veterans with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, military sexual trauma, and service-related traumatic brain \ninjuries that received a dishonorable discharge to have access to \nveterans treatment courts.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senator Peters in ensuring that veterans \nat risk of substance abuse have access to the veterans treatment \ncourts, particularly those most at risk. We cannot turn our backs on \nthose who answer the call to protect our country and are now \nstruggling, many of whom are struggling in silence. We must do \neverything we can to uphold the promises our government made to our \nveterans, and I am honored to be doing just that.\n  I thank Senator Peters for this bipartisan effort we are moving \nforward here to fight on behalf of our veterans.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments I \nam submitting to S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  Across the country, including in my home State of North Dakota, \nfamilies are experiencing the devastating effects of opioid and heroin \naddiction. In fact, in 2014, 61 percent of all overdose deaths in the \nUnited States were related to opioids. In North Dakota alone, overdose \ndeaths have tripled in the past decade. It is no mystery why. In 2014, \nthe North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation seized 1,549 dosage \nunits of opioids. In 2015, they seized 5,593. That is a 3\\1/2\\-fold \nincrease in just 1 year, so an increase of more than three times in \njust 1 year.\n  Similarly, law enforcement seizures of heroin from Canada have grown \nexponentially. But our data about cross-border drug smuggling is \nlimited. To battle drug abuse effectively, we need to know not just how \nmuch but how those drugs are getting into our country. The amendments I \nam proposing today will strengthen the overall bill by providing law \nenforcement with additional resources to address security \nvulnerabilities at the northern border that could be exploited by drug \ntraffickers.\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\n  My first amendment allows State law enforcement to use grant funds to \npartner with local and Federal law enforcement agencies. In the \nunderlying bill, the Attorney General may make grants to State law \nenforcement agencies to investigate the distribution of heroin and \nprescription opioids. My amendment allows States to use those grants to \npartner with local agencies, as well as the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration--the DEA--and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  In North Dakota, our law enforcement has faced increased challenges \nin combatting the flow of illegal drugs, including prescription opioids \nand heroin; however, our State has had a successful track record of \npartnering with local, State and Federal law enforcement to investigate \nand prevent criminal activities, specifically drug-related offenses. \nOne successful example of these partnerships is the Bakken Organized \nCrime Strike Force. This task force was created in part by North \nDakota's attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, along with the Organized \nCrime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, to address the increased drug \nactivity in the Bakken oil-producing region in western North Dakota.\n  My amendment will give States greater opportunities to partner with \nlocal and Federal agencies to investigate the trafficking of heroin, \nopioids, and other illicit drugs, as we have done successfully by \ncreating these task forces in North Dakota.\n  My next amendment also addresses drug smuggling. It requires a study \nof drug trafficking in States along the northern border. While there is \nmuch attention and energy focused on the trafficking of drugs through \nour southern border, there are vulnerabilities that exist on our \nnorthern border as well.\n  My amendment directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \ncoordination with the Attorney General, to conduct a study on the \ntrafficking of narcotics, specifically opioids and heroin, in States \nalong the northern border. The Secretary of DHS and the Attorney \nGeneral must submit a report on those findings to Congress. Those \nfindings will give Congress greater insight into the security needs at \nour northern border to prevent the trafficking of illegal drugs into \nthe United States.\n  Opioid and heroin addiction is a scourge that ruins lives and crushes \nthe spirit. S. 524 is a potent weapon in the fight against them. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the underlying bill, as well as my amendments, \nwhich seek to make the legislation even stronger by increasing \ncollaboration among law enforcement and addressing the security needs \nof our northern border.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Mahan Air and Iran\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, earlier this week, I joined a bipartisan \ngroup of Senate colleagues, including Senator Graham, Senator Ayotte, \nand Senator Blumenthal--Republicans and Democrats alike--to send a \nletter to the United States Department of the Treasury. In our letter, \nwe urged Secretary Jack Lew to continue the Obama administration's \nnecessary and vital efforts to crack down on Mahan Air, a private \nIranian airline that provides support for Iran's terrorist proxies and \nfunnels weapons to Hezbollah and the murderous Assad regime in Syria.\n  Mahan Air is only the latest example of a pattern of behavior we have \ncome to expect from Iran: Supporting terrorism and conducting \ndestabilizing activities in the Middle East, conducting illegal \nballistic missile tests in violation of U.N. Security Council \nresolution 1929, and committing ongoing, major human rights violations.\n  Indeed, as we wrote in the letter to the Secretary of the Treasury: \n``Strong and swift sanctions enforcement is vital to hold Iran to \naccount for its ongoing support of terrorism, ballistic missile \ndevelopment, and human rights violations.''\n  Today I would like to dive further into Mahan Air activities and \nexplain why it is important that America work with our allies to \ncontinue to push back on Iran's bad behavior and to hold Tehran to the \nterms of the agreement reached last summer with regard to Iran's \nnuclear agreement.\n  I will also explain why it is critical that the Senate confirm Adam \nSzubin, Treasury's now-Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and \nFinancial Intelligence, who plays a key role in pressuring our allies \nto push back on Iran and who, in the absence of confirmation, is \nweakened in that vital role. If we are serious about our shared \nintentions to hold Iran accountable, then this Senate must confirm Adam \nSzubin, and our European allies must work with us to sanction Mahan \nAir.\n  Although Mahan Air is technically a private Iranian airline, it \nsupports the operations of the IRGC--the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps--the hard-line military force committed to the preservation of \nthe revolutionary and extremist Iranian regime. Mahan Air also provides \nservices to the Quds Force, an elite IRGC military force that is \ndesignated as a terrorist group by the U.S. Treasury Department under \nExecutive Order 13224.\n  Through its ties to the IRGC and the Quds Force, Mahan Air directly \nand indirectly provides men and materiel to Hezbollah, a terrorist \norganization based in Lebanon, and to the murderous regime of Bashar \nal-Assad in Syria. Yet, despite these known ties, Mahan Air is still \nflying into 24 airports in countries around the region and world, \nincluding the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy, and it is \nsuccessfully procuring aircraft and equipment using front companies--an \nevasive approach that mirrors Iran's strategy in a number of \nindustries, not just in airlines.\n  Since October of 2011, the Treasury Department has taken key steps to \nsanction Mahan Air. In that month--October of 2011--Mahan Air provided \ntravel for members of the Quds Force, who flew to and from Iran and \nSyria for military training, and other suspected officers who flew \ncovertly in and out of Iran.\n  Less than a year later, in September of 2012, Treasury further \ncracked down on Mahan Air and two other airlines for a series of bad \nactions, including sending military and crowd control equipment to the \nAssad regime in Syria in coordination with Hezbollah, often under the \ncover of being humanitarian aid. Later, in both February of 2014 and \nMay of 2015, our Department of the Treasury took further action against \ntwo front companies that helped Mahan Air procure equipment and parts. \nThe 2014 action penalized personnel and companies in the United Arab \nEmirates who helped Mahan Air transfer money and procure aircraft and \nother parts.\n  This ongoing, long-term pattern of behavior by Iran and its IRGC \nmakes clear why the United States and our other vital allies must work \ntogether to cut off Mahan Air's access to international markets and \nairports, and I commend our Department of Treasury for taking these \nimportant steps to designate Mahan and its employees.\n  These actions alone are important--but not sufficient. Both the \nUnited States and our European allies must do more. To start, I urge \ngovernments across the European Union to also designate Mahan Air and \nits many front companies for their support for terrorism.\n  By continuing to support Syria's violent and discredited President, \nBashar al-Assad, Iran has directly contributed to the slow and grinding \ncollapse of Syria, to the enormous humanitarian crisis that has \nresulted, and to the destabilization of the region. There is a direct \ncorrelation between Iran's destabilizing actions in Syria, but also in \nYemen, Lebanon, and Iraq, and the migrant crisis now facing all of \nWestern Europe. The more that Iran uses Mahan Airlines to transport the \nvery goods that supply Hezbollah, the longer the instability inside \nSyria will persist and the more refugees and migrants will flee Syria \ntoward our allies in Western Europe.\n  Without the support of companies such as Mahan Air and the many front \ncompanies that it depends on, Iran and the IRGC would find supporting \nthe Assad regime substantially more difficult and expensive. We must \nwork together to keep Mahan Air from purchasing engines, aircraft, and \nother\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nequipment for these maligning purposes.\n  The second step our allies can and should take is simple: to stop \nallowing Mahan Air to land at their airports. A company like Mahan Air, \nwhich supports terrorism in defiance of international norms, should not \nhave easy access to international airports.\n  More broadly, combating Iran's destabilizing actions in the Middle \nEast and successfully and rigorously enforcing the terms of the nuclear \ndeal with Iran will require meaningful international coordination.\n  As I recently wrote in an editorial that ran in the Guardian, while I \nunderstand that many European companies will seek to do business with \nIran, now that certain economic sanctions have been lifted in \ncompliance with the terms of the nuclear agreement, I urge our allies \nto remember three simple things.\n  First, the United States and the U.N. continue to maintain and \nenforce economic sanctions against Iran. The United States' designation \nof Mahan Air is one of many unilateral sanctions examples, and many \nthat we continue to keep in place.\n  Second, stopping Iran's quest for a nuclear weapon must always remain \na top priority. We are counting on our European allies to continue to \nshare this view and to act in accordance with it--a view that they \nstated they shared during our negotiations that led up to the nuclear \ndeal.\n  Third, as Iran's relationship with Mahan Air shows, the Iranian \nGovernment remains a revolutionary regime with a long history of \npursuing nuclear weapons and a long track record of supporting \nterrorism and destabilization in the Middle East.\n  Iran's use of Mahan Air to evade international scrutiny is yet \nanother reminder that we must remain vigilant in our oversight of Iran. \nHere in the United States, we appreciate the partnership of our \nEuropean allies. In fact, the strength of this allegiance and our \nability to act as one were key factors that led Iran to agree to the \nstrict terms of the nuclear agreement. We must continue to advocate for \nand keep front of mind the idea that the most important contract with \nIran is the one we have already signed in the nuclear agreement. We \nmust pursue every possible means of enforcing it, and that means \ncracking down on front companies that facilitate Mahan Air, and \ncompanies that are playing a direct role in fomenting instability in \nthe Middle East.\n  Just as importantly, I urge my colleagues today to put politics aside \nand confirm Adam Szubin, who oversees the implementation of sanctions \nin the Treasury Department. With experience in both the Bush and Obama \nadministrations, Adam Szubin is the definition of an outstanding career \npublic servant: nonpartisan, dedicated to his job, and committed to his \ncountry. He has been widely praised by Senators of both parties, but \nhis confirmation has been blocked for nearly a year for reasons utterly \nunrelated to his capabilities or his performance of the job.\n  The cause of this hold is and has been raw politics, but the \nconsequences of the hold go far beyond that.\n  When Acting Under Secretary Szubin sits down at the negotiating \ntable, the individuals on the other side, whether from the private \nsector or a foreign government, friend or foe, should know that he \nspeaks for the American people and has the weight of the Senate and the \nwhole Government of the United States behind him. When Adam Szubin \ntravels around the world to ask senior officials from foreign \ngovernments to sanction Mahan Air and its front companies or to prevent \nMahan from flying into their airports, he is trying to convince foreign \ngovernments to do something difficult, but necessary. Those foreign \nofficials should know that he speaks not just for the Obama \nadministration but for the executive and legislative branches of our \nwhole government and that we as a people stand united against Iranian \naggression.\n  Let's demonstrate to our allies and to Iran that Congress takes these \nissues as seriously as we proclaim. Let's confirm Adam Szubin and other \nnominees who are vital to this effort and whose confirmations have been \nstalled for too long. Let's work together to crack down on Mahan Air \nand other Iranian avenues for sowing terror throughout the Middle East. \nAnd, in the same spirit of collaboration that led to the nuclear \nagreement, let's come together to rigorously enforce the terms of the \ndeal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nCoons, for his leadership on this very important topic. I could not \nagree with him more that we need to fund the IAEA, that we need to \nconfirm Adam Szubin for the position of Under Secretary for Terrorism \nand Financial Intelligence, and that our European allies must join us \nin sanctions against Mahan Air.\n  The JCPOA is focused upon one clear goal: preventing Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon. The fact that an agreement like this was \nable to be achieved at the negotiating table is a testament to the \nstrong economic sanctions that were imposed on Iran in direct response \nto Iran's past illicit nuclear activities.\n  The JCPOA required Iran to complete key nuclear-related steps, \nverified by the IAEA, before any sanctions were removed. Iran has \nshipped out 25,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium, thereby tripling its \nbreakout time. Iran has removed the core of the Arak heavy water \nplutonium reactor and has rendered it unusable. Iran is also limited to \n300 kilograms of uranium enriched to only 3.67 percent, which is below \nweapons grade. These are positive steps toward preventing Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  But they came at a time when the world community possessed the most \nleverage, and Iran had the most to lose by not complying with the deal. \nNow, in the aftermath of implementation day and with certain sanctions \nrelief provided to Iran, we must remain increasingly vigilant in our \nefforts to counter the Iranian regime's support for terrorism and \nviolations of human rights of their own people.\n  The Iranian regime must understand that there will be consequences \nfor violations, however minor, of the JCPOA. If Iran seeks a nuclear \nweapon, the world community, led by the United States, is ready to \nimplement the snapback of sanctions in response. And if Iran attempts \nto test our resolve through small but persistent violations of the \nJCPOA, they need to be punished swiftly.\n  I recently traveled to Vienna, along with Senator Coons and several \nof my colleagues, to meet directly with the U.S. Mission to the \nInternational Organization in Vienna, including the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. The IAEA is the world's ``nuclear \nwatchdog'' and the organization that, under the terms of the JCPOA, is \nresponsible for verifying Iran's compliance with the terms of the deal. \nWe must ensure that the IAEA, which serves as our eyes and ears on the \nground in Iran, with direct access and 24/7 online monitoring \ncapabilities of nuclear sites, has the resources necessary to execute \nits critical mission.\n  It is incredibly important that we continue to ensure strict \ncompliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The terms of \nthe JCPOA do not change, regardless of progress or setbacks in Iran's \npolitics, and our resolve to vigorously enforce the deal will not \nwaver. We will judge Iran's leadership by its actions and not words.\n  Last week, Iran conducted some elections. But let's be clear: Many of \nthe Iranian candidates being touted as so-called moderates are labeled \nthat way simply because of their support for, or connections to, \nIranian President Rouhani. But it is important to remember that, \naccording to the United Nations, Iran continues to ``execute more \nindividuals per capita than any other country in the world.''\n  Executions peaked at 753 in 2014, during President Rouhani's second \nyear in office, including those conducted in public, along with \nexecutions of women and at least one juvenile. Amnesty International \nhas reported on continued crackdowns against artists and activists who \nwere tortured into confessions to crimes such as ``spreading propaganda \nagainst the system'' and ``insulting Islamic sanctities.'' And we know \nthat Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe that the election results in Iran are \nin any way transformational. I agree with my colleague's assessment \nthat Iran's elections are neither free nor fair. The\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\nGuardian Council, a top clerical body of the Iranian regime, \ndisqualified thousands of candidates from standing for election. We \ncannot reasonably expect a transformational shift in Iran's foreign \npolicy, human rights record or support for terrorism when the hardline \nregime elements that promote these disturbing policies are allowed to \nprescreen and disqualify candidates for office.\n\n  Iran's support for terrorism and the ability to foster instability in \nthe region has serious consequences for our European allies and for our \nown homeland security. I served in the U.S. Navy Reserve, including \ntime in the Persian Gulf, where I saw firsthand the Strait of Hormuz \nand the strategic chokepoint that exists there. Last year Iran seized a \ncommercial vessel in the States, requiring the U.S. Navy to accompany \nvessels and provide security when moving in and out of the Persian \nGulf. The Iranian regime is a threat not just to the Middle East but to \nthe security and stability of the entire world.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate the need to confirm highly qualified \nnominees like Alan Szubin, who will oversee Treasury Department \nsanctions against Iran and the front companies used to support illicit \nactivities, and we need to urge our allies to join us in imposing these \nsanctions. We need to ensure that we provide the IAEA with the \nresources required to do its job and conduct rigorous daily oversight \nof the JCPOA.\n  Most importantly, we must continue to provide strict oversight of the \nJCPOA and ensure compliance with its terms. We cannot let up or be \ndistracted by perceived improvements or setbacks in Iran's politics. We \nmade a commitment to the American people that Iran must never be \nallowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. This is a commitment we must \nuphold and be focused on each and every day.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to explain four \namendments that I have filed and would like to make pending on S. 524. \nI understand we are in a position now that we need consent in order to \nhave these amendments pending. I am not going to ask for consent, but I \nwill explain the four amendments in hopes I will have an opportunity to \npresent these amendments and have them considered by the full Senate. I \nknow Leader McConnell wants an open amendment process, and I think all \nfour of these amendments are very much relevant to the underlying bill \nwhich is aimed at authorizing the Attorney General to address the \nnational epidemic of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use.\n  The first amendment I wish to talk about is an amendment on which I \nam joined by Senator Cornyn. It is amendment No. 3421, which would \nallow grants for 24/7 treatment centers.\n  I am proud to join with my colleague Senator Cornyn on this \namendment, which clarifies that grants under section 301 of CARA may be \nawarded for the establishment and support of treatment centers that \noperate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to provide immediate access to \nbehavioral health services.\n  The epidemic of opioid abuse and addiction impacts every State in our \ncountry. Many of us know individuals and families who have been deeply \naffected by this tragic crisis. Heroin and opioid drug dependency has \nmore than doubled in Maryland over the last decade. The number of \ndeaths related to heroin and opioid drug dependency has increased by \nmore than 100 percent in the last 5 years. In 2013, there were 464 \nheroin-related overdose deaths in Maryland, greater than the number of \nhomicides. Some parts of Maryland have had the highest per capita rate \nof heroin and opioid drug use in the United States. In some regions of \nthe State an estimated 1 in 10 citizens are addicted to heroin.\n  Improving access to behavioral health care--meaning both mental \nhealth and substance abuse treatment--is essential in combating this \nepidemic. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, more \nthan half of the individuals with substance use disorders also have at \nleast one serious mental health condition. There is often a small \nwindow of opportunity for getting an individual with substance abuse or \nmental health issues into treatment. If treatment cannot be provided on \ndemand, often the opportunity is lost. Allowing grants for the \nestablishment and support of 24/7 treatment centers providing \nbehavioral health services on demand will help ensure those individuals \nin need have access to behavioral health services at the time they need \nit.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in helping to get this amendment \npending and adopted. It is a bipartisan amendment, as I said. I am \njoined by Senator Cornyn in presenting it to our colleagues.\n  The second amendment is pretty simple. It requests a GAO report on \nnaloxone price increases. I am pleased this amendment I would offer \nwould require a study of the most recent dramatic increase in the price \nof this medicine. Naloxone is a lifesaving drug that is used to reverse \nthe effects of opioid overdose. However, according to the Baltimore \nCity Health Department, the cost per dose in Baltimore has quadrupled \nover the past 2 years--quadrupled in 2 years. This GAO study would \nevaluate the impact of the ability of States and local health \ndepartments to reduce the number of deaths due to opioid overdose. It \nis a pretty simple amendment, and I would hope we could get it pending \nand included in this legislation because I think it would save lives.\n  The next amendment I wish to talk about is again a bipartisan \namendment that is being offered with Senator Heller. This amendment \nwould repeal the therapy cap. I was in the House of Representatives \nwhen the therapy cap was imposed on therapeutic rehab services. It was \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and imposed annual \nfinancial limits on outpatient physical therapy and speech-language \npathology services, as well as occupational therapy services. The \ndecision to impose those caps was not based upon data, concerns about \nquality of care or clinical judgment. The sole purpose was to limit \nspending in order to balance the Federal budget.\n  I was in the Ways and Means Committee room when Chairman Thomas \nbrought this issue up to include in the Balanced Budget Act, and I \nasked the question: Why are we doing this? He said: Well, we need these \ndollar amounts to equal the numbers. I said: What is the policy reason? \nNone could be given.\n  These arbitrary caps create an unnecessary and burdensome financial \nbarrier to Medicare beneficiaries who rely on essential rehab services \nsuch as physical and occupational therapy to live healthy and \nproductive lives. Chronic pain, which is defined as pain that lasts for \nseveral months or in some cases years, affects at least 116 million \nAmericans each year. Physical therapy plays an important role in \nmanaging chronic pain.\n  Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published \ndraft clinical guidelines on the use of opioids for chronic pain, \nmaking it clear nondrug approaches, such as physical therapy, are \n``preferred'' treatment paths for chronic pain. Approaches such as \nphysical therapy ``have been underutilized and, therefore, can serve as \na primary strategy to reduce prescription drug medication abuse and \nimproving the lives of individuals with chronic pain.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Heller to permanently \nrepeal the therapy cap and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries, \nincluding those suffering from chronic pain, continue to have access to \nmedically necessary outpatient physical therapy services.\n  The fourth amendment I would like to offer is in title IV of this \nlegislation. It addresses the so-called collateral \nconsequences. Section 402 directs the Attorney General to establish a \n``Task Force on Recovery and Collateral Consequences.'' Collateral \nconsequences refer to a penalty, disability or disadvantage experienced \nby an individual because of a criminal conviction, but that is separate \nfrom the court's judgment or sentencing. The commission will study \nthese consequences and\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nwhether they affect the ability of individuals to resume their personal \nand professional lives. In other words, we are talking about reentry \ninto society.\n\n  But we do not have to wait for the results of a commission to take \naction to ameliorate one of the collateral consequences of a criminal \nconviction. Here, I am talking about the fundamental right to vote. An \nestimated 5.85 million citizens cannot vote as a result of criminal \nconvictions, and nearly 4.4 million of those have already been released \nfrom prison. So 4.4 million people in our communities are denied the \nright to vote. Nationwide, 1 in 13 African Americans of voting age have \nlost the right to vote, a rate 4 times higher than the national \naverage. Latino citizens are also impacted in an extreme way because \nthey are disproportionately overrepresented in the criminal justice \nsystem. States have vastly different approaches to voting with a \ncriminal conviction. This patchwork of State laws has caused confusion \namong election officials and the public, sometimes resulting in the \ndisenfranchisement of even eligible voters. Some of these State laws \nare a holdover from the era of Jim Crow laws, where even misdemeanor \nconvictions could take away an individual's right to vote. In some \ncases, the right to vote is lost permanently, with no ability for \nrehabilitation. This is just plain wrong.\n  The amendment I wish to offer would provide much-needed information \ninto the hands of citizens returning from incarceration. My amendment \nwould direct the Justice Department to provide to individuals released \nfrom the custody of the Bureau of Prisons information regarding their \nright to vote following release. It would require notifications to \nindividuals of the impact on their voting rights when they accept a \nplea agreement from the U.S. attorney and require the Department of \nJustice to report on the disproportionate impact of both Federal and \nState criminal disenfranchisement laws on minority populations, \nincluding data on voter disenfranchisement rates by race and ethnicity.\n  My amendment does not change any existing Federal or State voting \nrights laws. It does not. It simply requires the Justice Department to \nprovide additional information to ex-offenders upon their release from \nprison, and it makes sure that defendants are aware of the impact on \ntheir voting rights when accepting a plea agreement. The Department of \nJustice study can provide us additional information on the patchwork of \nState and Federal disenfranchisement laws, which Congress and the \nStates can use to make further changes in the statute.\n  So I urge my colleagues to have a process where this amendment, along \nwith the other three I have discussed, can be made pending so that we \ncan vote on these amendments. I think they all would improve the \nunderlying bill, and it is certainly consistent with the majority \nleader's commitment to an open amendment process. I hope there will be \na way that I will be able to offer these amendments and the full Senate \nwill be able to vote on these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                Filling the Vacancy on the Supreme Court\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, earlier this week and last week I joined a \nnumber of my colleagues on the floor and spoke at length about the need \nfor our fellow Senators on the other side of the aisle to do something \nsimple--to do their jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have on his microphone.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Earlier this week and last I spoke at length about the need for my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to do their job and to move \nforward with hearings and an up-or-down vote on whomever the President \nnominates to the Supreme Court. The outcry from the public continues \nfrom every corner of our justice system. Let's just recount quickly \nwhat happened after the tragic and untimely death of Justice Scalia.\n  Within an hour or so, the Republican leader of the Senate said: Don't \nbother sending up a nominee. History suggests that we won't do this in \nthe last year of the Presidency. We are not going to do hearings. Don't \neven bother.\n  Other Republican Senators, sort of like one bird flying off the \ntelephone wire--they all fly off a telephone wire--one Republican \nSenator after another, first said no hearings. Then, after the majority \nleader said that he would not even meet with prospective nominees, \nother Republican Senators said they wouldn't meet with nominees.\n  Just imagine that. We work hard to run for these offices. It is hard \nto get to the Senate. When we win, within a month and a half or 2 \nmonths later, we take an oath of office. We get paid to do our jobs. \nBut they are just not doing their job.\n  The Constitution says the President shall nominate to fill a vacancy \non the Supreme Court, and the Constitution says the Senate shall advise \nand consent--not except in the last year of the President's term, not \nonly if we feel like it. We are just saying to our Senate colleagues--\nalong with Americans saying to Senate Republicans: Do your job.\n  It is pretty simple. We are not saying you have to vote for the \nPresident's nominee. Understandably, you may not want to, but at least \nmeet the nominee, at least hold hearings on the nominee. Then let's \nbring him or her to the Senate floor and have a debate and vote up or \ndown.\n  Earlier this week I quoted from four former U.S. attorneys from my \nState of Ohio, from Washington State, California, and Virginia. They \nwrote: ``It is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal agents, police \nand prosecutors to spend more than a year guessing whether their \nactions will hold up in court.'' These are criminal prosecutors, U.S. \nattorneys, saying how important it is that, ultimately, when something \ngoes to the Supreme Court, there will be a decision made because there \nis an odd number of justices.\n  The last time there was a 1-year vacancy--which is what the \nRepublican leader, Mitch McConnell, is calling for--on the Supreme \nCourt was 150 years ago, and that was because we were at war. It was \nduring the Civil War. It is unprecedented to do what they are doing.\n  On Tuesday, former Ohio Court of Appeals Judge Mark Painter wrote an \nop-ed in the very conservative, very Republican Cincinnati Inquirer, \nsharing some of the same concerns. He wrote:\n\n       It would be irresponsible and unprecedented to let a \n     vacancy on the court extend into 2017. If Congress fails to \n     act, the Supreme Court will go two terms--well over a year--\n     with a vacancy. The court will hear significant cases in the \n     coming months and issue rulings that will impact our everyday \n     lives.\n       As a judge for 30 years, I learned that it is important for \n     the law to be settled.\n\n  Settled--not held in abeyance, not deadlocked, but settled--that is \nwhy we have an ultimate Supreme Court.\n\n       Uncertainty is bad for businesses, individuals and for \n     commerce. Two court terms of possible 4-4 votes would be a \n     nightmare.\n\n  There is no precedent for causing this damaging uncertainty. The only \nreason is politics.\n  That is the same Republican leader who some years ago said: My No. 1 \npolitical goal is to keep Barack Obama from being reelected, not, my \nNo. 1 goal is to help improve the economy or to help wages go up or to \npreserve our freedom, our families or our economic security from \nattack. He said: My No. 1 goal is to make sure that Barack Obama isn't \nreelected.\n  Then this same crowd shut down the government in 2013, after Barack \nObama was reelected. They didn't like that--understandably. But they \nshut the government down--not understandable. Now they want to shut the \nSupreme Court down by locking it in with an even number where we will \nsee 4-to-4 votes.\n  Judge Painter points out that we elected Barack Obama to a 4-year \nterm:\n\n       The nomination to fill the seat of Supreme Court Justice \n     Scalia is bigger than party or politics. And there is no \n     doubt that Scalia himself would interpret the Constitution as \n     requiring a nomination and a vote by the Senate. It's that \n     simple.\n       That's why President Obama will do the job that the \n     American people elected him to do. And that's why the Senate \n     should do its job also.\n       Under our Constitution, we elect presidents for four-year \n     terms. Obama has almost a quarter of his term left. Should \n     the process of government stop for a year?\n\n  Should the process of government stop for a year? It should not. My \ncolleagues, pure and simple, ought to do\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\ntheir jobs. They ought to meet the nominee. They ought to hold \nhearings. They ought to give an up-or-down vote to whomever the \nPresident nominates. Let's do our job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator Brown, in his message about our responsibility to do our job. \nIt is very simple: Do our job. Do what the people of our State elected \nus to do.\n  Senator Brown is absolutely correct. Article II, section 2 of the \nConstitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \nof the supreme Court.'' The last time I checked, the President was \nelected for a term of 4 years, not 3 years and 2 months. We still have \n10 months left of President Obama's Presidency. There is plenty of time \nfor the Senate to consider his nomination for the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  I find it shocking that my colleagues would suggest, even before the \nPresident has submitted a nomination, that the Senate would not conduct \nhearings or consider the nomination of the President to the Supreme \nCourt, even though that is our constitutional responsibility and even \nthough we were elected for a 6-year term. The last time I checked, we \nare in session until the end of this year. We don't adjourn in March. \nThe President has 10 months left in office, and Senators should do our \nwork and do our job. I think the American people will ultimately demand \nthat the Senate do its job and not threaten to stop working simply to \ncoddle and pander to the most extreme and fringe elements of its base.\n  Senators should look to the Constitution for the history and the \nprecedents of the Senate on how to proceed. I say that because if we do \nnot hold a hearing on President Obama's nomination for the Supreme \nCourt, it will be the first time in the history of the United States \nthat a nominee who requested a hearing is denied a hearing--the first \ntime ever. This is a matter of what is the appropriate role in the \nConstitution of the United States. We all took an oath of office to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, and it is our \nresponsibility to respond with a serious effort.\n  The majority leader said that when we get a nomination, we should act \nwith dignity. Well, we are not acting with dignity if we don't hold a \nhearing. Let me remind us that the last time a President nominated in \nan election year of the opposite party, President Reagan's nomination \nof Justice Kennedy was considered by a Democratic-controlled Senate and \napproved by a Democrat-controlled Senate.\n  Let me also remind us that there have been times where a nominee of \nthe President has not been approved by the Judiciary Committee. They \nhave still come to the floor of the Senate for action. Justice Thomas \nwas approved by a majority vote of the Senate even though he was not \nrecommended by the Judiciary Committee. It was short of the 60-vote \nthreshold, which means that if the Democratic majority had wanted to \nfilibuster, they could have. So we are on uncharted waters here with \nwhat the Republicans are doing.\n  We have separation of branches of government. That is the history of \nour country. That is the democracy in which we live. It is our \nresponsibility to preserve that. We, the legislative branch of the \ngovernment, have the responsibility to advise and consent on the \nindependent judiciary. The Supreme Court operates with nine justices, \nnot with eight. It is an abuse of power of the majority in the Senate--\nthe Republicans--to say that we are going to reduce the Supreme Court \nof the United States to eight by inaction. What happens when we have \nconflicting decisions made by different circuits and the only court \nthat can determine the law is the Supreme Court in its interpretation \nand they are 4-to-4 deadlocked? If we do not take up this appointment \nand we go the full year into next year, it will be two terms of the \nU.S. Supreme Court without the full complement of justices.\n  Do your job, my colleagues. That is all we have to do. You don't have \nto vote yes. Vote. Have a hearing. Have the courage to vote yes or no \non the President's nominee. They are saying we are not even going to \nhave a chance for a hearing or vote, and we don't even know who the \nnominee is, and that is just plain wrong. I think the American people \nwill speak with a clear voice and say that is not what the Senate \nshould be doing.\n  I hope the Republican leadership will provide the dignity of the \nSenate, hold hearings, and allow the full Senate to vote up-or-down on \nthe President's nominee for the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, addiction to prescription opioid pain \nrelievers and heroin is a growing public health epidemic that is taking \na heartbreaking toll on families and communities in every State of this \ncountry. In 2014, more than 47,000 Americans died because of \nprescription opioid and heroin overdoses.\n  This crisis is very real in my home State of New Mexico. For years, \nwithout adequate treatment resources, communities in my State have \nsuffered through some of the highest rates of heroin and opioid \naddiction in the country. Far too many New Mexico families have lost \nloved ones, and many more are struggling to find treatment and recovery \nresources for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, or for themselves.\n  Two weeks ago, I visited Espanola Valley in Rio Arriba County. Rio \nArriba, which is largely rural and has predominantly Hispanic and \ntribal communities, is filled with beautiful mountain and desert \nlandscapes, the kinds of places that attract artisan visitors from \naround the world. Families from Rio Arriba can trace their lineage to \nSpanish settlers who came to New Mexico in the 1600s and to Indian \nPueblos and tribes who have lived in this region for millennia. \nTragically, Rio Arriba County has also long been home to the highest \nrates of heroin addiction and overdose deaths in the Nation. In fact, \nbetween 2010 and 2014, the county's overdose death rate was more than \nfive times the national average. This is not only tragic, it is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Last month, I convened a roundtable discussion in the area with U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Region 6 Director Marjorie \nPetty and a number of local stakeholders, including the Rio Arriba \nCommunity Health Council. We gathered at the Delancey Street Foundation \nin Ohkay Owingeh to discuss ongoing efforts and ways to better address \nthe heroin and prescription drug crisis in my State. What I heard loud \nand clear from public health officials, from law enforcement and first \nresponders, and, probably most importantly, from people who have coped \ndirectly with addiction, is that this crisis is hitting entire \ncommunities and hitting them hard. Everyone knows a family who has a \nchild suffering through addiction or in recovery, and many have \nliterally lost loved ones to drug-related deaths.\n  For decades, drug addiction and substance abuse have been passed down \ngeneration to generation in too many families in Rio Arriba and in \ncommunities across New Mexico. The introduction of prescription opioid \npain medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone into the market over \nthe last two decades has poured fuel on this fire, creating even more \ncases of opioid abuse and heroin addiction. These prescription opioid \npain medications, which are so chemically similar to heroin, have \nproduced whole new onramps onto the highway of addiction. In many \ninstances, by the time someone has finished their first prescription \ndrug treatment, they are literally already hooked, so they turn to \npurchase new pills, legally or illegally, either through a new \nprescription or through other means. When they can't afford the pills \nanymore, all too often they turn to heroin.\n  Overprescription of opioid drugs and the widespread trafficking of \nlethal black tar heroin have both contributed enormously to the ongoing \npublic health crisis in New Mexico and now across our Nation. The \nstatistics alone should get our attention. From 2002 to 2013, opioid-\nrelated deaths quadrupled nationally. Drug overdoses were the leading \ncause of injury death in 2013. Among Americans ages 25 to 64 years\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\nold, drug overdoses caused more deaths than motor vehicle crashes. \nThink about that.\n  Over this same period, New Mexico families and communities have borne \nthe brunt of this epidemic. Between 2011 and 2013, New Mexico ranked \nsecond nationally for drug overdose deaths, and it is getting worse by \nthe year. More New Mexicans died of drug overdoses in 2014 than in any \nother year on record. Some 547 people died in New Mexico due to drug \npoisoning, including deaths from prescription opioids and heroin \noveruse.\n  Rather than focus solely on these statistics, I want to talk a little \nbit about some of the people I met in my visit to Rio Arriba County \nbecause I think it puts a much more human and real face on the very \nnature of this problem.\n  Jesus toured me around Delancey Street.\n  The Delancey Street Foundation is a national residential self-help \nrehab organization that helps former substance abusers, ex-convicts, \nand others who have literally hit rock bottom turn their lives around, \nget clean, and learn academic and vocational and life skills. Residents \nhave to commit to a minimum stay of at least 2 years. During that \nperiod, a comprehensive treatment program often produces dramatic \nresults.\n  Delancey Street's facility in New Mexico is located on a 17-acre \nranch in Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo. Residents there learn vocational skills \nto get jobs in livestock management, culinary arts, retail sales, \nconstruction, wastewater management, and landscaping.\n  Jesus came to Delancey Street after getting caught up using and \nselling pills and heroin in the Espanola Valley. He had two DUIs and \nsuffered through alcoholism and substance abuse. In 2011, when a judge \ngave him the option of going to Delancey Street instead of serving a 9-\nyear prison sentence, he took the chance. Through a long process, he \nreceived treatment and learned how to cope with his addiction. Jesus \nhas stayed at Delancey Street well past his 2-year commitment and has \ntaken on new responsibilities. He now serves as a mentor and a role \nmodel to new residents who are trying to overcome their addictions.\n  I met another man named Josh. He is a peer-to-peer support worker at \nInside Out Recovery Center in Espanola. Josh was born and raised in \nEspanola, where he saw drug and alcohol use as the way of life in his \ncommunity. When he was 14 years old, a high school friend with a \nprescription for hydrocodone offered him some pills. Josh quickly \nbecame addicted. Over time, his opioid addiction led him to the point \nwhere he was shooting 7 grams of heroin every day, stealing from family \nand friends to pay for that addiction, and going in and out of the \nprison system at the same time. At one point, while going through \nwithdrawal in a jail cell, Josh was unable to eat for weeks. He \nliterally lost over a third of his body weight. He remembers later \nattempting suicide in an act of desperation to end his addiction and \nfailing when his gun didn't go off.\n\n  In his late twenties, after going through these intense struggles, \nJosh was introduced to the Inside Out Recovery Center. He met a peer-\nto-peer support worker named Alex, who had done the same drugs and been \nthrough the same struggles. Josh realized there was a way to stop \nusing, and he turned his life around. He got clean.\n  When a judge sentenced Josh to probation instead of prison for an \noffense, he was released from jail and went straight to Inside Out and \ncommitted to treatment. He said it was the first time he had been \nreleased and hadn't immediately returned to drug and alcohol abuse. At \nInside Out, Josh received peer support and learned conflict resolution \nand coping skills. He credits the program with actually saving his \nlife. Now that Josh has his life back, he is working to help others in \nhis community to get their lives back from addiction.\n  Finally, I want to tell you about Rufus. Rufus is a 22-year-old \nNavajo Hopi man who lives in Pojoaque. When I met Rufus during my \nvisit, he was getting ready to graduate from his treatment at New Moon \nLodge treatment facility in Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo.\n  New Moon Lodge is a residential addiction treatment center that \nserves clients from New Mexico's American Indian communities. Although \nthe center treats different types of addiction and substance abuse, \nincluding alcoholism, recently they have seen many more cases of opioid \nand heroin addiction.\n  Rufus's addiction to opioids began when he was prescribed hydrocodone \nto help with a hand injury he received when he was 16. He became \naddicted. Once his prescription ran out, he turned to buying pills \nillegally, moved up to higher dosages, and eventually moved on to \nheroin. He got expelled from high school his senior year and fell even \ndeeper into this addiction.\n  After years of use and going in and out of jail for various offenses, \nRufus came before the Pojoaque Tribal Court last year and was given the \noption to go to New Moon for treatment. New Moon helped him see the \nperson he could be without the drugs. Rufus just graduated from his \ntreatment at New Moon last week. Now he is looking forward to building \na stable home life for his girlfriend and his baby by going back to \nschool to get his GED and working toward being a mechanic or an artist.\n  I tell these stories to demonstrate that when we provide an \nopportunity to receive comprehensive treatment and receive \nrehabilitation, people who have suffered through the trials of opioid \naddiction can turn their lives around and help their communities heal \nin the process.\n  Sadly, in addition to hearing these success stories, I have heard far \ntoo often that people who are looking to get help have absolutely \nnowhere to go. Particularly in New Mexico's rural, tribal, and \nimpoverished communities, there is a severe lack of access to proven \ntreatment and rehabilitation resources. We desperately need more \ndetoxification centers, more transitional housing facilities, more \noutpatient services, and more behavioral health facilities.\n  We as a nation are not doing even close to enough to provide adequate \ntreatment facilities and resources to communities like those in the \nEspanola Valley that are struggling to meet the challenges of the \ngrowing heroin and opioid addiction crisis. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, championed \nby our colleagues Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rob \nPortman of Ohio.\n  This legislation provides a series of incentives and resources \ndesigned to encourage States and local communities to pursue a full \narray of proven strategies that combat addiction. To ensure that this \neffort meets the needs of rural and tribal communities such as those in \nNew Mexico, I submitted a bipartisan amendment with my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Mike Enzi, to require that rural \nhealth professionals are included in the Pain Management Best Practices \nInteragency Task Force that is created by this legislation.\n  But, frankly, in order to truly provide local communities the tools \nthey need to tackle this crisis head-on, we need funding, which is why \nI am also cosponsoring emergency funding legislation, championed by my \ncolleague Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, to provide \nsupplemental appropriations of $600 million for drug prevention and \ntreatment programs. I understand that Senator Shaheen's efforts to \ninclude her funding legislation as an amendment failed to get enough \nvotes this week, which frankly I find deeply disappointing, but I think \nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is still a good first step \ntoward addressing this epidemic. You can be sure I will continue to \nfight to address it in the Senate and back in New Mexico.\n\n  Addiction is a disease that can happen to anyone. It transcends \nregion, race, gender, and socioeconomic status. It is a vicious cycle \nwe have seen all too frequently in New Mexico. By taking a \ncomprehensive approach to combat this epidemic, we can ensure that \npeople have the opportunity to get back on the road to recovery.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3345\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the American people sent all of us here to \nsolve problems, to strengthen and support our Nation and its people, \nand to help make ours a more perfect union. They expect us to govern \nresponsibly\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\nand to work together to improve our communities. This week we are \nconsidering the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. Few \nproblems in our country have had as devastating an impact on American \nfamilies as opioid addiction. From Vermont, to Kentucky, to Ohio, \ncommunities across the country are struggling, and they are reaching \nfor answers and for help.\n  It is clear there is a strong, bipartisan interest in Congress to \naddress the problems associated with opioid addiction. The legislation \nbefore us is a good bill. It demonstrates that Congress now sees \naddiction for what it is--a public health crisis. But CARA will not by \nitself pull our communities out of addiction. CARA is an unfunded \nframework. Addiction is too knotted and massive a challenge to address \nwith a mere change in philosophy. We cannot pretend that solving a \nproblem as large as opioid addiction costs nothing. The emergency \nfunding amendment by Senator Shaheen is an essential part of this \neffort. It puts real dollars behind the rhetoric to ensure that the \ncarefully crafted programs authorized in CARA can actually be \nimplemented and can succeed.\n  Congress has approved much larger emergency funding bills in the \npast. Just last year we approved more than $5 billion to combat the \nEbola outbreak in Africa, far from our shores. To be clear, I believe \nthis funding was appropriate. But we must now turn our attention to the \npublic health crisis here at home, in our own communities. More than \n40,000 Americans are dying each year from drug overdoses. In Vermont, \nState leaders like Governor Shumlin have tackled opioid addiction with \nan all-hands-on-deck approach. Other community leaders, like the Boys & \nGirls Club of Burlington, have done wonderful work expanding education \nefforts to prevent young people from becoming addicted in the first \nplace. I am proud of their efforts, but they will be the first to \nacknowledge that many challenges remain. As in other States, addiction \nhas spread across our State, and more Vermonters are dying from drug \noverdoses. Several have died while on waitlists for treatment.\n  Addiction is nothing less than an epidemic, and to solve it, this \ncrisis must be treated as an epidemic. More resources for targeted \nefforts will save lives and help stabilize families, neighborhoods, and \ncommunities. That is why we need Senator Shaheen's amendment. This \namendment would have provided resources to strengthen both the law \nenforcement and public health components needed to tackle the crisis. \nHer legislation would have delivered support to State and local law \nenforcement agencies, anti-heroin task forces, and treatment \nalternatives to incarceration. It would have also delivered necessary \nresources to health care professionals who are overwhelmed by a need \nthey cannot meet. No one should be turned away when seeking treatment \nfor the terrible disease of addiction. If cancer patients were refused \ntreatment, we would not hesitate to act, and this should be no \ndifferent.\n  We must make a real investment in combatting this ravaging epidemic, \nand the Shaheen amendment would have ensured that. Actions speak louder \nthan words, action requires resources, and budgets are where we set \npriorities. The American people are watching and waiting. It is time \nfor us to stop talking and start acting. It is time for us to start \ninvesting in our own country, our own communities' needs, and our own \npeople.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for \ntoday's vote on the Manchin amendment No. 3420 to S. 524, the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill. I would have voted \nyea.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for \ntoday's amendment vote in relation to S. 524, the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act of 2015.\n  On amendment No. 3420 by Senator Manchin, I would have voted \nyea.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           World Wildlife Day\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, on a day that was sadly often marked by \npartisan differences, I thought I would take a moment near the end of \nthis legislative day and simply remark on something where there has \nrecently been some bipartisan progress, and I think it is worthy of \nsome brief comment.\n  Today is the third annual World Wildlife Day. This day was declared \nby the United Nations and will soon be celebrated in another place on \nthis Capitol complex by a wide range of organizations from all over the \nUnited States and the world that are dedicated to preserving wildlife \nin places in the world where it is under distinct pressure.\n  As I said, this is the third annual celebration of World Wildlife \nDay. It was first declared by the United Nations, and I want to briefly \nremark that a bipartisan delegation of this Senate recently went to \nSouthern Africa. It was led by Senator Flake of Arizona, and he and \nSenator Cardin, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Cochran, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I had an \nopportunity to meet with leaders from four different countries. They \nare working tirelessly to try and contain an epidemic of poaching that \nhas reached nearly catastrophic levels.\n  Nearly 100 elephants are killed every day now so their ivory tusks \ncan be sold on the black market at prices higher than heroin or gold. \nIn 2014 alone, more than 1,000 rhinoceroses were illegally killed in \nSouth Africa, which is a 9,000-percent increase in the poaching of \nrhinos since 2007.\n  I think this is of concern to all of us, not just because of the loss \nof these remarkable and iconic wildlife species but because it is also \nfunding and fueling a multibillion-dollar industry of organized crime \nthat also traffics in drugs, people, and weapons and destabilizes \ncritical parts of the world.\n  We have a chance to make real progress. There is a bipartisan bill, \nthe END Wildlife Trafficking Act, that Senator Flake and I have \nintroduced, and that I am hopeful Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, as \nthe chair and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, will \ntake up, consider, and markup in our next business meeting. I do think \nthis legislation offers us a real opportunity to show that we can come \ntogether to support the President's plan for combating wildlife \ntrafficking and can make a modest and responsible investment in helping \ncountries on the other side of the world that are facing the same sort \nof scourge of lawlessness and violence that marks those places in \nAmerica where drug trafficking is at its peak, but instead of \ntrafficking illegal drugs, the actions they are carrying out is the \nslaughter and the export of the pieces of killed animals, whether \nelephant tusks or rhino horns.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ``Adopt the pace of nature: Her \nsecret is patience.'' It is my hope that with patience, persistence, \nand bipartisanship, we can celebrate this World Wildlife Day by doing \nsomething together to make progress in combating the scourge of illegal \nwildlife trafficking.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to call up the following amendments: No. 3336, Johnson, as \nmodified; No. 3329, Durbin; further, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, March \n7, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed \nand that there be no second-degree amendments in order to these \namendments prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Our respective cloakrooms have been working for the better part of \nthis week to get a list of amendments that could get votes.\n  As everyone knows, we have had, on our side, more than 60 amendments \nfiled. So I want to hold my friend to an often-expressed promise that \nwe would have a robust amendment process. Now, I know we aren't going \nto get 60 amendments--I got that--but there have been objections from \nRepublicans to a number of amendments my Senators want to offer. They \nwant to do a few votes on a number of their amendments.\n  First of all, everyone should understand we are not holding up this \nbill. The leader has indicated he is going to file cloture today or \ntomorrow, so I got that. We are not going to oppose cloture, but we are \nnot going to have the other side determine what amendments should be \noffered. We should be able to pick what amendments we want to offer. \nAnd I don't think it is appropriate--for example, one of the amendments \nhe chose is from a Senator running for reelection. Is there some \npurpose to that? I think we should have a process where we have \nalternating amendments, and we pick our amendments.\n  So I would ask my colleague to agree to changing his unanimous \nconsent request so that it would be in order to call up the amendments \nI mention now. There would be an hour of debate on each amendment. We \ncould certainly even shorten that time significantly prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendments in the order listed, and no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the votes: Durbin No. 3329, Gillibrand \nNo. 3354, Markey No. 3384--who has been begging me for 4 days now to \nget a vote on his amendment--Blumenthal No. 3327, Cardin No. 3421, \nMcCaskill No. 3375, Wyden No. 3402, Heinrich No. 3372, Schatz No. 3413, \nand Markey No. 3382--10 out of 60.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the original request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might just point out that apparently \nthe amendment that was in my consent request that was objectionable to \nthe other side was a simple amendment from the Senator from Wisconsin \nto include a representative of the Indian Health Service in the Pain \nManagement Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand, I am sure, the importance of \nthis amendment, but the other amendments are important also.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to call up the following amendments: No. 3334, Kirk; No. 3336, \nJohnson, as modified; No. 3329, Durbin; No. 3337, Johnson, as modified; \nNo. 3354, Gillibrand; No. 3366, Lankford; Markey-Paul related to the \nTREAT Act; No. 3407, McCain; and No. 3408, McCain; further, that at \n5:30 p.m., Monday, March 7, the Senate vote in relation to the Durbin \namendment No. 3329 and the Johnson amendment No. 3336; and that there \nbe no second-degree amendments in order to these amendments prior to \nthe votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. I don't like to admit this \npublicly that I have learned anything from the Republican leader, but I \nhave. One of the things I have learned is that it is not right to have \nthe majority pick the votes of the minority, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last night Honduras lost one of its most \ncourageous, charismatic indigenous leaders, Berta Caceres. Ms. Caceres \nwas the general coordinator of the National Council of Popular and \nIndigenous Organizations of Honduras, and she was assassinated in her \nhometown of La Esperanza, Intibuca.\n  According to initial reports, at least two people broke down the door \nof the house where she was staying for the evening and shot and killed \nher.\n  Berta Caceres spent her life fighting in defense of indigenous \nrights, particularly to land and natural resources. In 2015, she won \nthe prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for her outstanding \nactivism and leadership.\n  This horrific crime demonstrates that no one, not even an \ninternationally known social activist, is safe in Honduras if they \nspeak out against corruption or abuse of authority. Her death will have \na profound impact on the many communities she worked with, her \norganization, Honduran civil society, and all who knew her.\n  Berta Caceres and COPINH have been supporting land struggles \nthroughout western Honduras. In the last few weeks, threats and \nviolence towards Berta and the communities she and her organization \nsupport had escalated.\n  In Rio Blanco on February 20, Berta, her organization, and the \ncommunity of Rio Blanco were threatened as they engaged in a peaceful \nprotest to protect the river and their way of life from the \nconstruction of a large hydroelectric dam by an internationally \nfinanced Honduran company.\n  As a result of supporting the Rio Blanco struggle, Berta had received \nmany threats against her life and was granted, like dozens of other \nendangered Honduran social activists, precautionary measures by the \nInter-\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\nAmerican Commission on Human Rights.\n  Berta Caceres was an inspiration to people around the world, and her \ndeath is a great loss for all the people of Honduras. The immediate \nquestion is what President Hernandez and his government, which has too \noften ignored or passively condoned attacks against Honduran social \nactivists, will do to support an independent investigation, \nprosecution, and punishment of those responsible for this despicable \ncrime and, beyond that, what steps will the government take to protect \nthe many others, including members of COPINH, who are in need of \nprotection, and to stand up for the rights of people like Berta who \nrisk their lives peacefully defending the environment and their \nlivelihoods.\n  The answers to those questions will weigh heavily on the Congress's \nsupport for future assistance for that government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1274-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with the passing of Supreme Court Justice \nAntonin Scalia, our Nation has lost an exceptional jurist and \nunshakable defender of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Justice Scalia will be remembered for using his substantial intellect \nto affect how the American public views the Constitution and the role \nof the courts in interpreting the law. His thoughtful opinions over \nnearly 30 years on the Court shaped modern jurisprudence and helped \nfacilitate a larger discussion on the role of the Constitution in \ncontemporary terms and application.\n  Justice Scalia had an accomplished career as an attorney, law \nprofessor, general counsel for the Office of Telecommunications Policy, \nchairman of the Administrative Conference, Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Office of Legal Counsel for the Department of Justice, and as a \njudge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit. It was an honor for me to support his confirmation as an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court following his nomination by \nPresident Reagan in 1986.\n  Justice Scalia, who had a great love for the arts, education, and \nhunting, developed an affinity for the State of Mississippi and made \nmany friends during his visits to my State. Many Mississippians shared \nJustice Scalia's interest in hunting deer, duck, quail, and turkey, but \nhis most important influence on Mississippi may result from the \ngenerous time he invested speaking to young scholars during his visits \nto university campuses in my State.\n  We mark Justice Scalia's passing by rightfully acknowledging his many \nyears of public service, his defense of the founding principles of our \nNation, and his steadfast adherence to a conservative view of our \nConstitution. I am proud to have known and supported him.\n  I extend to his family sincere condolences and the thanks of a \ngrateful Nation for Justice Scalia's distinguished contributions and \nservice to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1274-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN MATTHEWS\n\n Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor John \nMatthews on his recent retirement from Madison Teachers Incorporated, \nMTI, after serving the local teachers union for an impressive 48 years \nas executive director. Hired in 1968 as MTI's first executive \nsecretary, a title subsequently changed to executive director, it is \nbelieved that John is one of the longest serving full-time heads of a \nteachers' union in the country.\n  Formed as the Madison Education Association, MEA, in the 1930s, MTI \nserved as a predominantly professional organization until 1964 when it \nbecame certified as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for \nteachers serving in the Madison Metropolitan School District, MMSD. In \nrapid succession, the first professional negotiations committee, PNC, \nwas elected in 1965, followed by a name change to Madison Teachers \nIncorporated, MTI, in 1966. With an expanding membership of \napproximately 1,125, MTI realized the need for professional staff, \nhiring John to lead their efforts in June of 1968.\n  Growing up in Billings, MT, as the son of the State budget director \nand the grandson of a Montana Supreme Court justice, John began to \ndevelop his passion for fighting injustice within his grandfather's \nchambers, as well as in and around the Montana State Capitol. In 1968, \nas a high school history and English teacher, John almost immediately \nfound himself involved in negotiations regarding health care coverage \nfor teachers. It was a path that would define both the man and his \ncareer in a profound way.\n  His almost five decades as MTI executive director have been dedicated \nto protecting MTI's employees and the teachers of Madison's public \nschools. His strong belief in the power of contracts, especially in a \nschool district where contracts govern schools, has guided his every \ndecision. Under his leadership, MTI has negotiated for the enforcement \nof strong contracts that uphold and strengthen the rights of teachers. \nHis undeniable dedication to the teachers' union has been demonstrated \nin his fiery leadership style and tenacity to speak out and protect \nworkers' rights to collectively bargain.\n  Described by others as engaged, insightful, and ever ready to not \nonly listen to teachers' concerns but act on them, John's leadership \nexemplifies an unwavering dedication to the rights of public school \nteachers and public workers. His success in leading MTI is evidenced by \nthe positive actions and outcomes achieved by organized labor, \nparticularly in a State where the role of unions has recently been \nchallenged.\n  Over the years, I have been honored to stand in solidarity with John \non the issues and am proud to call him my friend. On the occasion of \nhis retirement, I am pleased to recognize John Matthew's longstanding \ndedication to Madison Teachers Incorporated and his fight to protect \nthe rights and personal livelihood of the Madison teachers he served. \nHe has impacted lives through his constant engagement, personal \nkindness, and fiery leadership. I wish John and his family all the best \nin his retirement and happiness for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1274-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT TIM LINGLE\n\n Mr. DAINES.

In 1985, she moved to Las \nVegas, beginning her experience in broadcast journalism for southern \nNevada at KTNV. In 1988, Ms. Francis joined KLAS's news team, initially \nstarting her extended tenure with the news station as a health \nreporter. After proving to be an invaluable resource to the news team, \nshe moved into the anchor chair. During her time on air, Ms. Francis \nplaced a special emphasis on health care issues, familiarizing viewers \nwith important health information, in addition to bringing southern \nNevada breaking news coverage.\n  Throughout her tenure, Ms. Francis was recognized as Best TV Anchor \nin Las Vegas by Las Vegas Review Journal readers more than 15 times and \nwas inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters Association hall of fame and \nthe KLAS TV Hall of Fame. Ms. Francis went above and beyond in her \nambitions to bring Nevadans up-to-date and truthful news coverage. The \naccolades she has received are awarded to only the greatest of Nevada \njournalists, and without a doubt, she deserves each one.\n  For the past 30 years, Ms. Francis has been a tremendous contributor \nto southern Nevada journalism. Her commitment to the local community is \nwithout question, creating a great amount of trust between the viewers \nand the station. She stands as a role model to journalists across \nNevada with her unwavering dedication to familiarizing herself with the \nlocal issues. The knowledge she gained throughout her tenure is \nirreplaceable to the newsroom. Ms. Francis's legacy both at KLAS and \nwithin Nevada journalism will be felt for years to come.\n  Outside of her career, Ms. Francis continues to be highly involved in \na number of activities for the betterment of the local community. She \nis a founding member of the Nevada chapter of the International Women's \nForum and serves as a member of the board of trustees for the Shade \nTree Endowment Fund.

It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years of \ndedication to creating growth and success for northern Nevada's \nbusiness community.\n  Before joining the Chamber, Mr. Stevens served as a basketball coach \nfor 34 years, guiding teams at both Washington State University and the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno successfully through numerous seasons. In \n2002, he was chosen for the role of CEO at the Chamber, and he served \nthe State of Nevada in this position for over a decade. As CEO, Mr. \nStevens led the Chamber through challenging times, including the merger \nof chambers of commerce in Reno and Sparks. This merger, which was one \nof the largest and most complex mergers in northern Nevada history, led \nto creation of the Chamber in 2011. This incredible organization has \nhelped businesses through times of economic downturn to stay on their \nfeet and succeed. Through the incredible work of the Chamber, northern \nNevada's business community continues to thrive and maintain a high \nquality of life for residents. We are fortunate to have had someone \nlike Mr. Stevens leading the way at this important establishment.\n  Throughout his tenure, Mr. Stevens served as a powerful voice, \nadvocating for businesses across northern Nevada.

Under his leadership, the Chamber \nsaw consistent growth in membership, as well as additional \nopportunities for business leaders to come together.

Mr. President, last month, one of New \nHampshire's most respected veteran journalists retired after two \ndecades of prolific work at the Coos County Democrat, a weekly \nnewspaper based in Lancaster, in my State's North Country. I have had \nthe privilege of knowing Edith and admiring her work since I first ran \nfor Governor in 1996. In particular, I have respected her extraordinary \nwork ethic. She was the only full-time reporter with the Democrat, \noften filing several stories a day. At times, the front page would be \nfilled with stories carrying her byline.\n  No story was too big or too small for Edith. She covered Presidential \ncampaigns, select board meetings, festivals, factory openings, and, \namong her last stories, a characteristically detailed and colorful \narticle on a proposal to renew bobcat hunting in the North Country.\n  Over the years, Edith became a fixture on the landscape of New \nHampshire's first-in-the-Nation primary. Presidential candidates knew \nthat to gain credibility with North Country voters, they needed to \nsuccessfully navigate a grilling from Edith. She has been a regular \npublic affairs commentator on ``The Exchange with Laura Knoy,'' a \npopular New Hampshire Public Radio call-in show.\n  As State Representative Rebecca Brown, a longtime colleague of hers, \nnoted: ``Edith embraced small town reporting. She was indefatigable, \nincluding putting countless miles on the old Jeep, in which she took to \ncarrying a step ladder in case she needed to get a better camera \nvantage over a taller crowd.''\n  Edith speaks with unrivaled knowledge and insight about her beat, the \nNorth Country. No reporter has better captured the struggle and \nindomitable spirit of that region. In her early years with the \nDemocrat, her stories documented the pain and upheaval of too many \ndevastating factory closings and job losses. More recently, she has \ncovered heartening stories of new businesses and development projects \nflowing to the region, creating new jobs and opportunities.\n  In many retirement tributes, Edith Tucker has been described as a \nNorth Country institution and icon, but I suspect Edith would prefer to \nbe recognized simply as a skilled, hard-working beat journalist, always \ndetermined to get the story right and keep her community informed.

A bill to direct the Director of the Government Publishing \nOffice to provide members of the public with Internet access to \nCongressional Research Service reports, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I are introducing \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation to make reports published by the \nCongressional Research Service, CRS, available to the American public \nonline. This legislation will open up an invaluable, taxpayer-funded \nresource for use by schools, universities, researchers, libraries, and \nindividuals across the country.\n  The CRS was founded more than 100 years ago to provide comprehensive, \nnon-partisan information on vital issues affecting national policy. In \n2015, CRS issued over 1200 new reports and updated almost 2500 existing \nproducts, on matters ranging from the structure of government agencies, \nto summaries of legislative proposals, foreign policy primers, and \neverything in between. These reports are posted on an internal website \nfor use by Members of Congress and their staff, but they are not \ndistributed directly to the public. In an informal arrangement that is \nall too familiar in Washington, this unnecessary restriction has \ncreated a cottage industry of services that make copies of the reports \navailable to lobbyists for a subscription fee. Schools and the general \npublic cannot access them, nor do readers know whether the scattering \nof CRS reports they can find online through third-party websites are \nauthentic, complete, or up-to-date. That's not very `public' and does \nnothing for the average citizen in Vermont or the rest of the country \nwho does not have easy access to Washington.\n  Our bipartisan, bicameral legislation stops this unequal access by \nproviding for CRS Reports to be published online in a comprehensive \nfree, and searchable database on the website of the Government \nPublishing Office, GPO. This straightforward but important step has \nlong been called for by libraries, educators, and public interest \ngroups across the country. It is also supported by retired and former \nCRS employees, who note that ``CRS reports are widely available on \nCapitol Hill to staff and lobbyists alike, are released with no \nexpectation of confidentiality, and could be of immense value to the \ngeneral public.''\n  The century-old CRS was founded on the principles of nonpartisanship \nand respect for accurate, thoughtful information to inform the policy \nconversations of the day. It is a testament to the best ideals of \nCongress, and all Americans should benefit from the work and resources \nit provides. When I think of my grandchildren working on research \nreports for school, I want them to have access to this resource. I also \nwant the American people to know what information their Members of \nCongress are receiving on leading policy issues of the day.\n  The legislation includes several important measures--responsive to \nconcerns from CRS--to ensure that only appropriate materials are shared \nonline. It makes clear that the GPO website will include only final, \nnon-confidential CRS Reports and similar written, non-confidential CRS \nproducts that are intended for general Congressional distribution. It \nfirmly excludes from publication any memoranda or other custom \nmaterials that CRS provides in response to a research request from an \nindividual Member of Congress. The bill allows for identifying \ninformation for individual CRS researchers to be redacted so that CRS, \nnot individual staffers, is the named author of a work. It also \nrequires the inclusion of a written notification in all CRS Reports to \nexplain that the materials were prepared by CRS for use by Congress, \nand should not be relied upon for purposes other than public \nunderstanding of information that has been provided by CRS to Members \nof Congress in connection with CRS's institutional role.\n  This is an exciting time for the Library of Congress and its \ndivisions such as CRS. For the first time since 1987, the President has \nnominated, and I hope the Senate Rules Committee will soon consider, a \nnew Librarian of Congress to lead one of the largest libraries in the \nworld. As we move further into the digital age, now is an important \nmoment to consider the promise of this great American institution and \nthe resources it provides.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his long partnership with me on this \neffort, as well as Representatives Lance and Quigley who today are \nintroducing bipartisan companion legislation in the House. I hope \nmembers will join us in supporting this straightforward, but important, \nstep to make CRS reports available to the public so that all Americans \nmay enjoy this invaluable resource equally.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 22, 2015.\n       Dear Chairman Blunt, Chairman Capito, Chairman Miller, \n     Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Schumer, Ranking Member \n     Schatz, Ranking Member Brady, Ranking Member Wasserman \n     Schultz, and Vice Chairman Harper: We are former employees of \n     the Congressional Research Service (CRS), with more than a \n     collective five hundred years with the agency. We write in \n     strong support of timely, comprehensive free public access to \n     CRS reports. In doing so, we distinguish between CRS reports, \n     which are non-confidential, and other CRS products, such as \n     memoranda, which are confidential.\n       CRS plays a vital role in our legislative process by \n     informing lawmakers and staff about important policy issues. \n     To that end, nothing should impair CRS's ability to provide \n     confidential support to members of Congress, such as through \n     briefings and confidential memoranda. Nor should Congress \n     take any steps to weaken the Constitutionally-protected \n     status of CRS's work product. In contrast, CRS reports are \n     widely available on Capitol Hill to staff and lobbyists \n     alike, are released with no expectation of confidentiality, \n     and could be of immense value to the general public.\n       Longstanding congressional policy allows Members and \n     committees to distribute CRS products to the public, which \n     they do in a variety of ways. In addition, CRS provides \n     reports upon request to the judicial branch, to journalists, \n     and to the executive branch, which often publishes them on \n     agency websites. Insiders with relationships to congressional \n     staff can easily obtain the reports, and well-resourced \n     groups pay for access from third-party subscription services. \n     Members of the public, however, can freely access only a \n     subset of CRS reports, usually via third parties.\n       It is difficult for the public to know the scope of CRS \n     products they could obtain from Congress. A Google search \n     returned over 27,000 products including 4,260 hosted on .gov \n     domains, but there is no way to know if those documents are \n     up to date, whether the search is comprehensive, or when the \n     documents might disappear from view.\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\n       We believe Congress should provide a central online source \n     for timely public access to CRS reports. That would place all \n     members of the public on an equal footing to one another with \n     respect to access. It would resolve concerns around public \n     and congressional use of the most up-to-date version. \n     Additionally, it would ensure the public can verify it is \n     using an authentic version. And it would diminish requests to \n     analysts to provide a copy of the most recent report. Other \n     legislative support agencies, i.e., the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the Government Accountability Office, publish non-\n     confidential reports on their websites as a matter of course. \n     Doing so does not appear to harm their ability to perform \n     their mission for Congress.\n       We thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts on \n     implementing full public access to non-confidential CRS \n     reports. If you wish to discuss this further, please contact \n     Daniel Schuman, Demand Progress policy director, at \n     daniel@demandprogress.org, or Kevin Kosar, R Street Institute \n     senior fellow and governance director, at kkosar@rstreet.org. \n     Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           With best regards,\n         Henry Cohen, George Costello, Heather Durkin, Gregg \n           Esenwein, Louis Fisher, Peggy Garvin, Bernie Gelb, \n           Jeffrey C.

Longstanding congressional \n     policy allows Members and committees to use their websites to \n     disseminate CRS products to the public, although CRS itself \n     may not engage in direct public dissemination. This results \n     in a disheartening inequity. Insiders with Capitol Hill \n     connections can easily obtain CRS reports from any of the \n     20,000 congressional staffers and well-resourced groups can \n     pay for access from subscription services. However, members \n     of the public can access only a small subset of CRS reports \n     that are posted on an assortment of not-for-profit websites \n     on an intermittent basis. Now is the time for a systematic \n     solution that provides timely, comprehensive free public \n     access to and preservation of non-confidential reports while \n     protecting confidential communications between CRS and \n     Members and committees of Congress.\n       CRS reports--not to be confused with confidential CRS \n     memoranda and other products--play a critical role in our \n     legislative process by informing lawmakers and staff about \n     the important issues of the day. The public should have the \n     same access to information. In 2014 CRS completed over 1,000 \n     new reports and updated over 2,500 existing products. (CRS \n     also produced nearly 3,000 confidential memoranda.)\n       Our interest in free public access to non-confidential CRS \n     reports illustrates the esteem in which the agency is held. \n     CRS reports are regularly requested by members of the public \n     and are frequently cited by the courts and the media. For \n     example, over the last decade CRS reports were cited in 190 \n     federal court opinions, including 64 at the appellate level. \n     Over the same time period, CRS reports were cited 67 times in \n     the Washington Post and 45 times the New York Times. CRS \n     reports often are published in the record of legislative \n     proceedings.\n       Taxpayers provide more than $100 million annually in \n     support of CRS, and yet members of the public often must look \n     to private companies for consistent access. Some citizens are \n     priced out of these services, resulting in inequitable access \n     to information about government activity that is produced at \n     public expense.\n       In fact, while CRS generates a list of all the reports it \n     has issued over the previous year, it silently redacts that \n     information from the public-facing version of its annual \n     report, making it difficult for the public to even know the \n     scope of CRS products they could obtain from Congress. A \n     Google search returned over 27,000 reports including 4,260 \n     hosted on .gov domains, but there is no way to know if those \n     documents are up to date, what might be missing, or when they \n     might disappear from view.\n       Comprehensive free public access to non-confidential CRS \n     reports would place the reports in line with publications by \n     other legislative support agencies in the United States and \n     around the globe. The Government Accountability Office, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Law Library of Congress, and \n     85% of G-20 countries whose parliaments have subject matter \n     experts routinely make reports available to the public.\n       We hasten to emphasize that we are not calling for public \n     access to CRS products that should be kept confidential or \n     are distributed only to a small network on Capitol Hill. \n     Memoranda produced at the request of a Member or committee \n     and provided to an office in direct response to a request \n     should remain confidential unless the office itself chooses \n     to release the report. By comparison, we believe no such \n     protection should attach to reports typically published on \n     CRS' internal website or otherwise widely disseminated.\n       We value the work of CRS and in no way wish to impede its \n     ability to serve Congress. CRS reports already undergo \n     multiple levels of administrative review to ensure they are \n     accurate, non-partisan, balanced, and well-written. Authors \n     of every CRS product are aware of the likelihood that reports \n     will become publicly available.\n       We do not make a specific recommendation on who should \n     comprehensively publish non-confidential CRS reports online, \n     although the approaches outlined in H. Res. 34 (114th \n     Congress) and S. Res. 118 (111th Congress) are reasonable. \n     The Clerk of the House, the Secretary of the Senate, the \n     Government Publishing Office (GPO), the Library of Congress \n     and libraries in the Federal Depository Library Program \n     (FDLP) are all reasonable places for the public to gain \n     access to these documents. Even bulk publication on GPO's \n     website would be a major step forward.\n       We ask only that all non-confidential reports be published \n     as they are released, updated, or withdrawn; that they be \n     published in their full, final form; that they are freely \n     downloadable individually and in bulk; and that they be \n     accompanied by an index or metadata that includes the report \n     ID, the date issued/updated, the report name, a hyperlink to \n     the report, the division that produced the report, and \n     possibly the report author(s) as well.\n       In the attached appendix we briefly address concerns often \n     raised by CRS regarding public access to reports. In doing \n     so, we note that many committees, including the Senate Rules \n     Committee, have published CRS reports on their websites. \n     Also, that many CRS reports are available through third \n     parties. We urge you to give great weight to the significant \n     public benefit that would result from comprehensive, timely \n     access.\n       We welcome the opportunity to further discuss implementing \n     systematic public access to non-confidential CRS reports. \n     Please contact Daniel Schuman, Demand Progress policy \n     director, at daniel@demandprogress.org, or Kevin Kosar, R \n     Street Institute senior fellow and governance director, at \n     kkosar@rstreet.org.

They are an invaluable resource \n     to Congress in its efforts to oversee our massive federal \n     government and hold it accountable.\n       Members of Congress and their staff have easy access to CRS \n     reports. So too do lobbyists and other Beltway insiders, who \n     often pay for the reports through expensive subscription \n     services. But taxpayers cannot easily get copies of CRS \n     reports.\n       This policy is unfair and outdated. It also stands in stark \n     contrast to other legislative branch agencies: both the \n     Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability \n     Office release their reports to the public.\n       Making CRS reports easily accessible by the public will \n     increase transparency in government, and allow everyday \n     citizens access to important information that will better \n     educate them on the issues before Congress. The bottom line \n     is taxpayers pay for these reports. It is only fair that they \n     have easy access to them.\n           Sincerely,\n         Phil Kerpen, President, American Commitment; Grover \n           Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform; Norm \n           Singleton, President, Campaign for Liberty; Neil \n           Bradley, Chief Strategy Officer, Conservative Reform \n           Network; Tom Schatz, President, Council for Citizens \n           Against Government Waste; Adam Brandon, President and \n           CEO, Freedom Works; Michael Needham, CEO, Heritage \n           Action for America; Michael Ostrolenk, Co-Founder, \n           Liberty Coalition; Brandon Arnold, Executive Director, \n           National Taxpayers Union; Jerry Taylor, President, \n           Niskanen Center; Kevin Kosar, Senior Fellow and \n           Director of the Governance Project, R Street Institute; \n           David Williams, President, Taxpayers Protection \n           Alliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1281-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 385--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT OF \n  ASTRONAUT SCOTT JOSEPH KELLY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE \n ADMINISTRATION AS THE FIRST PERSON OF THE UNITED STATES TO COMPLETE A \n                   CONTINUOUS 1-YEAR MISSION IN SPACE\n\n  Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Peters, and Mr. \nMenendez) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 385\n\n       Whereas Scott Joseph Kelly was born on February 21, 1964, \n     to Richard and Patricia Kelly in Orange, New Jersey, and \n     raised in West Orange, New Jersey;\n       Whereas Scott Kelly received--\n       (1) a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering \n     from the State University of New York Maritime College in \n     1987; and\n       (2) a Master of Science degree in aviation systems from the \n     University of Tennessee in 1996;\n       Whereas in July 1989, Scott Kelly was designated as a naval \n     aviator in Beeville, Texas, and subsequently made overseas \n     deployments aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to--\n       (1) the North Atlantic Ocean;\n       (2) the Mediterranean Sea;\n       (3) the Red Sea; and\n       (4) the Persian Gulf;\n       Whereas since completing training at the United States \n     Naval Test Pilot School in June 1994, Scott Kelly has--\n       (1) logged over 8,000 hours in not fewer than 40 different \n     aircraft and spacecraft; and\n       (2) made not fewer than 250 carrier landings;\n       Whereas in 2012, Scott Kelly retired from the Navy as a \n     captain;\n       Whereas since being selected by the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``NASA'') for astronaut training in 1996, Scott Kelly has \n     served--\n       (1) in 1999, as a pilot of the Space Shuttle Discovery on \n     STS-103 to service the Hubble Space Telescope;\n       (2) in 2007, as Mission Commander of the Space Shuttle \n     Endeavor on STS-118 to the International Space Station \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``ISS'');\n       (3) as a flight engineer for ISS Expedition 25;\n       (4) as the Commander of ISS Expedition 26; and\n       (5) as a 1-year crew member of ISS Expeditions 43, 44, 45, \n     and 46, including 6 months of service as Commander;\n       Whereas on March 27, 2015, Scott Kelly launched into space \n     for a 340-day mission aboard the ISS;\n       Whereas during his 340-day voyage aboard the ISS, Scott \n     Kelly--\n       (1) remained in continuous orbit around the Earth;\n       (2) achieved the longest continuous amount of time that a \n     United States astronaut has spent living in space;\n       (3) in addition to his regular duties of ISS maintenance, \n     participated in hundreds of scientific studies; and\n       (4) conducted 3 space walks;\n       Whereas Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in \n     space while his identical twin brother, former NASA astronaut \n     Mark Kelly, acted as a human control specimen on Earth, \n     providing an understanding of the physical, behavioral, \n     microbiological, and molecular reaction of the human body to \n     an extended period of time in space, which could--\n       (1) be pivotal for the United States goal for humans to \n     explore Mars; and\n       (2) contribute to unforeseen scientific innovations that \n     benefit all of humanity;\n       Whereas the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly--\n       (1) generated new insight into how the human body adjusts \n     to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of \n     long-duration space flight; and\n       (2) will help support astronaut physical and mental well-\n     being during longer space exploration missions in the future;\n       Whereas Scott Kelly completed the 340-day mission with \n     Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, embodying peaceful \n     international cooperation in outer space;\n       Whereas on March 1, 2016, Scott Kelly touched down on \n     Earth, ending his 340-day space voyage; and\n       Whereas, the 1-year mission of Scott Kelly marks a \n     significant step in reaching the goals of NASA of future \n     missions to Mars, elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration astronaut Scott Kelly for--\n       (A) the historic achievement in completing a 1-year mission \n     in space; and\n       (B) a successful return to Earth, the United States, and \n     his family;\n       (2) recognizes that--\n       (A) the 1-year mission of Scott Kelly contributed to \n     research on the effects of long-duration space flight on the \n     human body and mind; and\n       (B) continuing studies of human health are critical to \n     future human exploration of space; and\n       (3) applauds the contributions of the 1-year journey in \n     space of Scott Kelly to the scientific progress of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1281-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1281-S1282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 386--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES SHOULD ESTABLISH A GOAL OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENT CLEAN AND \n CARBON-FREE ELECTRICITY BY 2030 TO AVOID THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE \n CHANGE, GROW THE ECONOMY, INCREASE SHARED PROSPERITY, IMPROVE PUBLIC \n    HEALTH, AND PRESERVE THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Coons, Mr. Wyden, \nMrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Nelson, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Merkley, Mr. \nUdall, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Markey, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Warren, \nMr. King, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Carper) submitted the \nfollowing resolution;

Lancaster wrote that, when engineering \n     the Historic Columbia River Highway, Lancaster aimed ``to \n     find . . . the points where the most beautiful things along \n     the line might be seen to the best advantage, and if possible \n     to locate the road in such a way as to reach them'';\n       Whereas the Historic Columbia River Highway is an \n     engineering masterpiece that successfully used innovative \n     engineering techniques to complement the magnificent natural \n     landscape of the Columbia River Gorge;\n       Whereas the Historic Columbia River Highway showcases all \n     aspects of the rich and diverse natural landscape of Oregon, \n     including Multnomah Falls, the fourth-largest waterfall in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the construction of a water-level route through the \n     Columbia River Gorge, now Interstate 84, destroyed many \n     sections of the Historic Columbia River Highway;\n       Whereas, in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area \n     Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-663; 100 Stat. 4274), Congress \n     directed the Oregon Department of Transportation to prepare a \n     program to preserve and restore the Historic Columbia River \n     Highway for public use as a historic road;\n       Whereas the State of Oregon is working to connect intact \n     and usable highway segments with recreation trails, where \n     feasible, to create a continuous historic road route through \n     the Columbia River Gorge that links local, State, and Federal \n     recreation facilities; and\n       Whereas the continued preservation and restoration of the \n     Historic Columbia River Highway will provide greater access \n     to the Columbia River Gorge for recreation and tourism, which \n     will help to boost the economies of the region: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Historic Columbia River Highway on \n     its 100th year;\n       (2) recognizes the cultural, economic, and environmental \n     importance of the Historic Columbia River Highway;\n       (3) expresses support for the continued success of the \n     restoration of the Historic Columbia River Highway; and\n       (4) requests that the Secretary of the Senate prepare an \n     official copy of this resolution for presentation to Senator \n     Wyden, Senator Merkley, and Kevin Gorman of Friends of the \n     Columbia Gorge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1282-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1282-S1283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 388--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nMarkey, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. Gillibrand, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Warren, Mr. Murphy, \nand Ms. Cantwell) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 388\n\n       Whereas, in March 2016, there are more than 3,640,000,000 \n     women in the world;\n       Whereas women around the world--\n       (1) have fundamental rights;\n       (2) participate in the political, social, and economic \n     lives of their communities;\n       (3) play a critical role in providing and caring for their \n     families;\n       (4) contribute substantially to economic growth and the \n     prevention and resolution of conflict; and\n       (5) as farmers and caregivers, play an important role in \n     the advancement of food security for their communities;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas, on July 28, 2015, in Mandela Hall at the African \n     Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the President told \n     individuals in Africa--\n       (1) ``if you want your country to grow and succeed, you \n     have to empower your women. And if you want to empower more \n     women, America will be your partner''; and\n       (2) ``girls cannot go to school and grow up not knowing how \n     to read or write--that denies the world future women \n     engineers, future women doctors, future women business \n     owners, future women presidents--that sets us all back'';\n       Whereas 2015 marked the 20th anniversary of the adoption of \n     the Beijing Declaration at the Fourth World Conference on \n     Women, in September 1995, which reaffirmed--\n       (1) the commitment of the international community to the \n     full implementation of the rights of women and girls as an \n     inalienable, integral, and indivisible part of all human \n     rights; and\n       (2) that local, regional, national, and global peace is \n     attainable and inextricably linked to the advancement of \n     women, who are a fundamental force for leadership, conflict \n     resolution, and the promotion of lasting peace at all levels;\n       Whereas 2016 will mark the 5-year anniversary of the \n     establishment of the first United States National Action Plan \n     on Women, Peace, and Security, which includes a comprehensive \n     set of commitments by the United States to advance the \n     meaningful participation of women in decisionmaking relating \n     to matters of war or peace;\n       Whereas the first United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security states that, ``Deadly conflicts \n     can be more effectively avoided, and peace can be best forged \n     and sustained, when women become equal partners in all \n     aspects of peace-building and conflict prevention, when their \n     lives are protected, their experiences considered, and their \n     voices heard.'';\n       Whereas there are 58 national action plans around the \n     world, and there are 15 national action plans known to be in \n     development;\n       Whereas at the White House Summit on Countering Violent \n     Extremism in February 2015, leaders from more than 60 \n     countries, multilateral bodies, civil society, and private \n     sector organizations agreed to a comprehensive action agenda \n     against violent extremism that--\n       (1) highlights the importance of the inclusion of women in \n     countering the threat of violent extremism; and\n       (2) notes that ``women are partners in prevention and \n     response, as well as agents of change'';\n       Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict \n     prevention and conflict resolution efforts, despite the \n     proven success of women in conflict-affected regions in--\n       (1) moderating violent extremism;\n       (2) countering terrorism;\n       (3) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation and \n     negotiation; and\n       (4) stabilizing societies by improving access to peace and \n     security--\n          (A) services;\n          (B) institutions; and\n          (C) venues for decisionmaking;\n       Whereas peace negotiations are more likely to end in a \n     peace agreement when women's groups play an influential role \n     in the negotiation process;\n       Whereas studies show that a peace agreement is 35 percent \n     more likely to last not less than 15 years if women \n     participate in the development of the peace agreement;\n       Whereas according to the Bureau of International Narcotics \n     and Law Enforcement Affairs of the Department of State, the \n     full and meaningful participation of women in security forces \n     vastly enhances the effectiveness of the security forces;\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2015, the Secretary of State and the \n     Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of \n     the United Kingdom highlighted, ``our goal must be to build \n     societies in which sexual violence is treated--legally and by \n     every institution of authority--as the serious and wholly \n     intolerable crime that it is. We have seen global campaigns \n     and calls to action draw attention to this issue and mobilize \n     governments and organizations to act. But transformation \n     requires the active participation of men and women \n     everywhere. We must settle for nothing less than a united \n     world saying no to sexual violence and yes to justice, \n     fairness and peace.'';\n       Whereas, in 2014--\n       (1) 700,000,000 women or girls had been married before the \n     age of 18; and\n\n[[Page S1283]]\n\n       (2) 250,000,000 women or girls had been married before the \n     age of 15;\n       Whereas, on October 11, 2013, the President strongly \n     condemned the practice of child marriage;\n       Whereas approximately \\1/4\\ of girls between the ages of 15 \n     and 19 are victims of physical violence;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 1 in 3 women around the world \n     has experienced some form of physical or sexual violence;\n       Whereas according to the 2012 report of the United Nations \n     Office on Drugs and Crime entitled the ``Global Report on \n     Trafficking in Persons''--\n       (1) adult women account for between 55 and 60 percent of \n     all known trafficking victims worldwide; and\n       (2) adult women and girls account for approximately 75 \n     percent of all known trafficking victims worldwide;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, women are \n     subjected to physical or sexual violence, including rape, \n     other forms of sexual violence, and human trafficking, as a \n     weapon of war;\n       Whereas 603,000,000 women live in countries in which \n     domestic violence is not criminalized;\n       Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the President announced the \n     United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based \n     Violence Globally, the first interagency strategy to address \n     gender-based violence around the world;\n       Whereas, in December 2015, the Department of State released \n     a report on the implementation of the United States Strategy \n     to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally that \n     states, ``Addressing GBV is intimately tied to a range of \n     global efforts that address gender equality and women's and \n     girls' empowerment, whether in peacetime or in the midst of \n     conflict. This includes addressing GBV as part of efforts to \n     raise the status of adolescent girls and through women's \n     economic empowerment activities.'';\n       Whereas the ability of women and girls to realize their \n     full potential is critical to the ability of a country to \n     achieve--\n       (1) strong and lasting economic growth; and\n       (2) political and social stability;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific, and Cultural Organization, \\2/3\\ of the \n     775,000,000 illiterate individuals in the world are female;\n       Whereas 150,000,000 children currently enrolled in school \n     will drop out before completing primary school, not less than \n     100,000,000 of whom are girls;\n       Whereas according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, in comparison with uneducated \n     women, educated women are--\n       (1) less likely to marry as children; and\n       (2) more likely to have healthier families;\n       Whereas a goal of the United Nations Millennium Project, to \n     eliminate gender disparity in primary education, was achieved \n     in most countries not later than 2015, but more work remains;\n       Whereas gender equality is 1 of the 17 Sustainable \n     Development Goals adopted at the United Nations Sustainable \n     Development Summit on September 25, 2015;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, women have access \n     to fewer income earning opportunities and are more likely to \n     manage the household or engage in agricultural work than men, \n     making women more vulnerable to economic insecurity caused \n     by--\n       (1) natural disasters;\n       (2) long term changes in weather patterns; or\n       (3) environmental degradation;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank Group, women own or \n     partially own more than \\1/3\\ of small- and medium-sized \n     enterprises in developing countries, and 40 percent of the \n     global workforce is female, but female entrepreneurs and \n     employers have disproportionately less access to capital and \n     other financial services than men;\n       Whereas in the United States, women account for 45 percent \n     of the overall labor force of companies included in the \n     Standard & Poor's 500 Index, and 37 percent of the first or \n     mid-level officials and managers in those companies are \n     women, but--\n       (1) only 25 percent of the executive and senior level \n     officials and managers in those companies are women;\n       (2) women only hold 19 percent of the seats on the boards \n     of those companies; and\n       (3) only 4.6 percent of the Chief Executive Officers of \n     those companies are women;\n       Whereas globally women earn an average of 24 percent less \n     than men;\n       Whereas despite the achievements of individual female \n     leaders--\n       (1) women around the world remain vastly underrepresented \n     in--\n          (A) high-level positions; and\n          (B) national and local legislatures and governments; and\n       (2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women \n     account for only 22 percent of national parliamentarians and \n     17.7 percent of government ministers;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, during \n     the period beginning in 1990 and ending in 2015, global \n     maternal mortality decreased by approximately 44 percent, but \n     approximately 830 women die from preventable causes relating \n     to pregnancy or childbirth each day, and 99 percent of all \n     maternal deaths occur in developing countries;\n       Whereas a target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \n     Development, adopted at the United Nations Sustainable \n     Development Summit on September 25, 2015, is to reduce global \n     maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths for every 100,000 \n     live births not later than 2030;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization--\n       (1) suicide is the leading cause of death for girls between \n     the ages of 15 and 19; and\n       (2) complications from pregnancy or childbirth is the \n     second-leading cause of death for those girls;\n       Whereas the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees reports that approximately \\1/2\\ of--\n       (1) refugees and internally displaced or stateless \n     individuals are women; and\n       (2) the 59,500,000 displaced individuals in the world are \n     women;\n       Whereas it is imperative--\n       (1) to alleviate violence and discrimination against women; \n     and\n       (2) to afford women every opportunity to be full and \n     productive members of their communities;\n       Whereas, on October 10, 2014, Malala Yousafzai became the \n     youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate for her work \n     promoting the access of girls to education; and\n       Whereas March 8, 2016, is recognized as International \n     Women's Day, a global day--\n       (1) to celebrate the economic, political, and social \n     achievements of women in the past, present, and future; and\n       (2) to recognize the obstacles that women face in the \n     struggle for equal rights and opportunities: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of International Women's Day;\n       (2) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of a country to \n     generate--\n       (A) economic growth;\n       (B) sustainable democracy;

Res. 389\n\n       Whereas lymphedema is a condition that--\n       (1) occurs when--\n          (A) the natural lymphatic drainage system of the body is \n     damaged, blocked, or does not develop properly; and\n          (B) the lymphatic fluid within a certain area, such as \n     the arm, leg, torso, head, or neck, is unable to drain \n     properly;\n       (2) results in extreme swelling that impairs mobility and \n     function; and\n       (3) can cause pain and significantly impair the quality of \n     life of the affected individual;\n       Whereas the total number of individuals living with or at \n     risk for lymphedema is difficult to establish because \n     lymphedema is underreported and often misdiagnosed;\n       Whereas the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of lymphedema \n     patients costs healthcare providers and healthcare insurers, \n     including the Medicare program, millions of dollars each year \n     because if lymphedema is left untreated--\n       (1) the potential for infection is greatly increased;\n       (2) infection may occur in the course of a few hours; and\n       (3) immediate treatment on an emergency basis is required;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that--\n       (1) more than 150,000,000 individuals worldwide have \n     secondary lymphedema; and\n       (2) 120,000,000 individuals worldwide are infected with \n     lymphatic filariasis, which leads to lymphedema;\n       Whereas Stanford University estimates that as many as \n     10,000,000 individuals in the United States are affected by \n     lymphedema;\n       Whereas lymphedema can--\n       (1) as primary lymphedema, be inherited and either be \n     present at birth or manifest itself later in life; or\n       (2) as secondary lymphedema, develop after cancer \n     treatment, radiation therapy, major\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\n     surgery, severe burn, or certain other traumatic injuries, \n     including injuries affecting combat-tested veterans of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that a high percentage of elderly cancer survivors \n     will develop lymphedema;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute predicts that, not \n     later than 2020--\n       (1) the number of cancer survivors aged 65 or older will \n     increase by 42 percent; and\n       (2) as many as 3,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries that are \n     cancer survivors will require treatment for lymphedema;\n       Whereas lymphedema affects an estimated 15 percent of all \n     cancer survivors and 40 percent of all breast cancer \n     patients; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of the financial, physical, and \n     psychological impact that lymphedema has on each individual \n     afflicted with lymphedema, it is incumbent on the people of \n     the United States to support--\n       (1) each courageous individual living and coping with \n     lymphedema, a debilitating condition; and\n       (2) each caregiver, whether a professional or not a \n     professional, of each individual afflicted with lymphedema: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that each tireless \n     advocate and healthcare provider that spends much time and \n     many resources battling lymphedema, a painful and destructive \n     condition that affects many individuals, should be \n     recognized; and\n       (2) the Senate designates March 6, 2016, as ``World \n     Lymphedema Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/03/senate-section/article/S1284-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 390--DESIGNATING MARCH 3, 2016 AS ``WORLD WILDLIFE \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 390\n\n       Whereas wildlife has provided numerous economic, \n     environmental, social, and cultural benefits during the \n     course of human history, and wildlife conservation will \n     secure these gifts for future generations;\n       Whereas plant and animal species play an important role in \n     the stability of diverse ecosystems around the world, and the \n     conservation of this biodiversity is critical to maintain the \n     delicate balance of nature and keep complex ecosystems \n     thriving;\n       Whereas observation of wild plants and animals in their \n     natural habitat provides individuals with a more enriching \n     world view and a greater appreciation of the wonders of the \n     natural environment;\n       Whereas tens of millions of individuals in the United \n     States strongly support the conservation of wildlife, both \n     domestically and abroad, and wish to ensure the survival of \n     species in the wild, such as rhinoceroses, tigers, elephants, \n     pangolins, turtles, seahorses, sharks, ginseng, mahogany, and \n     cacti;\n       Whereas the trafficking of wildlife, including timber and \n     fish, comprises the fourth largest global illegal trade after \n     narcotics, the counterfeiting of products and currency, and \n     human trafficking, and has become a major transnational \n     organized crime with an estimated worth of as much as \n     $19,000,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas increased demand in Asia for high-value illegal \n     wildlife products, particularly elephant ivory and rhinoceros \n     horns, has recently triggered substantial and rapid increases \n     in poaching of these species, particularly in Africa;\n       Whereas trafficking of wildlife is a primary threat to many \n     wildlife species, including elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, \n     pangolins, and sharks;\n       Whereas many different kinds of criminals, including some \n     terrorist entities and rogue security personnel, often in \n     collusion with corrupt government officials, are involved in \n     wildlife poaching and the movement of ivory and rhinoceros \n     horns across Africa;\n       Whereas wildlife poaching presents significant security and \n     stability challenges for military and police forces in \n     African nations that are often threatened by heavily armed \n     poachers and the criminal and extremist allies of those \n     poachers;\n       Whereas wildlife poaching negatively impacts local \n     communities that rely on natural resources for economic \n     development, including tourism;\n       Whereas penal and financial deterrents can improve the \n     ability of African governments to reduce poaching and \n     trafficking and enhance their capabilities of managing their \n     resources;\n       Whereas assisting institutions in developing nations, \n     including material, training, legal, and diplomatic support, \n     can reduce illegal wildlife trade;\n       Whereas wildlife provides a multitude of benefits to all \n     nations, and wildlife crime has wide-ranging economic, \n     environmental, and social impacts;\n       Whereas, between 2010 and 2013, the number of elephants \n     killed in Africa by poachers is estimated to have been \n     100,000 out of a remaining population of roughly 500,000 \n     elephants;\n       Whereas, from 2007 to 2012, the number of elephants killed \n     in Kenya increased by more than 800 percent, from 47 to 387 \n     elephants killed;\n       Whereas the number of forest elephants in the Congo Basin \n     in Central Africa declined by approximately \\2/3\\ between \n     2002 and 2012, placing forest elephants on track for \n     extinction in the next decade;\n       Whereas the number of rhinoceroses killed by poachers in \n     South Africa increased by almost 10,000 percent between 2007 \n     and 2014, from 13 to more than 1,200 rhinoceroses killed;\n       Whereas as few as 3,200 tigers remain in the wild \n     throughout all of Asia;\n       Whereas pangolins are often referred to as the most \n     trafficked mammal in the world and all 8 pangolin species \n     spanning Africa and Asia are faced with extinction because \n     pangolin scales are sought after in the practice of \n     traditional Chinese medicine and pangolin meat is considered \n     a delicacy;\n       Whereas approximately 100,000,000 sharks are killed \n     annually, often targeted solely for their fins, and \n     unsustainable trade is the primary cause of serious \n     population decline in several shark species, including \n     scalloped hammerhead sharks, great hammerhead sharks, and \n     oceanic whitetip sharks;\n       Whereas the United States is developing and implementing \n     measures to address the criminal, financial, security, and \n     environmental aspects of wildlife trafficking;\n       Whereas Congress has allocated specific resources to combat \n     wildlife trafficking and address the threats posed by \n     poaching and the illegal wildlife trade;\n       Whereas, in December 2013, the United Nations General \n     Assembly proclaimed March 3 as World Wildlife Day to \n     celebrate and raise awareness of the wild fauna and flora \n     around the world;\n       Whereas March 3, 2016 represents the third annual \n     celebration of World Wildlife Day;\n       Whereas, in 2016, the theme of World Wildlife Day is ``The \n     future of wildlife is in our hands''; and\n       Whereas, in 2016, World Wildlife Day commemorations will \n     ``celebrate the many beautiful and varied forms of wild fauna \n     and flora, raise awareness of the multitude of benefits that \n     wildlife provides to people, and raise awareness of the \n     urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime, \n     which has wide-ranging economic, environmental, and social \n     impacts'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 3, 2016 as ``World Wildlife Day'';\n       (2) supports raising awareness of the benefits that \n     wildlife provides to people and the threats facing wildlife \n     around the world;\n       (3) supports escalating the fight against wildlife crime, \n     including wildlife trafficking;\n       (4) applauds the domestic and international efforts to \n     escalate the fight against wildlife crime;\n       (5) commends the efforts of the United States to mobilize \n     the entire Government in a coordinated, efficient, and \n     effective manner for dramatic progress in the fight against \n     wildlife crime; and\n       (6) encourages continued cooperation between the United \n     States, international partners, local communities, nonprofit \n     organizations, private industry, and other partner \n     organizations in an effort to conserve and celebrate \n     wildlife, preserving this precious resource for future \n     generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url":
