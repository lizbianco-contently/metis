Mr. President, it was really quite something to watch \nPresident Obama's party vote to filibuster his top domestic legislative \npriority yesterday. That is what we saw right here in the Senate. It \nleft pretty much everyone scratching their heads.\n  The Democratic leader made clear yesterday that he was not interested \nin debating the ``merits of the bill.'' In other words, he told us that \nthis filibuster is for political reasons only.\n  It makes sense, considering that this filibuster is all about \nappeasing a facts-optional crowd on the left that hasn't been able to \nmarshal much of a serious, fact-based argument to support its \nopposition to more American exports and more American trade jobs.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. It is President Obama who said \nthe far left's arguments don't ``stand the test of fact and scrutiny.'' \nIt is President Obama who says the far left is just ``making stuff \nup.'' And it is President Obama who warns the far left about ``ignoring \nrealities.''\n  In other words, hardly anyone believes there is a serious policy leg \nfor these folks to stand on--not that there is a viable process excuse \nfor this filibuster, either.\n  A senior Senator in the Democrat leadership essentially rebutted the \nlatest process argument yesterday. He said: ``[N]o one disputed in \ncommittee that we'd get a vote separately''--separately--``on the \ncustoms bill'' because it contained a provision, he said, that would \nbring down TPA.\n  What we can infer from this is that the demand to merge four separate \ntrade bills--including the Customs bill--into one trade bill isn't a \nstrategy designed to pass better trade legislation but a poison pill \ndesigned to kill it. So we certainly won't be doing that, because our \ngoal here should be to score a serious policy win for the American \npeople and not claim a symbolic scalp for the extreme left.\n  That is why Republicans have chosen to work closely with President \nObama to advance a serious trade and economic growth agenda. It is not \na natural position for us, I assure you, or for the President to be in \npolitically, but we agree that strengthening the middle class by \nknocking down unfair trade restrictions is a good idea. Since we agree \non the policy, I think we have a duty to the American people to \ncooperate responsibly to pursue it. And that is just what we have done. \nNot a single Republican--not one--voted yesterday against at least \nopening the debate on this 21st century American trade agenda.\n  Now, all that is needed to move forward is for our Democratic friends \nwho tell the public they support trade to withdraw support for a \nfilibuster they know is wrong on the merits.\n  Yes, I understand it may be uncomfortable for our Democratic \ncolleagues to cross loud factions in their party, but Republicans \nproved yesterday that it is possible to put good policy over easy \npolitics.\n  So Democrats have to choose. Will they allow themselves to keep being \nled around by the most extreme elements of their party, even when it \nruns counter to the needs of their constituents, or will they take a \nstand and lead? The American people are counting on them to make the \nright choice.\n  When they do, they will find the same willing partners who have \nalways been here. They will find we are ready to continue working \nacross the aisle in good faith to move forward.\n  Recall that we have only gotten as far as we have already because of \na significant bipartisan compromise on\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\nChairman Hatch's part. He worked very closely with Senator Wyden to \nhammer out a trade package that garnered an astonishing 20 votes in the \nFinance Committee, with just 6 Senators opposed--just 6. That huge \nlevel of bipartisan support really surprised everybody. We have seen \nsome unfortunate partisan rear-guard action since then that is designed \nto sink these American trade jobs. But we can rise above it. That is \nwhy Republicans remain committed to carrying forward the kind of \nbipartisan momentum we saw over in the Finance Committee, just as we \nhave been all along on other issues. We are happy to work with any \nSenator in a serious way. The door is open.\n  I have made clear that there would be an open amendment process. I \nhave made clear that Senators would receive fair consideration once we \nproceed to debating this bill. The bipartisan path forward I offered \nyesterday morning is still on the table. I remain committed to the \nsignificant concession my party already made about processing TPA and \nTAA. I don't like TAA. I think it is a program very hard to defend. But \nI understand that if we are going to get TPA, our friends on the other \nside need TAA. If Chairman Hatch and Senator Wyden can agree to other \npolicies, we can consider those, too. What we won't be doing is \npursuing poison-pill strategies such as the one I mentioned already.\n  Let's also agree that no Senator is in a position to guarantee that \nsome bill can clear both Houses of Congress, receive a signature from \nthe President, secure the blessings of the Supreme Court, and whatever \nelse our friends might demand. This wouldn't be much of a democracy if \nSenators could actually make such an impossible guarantee.\n  So look, we want to have a serious discussion. We want to actually \nget a good policy outcome. That has always been our goal. I hope more \nwill now join us to allow debate on the trade discussion our \nconstituents deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2816-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have heard the expressions ``red \nherring'' and ``loss leader,'' all these terms that try to focus \nattention someplace where it shouldn't be focused. That is basically \nwhat the Republican leader has done this morning.\n  He, of course, misconstrued what I said on the floor yesterday. I \nsaid that I am not here to debate the intricacies of this trade bill. \nSome can do that better than I. I have no qualms about saying that \nabout myself. It is a very specialized area. But I do understand that \nthe debate was not taking place because we were not on the bill. I said \nthat I understand the procedure around here--and I do.\n  The procedure is pretty simple. It is a fact that virtually all \nlegislation that passes the Senate needs major bipartisan support. This \nyear is an example. Nearly every bill passed by the Senate has enjoyed \nthe support of over 90 percent of Senate Democrats. It is just a \nreality that the 114th Congress will take Democratic votes to get \nthings done.\n  Many Democrats don't support fast-track. I don't. The vast majority \nof Democrats don't. But without following all of the loss leaders, the \nred herrings the Republican leader threw out, the Finance Committee \nreported out four bills, and it is only logical we consider all four of \nthem.\n  I have said, and I say it again, it is only logical we take the \nRepublican leader's words for what they are. He said: Let's get on the \nbill, and then we will start the amendment process.\n  Well, we can't start the amendment process very well if we are not \nhaving an opportunity to amend and change the bills that aren't there. \nThey would just be thrown to the winds. That is, Customs is very \nimportant and enforcement and, of course, the situation dealing with \nAfrican trade.\n  We put a reasonable alternative on the table for Senate Republicans \nto accept. All the Republican leader needs to do is say yes, and we can \nopen debate on these trade bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2816-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2816-S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week there were celebrations all around \nthe world celebrating the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.\n  Here in our Nation's capital, we celebrated the day that Europe was \nofficially liberated. Just outside of the Capitol, dozens of World War \nII aircraft flew up and down the Mall honoring and celebrating the end \nof the war that engulfed Europe--over the Lincoln Memorial, the \nNational World War II Memorial, the Washington Monument, over the \nCapitol, and points in between.\n  I grew up in a little town and I was a little boy, but I can still \nremember the war ending. I don't really remember what I remember, but I \nknew it was something that was important to everybody there. It was a \nbig deal in Searchlight, as it was everyplace in America. The war was \nat an end. Americans were thankful that the war was over. They were \nthankful that their fathers, sons, brothers, and--yes, Mr. President--\nWorld War II daughters were able to come home. They had fought \nvaliantly on battlefields across the world, and they would be coming \nhome--as I mentioned, the women, the WAVES, the WACs, and SPARS--all \nthese women, thousands and thousands who participated in the war, for \nthat manner.\n  Across America we were all happy that freedom and democracy had \nprevailed over a regime that was fueled by hatred.\n  I heard on the radio this morning a brief account of Winston \nChurchill. That was many years ago, 70 years ago today giving a speech. \nHe had only been Prime Minister 3 days, and he gave one of his most \nfamous speeches, about all he had to offer. They were engulfed in this \nwar. They were doing it alone. It was a stunning speech that history \nwill always remember. But after that war was over, we were happy. \nEngland was happy. Freedom and democracy had prevailed over a regime \nthat was fueled by hatred.\n  As I got older and could understand a little more, I first became \nreally focused on World War II. I am sorry to say I did not do it until \nI was in college, but I remember it as if it were 5 minutes ago, \nlooking at those pictures in the book ``The Rise and Fall of the Third \nReich'' by William Shirer. Those pictures I will never ever forget. I \ncan see them now in my mind's eye. In that book, there were pictures of \nthe liberation of the concentration camps.\n  I learned how the world learned of the enormity of the Holocaust, the \ngenocide of 6 million Jews. The world saw the incredible extent to \nwhich the Nazis had taken their hatred of the Jews. It is hard to \ncomprehend, but nothing--nothing--could adequately describe how \nhorrible the situation was. Sadly, though, as I look around the world \ntoday, there are still glimpses of that same hate that we as a human \nrace had hoped to extinguish those seven decades ago.\n  It is not always on the front pages of the press or on the television \nsets, but it is still there. Hate wears many masks: violence, \nintimidation, segregation, vile rhetoric, and, of course, \ndisenfranchisement. Anti-Semitism is that and more. Though it assumes \ndifferent identities, in the end, it is still hate. It pains me to say \nthere seems to be a resurgence of anti-Semitism across the world. I \nlook at Israel and I see the vicious attacks carried out against \ninnocent Jews there: the slaughter of Jewish worshipers in a Jerusalem \nsynagogue last November; Hamas's campaign of terror, indiscriminately \ntargeting innocent Israelis with their thousands and thousands of \nrockets.\n  I look at Europe and see the heinous acts being perpetuated there \nagainst Jews. For example, in the Netherlands, the home of a prominent \nrabbi was attacked twice in one week. In Paris,\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\nhundreds and hundreds of protesters attacked synagogues, smashed the \nwindows of Jewish shops and cafes, and set several afire. In France, \nthere was also an attack on a Jewish grocery store following the \nCharlie Hebdo shootings. Anti-Semitic slogans, such as ``Gas the Jews'' \nhave been shouted at several demonstrations throughout Germany. Jewish \nmuseums throughout Norway were forced to close because of fear of \nattacks.\n  I look at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva and am \nsickened by its long history of bias against Israel and the people of \nIsrael. Then I see what is happening on some college campuses here in \nthe United States, and I am shocked by the vitriol being directed at \nJews and supporters of Israel.\n  Last Sunday, the New York Times reported that in the midst of campus \ndebates about boycotts of Israel, Jewish students felt increasingly \nintimidated. At several colleges, swastikas have been painted on the \ndoors of Jewish fraternities and in some instances on the doors of Jews \nwho were in their rooms. Some Jewish students feel the need to hide \ntheir heritage and support for Israel given the intense backlash. That \nis sad.\n  The former president of the University of California system, Mark \nYudof, recently was quoted as saying:\n\n       Jewish students and their parents are intensely \n     apprehensive and insecure about this movement. I hear it all \n     the time: Where can I send my kids that will be safe for them \n     as Jews?\n\n  That is just stunning. Bigotry and hatred have no place in the world \ntoday, especially not in a country that has long prided itself on being \na beacon of freedom and acceptance. Instead, it is incumbent upon all \nAmericans to not only stand up to anti-Semitism wherever we see it but \nalso to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people.\n  Three things: Let's stand against anti-Semitism; let's stand with \nIsrael and the Jews throughout the world; and, third, let's stand \nagainst hate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2817-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. REID. I want to say a brief word about something I mentioned as I \nstarted my remarks. My friend, the Republican leader, has stated that \nthe extreme left is causing a problem on this bill. It is not the \nextreme left. It is Democrats who are concerned about the middle class.\n  We do not focus here on the middle class. Republicans are focused \nelsewhere. We have done nothing on minimum wage, and we have done \nnothing on student debt. We have done nothing on equal pay for men and \nwomen. We have done nothing to create jobs--nothing. We are here. In a \nmatter of 1 week or 2 weeks, the authorization for highways will be \ngone. It is different than other authorizations we do because under the \nlaw we passed previously, when that law expires, there is no contract \nauthority, and that program will come to a screeching halt. We have a \nfew dollars left to carry on for a few more weeks, but it will not be \nspent.\n  It is a shame my friend, the Republican leader, keeps referring to \nthe extreme left--whatever that means--when we start talking about the \nmiddle class. That is one reason we are concerned about this trade bill \nthat is before us today.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2817-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the threat from \nNorth Korea to U.S. national security and to our friends and allies in \nEast Asia.\n  On May 9, North Korea claimed it had test-fired a ballistic missile \nfrom a submarine, raising concerns across the region. If these reports \nare accurate, experts point out that North Korea may have succeeded for \nthe first time in installing a missile launcher of about 2,500 tons \nonto a submarine.\n  If that is true, with this test, North Korea violated a series of \nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions, including resolutions \n1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094.\n  According to a more cautious assessment from South Korean officials, \nit appears North Korea will be able to deploy a fully operational \nsubmarine capable of launching a ballistic missile in only 4 to 5 \nyears. This launch is the latest confirmation of Pyongyang's growing \nnuclear and ballistic missile capabilities while the Obama \nadministration seems to have fallen asleep at the switch with regard to \nour policy to deter the growing North Korea threat.\n\n  According to the Director of National Intelligence's 2015 Worldwide \nThreat Assessment, ``North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs \npose a serious threat to the United States and to the security \nenvironment in East Asia.''\n  We should remember North Korea has already tested nuclear weapons on \nthree separate occasions--2006, 2009, and in February of 2013. Most \nrecently, nuclear experts have reported that North Korea may have as \nmany as 20 nuclear warheads, a number that could double by next year, \nand that Pyongyang has the potential to possess as many as 100 warheads \nwithin the next 5 years.\n  We know North Korea is a nuclear proliferator. They cooperated with \nthe Syrian regime on their nuclear weapons program before Israeli jets \ndestroyed that facility in 2007. We know North Korea's conventional \narsenal is rapidly expanding and threatens not only our close allies in \nSouth Korea and Japan but could also threaten the United States, our \nhomeland, in the near future.\n  According to the DNI, ``North Korea has also expanded the size and \nsophistication of its ballistic missile forces, ranging from close-\nrange ballistic missiles to ICBMs, while continuing to conduct test \nlaunches. In 2014, North Korea launched an unprecedented number of \nballistic missiles.''\n  The DNI report goes on to say that ``Pyongyang is committed to \ndeveloping a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of \nposing a direct threat to the United States.'' We should not forget \nthat North Korea is an aggressive, ruthless regime that is not even \nafraid to kill its own innocent people.\n  On March 26, 2010, North Korean missiles sank the South Korean ship \nCheonan, killing 46 of her crew, and several months later shelled a \nSouth Korean island, killing four more South Korean citizens. It is \nalso quickly developing other tools of intimidation as well, such as \ncyber capabilities, as demonstrated by the attack on the South Korean \nfinancial and communication systems in March of 2013 and the infamous \nSony Pictures hacking incident in November of 2014.\n  We should also not forget that this regime remains one of the world's \nforemost abusers of human rights. The North Korean regime maintains a \nvast network of political prison camps where as many as 200,000 men, \nwomen, and children are confined to atrocious living conditions and are \ntortured, maimed, and killed.\n  On February 7, 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Council released \na report detailing North Korea's horrendous record on human rights. \nHere is a description of some of the torture methods common in North \nKorea as described by former North Korean state security officials \ninterviewed for the report.\n\n       The room had wall shackles that were specially arranged to \n     hang people upside down. Various other torture instruments \n     were also provided, including long needles that would be \n     driven underneath the suspect's fingernails and a pot with a \n     water-hot chili pepper\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n     concoction that would be poured into the victim's nose. As a \n     result of such severe torture, suspects would often admit to \n     crimes they did not commit.\n\n  This report makes for horrifying reading and gives us a glimpse of \nthe utter depravity of this regime. What then is the U.S. policy to \ncounter North Korea's belligerence and human rights abuses? The answer \nis precious little.\n  The administration's policy of strategic patience has been a failure. \nAll that our so-called patience has done is allowed the regime to \nsignificantly advance its military capabilities and to systematically \ncontinue to torture its own people.\n  I call on the administration to immediately reverse course and begin \nthe process of applying more pressure to the North Korean regime \nthrough additional financial sanctions, increased military engagement \nwith our allies in the region, and more assertive diplomacy with China, \nwhich wields significant control over the fate of the regime.\n  We should never negotiate with Pyongyang without imposing strict \npreconditions that North Korea take immediate steps to halt its nuclear \nprogram, cease all military provocations, and make credible steps \ntoward respecting human rights of its people.\n  We should not forget that in a deal with the United States over 20 \nyears ago, North Korea pledged to dismantle their nuclear program. \nToday, we are reaping the harvest of failed policies of engagement with \na regime that has no respect for international agreements or \ninternational norms.\n  As it negotiates with other rogue states that seek to obtain nuclear \nweapons to threaten the free world, I urge the administration to draw \nthe appropriate conclusions from our failed North Korea policy.\n  As we talk about human rights violations and violations of \ninternational norms, there was a report printed yesterday with the \nheadline ``North Korea Said to Execute a Top Official, With an \nAntiaircraft Gun.'' This is a country violating human rights, killing \nits own people, and willing to watch as its own people starve to death. \nNow there is a report that they are killing people with anti-aircraft \nguns. This is a regime that doesn't deserve strategic patience but \ndeserves the full commitment of the United States in our efforts to \nmake sure we are bringing peace to the region and long-term peace to \nthe world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2818-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2818-S2819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, last week we passed an important bill \nthat protected the rights of the American people. It said the people in \nCongress have a right to be involved in an agreement the President \nnegotiates on Iran's nuclear program. Well, that was an important piece \nof legislation, and I was glad to see it passed with overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  The bill on trade promotion authority, which we have been talking \nabout this week, is also very important. This bill is about U.S. trade \nwith other countries and the proper role Congress should play in that. \nIt is also very much about America's future, and that is why \nRepublicans are so committed to this piece of legislation.\n  The problem is Senate Democrats have pulled the rug out from under \nthe American people and the President. They blocked the Senate from \neven considering this important piece of legislation. This is not the \nnormal story of Democrats v. Republicans or Senator Reid v. Senator \nMcConnell. Oh, no. This is a story about Senator Reid v. President \nObama.\n  America's economy grew by just 0.2 percent in the first quarter of \nthis year. When the Democratic leader orders the Senators on his side \nof the aisle to block this bill, is he saying the American people \nshould be satisfied with 0.2 percent growth? Is that satisfaction?\n  If we are going to get America's economy going and growing again, we \nneed to increase opportunities for America's farmers, ranchers, and \nmanufacturers to sell their products overseas.\n  According to the Commerce Department, 95 percent of the world's \ncustomers live outside the United States. That means there are billions \nof people around the world who want to buy American products, and that \nmeans creating jobs for Americans who make those products. It means \nlower prices for many of the products Americans want to buy at home. It \nmeans more money for the American economy, which is good for all of us. \nNow, all of that comes from more U.S. trade with other countries.\n  The bill we are debating right now is very important to American \nfamilies and to the American economy. Trade promotion authority is a \nvaluable tool. It helps make sure there are strong rules that hold \nother countries accountable for their unfair trade practices. It also \nhelps us forge agreements to tear down the barriers that block American \ngoods from foreign markets. The sooner we renew trade promotion \nauthority, the sooner American families can start reaping the benefits.\n  It is outrageous Senate Democrats are keeping us from taking this \nstep to help these families all across the country. The benefits of \ntrade are substantial for places such as my home State of Wyoming.\n  Exports from Wyoming to other countries amounted to almost $2 billion \nlast year--$2 billion. The Wyoming chemical industry alone exported \nnearly $1 billion worth of material.\n  One of our most important chemical exports is soda ash, which is a \nchemical used to make things such as glass and detergents. It is the \nlargest inorganic chemical export in the United States, and it is \nresponsible for thousands of American jobs. Our producers face high \ntariffs in some countries, and they are competing with China for the \ncustomers.\n  If we pass this bill and follow that up with the kind of trade deals \nit allows, we could add another $40 million in new soda ash exports, \nand that means a lot of jobs here at home.\n  Trade promotion authority helps give American producers a fair chance \nto compete for business overseas.\n  In Wyoming, our farmers and ranchers also export beef, lamb, and \ngrain. We export machinery, minerals, and energy from our oil and gas \nproducers. Wyoming's presence in the global marketplace has been \nincreasing, and we as a nation cannot afford to stop that progress now. \nWe need more access to more markets and we need fair competition.\n  So the question is: Why are the Democrats standing in the way of all \nof that? Democrats are blocking more than just the money for American \nworkers and our economy. Economic prosperity itself strengthens our \nNation and makes it more secure.\n  Ronald Reagan once said: ``Our national security and economic \nstrength are indivisible.'' He understood that national defense is \nexpensive and that America needs a strong economy to pay for it. Reagan \nunderstood that American trade with other countries can help strengthen \nour military alliances as well. American goods sold overseas provide an \nAmerican presence all around the world. They are economic boots on the \nground.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, said something similar in a \nspeech last month. He said: ``Our military strength ultimately rests on \nthe foundation of our vibrant, unmatched, and growing economy.''\n  He said the kinds of trade deals this bill would promote are ``as \nimportant to me as another aircraft carrier.'' Now, that is the current \nSecretary of Defense agreeing with what President Ronald Reagan said \nyears ago.\n  The Defense Secretary also talked about what all of us in the Senate \nknow to be true: If America does not continue to lead in global \ncommerce and does not attract more trading partners, someone else will. \nMore likely than not, that is going to be China.\n  America needs to step up and start negotiating effective, fair, and \nenforceable trade agreements or we are going to be allowing China to \nwrite the rules for global trade. If that happens, every Senator here \nknows those rules will not favor American workers and American exports. \nSenate Democrats know that, and they are still standing in the way of \nthis legislation.\n  Last year, our exports supported nearly 12 million American jobs. \nThat is an increase of 2 million jobs since 2009. It is great news, but \nit is not enough.\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n  According to the latest numbers that came out last Friday, there are \nanother 17 million Americans who are either unemployed, are working \npart time because they cannot find full-time work or have absolutely \ngiven up and stopped looking for a job. There are 17 million Americans \nwho are waiting for our economy to really start growing again.\n  We need to create more stable, long-term jobs for those Americans who \nhave been left behind by the weak economy over the past 6 years. More \nU.S. trade with other countries can help make that happen. This trade \npromotion authority bill is the first step toward reaching that goal \nand Democrats know that. Why then are they fighting so hard to make \nsure this bill fails? Why are they fighting so hard to block those \njobs? This legislation would give the President a clear roadmap--a \nroadmap to follow while negotiating trade deals. It also ensures that \nCongress and the American people have a say about whether a deal goes \nthrough. That part is extremely important.\n\n  I mentioned the fight we just had with the White House to make sure \nthe American people and Congress can review an agreement with Iran over \nits nuclear program. Well, this bill says right up front that Congress \nwill get to have an up-or-down vote on any trade deals.\n  This isn't about expanding the powers of the President. I know a lot \nof Senators have serious concerns about how President Obama has abused \nhis authority in unchecked and unprecedented ways. A lot of Americans \nhave those same concerns. This bill is not just about this President. \nIt is about the next President and the one after that. It is about \nAmerican workers, American families, and growing the American economy \nfor all of us. It is about making sure America continues to lead and \nAmericans continue to prosper. American exports to other countries are \nthe key to this. This bill on the floor right now can make sure all of \nthat happens, and it makes sure the American people have their say.\n  It is time for Senate Democrats to call off their destructive fight \nwith the President. It is time for Senate Democrats to stop blocking \ntrade, stop blocking jobs, and stop blocking progress for American \nfamilies and for our economy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on May 4, 2015, Officer Brian Moore was \nkilled in the line of duty. This was an exceptional young police \nofficer in New York City. He was young enough that he still lived in \nhis father's home, but he was experienced enough, old enough that he \nhad already become a decorated officer in the NYPD and had made over \n150 arrests since joining the department just 5 years ago.\n  Commissioner Bill Bratton said: ``In his very brief career, he \nalready proved himself to be an exceptional young officer.''\n  We have heard a lot about law enforcement gone wrong, but the reality \nis that every single day police officers are under threat and they are \nin danger.\n  All Brian Moore did on the evening of May 2 was pull up behind \nsomeone who was acting in a suspicious manner, and as they began \ntalking to him, the man turned and fired at the car. Officer Moore was \nstruck in the cheek. He had trauma to his brain. Ninety minutes after \nthe shooting, officers arrested the man who perpetrated this crime. He \ndid it with a stolen weapon--one of 23 weapons that were stolen in a \n2011 robbery at Little's Bait & Tackle Pawn Shop in Perry, GA.\n  Detective Mike Cerullo said of him:\n\n       He was a great kid. I can't say a bad thing about him. He \n     always had a smile on his face.\n\n  Officer Moore was an officer who was rising through the ranks very \nquickly and who was beloved in his community. He grew up on Long \nIsland, tragically and ironically in a town with an athletic field at \nthe high school named after Edward Byrne--another alumnus of that high \nschool who was killed in the line of duty as a 22-year-old rookie in \n1988. That name may be familiar to us because we now hand out millions \nof dollars in Byrne grants all across the country--another alumni of \nthis particular high school shot down.\n  Brian is one of 86 people across this country who are killed by guns \nevery day--2,600 a month and 31,000 a year. Not every single one of \nthese deaths is preventable. I don't know whether Brian Moore's was \npreventable. But what I know is that many of these deaths are \npreventable, that there has to be a reason why these numbers are so out \nof whack with every single other country in the industrialized world. A \nlot has to do with the reality of this place, that as these numbers \ncontinue to go up day after day, month after month, year after year at \ncatastrophic levels, we do absolutely nothing about it.\n  We have to start thinking about not just the cost to the families--\nand it is not just the mother and the father and the brother and the \nsister. If we look at the pictures of Brian Moore's funeral, they are \nheartbreaking, seeing the tragedy that is washing over the family \nmembers.\n  The average homicide by gun has 22 different victims who are affected \nby it. It often leads to cycles of violence in which there are killings \nfor retribution, in which the trauma spirals lives of children and \nbrothers and sisters downward.\n  Let's look for a second at the cost of one murder. Here are some \nnumbers overall. A recent study showed that the annual cost of gun \nviolence in America is $229 billion with a ``b.'' That is $47 billion \nmore than Apple's 2014 worldwide revenue. But here is the cost of just \none murder--$441,000 in direct costs. Eighty-seven percent of it is \npaid for by taxpayers. It costs over $400,000 to lock up the \nperpetrator, $2,000 when he is charged and sentenced, $11,000 for \nmental health treatment for the victim's families, $10,000 for the \nvictim's hospital expenses, $450 just to transport to the hospital, and \nthen $2,000 for police response and investigations.\n  That is not why we should take on the issue of gun violence in this \ncountry; we should do it simply to try to stop this scourge of murders. \nBut if we care about being a good steward of the taxpayers' dollars, \nthen $441,000 a year that could be saved just by eliminating one of the \n86 a day seems like a pretty good deal.\n  Jose Araujo, from Milford, CT, was working for Burns Construction \nCompany in Bridgeport when he was shot at his job on a construction \nsite after a suspect asked for a job and he was referred to the company \noffice. He started to head for the office, but then he turned around \nand shot Jose.\n  A family friend said:\n\n       He was a gentle giant. Wherever he walked in there was a \n     smile on his face. He always gave you a strong handshake.\n\n  Another friend said:\n\n       He's nice, generous and a man of peace.\n\n  Jose's girlfriend said:\n\n       He was such a great person and if the world had more people \n     like him--oh, what a beautiful world we would live in.\n\n  Jose leaves behind a 5-year-old son.\n  Sanjay Patel was killed on April 6 in New Haven, CT. He was just \nworking, as millions of other Americans do, putting in his hours as a \nmanager at a CITGO gas station, when he was shot four times by an \napparent robber at the station. The perpetrators took money and store \nmerchandise. Specifically, they stole a box of cigars. They killed this \nguy over a box of cigars.\n  Sanjay's wife was 6 months pregnant at the time. He told her he \ndidn't want her to work while she was pregnant, in part because she had \nbeen injured in a house fire last year. In a tearful interview, she \nsaid her husband took excellent care of her and the baby. He brought \nher ice cream and breakfast in bed. ``This is my first baby,'' she \nsaid, ``and my husband was so happy.''\n  The stats are overwhelming, whether it be the number of people who \nare killed by guns or the cost to U.S. taxpayers. I try to come to the \nfloor every couple of weeks just to give voice to the victims of gun \nviolence, figuring that if the numbers don't move this place, maybe the \nstories of those who are lost will. I can only tell a few a\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\nday, but, frankly, it would take me more time than we have here for \ndebate on the floor to tell 86 stories every single day.\n  This isn't just about the fact that I come from Newtown, CT; this is \nabout the fact that there is a regular drumbeat of gun violence \nthroughout this country. By doing nothing in the Senate and the House \nweek after week, month after month, year after year, we effectively \nbecome complicit in these murders. We silently endorse this epidemic of \ngun violence when we don't even try to make gun trafficking illegal at \na Federal level; when we don't stand with 90 percent of the American \npublic and the vast majority of gun owners--80 to 90 percent--and \nsimply say you shouldn't be able to get a gun if you are a criminal and \nyou have to prove you are not a criminal before you get a gun; when we \ndon't endorse simple gun safety technology to make sure the gun that \nwas used to kill Officer Moore can't be used by someone who isn't its \nintended user, its owner, the technology developing--we could help; we \ncould assist--that would cut down on stolen firearms that are used to \nkill and hurt people.\n  I will keep coming down to the floor whatever chance I get to tell a \nhandful of these tragic stories from Connecticut, to New York, to \nChicago, to Los Angeles, giving voices to the victims of gun violence \nso that someday, somehow, the Senate will recognize that although we \ncan't eliminate these numbers, although we can't bring them down to \nzero, with smart, commonsense legislation, we can make sure these \nnumbers are much lower than they are today and that there is much less \ntragedy visited on American families and much less cost to American \ntaxpayers.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all across the country right now people are \nhonoring the men and women who serve in law enforcement as we honor \nNational Police Week. I was the cochair of the Senate Law Enforcement \nCaucus. Senator Coons and I founded that caucus when we came to the \nSenate a little over 4 years ago. I am proud to be able to speak on \nbehalf of those who serve and their families.\n  I just had a meeting with the Federal Law Enforcement Association to \ntalk about the challenge of these jobs and the challenge to families \nand the importance of understanding the moment you are in. One of the \nobservations I made to them--going back to some legislation I worked on \na few years ago to allow police officers to carry their weapons when \nthey went from State to State--is that you may not remember everybody \nthat you arrested, but everybody you arrested remembers you.\n  The vulnerability of police and their families is sometimes equal to \nand sometimes exceeds the vulnerability of those of us whom the police, \nevery day, step up to protect. This is a week when we really take a \nmoment to recognize that. We take a moment to recognize those who \nserve. I want to pay tribute today particularly to two Missouri \nofficers who were killed in the line of duty last year: Deputy Sheriff \nMatthew Chism of the Cedar County Sheriff's Office and Officer Eddie \nJohnson of the Alton Police Department.\n  Deputy Sheriff Chism, of Stockton, MO, was tragically killed in \nNovember of last year. He was 25 years old. Deputy Sheriff Chism was \nshot and killed while conducting a traffic stop. He had served with the \nCedar County Sheriff's Office for just under 2 years. Deputy Sheriff \nChism is survived by his wife and his young son. Clearly, that family \nhas paid a tremendous price for the willingness of their husband and \nfather to step up and defend us.\n  Officer Eddie Johnson, Jr., of Alton, MO, was involved in a fatal \nvehicle crash while responding to a structure fire on October 20 of \nlast year. In addition to being an officer with the Alton Police \nDepartment, Officer Johnson also served as the fire chief of the \nvolunteer fire department and as a reserve deputy for the Oregon County \nSheriff's Department. He was 45 years old. He is survived by his wife \nand their three children.\n  So difficult things happen to those who serve. We saw two of our \nofficers, the St. Louis County police officers at Ferguson, MO, who \nwere shot recently as someone was shooting into a crowd there \nexpressing concern about police activity. But the very people trying to \nbe sure that the crowd was able to express that concern were then the \nvictims of violence that has not yet been really figured out--why the \nperson who fired those shots was shooting at a crowd, whether he was \nshooting specifically at police in that crowd or just shooting into the \ncrowd or what that person was doing.\n  The desire of people who serve and put on that uniform every day is \nto serve and protect. That is their No. 1 goal, I am confident, in \nvirtually every case in taking that job. The No. 1 hope of their family \nis that those people come home safely at the end of their shift. You \nknow, life is uncertain in many ways, but more uncertain when you \nactually decide you are going to pursue a service to others that puts \nyou intentionally in harm's way--people who are not only prepared to \nserve but willing to serve, prepared to stand in the way of danger to \nothers but willing to stand in the way of danger to others. It is a \ndetermination of what to do that other people don't make and don't bear \nthe responsibility the same way. So it is important for us right now to \nthink about those who serve.\n  I was glad to join Senator Cardin as a cosponsor, with others, of the \nNational Blue Alert Act--the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue \nAlert Act. This bill created a national alert system to apprehend \nviolent criminals who have seriously injured or killed police officers. \nThese two officers were killed while in their squad car. This alert \nsystem would be used to quickly get that information to other police \nagencies and to the public, as they are trying to find someone who \nwould think about doing that sort of thing.\n  We passed that bill on April 30. The House of Representatives passed \nit yesterday. It is now on the way to the President's desk. It is a \ngood thing for us to step up and be willing to do. This is a job where \nyou go to work every day not knowing what is likely to happen that \nday. We saw events in my home State, in Ferguson, MO, last August that \nbrought attention to the danger that police face.\n\n  I heard even the President talking about Baltimore just a few days \nago. He made the comment that we have difficulty in communities and \ndifficulty in people's lives--people who are not prepared for \nopportunities and they do not get opportunities. The President said \nsomething like this: And then we send the police into those \nenvironments, and we act surprised when bad things happen, when \nunfortunate things happen, when violence occurs, when police are in the \nmiddle of a situation that suddenly does not work out the way any of us \nwould want it to.\n  Police are dealing with major problems. I cosponsored with Senator \nStabenow last year the Excellence in Mental Health Act, trying to be \nsure that we are dealing with people's behavioral health problems like \nwe deal with all other physical health problems. One out of four adult \nAmericans has a behavioral health problem that is diagnosable--\naccording to the NIH, almost always treatable--and then one out of nine \nhas a behavioral health problem that severely impacts how they function \nas an individual, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n  We have no greater support of that effort to try to begin to try to \ntreat behavioral health like all other health than the police \norganizations around the country that stepped forward and have said: \nThis is a problem that we deal with all the time, and there are better \nways to deal with it than expecting police officers to deal with \nsomeone whose behavioral health problem leads them to violence or into \nanother situation.\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\n  By the way, people with behavioral health problems are more often the \nvictims of violence than they are the perpetrators of violence. So \noften this is part of what we ask police to respond to. We expect \npolice to be psychiatrists and psychologists and first responders and \nexperts at protecting others. Then, we can easily begin to want to \nquestion what equipment they used, what uniform they were told they \nneeded to have on for the exercise that they were about to participate \nin, the public safety moment they were about to be part of.\n  These are hard jobs. They are difficult jobs that often come into the \nmoment of difficulty in other people's lives--people who for whatever \nreason do something that they would normally not do, react in a way \nthat they might normally not react or react out of incredible \nfrustration because of the situation they found themselves in. But we \nexpect the police to step forward and immediately be able to respond to \nthat situation in a way that protects others. Does every police officer \ndo the right thing every time? Probably not. Does almost every police \nofficer do their very best to do the right thing ever time? Absolutely, \nthey do. It is the exceptions that get attention, as they should. But \nfor those of us who every day benefit and benefit in this building from \nthe work they do--I remember on 9/11. One of my memories of 9/11 is \nthat I am one of the last people to leave the Capitol Building and the \npolice officer who is there telling me to get out as quickly as I \ncould. As she says that to me, I realize, as I am leaving the door to \ntry to get to a safer place, she--the police officer who says that I \nneed to get out of here right now--is still standing at the place where \nshe told me: You need to get out of here right now. Whoever else might \nhave been left in the building, she was trying to be sure that they got \nout of the building, too.\n  That is what we expect the police to do. That is what their families \nknow every day when they go to work, that they may be called on to do \nextraordinary things. For those who serve, we are grateful. This is an \nimportant week to be grateful to police officers whom we see and police \nwho are helping us whom we do not see. So I am pleased to be here to \nthank them for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2821-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TRADE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, on another topic, I would just like to say \nthat I hope we can move forward with the ability to have trade \nagreements. I was disappointed yesterday that we were not able to move \nforward and not vote on a trade agreement but to vote on the framework \nthat at some point in the future would allow us to negotiate a trade \nagreement.\n  You cannot get the final negotiation on a trade agreement unless the \npeople with whom you are negotiating know that the trade agreement is \ngoing to be voted on--yes or no--by the Congress. It cannot be an \nagreement that the Congress can go back and look at and say: Well, we \ndo not really like that provision. We do not like this provision. Let's \nsend it back, but let's not do what they said they were willing to do \nas part of this negotiation.\n  Trade is good for us. Trade is in almost all cases about tearing down \nbarriers to our products, because we have very few barriers to those \nthat we trade with. So trade is almost always an opportunity to sell \nmore American products in other countries, particularly as it relates \nto the most likely first agreement we would get if we would get trade \npromotion authority. That agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nwill make a huge difference in the way that part of the world develops, \nif they develop based on a trade relationship where the rule of law \nmatters, a trade relationship where everyone is treated in a way where \nyou are looking for a way to come back and have more ability to work \ntogether in the future, where you are working on trade relationships \nwhere not every ounce of profit has to be made on any one deal, because \nyou are always thinking about what happens next.\n  We have great opportunities there and they do too. That part of the \nworld will be dramatically different 10 years from now and even more \ndifferent 20 years from now, if our system becomes a system that \nbecomes the basis for how they move into their economic future and \ncreate economic opportunity for them and for us--as opposed to the \nother alternatives, which are much more colonial in nature, much more \ncynical in nature, much more likely to be one big trading partner, and \nthere is one little trading partner in every deal.\n  That is not the way this works. That is not the way it should work, \nbut we can't get to that final opportunity for American workers unless \nwe have an agreement where we understand what happens to that agreement \nonce it has been negotiated.\n  The best thing, the best offer does not come until the people on the \nother side of the negotiating table know they are doing this under \ntrade promotion authority, an authority that every President since \nFranklin Roosevelt has had, and every President since Franklin \nRoosevelt asked for, until this President, who didn't ask for it until \nhis second term and then clearly didn't do anything to push for it \nuntil after the congressional elections last year.\n  But this is a 6-year ability to create more opportunities for \nAmerican workers and jobs that provide good take-home pay for American \nworkers. I hope the unfortunate decision not to move forward and get \nthis done is a decision the Senate quickly has a chance to rethink, \nrevote on, and move forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2821-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n             Our Country's Word on the International Stage\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, it has been nearly 2 years since the \nSyrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad attacked his own people with sarin gas, \ncrossing President Obama's so-called red line. At the time, President \nObama grudgingly called for airstrikes against Assad but hesitated at \nthe moment of decision. When Secretary of State Kerry opened the door \nto a negotiated solution, Vladimir Putin barged in, allowing Assad the \npretext of turning over his chemical weapons to avoid U.S. airstrikes. \nThe amen chorus proclaimed a strategic master stroke.\n  But it wasn't so. Street-smart observers were onto Assad's game. He \nonly needed to keep a tiny fraction of his chemical stockpile to retain \nhis military utility. Syria thus could open most--but not all--of its \nfacilities at no cost to the regime.\n  In fact, because most of Syria's chemical agents were old, \npotentially unreliable yet still dangerous, the regime actually \nbenefitted by getting the West to pay for the removal of the old \nstockpiles.\n  And where are we now? Exactly where a few of my colleagues and I \nwarned we would be. News reports just this week indicate that the \nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has discovered new \nevidence of sarin gas and VX nerve agent--9 months after the \norganization declared Syria had disposed of all of its chemical \nweapons. In the meantime, Assad has simply shifted to chlorine gas for \nchemical attacks against his own people, which is also prohibited by \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, even though Syria signed that \nconvention as part of President Obama's deal in 2013.\n  I am appalled by these reports that the Syrian regime has obtained \nstocks of chemical weapons, but I cannot say I am surprised. Anyone \nwith eyes to see knew the message President Obama had sent. When he \nflinched in 2013 in the face of Assad's brazen and brutal\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\nuse of sarin gas on civilians, it only emboldened Assad to continue \ntesting U.S. resolve.\n  Of course, the fallout goes far beyond Syria. The failure to enforce \nthe U.S. red line against the use of chemical weapons in Syria has \nseverely damaged U.S. credibility around the world. I hear this message \nfrom leaders of countries not just in the region but across the globe. \nThe message sounds most loudly with Iran, where the Ayatollahs continue \ntheir headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons capabilities with impunity. \nRegrettably, then, we are reaping the bitter fruits of President \nObama's weakness in 2013.\n  There are two simple lessons we must draw from this sad sequence of \nevents. First, our country's word on the international stage must be \ngood and it must be credible. When a President draws a red line and \nfails to back it up, it only emboldens our enemies and makes America \nappear as the weak horse. Remember, Osama bin Laden famously said that \nwhen given the choice between a weak horse and a strong horse, people \nwill, by nature, root for the strong horse. Under Barack Obama, America \nincreasingly looks like the weak horse.\n  Second, we cannot trust tyrannical regimes to abide by agreements \nunless we force them to do so. This means that any agreement with Iran \nabout its nuclear weapons program must contain the most stringent \nconditions, impose the most intrusive verification procedures, and \nultimately prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability.\n  The framework agreement President Obama has reached with Iran meets \nnone of those standards. Moreover, the administration's concealment of \nSyria's cheating surely foreshadows how it will look the other way when \nIran cheats on any final deal.\n  Assad's cheating on his chemical weapons agreement today is \ndevastating for the people of Syria, but Iran's cheating on a nuclear \nagreement in the future could be catastrophic for the United States and \nthe world at large.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              PATRIOT Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in February, the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center estimated that nearly 20,000 foreign fighters \nhad joined ISIS or other related groups in Syria. Among those, some \n3,000 were from Western countries. In other words, many of them either \nhad American passports or those that are part of the visa waiver \nprogram and could travel, really, without anything other than that \npassport in the country. Over 150 were from the United States.\n  Just last week, in describing the widespread nature of this growing \nthreat, FBI Director James Comey said that the FBI is working on \nhundreds of investigations in the United States, hundreds of \ninvestigations. In fact, according to Comey, all 56 of the FBI's field \ndivisions now have open inquiries regarding suspected cases of \nhomegrown terrorism--again, not people coming from Syria or Afghanistan \nor someplace in the Middle East, these are often Americans who have \nbecome radicalized due to the use of social media or the Internet--much \nas 5 years ago we saw at Fort Hood, TX, a major in the U.S. Army, Nidal \nHasan, who had been radicalized by a cleric, Anwar al-Awlaki.\n  Major Hasan actually pulled out his weapon and killed 13 people, 12 \nuniformed military, 1 civilian, and shot roughly 30 more in a terrible \nterrorist attack at Fort Hood, TX.\n  So today we are not just worried about a major attack on a \nsignificant cultural or economic hub, we also have to worry about ISIS-\ninspired terrorists all around the country, even as we witnessed in my \nhome State of Texas just on May 3.\n  When you begin to look at the story--that I will ask to be made part \nof the Record--written by the New York Times on May 11, 2015, it \nexplains how this new threat of homegrown terrorism is inspired. I will \nquote a few pieces of it:\n\n       Hours before he drove into a Texas parking lot last week \n     and opened fire with an assault rifle outside a Prophet \n     Muhammad cartoon contest, Elton Simpson, 30, logged onto \n     Twitter.\n       ``Follow @_AbuHu55ain,'' Mr. Simpson posted, promoting a \n     Twitter account believed to belong to Junaid Hussain, a young \n     computer expert from Birmingham, England, who moved to Syria \n     two years ago to join the Islamic State and has become one of \n     the extremist group's celebrity hackers.\n\n  Well, there is a question--as the article goes on to say--whether or \nnot Mr. Simpson and his colleague, who came, I believe, from Phoenix, \nAZ, and went on to Garland, TX, to carry out this attack--whether they \nwere actually recruited ahead of time by ISIL or whether ISIL just \nclaimed credit after the fact. But the article goes on to say:\n\n       It was the first time that the terror group had tried to \n     claim credit for an operation carried out in its name on \n     American soil. . . . Yet Mr. Simpson appears to have been \n     part of a network of Islamic State adherents in several \n     countries, including the group's hub in Syria, who have \n     encouraged attacks and highlighted the Texas event as a \n     worthy target.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nfollowing my remarks, this New York Times article from May 11, 2015, \nand a Wall Street Journal article from May 12, 2015, by Michael B. \nMukasey.\n  So what FBI Director Comey has expressed concern about recently is \napparently very real. It is as real as the daily newspaper recounting \nthe attack on May 3 in Garland, TX, of all places.\n  Terrorists are sending a clear signal to those in the United States \nand other Western countries: If you can't fight us abroad, we are going \nto bring the fight to you in your own country.\n  This heightened threat environment has led Pentagon officials to \nraise the security level at U.S. military bases. The last time the \nthreat level was raised to this level was the 10th anniversary of the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  I still remember when the former admiral, Bobby Inman, who served for \na long time in the Navy and then also in the intelligence community, \nwas asked about 9/11. He said: It wasn't so much a failure of \nintelligence, as it was a failure of imagination.\n  Nobody imagined that terrorists would hijack a plane and fly it into \none of our Nation's highest skyscrapers, thus, in the process, killing \napproximately 3,000 people.\n  So we need to remember not to have a failure of imagination when it \ncomes to the tactics used by terrorists and those who inspire them \nabroad. Remarks like those from Director Comey and the Director of our \nNational Counterterrorism Center are certainly troubling ones for us to \nhear, and it counsels caution.\n  While the United States has been mostly successful in thwarting \nattacks on our homeland since 9/11, the threats are still very real. In \nfact, the terrorist threat has evolved and become more complex in \nrecent years.\n  In Texas, we rightly recognize that the role of government should be \nconstrained to focus on core functions. At the Federal level, of \ncourse, this means things such as passing a budget. But surely it also \nmeans protecting our country and its security and the security of the \nAmerican people.\n\n  That brings me to some business that we are going to have to conduct \nhere in the Congress sometime within the next couple of weeks before \ncertain provisions of the U.S. PATRIOT Act expire on June 1. I believe \nthat if we allow these provisions to expire, our homeland security will \nbe at a much greater risk. So I think we need to talk a little bit \nabout it and explain not only the threat but what our intelligence \ncommunity and our national security officials are doing, working with \nCongress and the administration, to make sure Americans are safe, and \nthe PATRIOT Act is part of it.\n  I recognize there are many who perhaps haven't read the PATRIOT Act \nor whose memories have perhaps dimmed since those terrible events on 9/\n11 and who think we don't need the PATRIOT Act. But I would argue that \nthe PATRIOT Act serves as a tool for intelligence and law enforcement \nofficials to protect our Nation from those who are seeking to harm us. \nThree of those useful tools will expire at the end of the month, \nincluding section 215, which allows the National Security Agency to \naccess certain types of data, including phone records.\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\n  There has been a lot of misunderstanding and, frankly, some of it \ndownright deceptive, about what this does, when, in fact, section 215 \nis a business records collection provision that happens to be applied \nto collecting phone records but not the content of phone records. This \nis one of the misleading statements made by some folks who think we \nought to let this provision expire.\n  Right now, under current law, which is set to expire June 1, our \nintelligence community can get basically three types of information \nabout a phone record: the calling and receiving number, the time of the \ncall, and the duration. That is it--no content, no names or addresses. \nYou can't even get cell tower identification that would tell one where \nthe call is coming from.\n  Much has been said about this program, and, as I said, much of it \nmisleading or downright false, but I want to focus now on the oversight \nthat is built into this program because I think Americans understand we \nneed to take steps in a dangerous world to keep the American people \nsafe, but they also value their privacy, and justly so. We all do. So \nit is important to remind the American people and our colleagues as we \ntake up this important provision of law about what we have already \nbuilt into the law to protect the privacy of American citizens who are \nnot engaged in any communication with foreign terrorists or being \ninspired by foreign terrorists to commit acts of terrorism here in the \nhomeland.\n  Let me talk about the barriers we have created in the law for an \nNSA--National Security Agency--analyst to overcome before seeing any \nreal information from this data. First, for the NSA to have access to \nphone records at all--at all--a special court must approve an order \nrequiring telephone companies to provide those call records to the \nAgency. That order has been in place since roughly 2006, where the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the specialized court created \nby Congress for this purpose, has issued an order requiring the \ntelephone companies to turn over these call records--again, no content, \nno name and address, but merely the sending number, the receiving \nnumber, and the duration. That is the core information which is \nrequired.\n  It is important to point out that these records include only the most \nbasic limited information. They do not include the information I \nsuggested earlier--the content, names and addresses, and the like.\n  So the National Security Agency is not, as some have assumed wrongly, \nable to retrieve old phone conversations. They do not collect that sort \nof information, nor are they able to simply listen in on any American's \nphone conversations under this authority. That would be a violation of \nthe protections Congress has put in place under the provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Before an analyst at the NSA can even search for or query the \ndatabase, they must go through even more controls, and these are \nimportant. To be granted the ability to search the database, the \nanalyst must demonstrate to the FISA Court--the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court created by Congress for this purpose--that there is \na reasonable, articulable suspicion that the phone number is associated \nwith terrorism.\n  This is similar--not the same but similar--in many respects to the \nprotections offered in a criminal case under the Fourth Amendment to \nthe Constitution where law enforcement agencies would have to come in \nand establish probable cause that a crime has been committed before a \nsearch would be allowed. But since this is an investigation into \nforeign-induced terrorist activity, the standard Congress set was a \nreasonable, articulable suspicion that the phone number is associated \nwith terrorism. If the court determines that standard has been met, \nthey can grant access to the conversation but not under any other \ncircumstance.\n  If the NSA believes the phone number belongs to someone who intends \nto attack our country, the Agency must go back to court another time to \nbe granted other abilities to surveil that individual.\n  In addition to these checks and balances between the National \nSecurity Agency and the courts, all three branches of government have \noversight over this program. And strong oversight of the intelligence \ncommunity is absolutely essential to safeguarding our freedoms and our \nliberty.\n  Because parts of this program are by and large classified, you are \nnot going to hear public debates about it. Indeed, that puts defenders \nof the program at some disadvantage to those who attack it--sometimes \nin a misleading or deceptive sort of way--because it is very difficult \nto counter that with factual information when they are talking about a \nclassified program, or parts of which are classified. It is important \nthat our enemies don't know exactly what we are doing because then they \ncan wire around it.\n  We live, of course, in a world with many threats, as I said, many of \nthem in our backyard. Many of them can be thwarted with good \nintelligence and law enforcement. And I make that distinction on \npurpose--intelligence and law enforcement. Law enforcement--as we \nlearned with 9/11, we can't just treat terrorism as a criminal act. It \nis a criminal act, but if we are going to stop it, we need access to \ngood intelligence to thwart it before that act actually occurs. It is \nnot enough to say to the American people: Well, we will deploy all of \nthe tools available to law enforcement to prosecute the person who \nmurders innocent people. We need to keep the commitment to protect them \nfrom that innocent slaughter in the first place, and the only way we do \nthat is by using legitimate tools of intelligence, such as this program \nI am discussing.\n  Earlier this year, for example, the United States frustrated a \npotential attack by a man from Ohio. He was an ISIS sympathizer and had \nplans to bomb the building we are standing in today, the U.S. Capitol. \nThat potential attack was thwarted by the use of good intelligence \nunder the limitations and strictures and procedures I described a \nmoment ago. Over the past 2 years, the FBI has told us they have \nstopped 50 American citizens from traveling overseas and joining the \nIslamic State and then coming back. So clearly the intelligence \ncommunity has a vital role to play in safeguarding the American people \nin our homeland.\n  Some in the intelligence community have said the bulk data collection \nI have described here briefly has led to a safer United States, and it \nis because of programs such as these that we are much better off than \nwe were pre-9/11. That is very important because the last thing I would \nthink we would want to do here in Congress is to return us to a pre-9/\n11 mentality when it comes to the threat of terrorism both abroad and \nhere at home and to make it harder for our national security personnel \nto protect the American people.\n  I believe the portion of the PATRIOT Act in question provides our \nintelligence community with the tools they need in order to effectively \nprotect all Americans.\n  I have been briefed on this program. We just had a briefing yesterday \nby the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, by the FBI \nDirector, by DOJ personnel, and by the leader of the National Security \nAgency. It was held downstairs in a secure facility because, as I said, \nmuch of it was classified. Much of it we can't talk about without \nalerting our adversaries to ways to circumvent it. But all responsible \nMembers of Congress have taken advantage of the opportunity to learn \nabout how this program works as part of our oversight responsibilities.\n  I remain convinced that this program, like many others, has helped to \nkeep us safe while using appropriate checks and balances to ensure that \nour liberties remain intact. And Congress, by maintaining strong \noversight of these and other government programs, can have a win-win \nsituation that both protects American lives and protects American \nliberties.\n  Mr. President, I want to draw my colleagues' attention to an opinion \npiece that appeared today in the Wall Street Journal that was written \nby Michael B. Mukasey, who, of course, was a former U.S. district judge \nand more recently Attorney General of the United States from 2007 to \n2009. General Mukasey writes in this article about the Second Circuit \nopinion that has prompted so much recent discussion about section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act and the bulk metadata collection process I described \na moment ago. I think he makes some very important points.\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\n  First of all, he makes the important point that it is a good thing \nCongress has created a special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nbecause the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, no matter how good they \nare as judges, simply doesn't have the experience to deal with parsing \nthe law on intelligence matters and things such as this 215 provision I \ntalked about a moment ago.\n  He makes the important point that intelligence by its nature is \nforward-looking and our criminal justice system, which is what most \ncourts have experience with, is backward-looking--in other words, \nsomething bad has already happened and the police and investigators and \nprosecutors are trying to bring somebody to justice for committing a \ncriminal act. But our intelligence community is supposed to look \nforward and to help prevent those terrible accidents or incidents from \noccurring in the first place.\n  The second point General Mukasey makes in this article is that the \nSecond Circuit panel of judges assumes that many Members of Congress \nare simply unaware of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act I mentioned \nearlier--section 215, this metadata collection--which is a terrible and \nglaring mistake on the part of the Second Circuit panel.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, just as we have done many times \npreviously, Members of the Senate and the Congress generally have \nregular or at least periodic briefings on these intelligence programs \nas part of our oversight responsibilities. For the Second Circuit panel \nto suggest that Congress didn't know what it was talking about when it \nauthorized these programs and when it wrote this provision of the law \nis simply erroneous.\n  The third point General Mukasey makes is that the judges didn't even \nstop the program in the first place. So it makes one really wonder why \nthey handed down their opinion about 3 weeks before the expiration of \nthis provision, when Congress is going to have to take up this matter \nanyway, unless they wanted to have some impact on our deliberations \nhere.\n  What Attorney General Mukasey suggested, I think, is good advice. \nThere needs to be an appeal to the Second Circuit Court en banc and \nthen to the U.S. Supreme Court to get a final word. We don't need to \nsettle on what he calls a ``Rube Goldberg'' procedure that would have \ndata stored and searched by the telephone companies, he says, whose \ncomputers can be penetrated and whose employees have neither the \nsecurity clearance nor the training of the NSA staff.\n  Mr. President, I commend this article to my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 11, 2015]\n\n    Clues on Twitter Show Ties Between Texas Gunman and ISIS Network\n\n                        (By Rukmini Callimachi)\n\n       Hours before he drove into a Texas parking lot last week \n     and opened fire with an assault rifle outside a Prophet \n     Muhammad cartoon contest, Elton Simpson, 30, logged onto \n     Twitter.\n       ``Follow @_AbuHu55ain,'' Mr. Simpson posted, promoting a \n     Twitter account believed to belong to Junaid Hussain, a young \n     computer expert from Birmingham, England, who moved to Syria \n     two years ago to join the Islamic State and has become one of \n     the extremist group's celebrity hackers.\n       This seemingly routine shout-out is an intriguing clue to \n     the question of whether the gunmen, Mr. Simpson and Nadir \n     Soofi, 34, both of Phoenix, were acting in concert with the \n     Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in carrying out an \n     attack outside a community center in Garland, Tex. The \n     Islamic State said two days later that the two men, who were \n     killed by officers after opening fire, were ``soldiers of the \n     Caliphate.'' It was the first time that the terror group had \n     tried to claim credit for an operation carried out in its \n     name on American soil.\n       As the gunmen were driving toward the Curtis Culwell \n     Center, Mr. Hussain logged onto Twitter himself from half a \n     world away, firing off a series of posts in the hour before \n     the attack began at 7 p.m. on May 3. One message posted to \n     his account about 5:45 p.m. seemed to predict imminent \n     violence: ``The knives have been sharpened, soon we will come \n     to your streets with death and slaughter!''\n       After the attack, Mr. Hussain was in the first wave of \n     people who praised the gunmen, before his account was \n     suspended.\n       Law enforcement officials have not presented any conclusive \n     evidence that the Islamic State planned or directed the \n     attack. Yet Mr. Simpson appears to have been part of a \n     network of Islamic State adherents in several countries, \n     including the group's hub in Syria, who have encouraged \n     attacks and highlighted the Texas event as a worthy target.\n       Counterterrorism officials say the case shows how the \n     Islamic State and its supporters use social media to \n     cheerlead for attacks without engaging in the secret \n     training, plotting and control that has long characterized Al \n     Qaeda. But a close look at Mr. Simpson's Twitter connections \n     shows that he had developed a notable online relationship \n     with some of the Islamic State's best-known promoters on the \n     Internet, and that they actively encouraged such acts of \n     terror.\n       Speaking of the Texas case last week, James B. Comey, the \n     director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the \n     distinction between an attack ``inspired'' by a foreign \n     terrorist group and one ``directed'' by the group ``is \n     breaking down.''\n       ``It's not a useful framework,'' he added.\n       Mr. Simpson was radicalized years before the Islamic State \n     announced in 2014 that it was creating a caliphate, a unified \n     land for Muslims, and drew global attention for territorial \n     gains and brutal violence. He was investigated by the F.B.I. \n     starting in 2006 and was sentenced to probation in 2011 for \n     lying to investigators. But like many young Muslims drawn by \n     the sensational image of the Islamic State, he \n     enthusiastically joined its virtual community of supporters.\n       An analysis of Mr. Simpson's Twitter account by the SITE \n     Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist statements, found \n     that Mr. Simpson followed more than 400 other accounts, \n     including ``hardcore I.S. fighters from around the world.'' \n     They included an alleged British fighter for the Islamic \n     State, known as Abu Abdullah Britani, who according to SITE \n     is believed to be Abu Rahin Aziz, a radical British national \n     who skipped bail to join the terror group. They also included \n     an alleged American fighter called Abu Khalid Al-Amriki and \n     numerous female Islamic State jihadists.\n       Many of Mr. Simpson's posts announced the new Twitter \n     handles of Islamic State members whose accounts the social \n     media company had suspended, messages commonly called \n     ``shout-outs.''\n       ``He was taking part in shout-outs of ISIS accounts that \n     were previously suspended, and this shows a pretty deep \n     involvement in the network online,'' says J. M. Berger, a \n     senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a \n     book about the Islamic State. ``He was wired into a \n     legitimate foreign fighters network.''\n       Starting last fall, the Islamic State has repeatedly called \n     for attacks in the West by supporters with no direct \n     connection to its core leadership, and there have been at \n     least six attacks in Europe, Canada and Australia by gunmen \n     who appeared to have been inspired by the group. Each \n     attacker left an online trail similar to that of Mr. Simpson, \n     though not all were in contact with Islamic State operatives \n     in Syria.\n       A review of Mr. Simpson's Twitter account shows that he \n     interacted not just with sympathizers of the Islamic State, \n     but also with fighters believed to be in Syria and Africa. \n     Some of these fighters later posted on Twitter details of Mr. \n     Simpson's biography not yet in the public sphere, suggesting \n     that he had shared details about his life with them.\n       ``The thing that clearly stands out if you peruse the Texas \n     shooter's timeline is his third to last tweet,'' the one \n     promoting Mr. Hussain, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior \n     fellow who researches extremism at the Foundation for the \n     Defense of Democracies and who shared a PDF of Mr. Simpson's \n     Twitter history.\n       Veryan Khan, who helps run the Terrorism Research and \n     Analysis Consortium, said that Mr. Simpson probably urged \n     others to follow Mr. Hussain in order to draw broader \n     attention to his forthcoming attack. ``He wanted to make sure \n     everyone in those circles knew what he'd done,'' she said. \n     ``It was attention-seeking--that's what it looks like,'' \n     added Ms. Khan, whose organization tracks some 5,000 Islamic \n     State figures and supporters.\n       While still living in Birmingham, Mr. Hussain rose to \n     notoriety as a hacker working under the screen name Tr1Ck, \n     and he was believed to be a core member of what was called \n     TeaM p0isoN. The team claimed a string of high profile \n     cyberattacks, hacking into a Scotland Yard conference call on \n     combating hackers and posting Facebook updates to the pages \n     of its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and former President \n     Nicolas Sarkozy of France.\n       Mr. Hussain was eventually arrested, and he served a six-\n     month prison sentence before traveling to Syria. He has since \n     been linked to a number of Islamic State hacking attacks \n     overseas, though some security officials have doubts about \n     his role.\n       Another well-known promoter of the Islamic State who \n     engaged with Mr. Simpson was a jihadist known on Twitter as \n     Mujahid Miski, believed to be Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, a \n     Somali-American from Minnesota. Though Mr. Hassan lives in \n     Somalia, he has emerged as an influential recruiter for the \n     group.\n       On April 23, the account Mujahid Miski shared a link on \n     Twitter to a listing for the Muhammad cartoon contest and \n     goaded his followers to attack it. ``The brothers from the \n     Charlie Hebdo attack did their part. It's time for brothers \n     in the #US to do their part,'' he wrote. Among the nine \n     people who\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\n     retweeted his call to violence, according to SITE, was Mr. \n     Simpson.\n       Three days later, Mr. Simpson reached out to Mujahid Miski \n     on Twitter, asking him to message him privately. Whether they \n     actually communicated, or what they may have said, is not \n     publicly known. Minutes before Mr. Simpson arrived at the \n     cartoon event in Garland and began shooting, he went on \n     Twitter one last time to link the attack to the Islamic \n     State. ``The bro with me and myself have given bay'ah to \n     Amirul Mu'mineem,'' he wrote, using the vocabulary of the \n     Islamic State to say that they had given an oath of \n     allegiance to the Emir of the Believers--the leader of the \n     Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n       ``May Allah accept us as mujahedeen,'' he wrote, adding the \n     hashtag ``#TexasAttack.''\n       Among those who retweeted this last post was Mr. Hussain, \n     the Islamic State hacker in Syria. ``Allahu Akbar!!!!'' he \n     wrote. ``2 of our brothers just opened fire at the Prophet \n     Muhammad (s.a.w) art exhibition in Texas!'' he added, using \n     the Arabic abbreviation for ``peace be upon him.''\n       After Mr. Simpson's death, Mujahid Miski tweeted a series \n     of posts, calling Mr. Simpson ``Mutawakil,'' ``One who has \n     faith,'' a variation on Mr. Simpson's Twitter handle, \n     ``Atawaakul,'' meaning ``To have faith.''\n       ``I'm gonna miss Mutawakil,'' Mujahid Miski wrote. ``He was \n     truly a man of wisdom. I'm gonna miss his greeting every \n     morning on twitter.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 12, 2015]\n\n                   Impeding the Fight Against Terror\n\n\n      The appeals-court ruling on surveillance will have damaging \n                  consequences if Obama doesn't appeal\n\n                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       Usually, the only relevant objections to a judicial opinion \n     concern errors of law and fact. Not so with a federal appeals \n     court ruling on May 7 invalidating the National Security \n     Agency's bulk collection of telephone metadata under the USA \n     Patriot Act.\n       Not that the ruling by the three-judge panel of the Second \n     Circuit in New York lacks for errors of law and fact. The \n     panel found that when the Patriot Act, passed in the \n     aftermath of 9/11, permitted the government to subpoena \n     business records ``relevant'' to an authorized investigation, \n     the statute couldn't have meant bulk telephone metadata--\n     consisting of every calling number, called number, and the \n     date and length of every call.\n       That ends up subpoenaing everything, the panel reasoned, \n     and what is ``relevant'' is necessarily a subset of \n     everything. In aid of this argument the panel summons not \n     only the dictionary definition of an investigation, but also \n     the law that relates to a grand-jury subpoena in a criminal \n     case, which limits the government to ``relevant'' \n     information.\n       Yet the judicial panel failed to consider the purpose of \n     the statute it was analyzing. The Patriot Act concerns \n     intelligence gathering, which is forward-looking and \n     necessarily requires a body of data from which potentially \n     useful information about events in the planning stage may be \n     gathered. A grand jury investigation, by contrast, is \n     backward-looking, and requires only limited data relating to \n     past events. A base of data from which to gather intelligence \n     is at least arguably ``relevant'' to an authorized \n     intelligence investigation.\n       Equally serious an error is the panel's suggestion that \n     many, perhaps most, members of Congress were unaware of the \n     NSA's bulk metadata collection when they repeatedly \n     reauthorized the statute, most recently in 2011. The judges \n     suggest that an explanation of the program was available only \n     in ``secure locations, for a limited time period and under a \n     number of restrictions.'' In addition to being given briefing \n     papers, lawmakers had available live briefings, including \n     from the directors of the FBI and the National Intelligence \n     office.\n       In any event, no case until the judicial panel's ruling \n     last week has ever held that a federal tribunal may engage in \n     telepathic hallucination to figure out whether a statute has \n     the force of law.\n       The panel adds that because the program was highly \n     classified, Congress didn't have the benefit of public \n     debate. Which is to say, no truly authorized secret \n     intelligence-gathering effort can exist unless we let in on \n     the secret those from and about whom the intelligence is to \n     be gathered. Overlooked in this exertion is the Founders' \n     foresight about the need for secrecy--expressed in the body \n     of the Constitution in the requirement that each legislative \n     house publish a journal of its proceedings ``excepting such \n     Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy.''\n       But isn't the misbegotten ruling by this trio of federal \n     judges correctable on appeal? Or won't it be made moot \n     because the Patriot Act must be reauthorized by June 1 and \n     Congress will either enact substitute legislation, or let the \n     statute lapse, or simply reauthorize it with full knowledge \n     of how the program works? Here the Second Circuit's opinion \n     is problematic in ways not immediately apparent.\n       The judges didn't reverse the lower-court opinion upholding \n     the NSA data-collection program and order the program \n     stopped. Rather, the panel simply vacated that opinion and \n     sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether it is \n     necessary to stop the program now. By rendering its order in \n     a non-final form, the panel made it less likely that the \n     Supreme Court would hear the case even if asked, because the \n     justices generally won't take up issues that arise from non-\n     final orders.\n       Moreover, the opinion tries to head off the argument that \n     if Congress reauthorizes the Patriot Act in its current form, \n     lawmakers will have endorsed the metadata program. The panel \n     writes: ``If Congress fails to reauthorize Section 215 \n     itself, or re-enacts Section 215 without expanding it to \n     authorize the telephone metadata program, there will be no \n     need for prospective relief, since the program will end.'' \n     That is, unless Congress adopts the panel's view of what \n     Congress has done, rather than its own view of what it has \n     done, the program must end.\n       Then there is the opinion's timing. The case was argued \n     eight months ago. This opinion, or one like it, easily could \n     have been published in time for orderly review by the Supreme \n     Court so the justices could weigh matters arguably critical \n     to the nation's security. Or the panel could have followed \n     the example of the D.C. Circuit and the Ninth Circuit--which \n     have had cases involving the NSA's surveillance program \n     pending for months--and refrained from issuing an opinion \n     that could have no effect other than to insert the views of \n     judges into the deliberations of the political branches.\n       What to do? An administration firmly committed to \n     preserving all surveillance tools in a world that now \n     includes al Qaeda, Islamic State and many other terror \n     groups, would seek a quick a review by the Supreme Court. But \n     President Obama has already stated his willingness to end \n     bulk collection of metadata by the government. Instead, he \n     wants to rely on a Rube Goldberg procedure that would have \n     the data stored and searched by the telephone companies \n     (whose computers can be penetrated and whose employees have \n     neither the security clearance nor the training of NSA \n     staff).\n       The government, under Mr. Obama's plan, would be obliged to \n     scurry to court for permission to examine the data, and then \n     to each telephone company in turn, with no requirement that \n     the companies retain data and thus no guarantee that it would \n     even be there. These constitute burdens on national security \n     with no meaningful privacy protection.\n       The president's plan would make protecting national \n     security more difficult. We would all have been better off if \n     the Second Circuit panel had avoided needless complication \n     and instead emulated the judicial modesty of their Ninth \n     Circuit and D.C. Circuit colleagues.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here today for the 99th time to \nremind us that we are sleepwalking our way to a climate catastrophe, \nand that it is time to wake up.\n  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the \nUnited States, recently announced an ominous milestone. This March, for \nthe first time in human history, the monthly average of CO2 \nin our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. This chart shows the \nglobal concentration of carbon dioxide over the last few years as \nmeasured by NOAA. The level varies with the seasons. The Earth sort of \ninhales and exhales carbon dioxide as the seasons pass. But overall, we \ncan see the steady prominent upward march of CO2 levels, \nrising right here to above 400 parts per million for the month of March \n2015.\n  Scientists at NOAA's Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii first measured \nan atmospheric concentration of CO2 above 400 parts per \nmillion in 2013--for the very first time. It reached up and it\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\ntouched 400 parts per million for the first time and then receded \nagain. Now, 2 years later, as we continue dumping carbon pollution into \nthe atmosphere, the average weekly air sample from NOAA's entire global \nnetwork of sampling stations measured an average--a month-long \naverage--of 400 parts per million for the entire month of March. That \nis a daunting marker.\n  Global carbon concentrations haven't been this high for at least \n800,000 years, much longer--much longer--than humankind has walked the \nEarth. Every year, that concentration increases.\n  The fact that increasing levels of carbon in the atmosphere warm the \nplanet has been established science for 150 years. Science on this was \nbeing published in scientific journals when Abraham Lincoln in his top \nhat was walking around Washington. We have pumped more and more carbon \npollution into the atmosphere, and we have measured corresponding \nchanges in global temperatures.\n  Now, there is some mischief afoot, people who cherry-pick the data to \ncreate false impressions--to create false doubt. Well, the honest thing \nto do is to look at all of the data. When we look at all of the data, \nwe see long-term warming. We see warming so obvious that scientists \ncall the evidence unequivocal--unequivocal. That is about as strong a \nscience word as we can have.\n  Evidence of the changing climate, the consequences of unchecked \ncarbon pollution, abounds: more extreme weather, rising sea levels, and \nwarming and acidifying oceans--all as predicted. These changes are \nalready starting to hurt people, through more severe heat waves, \nparched fields, flooded towns and homes, altered ecosystems, and \nthreatened fisheries. We have certainly seen the fisheries change at \nhome in my State of Rhode Island. We are already starting to pay the \nprice of our continued and reckless burning of fossil fuels.\n  Dr. James Butler, the Director of NOAA's Global Monitoring Division, \nsays:\n\n       Elimination of about 80 percent of fossil fuel emissions \n     would essentially stop the rise in carbon dioxide in the \n     atmosphere, but concentrations of carbon dioxide would not \n     start decreasing until even further reductions are made.\n\n  We need to cut our use of fossil fuels, we need to cut energy waste, \nand we need to generate more of our energy from clean and renewable \nsources. We need to do it, and we can do it. We have the technologies \nand the policies available right now. We can choose to level the \nplaying field for clean energy, to make polluters pay for the climate \ncosts of their pollution, and to move forward to a low-carbon economy--\nthe one with the green jobs, with the American innovation, with the \nsafer climate. But we are not going to get there with business as \nusual.\n  That brings me to the fast-track trade bill, which, I am glad to say, \nfailed its procedural vote in the Senate this week--a bill that would \nmake it easier for the administration to commit the United States to \nnew sweeping trade agreements.\n  The first agreement waiting to get through is the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--some call it the TPP--which is being sold as ``a trade \ndeal for the 21st century.'' But when it comes to climate change, the \nfast-track bill and the Pacific trade bill aren't 21st century \nsolutions. They are business as usual.\n  Past trade deals have not been kind to workers in Rhode Island. I \nhave been to Rhode Island factories and seen the holes in the floor \nwhere machinery had been unbolted and shipped to other countries for \nforeign workers to perform the same job for the same customers on the \nsame machines. That is what we saw from trade bills. The trade \nadvocates always say it is going to be wonderful, but then what do we \nsee? Jobs offshored again and a huge trade deficit.\n  Past U.S. trade deals have required participating countries to join \nsome multilateral environmental agreements, including agreements to \nprotect endangered species, whales, and tuna; to help keep the oceans \nfree of pollution; and to protect the ozone layer by reducing the use \nof HFCs and other ozone-depleting gases. But I haven't seen much \nenforcement, and everywhere we look things are getting worse. I am not \nimpressed.\n  When it comes to climate change, the fast-track bill is silent. There \nis no mention of, let alone protection for, commitments the United \nStates and other countries might make to cut carbon pollution.\n  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the main \ninternational agreement for dealing with climate change. The Senate \nratified this treaty in 1992, and since then, under various \nadministrations, the United States has taken a leading role under the \nframework to reach global accord and, particularly, to work to reach a \nglobal accord in Paris later this winter. The Paris accord is perhaps \nour last best hope to put the world on a path that avoids severe \nclimate disruption, even climate catastrophe.\n  That fast-track bill and the Pacific trade bill ought to enable and \nsupport our trade partners to live up to their climate agreement. Those \nbills ought to protect countries that act to address climate change. In \nparticular, they ought to protect them from the threat of trade \nsanctions or from corporate challenges seeking to undermine sovereign \ncountries' climate laws.\n  These 21st century agreements on trade ought to match our 21st \ncentury commitments on climate, but they don't. Fast-track is silent on \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and on \nclimate change more broadly. Fast-track provides no protection for our \nown or any other country's climate commitments. And we have heard \nnothing to suggest the Pacific trade bill will be any better.\n  What we do know about the Pacific trade bill is not encouraging. The \nPacific trade bill, in its agreement under negotiation as we see it \nnow, includes the horrible investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, \ncalled ISDS, a mechanism that allows big multinational corporations and \ntheir investors to challenge a country's domestic rules and \nregulations--outside of that country's judicial process, outside of any \ntraditional judicial process, outside of appeal, outside of traditional \njudicial baseline principles such as precedent.\n  Increasingly, these ISDS challenges are being turned against \ncountries' environmental and public health standards. Fossil fuel \ncompanies such as Chevron and ExxonMobil have brought hundreds of \ndisputes against almost 100 governments when those governments' \npolicies threaten corporate profits. In fact, more than 85 percent of \nthe more than $3 billion awarded to corporations and investors in \ndisputes have come from challenges against natural resource, energy, \nand environmental policies.\n  Last week, on the floor I compared the Big Tobacco playbook--that is \nthe one that was found by a Federal court to be a civil racketeering \nenterprise--to the fossil fuel industry's scheme to undermine climate \naction in the United States.\n  The comparisons are self-evident. Well, the tobacco industry is in on \nthe trade challenge game as well, challenging countries' antismoking \nmeasures under the guise of protecting free trade.\n  If a country wants new health or environmental rules, big \nmultinationals can use this ISDS process to thwart them. They don't \nnecessarily even have to bring the challenge. Just threatening to seek \nextrajudicial judgments in the millions or even billions of dollars \nfrom panels stacked with corporate lawyers can be enough to make \ncountries stop protecting the health of their citizens. We have seen \nthe polluters use these tools already. This is not conjecture. It is \nwhat is happening.\n  Why open U.S. climate regulations to this risk? Why put our \ncommitment to climate action at the mercy of these sketchy panels? What \nwill keep the fossil fuel industry from threatening smaller countries \nin Paris to discourage them from climate accords? Where are the \nsafeguards? Why should we accept trade deals that do not keep safe from \nthat kind of threat a country's legitimate efforts to control carbon \npollution? Why give the polluters this club?\n  It is not news to Congress that the fossil fuel industry does not \nplay fair; it plays rough. We see that every day. The fossil fuel \nindustry has used Citizens United to beat and cajole the Republican \nParty in Congress into becoming the political arm of the fossil fuel\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\nindustry. The party that brought us Theodore Roosevelt, the party that \nbrought us the Environmental Protection Agency, the party of my \npredecessor, John Chafee, who is still revered across Rhode Island as \nan environmentalist, has now become the political arm of the fossil \nfuel industry. It is not its high point in history. It is a party that \nlines up behind climate denial.\n  If the fossil fuel industry is willing to impose its will that way on \nthe Congress, why would we trust them with this ISDS mechanism to \nthreaten and bully governments around the rest of the world?\n  A 21st-century trade deal ought to acknowledge the 21st-century \nreality of climate change. We have right now the technology and the \ningenuity to address this problem and to boost our economy into the \nfuture. For the first time in years, we have international momentum to \naddress this threat. But it does not make sense to act on climate \nchange in Paris and undermine climate action in our trade deals. We \nneed to wake up to that little problem, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Sally Yates\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on \nthe nomination of Ms. Sally Yates to be Deputy Attorney General. That \nis the second in command at the U.S. Department of Justice. It is a \nvery important position. She has had over the years a good background \nin general for us to consider that she would be able to handle that job \nin an effective way. She understands the system. She has been at the \nDepartment of Justice for a number of years. I have no concern with her \npersonal integrity or work ethic or her desire to do well.\n  However, Congress and the executive branch are on a collision course \nhere. A lot of our Members choose not to think sufficiently about it or \nconsider the gravity of it, but I have to say that Congress needs to \ndefend its institutional powers. We have certain powers we can use to \ndefend constitutionally the responsibilities we have and to reject \nexecutive overreach--not many, but we have some real powers we can use.\n  Apparently, it is all right for the President to use all his powers \nand more. It is perfectly all right, I suggest, that we in the Senate \nuse the powers we clearly and unequivocally and indisputably have.\n  I want to tell you how I see the situation with this nomination. I \nasked her directly at her confirmation hearing, as a member of the \nJudiciary committee, could she answer yes or no--did she think that the \nPresident's Executive amnesty is legal and constitutional. Basically, \nshe said yes, she did. She answered that she has been ``serving as the \nActing Deputy Attorney General of the Department of Justice. And the \nDepartment of Justice is currently litigating this matter.'' She \nfurther stated that ``the Department of Justice has filed pleadings \nwith its position and I stand by those pleadings,'' which I suppose she \nshould.\n  Two things about that. Historically, the Attorney General of the \nUnited States understands that their role is different from a lower \nofficial, but indeed they have to advise the President on matters of \nconstitutional authority and tell the President no when a strong-willed \nPresident wants to do something that is not correct.\n  They are not a judicial officer; they are part of the executive \nbranch. They should try to help the President achieve things the \nPresident wants to achieve as a matter of policy. I do not dispute \nthat. But at some point, if the President is seeking to do clearly \nunconstitutional or illegal, they should tell the President so and not \nacquiesce, in my opinion. The honorable thing to do, as has been done \nin the past, is to resign. But if an Attorney General is firm and clear \nand stands in a firm position, then often the President will back down \nand avoid a constitutional crisis and keep our government going in the \nright way.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is the Department's second-ranking \nofficial and functions as its chief operating officer. The 25 \ncomponents and 93 U.S. attorneys--I was a U.S. attorney for 12 years, \n15 years at the Department of Justice; I am proud of that service and \nproud of the Department of Justice--they report directly to the Deputy, \nand 13 additional components report to the Deputy through the Associate \nAttorney General. So, on a daily basis, the Deputy Attorney General \ndecides a broad range of legal, policy, and operational issues.\n  Ms. Yates, I suggest, is a high ranking official who holds a \nposition--unlike a U.S. attorney or some section chief--who is involved \nin the policymaking of the Department of Justice. In addition to that, \nthe litigation going on in Texas before Judge Andrew Hanen is under her \ndirect supervision, and she is monitoring the lawyers who are \nadvocating a position that is opposed by a majority of the State \nattorneys general of the United States. A majority of them have filed a \nlawsuit, and they contend that the President's Executive amnesty--an \neven more dramatic assertion of Executive power than his original \namnesty in 2012--is contrary to the law and Constitution. She is direct \nsupervisor over that litigation.\n  On April 7 of this year, Judge Andrew Hanen issued a blistering \nopinion in the litigation that is ongoing that the Justice Department \nattorneys had made ``multiple misrepresentations'' to the court ``both \nin writing and orally that no action would be taken pursuant to the \n2014 DHS Directive until February 18, 2015.''\n  I would like to read some of the comments from the judge's opinion. \nJudges take this seriously; they are not just saying these things for \nfun.\n  Judge Hanen said this:\n\n       Whether by ignorance, omission, purposeful misdirection, or \n     because they were misled by their clients, the attorneys for \n     the Government misrepresented the facts.\n\n  He didn't say that lightly. When U.S. attorneys and other Federal \nprosecutors appear in court, they have an absolute duty to tell the \ntruth. It is a responsibility that every judge knows and every \ngovernment attorney knows. When a government attorney goes into court \nand they are asked whether they are ready, they reply: The United \nStates is ready, Your Honor. They have a duty to respond consistently \nwith the integrity of the United States of America. We all know that.\n  In this case, the government lawyers asserted that:\n\n       No applications for the revised DACA would be accepted \n     until the 18th of February, and that no action would be taken \n     on any of those applications until March the 4th.\n\n  Regarding this, Judge Hanen said:\n\n       This representation was made even as the Government was in \n     the process of granting over 100,000 three-year renewals \n     under the revised DACA.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       In response to this representation, counsel for the States \n     agreed to a schedule more favorable to the Government, and \n     the Court granted the Government's request not only to file a \n     sur-reply, but also to have additional time to do so. The \n     States now argue that they would have sought a temporary \n     restraining order, but for the Government's \n     misrepresentations. A review of the Chronology of Events, \n     attached as an appendix to this Order, certainly lends \n     credence to the States' claims.\n\n  That is a pretty serious allegation. Not only did they misrepresent \nkey facts, but they used that misrepresentation to achieve a favorable \nschedule, which often in litigation is important.\n  The judge goes on to say:\n\n       The explanation by Defendants' counsel for their conduct \n     after the fact is even more troublesome for the Court. \n     Counsel told the Court during its latest hearing that she was \n     unaware that these 2014 DACA amendments were at issue until \n     she read the Court's February 16, 2015 Order of Temporary \n     Injunction and Memorandum Opinion and Order. Counsel then \n     claimed that the Government took ``prompt'' remedial action. \n     This assertion is belied by the facts. Even if one were to \n     assume that counsel was unaware that the 2014 DACA amendments \n     in their entirety were at issue until reading this Court's \n     February Opinion, the factual scenario still does not suggest \n     candor on the part of the Government.\n\n  Government counsel have an absolute duty of candor to the court. That \nis a serious charge by the Federal judge.\n  It goes on:\n\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\n\n       The February Opinion was issued late in the evening on \n     February 16, 2015 (based on the representation that \n     ``nothing'' would happen on DAPA or revised DACA until at \n     least February 18, 2015). As the February Opinion was \n     finalized and filed at night, counsel could not have been \n     expected to review it until the next day; yet, for the next \n     two weeks, the Government did nothing to inform the Court of \n     the 108,081 revised DACA approvals. Instead, less than a week \n     later, on February 23, 2015, the Government filed a Motion to \n     Stay and a Notice of Appeal. Despite having had almost a week \n     to disclose the truth--or correct any omission, \n     misunderstanding, confusion, or misrepresentation--the \n     Government did not act promptly; instead it again did \n     nothing. Surely, an advisory to this Court (or even to the \n     Court of Appeals) could have been included in either document \n     filed during this time period. Yet, counsel for the \n     Government said nothing.\n\n  So the court goes on:\n\n       Mysteriously, what was included in the Government's \n     February 23, 2015 Motion to Stay was a request that this \n     Court rule on the Motion ``by the close of business on \n     Wednesday, February 25. . . . ''--in other words, within two \n     days. Had the Court complied with this request, it would have \n     cut off the States' right to file any kind of reply. If this \n     Court had ruled according to the Government's requested \n     schedule, it would have ruled without the Court or the States \n     knowing that the Government had granted 108,081 applications \n     pursuant to the revised DACA despite its multiple \n     representations to the contrary.\n\n  The attorneys were telling the Court they had not granted any of \nthese applications and had stopped it while, in fact, over 108,000 \napplications had been issued.\n  The court goes on to say:\n\n       While this Court is skeptical that the Government's \n     attorneys could have reasonably believed that the DACA \n     amendments contained in the 2014 DHS Directive were not at \n     issue prior to the injunction hearing on January 15, 2015, \n     this Court finds it even less conceivable that the Government \n     could have thought so after the January 15, 2015 hearing, \n     given the interplay between the Court and counsel at that \n     hearing. Regardless, by their own admission, the Government's \n     lawyers knew about it at least as of February 17, 2015. Yet, \n     they stood silent. Even worse, they urged this Court to rule \n     before disclosing that the Government had already issued \n     108,081 three-year renewals under the 2014 DACA amendments \n     despite their statements to the contrary.\n\n  The judge goes on to say:\n\n       Another week passed after the Motion to Stay was filed and \n     still the Government stood mute . . . Still, the Government's \n     lawyers were silent . . . Finally, after waiting two weeks, \n     and after the States had filed their reply, the Government \n     lawyers filed their Advisory that same night at 6:57 p.m. \n     CST. Thus, even under the most charitable interpretation of \n     these circumstances, and based solely upon what counsel for \n     the Government told the Court, the Government knew its \n     representations had created ``confusion,'' but kept quiet \n     about it for two weeks while simultaneously pressing this \n     Court to rule on the merits of its motion. At the March 19, \n     2015 hearing, counsel for the Government repeatedly stated to \n     the Court that they had acted ``promptly'' to clarify any \n     ``confusion'' they may have caused. But the facts clearly \n     show these statements to be disingenuous. The Government did \n     anything but act ``promptly'' to clarify the Government-\n     created ``confusion.''\n\n  The judge goes on to quote the rules of professional conduct:\n\n       The ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct . . . require a \n     lawyer to act with complete candor in his or her dealings \n     with the Court. Under these rules of conduct, a lawyer must \n     be completely truthful and forthright in making \n     representations to the Court. Fabrications, misstatements, \n     half-truths, artful omissions, and the failure to correct \n     misstatements may be acceptable, albeit lamentable, in other \n     aspects of life; but in the courtroom, when an attorney knows \n     that both the Court and the other side are relying on \n     complete frankness, such conduct is unacceptable.\n\n  I don't think that is a little matter. I am just saying this nominee \nhad those lawyers under her supervision at the time this occurred. We \nhave had a lot of talk over the years from Democrats and Republicans \nabout demanding higher standards of professionalism among government \nprosecutors and lawyers. I think that is a legitimate demand. We have \nhad too many examples of failures.\n  Sometimes lawyers--I have seen it--for the government have been \nunfairly criticized. I don't think there is any dispute that the \njudge's findings in this case represent an accurate statement of the \nmisrepresentations and disingenuousness of these attorneys.\n  Has any discipline been undertaken against them? I am not saying Ms. \nYates knew this. I am just saying that if you are the responsible \nsupervisor, shouldn't you take some action to deal with it, and to my \nknowledge, none has been taken, even at some point the Department of \nJustice suggested they did nothing wrong.\n  Basically, the Department of Justice has said the court is incorrect \nin its finding, which I don't think can be justified.\n  On May 7, 2015, the Department of Justice notified the court of an \nadditional misrepresentation regarding approximately 2,000 individuals \nbeing granted three-year work authorizations subsequent to this opinion \nand in violation of the original court order.\n  OK. So you say, well, maybe she is not responsible for that, but I do \nbelieve the Deputy Attorney General--acting now--is responsible for \ntaking action against attorneys who breached the proper standards of \nethical conduct. But we are drifting too far, in my opinion, into a \npostmodern world, where rules don't seem to make much difference. You \ncan just redefine the meaning of words and you can just say--once \ncaught in some wrongdoing--well, we didn't mean it or that is not \ncorrect or the facts are different, when the facts show what the facts \nshow. It is an unhealthy trend in this country, I think. It is \nparticularly unacceptable in the Department of Justice. That was a \ngreat department. It has high standards. It is filled with many of the \nbest lawyers of the highest integrity anywhere in the world, but sloppy \nwork and disingenuousness cannot be acceptable. I believe the \nDepartment of Justice needs to do more, and the primary responsibility, \nit seems to me, is with the Deputy Attorney General.\n  Well, what about the fundamental problem of Congress's power to deal \nwith a President who overreaches, a President who makes law rather than \nenforces law? We learned in elementary school that Congress makes law \nand the President enforces law. The Chief Executive cannot make up law. \nHe cannot issue decrees and then declare they are the law of the land. \nHow fundamental is that?\n  Professor Jonathan Turley at George Washington University Law School \nis a constitutional expert and a supporter of President Obama. He \ntestified before our Judiciary Committee, and other committees, a \nnumber of times over the years, mostly for the Democrats, I think--at \nleast from the times I remember. This is what Professor Turley has \nwarned Congress about.\n  I urge colleagues to understand what we are considering here. He \nsaid:\n\n       I believe the President has exceeded his brief. The \n     president is required to faithfully execute the laws. He's \n     not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same \n     resources through them. But I believe the President has \n     crossed the constitutional line in some of these areas.\n\n  Here he is referring to the original DACA. He said:\n\n       This goes to the very heart of what is the Madisonian \n     system. If a president can unilaterally change the meaning of \n     laws in substantial ways or refuse to enforce them, it takes \n     offline that very thing that stabilizes our system. I believe \n     the members will loathe the day that they allow this to \n     happen.\n\n  He is testifying before the House of Representatives and talking \ndirectly to Members of Congress. He said that you will loathe the day \nthat you allowed this to happen.\n  He also said:\n\n       This will not be our last president. There will be more \n     presidents who will claim the same authority.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       The problem of what the President is doing is that he is \n     not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he \n     is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to \n     avoid: that is, the concentration of power in a single \n     branch. This Newtonian orbit that the three branches exist in \n     is a delicate one, but it is designed to prevent this type of \n     concentration.\n\n  That is what Professor Turley said to the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. He goes on to say:\n\n       We are creating a new system here, something that is not \n     what was designed. We have this rising fourth branch in a \n     system that is tripartite. The center of gravity is shifting, \n     and that makes it unstable. And within that system, you have \n     the rise of an uber presidency. There could be no greater \n     danger for individual liberty, and I really think that the \n     framers would be horrified by that shift because everything \n     they've dedicated themselves to was creating this orbital \n     balance, and we've lost it.\n\n  We need to listen to this. The President is issuing orders that \nnullify law,\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\nactually creating an entirely new system of immigration that Congress \nrejected. He proposed all of this, and Congress flatly refused to pass \nit. He then declares he has the power to do this system anyway, and he \nis doing it. This judge has finally stopped part of it for the moment.\n  Professor Turley is talking about deep constitutional questions and \nwhat our duty is here. It is not a question of what you believe about \nimmigration or how you should believe the laws are to be written or \nenforced. We can debate that. But there should be unanimous agreement \non both sides of the aisle that the President enforce the laws we \nhave--the laws duly passed by Congress--and not create some new law and \nenforce them.\n  Mr. Turley goes on to say:\n\n       I believe that [Congress] is facing a critical crossroads \n     in terms of its continued relevance in this process. What \n     this body cannot become is a debating society where it can \n     issue rules and laws that are either complied with or not \n     complied with by the president. . . . [A] president cannot \n     ignore an express statement on policy grounds. . . . Is this \n     [Congress] truly the body that existed when it was formed? \n     Does it have the same gravitational pull and authority that \n     was given to it by the framers?\n\n  That is what Mr. Turley says. Then he looks directly at the Members \nof Congress and says:\n\n       You're the keepers of this authority. You took an oath to \n     uphold it. And the framers assumed that you would have the \n     institutional wherewithal, and, frankly, ambition to defend \n     the turf that is the legislative branch.\n\n  I think that is a legitimate charge to the Members of Congress--House \nand Senate.\n  Professor Turley goes on to say:\n\n       The current passivity of Congress represents a crisis for \n     members, crisis of faith for members willing to see a \n     president assume legislative powers in exchange for insular \n     policy gains. The short term insular victories achieved by \n     this president will come at a prohibitive cost if the balance \n     is not corrected. Constitutional authority is easy to lose in \n     the transient shift to politics. It's far more difficult to \n     regain. If a passion for the Constitution does not motivate \n     members of Congress, perhaps a sense of self-preservation \n     will be enough to unify members. President Obama will not be \n     our last president. However, these acquired powers will be \n     passed on to his successors. When that occurs, members may \n     loathe the day that they remain silent as the power of \n     government shifted so radically to the chief executive. The \n     powerful personality that engendered this loyalty will be \n     gone, but the powers will remain. We are now at the \n     Constitutional tipping point of our system. If balance is \n     to be reestablished, it must begin before this president \n     leaves office, and that will likely require every possible \n     means to reassert legislative authority.\n\n  What is our authority? How do we reassert power? I believe it is \nperfectly constitutionally appropriate for us to tell the President of \nthe United States: We are not going to confirm your nominee for Deputy \nAttorney General of the United States, who is directly supervising the \nlawsuits, the litigation that is going on that undermines our power and \nundermines the constitutional authority of the people's branch.\n  We are not going to confirm them and allow them to continue to go to \ncourt every day and take a position directly contrary to the authority \nthat has been given by the Constitution to the Congress. That is pretty \nsimple. So we have that power. We can confirm or not confirm any \nnominee to any position. We absolutely should not abuse that power. We \nshouldn't attack people personally and attack their ethics just because \nwe disagree with their policies.\n  I think Ms. Yates, as I said, is a responsible person, but she is the \npoint person, the supervisor of a litigation that has gone awry in a \nnumber of ways in Texas and fundamentally is seeking to advance an \nunconstitutional power by the Chief Executive. I don't believe it is a \nlittle matter. I think it is a big matter. Therefore, I will not vote \nfor her confirmation on that basis.\n  Some of our Members haven't thought this through yet, but sooner or \nlater we are going to have to confront the stark question of how long \ncan we remain effectively silent in the face of Presidential overreach.\n  Professor Turley, in January of this year testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing for the Attorney \nGeneral nominee, and added these words: ``If there is an alternative in \nunilateral executive action, the legislative process becomes purely \noptional and discretionary.''\n  In other words, if the Chief Executive can execute an alternative \npower to pass laws and execute policies he wants if they are contrary \nto Congress's will, then the legislative process becomes purely \noptional and discretionary. It has to be mandatory. It can't be that \nour power is optional.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The real meaning of a president claiming discretion to \n     negate or change Federal law is the discretion to use or \n     ignore the legislative process. No actor in a Madisonian \n     system is given such discretion. All three branches are meant \n     to be locked in a type of constitutional synchronous orbit--\n     held stable by their countervailing gravitational pull. If \n     one of those bodies shifts, the stability of the system is \n     lost.\n\n  So the President does not have the power to ignore the legislative \nprocess, and we are going to regret this day if we remain silent on \nthis issue.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share this with my colleagues. I \ndon't know if anybody is listening at this point. Certainly the \nAmerican people were horrified by the Executive amnesty carried out by \nthe President last year. He announced it before the election but held \noff until afterward. Still, there is no doubt in my mind that many of \nthe people who went to the polls in November were voting for a \nrejection of this kind of Executive overreach. It was a message of this \npast election.\n  We took our seats in January, a new Congress is here, and Professor \nTurley has said we need to act and we are not acting. Professor Turley \nhas said we need to stand up to the Chief Executive, this Chief \nExecutive while he is in office now, and if we don't, when we go to \nanother election cycle, the powers he has aggrandized to himself will \nbe claimed by the next President.\n  Truly so. That is a grim warning he has given us. I am ready and I \nthink it is time for us to stand up and be clear about this.\n  So, regretfully, I feel compelled to carry out one of the powers \nCongress has clearly been given--the power to confirm or reject \nnominations for higher office. I believe we should reject the \nnomination for the Department of Justice Deputy Attorney General who is \nadvocating and pursuing a lawsuit that goes against the constitutional \npowers of the Congress, and therefore I will be voting no on the \nnomination.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Amtrak Train Derailment\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to bring attention to the tragic \nAmtrak derailment that took at least 7 lives and caused over 140 \ninjuries, including an Associated Press member from New Jersey, Jim \nGaines of Plainsboro, NJ. Our thoughts and prayers are with the \nfamilies of those who lost their lives. To those of us from New Jersey \nand those who live along the Northeast corridor, they are our \nneighbors, our friends, our relatives. They could be us. It hits \nespecially close to home. I know, because I take Amtrak virtually every \nweek back to New Jersey.\n  There was a period of time last night when I did not know the \nwhereabouts of my son Rob, who was scheduled to be on Amtrak back to \nNew York. But I later found out that he was on the next train \nimmediately behind the one that derailed, and thankfully, he was safe. \nI am grateful for that. But others were not so lucky.\n  But luck should not be America's transportation policy. It is \nimperative that the cause of the derailment be fully investigated so \nthat we can prevent tragedies such as these in the future. I have \nalready been on the phone with Secretary of Transportation Anthony Fox \nand continue to monitor closely the situation.\n  I want to recognize the extraordinary work of our first responders. \nOnce again, firefighters, police officers, and emergency responders \nshowed us what bravery is all about. They ran to the crash site to save \nlives while others were running away. For that, we should all be \ngrateful.\n  Now, we do not know what caused this accident. But we do know that we\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nneed to invest in 21st-century systems and equipment and stop relying \non patchwork upgrades to old, rusted 19th century rail lines.\n  I travel Amtrak, as I said, virtually every week. I travel the Acela, \nwhich is supposed to be our high-speed rail. It is like shake, rattle, \nand roll. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have \ntraveled in other countries in the world, such as Japan. They have a \nbullet train in which you virtually cannot feel anything while you are \non the train, going at speeds far in excess of what we call high-speed \nrail.\n  Now, there are still many questions to which we do not know the \nanswers. Was there human failure? Was there a mechanical failure or \nwere there infrastructure issues or was it a combination of issues? \nWhat we do know is that our rail passengers deserve safe and modern \ninfrastructure. New Jersey, for example, is at the heart of the \nNortheast corridor. It has long held a competitive advantage with some \nof the Nation's most modern highways, an extensive transit network, and \nsome of the most significant freight corridors in the world at the \nconfluence of some of the largest and busiest rail lines, interstates, \nand ports.\n  In a densely populated State such as New Jersey, the ability to move \npeople and goods safely and efficiently is critical to our economy and \ncritical to our quality of life. But, unfortunately, in recent years, \nNew Jersey and the Nation as a whole have fallen behind. We have 20 \nyears maximum--maximum--before the Hudson River tunnels are taken out \nof service. Twenty years may sound maybe to some of our young pages \nlike a long time, but it is a flash of the eye. Think about what \nhappens if we take either or both of those tunnels out of service \nwithout an alternative, tunnels that are absolutely essential to moving \npeople and goods in the region that contributes $3.5 trillion to our \nNation's economy--20 percent of the entire Nation's gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Nationwide, 65 percent of major roads in America are in poor \ncondition. One in four bridges in our Nation needs significant repair. \nThere is an $808 billion backlog in highway and bridge investment \nneeds. On the transit side, there is an $86 billion backlog of transit \nmaintenance needs--maintenance needs, not expanding, just maintaining \nthat which we have.\n  It will take almost $19 billion a year through the year 2030 to bring \nour transit assets into good repair. These are just a handful of the \nstatistics underscoring our Nation's failure to invest in our \ntransportation network. But we have to get beyond looking at the \nnumbers on a page. We have to talk about what Congress's failure to act \nmeans to the people we represent, to every community--every community, \nevery commuter, every family, everyone who travels every day, and every \nconstruction worker looking for a job.\n  Failure to act means construction workers now face a 10-percent \nunemployment rate, and at a time when our infrastructure is crumbling \naround us, they will not get the work they need. It means a business \ncannot compete in a globalized economy because their goods cannot get \nto market in time. It means a working mother is stuck in traffic and \ncannot get home in time for dinner with her kids. In the very worst \ncases--cases such as the one we saw yesterday on Amtrak--it very well \nmeans that a loved one is lost in a senseless tragedy.\n  In Congress, we too often treat our infrastructure as if it is an \nacademic exercise, as if it is numbers on a page that we adjust to \nscore political points or balance a budget or make an argument about \nwhat types of transportation are worthy of our support. But that is not \nthe real world. In the real world, the choices we make have an impact \non people's lives, on their jobs, on their income. They have an impact \non our Nation's ability to compete. They have an impact on the safety \nof Americans and America's ability to lead globally the economy in the \nworld.\n  We in Congress are failing to recognize the real-world impacts of the \nchoices we make about our transportation infrastructure. We have a \npassenger rail bill that expired in 2013. We have a highway trust fund \non the brink of insolvency, with no plans--no plans--to fix it \nsustainably. We have a crowded and outdated aviation system that we \nrefuse to adequately fund. We have failed to upgrade with presently \navailable technologies that can reduce the number of failures. We have \nappropriations bills aiming to cut already-low funding levels of \nAmtrak, in particular, to meet an arbitrary budget cap for the sake of \npolitical points.\n  I cannot understand that. I cannot understand that. We are living off \nthe greatest generation's investment in infrastructure in this country. \nWe have done nothing to honor that investment, to sustain it or to \nbuild upon it. Yet nothing we are doing is aimed at fixing the problem. \nOur inaction comes with an extraordinarily high cost. So I can tell \nyou, as the senior Democrat on the subcommittee on mass transit, I \ncategorically reject the idea that we cannot afford to fix our \ntransportation system.\n  The truth is, we cannot afford not to fix it. The Amtrak disaster \nlast night is a tragic reminder that we have to act. We are reminded of \nthe tragic consequences of inaction and the impact of inaction on the \nlives of workers and families, on their lives and their ability to get \nto work and do their jobs with confidence that they will be safe.\n  So, as a member of the Finance Committee, and the ranking member of \nthe transit subcommittee, I have been advocating that we act as soon as \npossible. We cannot keep pretending the problem is going to resolve \nitself if we just wait long enough. We simply cannot afford to wait. I \nhope that everyone in this Chamber--Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents alike--will come together, will work together, and make \nreal progress in building the future that we can be proud of.\n  We can start by putting politics aside to think about the safety of \nthe American people, to think about the future, to think about \nAmerica's competitiveness, and to find common ground to do whatever it \ntakes to invest in America's railroads, ports, highways, and bridges, \nand to invest in our future.\n  So let's not wait until there is another tragic headline or to see \nthe consequences of what flows, as people along the entire Northeast \ncorridor are trying to figure out alternatives in the midst of a system \nthat is now shut down for intercity travel--all the transit lines of \nStates and regions within the Northeast corridor that depend upon using \nAmtrak lines to get to different destinations for their residents, to \nget people to one of the great hospitals along the Northeast corridor, \nto get people to their Nation's Capital to advocate with their \ngovernment, to get people and the sales forces of companies to work, to \nget home.\n  Let's not wait until we have another tragedy to think about the \nconsequences of our transportation system, what it means to the Nation, \nor until the next time when lives are lost. I think we can do much \nbetter. I have faith that hopefully this will be a crystalizing moment \nfor us on this critical issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I think she will \nbe easily confirmed. I know there has been a delay\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\nof several weeks getting her here, but I thank Senator Isakson, who \nworked so hard to get her before this body. It should not have taken \nthis long. Ms. Yates was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with \noverwhelming bipartisan support almost 3 weeks ago. We are finally \nvoting to confirm her today to serve as the second highest law \nenforcement office in our country, and it is long past due. This is the \nleast we can do to honor law enforcement, as it is National Police \nWeek.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is critical to the efficient functioning \nof the Department of Justice. The person serving in that position works \ndiligently behind the scenes. The position requires someone who is of \nutmost competence, who prioritizes the Department above all else, and \nwho executes the mission and vision of the Attorney General.\n  We are actually fortunate here. We will have an Attorney General and \na Deputy Attorney General whose backgrounds are very similar--both have \nshown their ability as law enforcement officers, both have been \nprosecuting attorneys, and both have similar views, as we saw during \nthe confirmation hearings, on all the major issues.\n  Sally Yates is an ideal person for this position, as those who know \nher can attest. She was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. She grew up \nseeing the justice system as a force for good. There was no need to \nlook outside her home for an Atticus Finch to look up to because her \nfamily members lived that example. Her father, Kelly Quillian, was a \njudge on the Georgia Court of Appeals; her grandfather, Joseph \nQuillian, was a justice on the Georgia Supreme Court; and at a time \nwhen women did not fill the ranks of the legal system, her grandmother, \nTabitha Quillian, became one of the first women to be admitted to the \nGeorgia bar. Ms. Yates carried on that family tradition, becoming a \ntop-notch lawyer who has prioritized public service above all else.\n  For more than 25 years, Sally Yates served as a prosecutor in the \nOffice of the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. For \nthe past 5 years she has served as U.S. Attorney of that district, \nfollowing her unanimous confirmation by the Senate in 2010.\n  Since January of this year, she has served as Acting Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. I have been at briefings she has given to Members of the \nSenate. I have also been at briefings at the White House where she has \nbriefed the President on issues before the country. She is an \nexperienced and dedicated prosecutor with a well-deserved reputation \nfor fairness, integrity, and toughness.\n  She is perhaps best known for her successful prosecutions of the \nAtlanta Olympics bomber, who pled guilty in exchange for a life \nsentence without parole; and for her prosecution and conviction of a \nformer Atlanta mayor for tax evasion. However, if you were to ask her \nthe most significant case she has taken on, she will tell you that it \ninvolved a pro bono representation when she was just out of law school.\n  As a junior associate at a law firm, Ms. Yates represented the first \nAfrican-American family to own land in Barrow County, GA, in a property \ndispute. The family had obtained a deed to their property, but lacking \ntrust in the court system, had failed to record their deed in a timely \nmanner. As a result, when the adjoining property was sold, a dispute \narose as to who owned part of the land. Ms. Yates filed suit to recover \nthe family's property. After a 1-week trial--in which she helped \nconvince a member of the ``Dixie Mafia'' to testify in court on behalf \nof the family--she was able to win the case before an all-white jury.\n  According to Ms. Yates, it was the most meaningful case of her career \nbecause it gave the African American family she represented a sense of \ntrust in the judicial system that they previously lacked. This case \nrepresents who she is as an attorney: someone who uses the judicial \nsystem as a force for good.\n  It is also an example of why she will thrive as the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. While most people seek the spotlight by pursuing high-profile \nmatters, Sally Yates devotes herself to the matters that are less \nglamorous, but just as important.\n  Ms. Yates also deserves praise for her dedication to sentencing \nreform and the clemency initiative begun by her predecessor, Jim Cole. \nIt is encouraging to see that we will continue to have individuals in \nthe Justice Department's leadership who understand the inequities in \nour criminal justice system's sentencing practices and the consequences \nof mass incarceration. As she made clear when she testified before the \nJudiciary Committee, sentencing reform is critical to ensure that we \nbetter allocate our limited law enforcement resources and to make our \ncountry safer. The clemency initiative is an important part of that \nprocess as well and I am glad that I have her commitment that it will \nbe a priority.\n  Sally Yates has received strong bipartisan support for her \nnomination. Among the letters of support the Judiciary Committee has \nreceived are those from Georgia's Republican Governor, Nathan Deal; \nGeorgia's Republican Attorney General, Samuel Olens; and former \nDemocratic Senator from Georgia, Sam Nunn. She also has the support of \nlaw enforcement and civil rights leaders.\n  At her nomination hearing, Ms. Yates was introduced by Congressman \nJohn Lewis, Senator Perdue and Senator Isakson. As Senator Isakson \nnoted when Ms. Yates was first nominated this past December, ``Sally \nYates is an exceptionally skilled attorney with a strong record of \npublic service and a well-qualified nominee to be Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.'' Prior to his retirement, Senator Saxby Chambliss also spoke \nout in support of Ms. Yates' nomination.\n  Almost 3 weeks ago, her nomination was voted out of Committee with \nstrong bipartisan support, so this nomination should not be an occasion \nfor further partisanship. The responsibilities of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral are too important to the safety and security of all Americans \nto be held up any longer. The dedicated public servants at the Justice \nDepartment deserve a confirmed leader in this crucial position, and I \nknow Sally Yates will serve with distinction as our next Deputy \nAttorney General of the United States. I thank her for her willingness \nto continue to serve this great Nation, and I want to publicly \ncongratulate her on this well-deserved appointment.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Eric Holder\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about a different but related issue.\n  Two weeks ago, after 5 long months, Loretta Lynch was finally sworn \nin as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States. I know she is \ngoing to be an exceptional Attorney General, and she has an exceptional \ndeputy in Sally Yates. But I want to speak here about the remarkable \nservice of Eric Holder, who has just left as Attorney General.\n  Many don't realize that he came to the Justice Department as a 25-\nyear-old law school graduate in 1976. He has served at nearly every \nlevel of the Department over the past four decades. I believe we owe \nhim our gratitude for his commitment to public service.\n  I also know on a personal basis how much Marcelle and I appreciate \nthe friendship we have with Eric and his wonderful wife, Sharon.\n  When Eric Holder's nomination was first announced in 2008, I said \nthat we needed an Attorney General who, as Robert Jackson said 68 years \nago, ``serves the law and not factual purposes, and who approaches his \ntask with humility.'' Well, that is what I said we needed, and that is \nwhat we got. It is the kind of man Eric Holder is and the kind of \nAttorney General he has been. He understands our moral and legal \nobligation to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans and to \nrespect the human rights of all people. His leadership over the past 6 \nyears shows us that.\n  I was there when he was sworn in as the 82nd Attorney General. His \nfamily was there--his wife, mother, children, and others. Upon being \nsworn in, he immediately changed the tone of the Department. As he \nfinished taking the oath, you heard this roar throughout the marbled \nand granite halls of the Department of Justice. The building literally \nshook with cheers. The dedicated professionals knew the Department was \nonce again going to be dedicated to a nonpartisan search for justice \nfor all Americans. These are highly professional and highly dedicated \nmen and women appointed by both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, who set aside politics. They just want \nprofessionalism. And they knew, with Eric Holder, they would get it.\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\n  His decision to dismiss the charges brought during the Bush \nadministration against former Senator Ted Stevens because of \nprosecutorial misconduct was a courageous decision. But, more \nimportantly, it sent a strong message that misconduct would not be \ntolerated under his watch, and the Department would adhere to the \nhighest ethical standards.\n  This sense of fairness and justice also led Eric to restore what he \nfondly refers to as the conscience of the Nation, the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Justice Department.\n  His work on voting rights is among the most important during his \ntenure, and in the last 6 years, he has had his work cut out for him. \nAfter the Supreme Court's disastrous decision in Shelby County v. \nHolder, where a narrow majority gutted the Voting Rights Act, the \nAttorney General recommitted the Justice Department to safeguarding the \nright to vote for every American. And that he did so at a time when \nthese constitutional rights were under attack has been supremely \nimportant.\n  For Eric Holder, this cause is not new. It is as deep as his family \nroots, which include the work of his late sister-in-law Vivian Malone, \nSharon's sister, who fought against segregation and for equal rights as \na college student, seeking admittance to the University of Alabama in \n1963. I know that Eric is deeply proud of her and of the countless \nbrave men and women who fought for equal voting rights and civil rights \nfor every American. Each generation has its trailblazers who contribute \nto our march toward equality. I and my family believe that history will \ncount Eric Holder among those patriots.\n  Eric Holder did not simply look to correct the misguided practices of \na previous administration. He sought to bring this Nation forward with \nan acute understanding that the fight for civil rights is not a single \nmovement of five decades ago. The fight, as he knows, continues.\n  Attorney General Holder recognized that the constitutionality of the \nDefense of Marriage Act, which discriminated against Americans simply \nfor whom they loved, could no longer be defended by the Justice \nDepartment. The Supreme Court's decision to strike down section 3 of \nDOMA vindicated his decision. Some argued that it was the Justice \nDepartment's duty and obligation to defend the constitutionality of \nthat statute. But just as our country came to see separate as \ninherently unequal, I believe Attorney General Holder's decision will \nbe further vindicated with time. Discrimination has no place in our \nlaws. Rooting it out takes leadership--the kind of leadership Eric \nHolder is known for.\n  He also recognized the inequities in our criminal justice system and \nthe consequences of mass incarceration. Our criminal justice system \nserves to imprison too many offenders for too long. This has resulted \nin our Federal prisons at nearly 40 percent overcapacity, consuming \nnearly one quarter of the Justice Department's budget. And this growth \nhas been largely driven by our misplaced reliance on drug mandatory \nminimums. These mandatory minimums too often see no difference between \ndrug couriers and drug kingpins.\n  Attorney General Holder's ``Smart on Crime'' Initiative, along with \nCongress's effort to reform our Nation's sentencing laws, has been an \nessential step toward addressing these problems. No Attorney General in \nour Nation's history has recognized the inequities of our criminal \njustice system more than Eric Holder. He has proven that addressing \nthese inequities leads to a more effective system. In fact, with Eric \nHolder, as our Nation's chief law enforcement officer, last year--for \nthe first time in 40 years--the overall crime rate and the overall \nincarceration rate declined together.\n  The Attorney General's commitment to fairness went well beyond \nsentencing reform. I look at the calm that he brought when he visited \nFerguson, MO, in the midst of chaos and fear. He helped to bridge the \ndistrust between law enforcement and the Ferguson community. He \ndeserves praise for the Justice Department's investigation and \nreporting of the police department and the circumstances surrounding \nthat shooting. These reports are scrupulously fair and they are fact-\nbased. His work has made the city of Ferguson reassess its practices, \nbut it has also provided a path forward for both law enforcement and \nthe broader community alike.\n  Now, to go to one other point. I share Attorney General Holder's \nbelief that we should not be afraid to prosecute terrorists in our \nFederal courts in accordance with the rule of law.\n  With Eric's leadership, we proved we could hold terrorists \naccountable by making them answer for their crimes in public, for the \nworld to see. Since Attorney General Holder assumed office, the \nDepartment of Justice has secured over 180 terrorism-related \nconvictions. This shows his dedication to upholding the rule of law, \neven under the most difficult of circumstances. That is arguably one of \nhis most enduring legacies.\n  I know a number of people, including some on this floor, would stand \nup and say: Well, we should lock these terrorists up at Guantanamo. We \nare afraid to let them come to our country. We should not allow them \nhere.\n  Instead, Eric Holder said: What are we afraid of? We have the finest \ncriminal justice system in the world. Bring them here; let the rest of \nthe world see what happens.\n  One by one, he did just that. They were each convicted, and they are \nall serving extremely difficult sentences. What he said is, we should \nnot turn our backs on the values of America by locking them up in \nGuantanamo--a place so many of us feel should be closed. Let them come \nbefore our court system. Let's make sure they are adequately \nrepresented--both sides.\n  The list of his accomplishments goes on. The Attorney General's \nleadership ensured that the most vulnerable Americans are protected by \nthe Justice Department, including those who have suffered from hate \ncrimes, domestic violence, and human trafficking. He guided the \nDepartment's steadfast implementation of vital legislation which passed \nthrough Congress, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act and the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act. These historic civil rights bills greatly expanded \nprotections for the LGBT community, for rape victims, and for Native \nAmerican domestic violence victims. As one who led the fight on many of \nthese issues, I can tell my fellow Senators that it would have been \nimpossible to pass them without Eric Holder's powerful commitment to \nprotecting the most vulnerable among us.\n  I talked about how when he returned to the Justice Department in \n2009, career attorneys lined the hallways to welcome back one of their \nown--cheers shook those walls. It had been a very difficult time for \nthe Department. During the previous administration, there were scandals \nof politicized hiring, the decimating of the Civil Rights Division, the \nU.S. Attorney firing scandal, and the legal opinions defending the use \nof torture. But 6 years later, in his final day at the Department, \nthose same professionals, appointed by both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, again lined the hallways in gratitude to Eric Holder \nfor his work restoring integrity to the Department. Eric Holder \nrestored the public's confidence in the Department. He leaves a \nDepartment that is now living up to its name, the Department of \nJustice.\n  I am thankful for his dedicated, unwavering service to our country. \nWe have a better Department of Justice because of Eric Holder's \nleadership. We are a better nation because of Eric Holder.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am in support of Ms. Sally Quillian \nYates, of Georgia, to be the next Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  Ms. Yates has been acting as Deputy Attorney General since January of \nthis year and has a long and successful career in public service. \nGraduating from the University of Georgia School of Law in 1986, with \nhonors of magna cum laude, she went on to spend more than 20 years \nensuring our streets were safe and our rights were protected in the \nU.S. attorney's office in Georgia. Ms. Yates served as the chief of the \nfraud and public corruption section and was the lead prosecutor in the \ncase against Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Park Bomber in Atlanta.\n  She was the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney in the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia, confirmed by this body on\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nMarch 10, 2010. Ms. Yates also served as vice chair of the Attorney \nGeneral's Advisory Committee.\n  Ms. Yates has not been afraid to take on complex and challenging \ncases and has handled herself with professionalism and integrity. She \nis effective in problemsolving and provides reasonable and rational \nsolutions. I am confident she will serve the American people with \ndistinction and dedication. I look forward to working with her in my \nrole as vice chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies \nSubcommittee.\n\n\n                        Amtrak Train Derailment\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, just a quick comment, if I may, about this \ntragedy that is now up to 7 deaths and about 150 people who were \ninjured in this Amtrak derailment. There was a report out of the Wall \nStreet Journal just a few minutes ago that apparently the train was \ngoing 100 miles per hour going into a curve and that the curve speed \nshould have been 50 miles per hour. If that is the case, that would \nindicate the conductor would not have been aware of what was happening \nor was negligent in what was happening. But there is something we can \ndo about that, and it is called positive train control. Indeed, this is \nan issue which is facing all of the railroads. The infrastructure is \nvery expensive, and the question is, How much should it be delayed in \nthe future because it is not ready to go?\n  Positive train control would--in places where there is potential \ndanger or the potential of two trains colliding, there is automatic \nmonitoring, and electronically it would change the speed of the train.\n  Interestingly, Amtrak in the Northeast corridor already has some of \nthis positive train control on the tracks, but apparently it did not at \nthis particular location, in which case, that begs the question, What \ndo we need to do if this is ultimately, by the NTSB investigation, \ndetermined to be the cause?\n  One of the things this Senator would suggest is that we certainly do \nnot want to cut Amtrak's budget. To the contrary, I would think we \nwould want to increase Amtrak's budget. I am rounding numbers here, but \nAmtrak basically has about $3 billion in revenues, but they have about \n$4 billion in expenses. The difference is made up by the Federal \nGovernment. In the past, that difference has been about $1.4 billion. \nThe House is considering legislation that would cut that down to $1.1 \nbillion, when, in fact, Amtrak is asking for $2 billion.\n  Is the funding the only question? I do not think we will know until \nwe get the NTSB investigation report. However, we should know this: \nRailroads and roads and bridges and other infrastructure are in \ndesperate need of repair and enhancement and expansion, and that is \ngoing to take revenue.\n  Is this country going to allow itself to be considered a third-rate \ncountry in infrastructure? By the way, that is not even to speak about \nwhat infrastructure does when you build it, the number of jobs. If you \ntalk to road builders, they will tell you that for every billion \ndollars, thousands of new jobs are created.\n  Confronting the safety issue is what we are focused on here with this \nterrible accident. Our heart goes out to the victims. But at the same \ntime, we have to look to the future, and we have to get our heads out--\nour collective heads--of the sand and start producing the funding for \ninfrastructure investment.\n  I think back to the time in the depths of the recession--as the \nSenator from Vermont will recognize--that we were going to do an \neconomic stimulus bill. We tried to get increased infrastructure \nspending, and we were voted down in the stimulus bill. Here we are \nyears later, out of the recession, the economy is returning, the jobs \nare increasing, but our infrastructure is still crumbling.\n  I speak about this as the ranking member of the commerce committee, \nand fortunately we have a chairman who feels the same way. Senator \nThune and I are going to be working on this as well as things I \nsuggested a moment ago about positive train control to improve the \nsafety of our traveling public.\n  Mr. President, I have one more thing I would like to say.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it on the pending business?\n  Mr. NELSON. It is not. Does the Senator want me to stop so he can \ntalk about the Assistant Attorney General?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If we could.\n  Mr. NELSON. Of course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. President, earlier I spoke praising Sally Yates. In my words on \nthe floor, I also spoke about the senior Senator from Georgia, about \nall the help he has given on this. I want to make sure I also include \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Perdue, who, under our \nrules, cannot speak from the chair, but I would note for the other \nSenators how his testimony was so supportive of Sally Yates, and also, \nin the committee on which he and I serve, he voted for Sally Yates. \nThus, both he and his colleague, Senator Isakson, were extremely \nvaluable in this. I do not want anybody to think I was not aware of \ntheir support. I would say to both Senators from Georgia that I am \ndeeply appreciative.\n  I yield to the senior Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee and my dear friend Senator Leahy for all his help \nand for his kind remarks. Sally Quillian Yates would not be before us \nif it were not for the Senator from Vermont. He has been great in the \nprocess.\n  I think it is fortuitous and it is a good omen that the junior \nSenator from Georgia is the Presiding Officer at a time when we will \nelect the Deputy Attorney General, Sally Quillian Yates, to her \nposition.\n  Sally Quillian Yates is a human being I have known for almost 40 \nyears. For 25 years, she has been the lead prosecutor in the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia. She has been an equal opportunity prosecutor--she \nhas prosecuted Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Olympic Park \nbombers, anybody who violated the public trust. Any abuse of power, \nSally Yates has gone after them, and she has won. She is fair. She is \nsmart. She is intelligent.\n  As a Georgia Bulldog--I realize the junior Senator is from Georgia \nTech, so I am going to throw this in--as a Georgia Bulldog, she is what \nwe call a double dog. She has her bachelor's degree and law degree from \nthe University of Georgia and graduated magna cum laude from the \nUniversity of Georgia Law School.\n  Sally Quillian Yates is a great Georgian who will become a great \nDeputy Attorney General of the United States of America. I commend her \nto each of our colleagues and ask the Senators to vote and send a \nunanimous vote for Sally Quillian Yates to be Deputy Attorney General.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee is coming to the floor. \nLet me end my remarks by saying that Senator Grassley has been of \nimmeasurable help in ensuring that Sally Quillian Yates gets to this \nposition. I thank the Senator for his support. Unless he has something \nto say, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield back my time and the remainder of the majority \ntime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if we have nobody here seeking recognition, \nwe have a few minutes left, and I am perfectly willing to yield back \nthat time also.\n  I do yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Sally Quillian Yates, of Georgia, to be Deputy Attorney General?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Florida (Mr. Rubio) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nToomey).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey) \nand the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning, I restated my commitment \nto working with Senators in a serious way to move our country ahead on \ntrade in the economy of the 21st century. I said that we need to allow \ndebate on this important issue to begin and that our colleagues across \nthe aisle need to stop blocking us from doing so.\n  That is the view from our side, it is the view from the White House, \nand it is the view of serious people across the political spectrum. I \nhave repeatedly stated my commitment to serious, bipartisan ways \nforward on this issue. Now, serious and bipartisan does not mean \nagreeing to impossible guarantees or swallowing poison pills designed \nto kill the legislation, but it does mean pursuing reasonable options \nthat are actually designed to get a good policy result in the end.\n  That is why I have agreed to keep my party's significant concession \nof offering to process both TPA and TAA on the table. It is why I have \nsaid we could also consider other policies that Chairman Hatch and \nSenator Wyden agree to. That is why I will keep my commitment to an \nopen amendment process once we get on the bill.\n  Of course, our friends across the aisle say they also want a path \nforward on all four of the trade bills the Finance Committee passed. \nThis isn't just an issue for our friends on the other side, but there \nis a great deal of support on our side for many of the things contained \nin these other bills. However, as a senior Senator in the Democratic \nleadership reminded us yesterday, we have to take some of these votes \nseparately or else we will kill the underlying legislation.\n  So the plan I am about to offer will provide our Democratic \ncolleagues with a sensible way forward without killing the bill.\n  The plan I am about to offer will allow the regular order on the \ntrade bill, while also allowing Senators the opportunity to take votes \non the Customs and preferences bills in a way that will not imperil the \nincreased American exports and American trade jobs that we need. We \nwould then turn to the trade bill with TPA and TAA as the base bill and \nopen the floor to amendments, as I have suggested all week. It is \nreasonable.\n  So I look forward to our friends across the aisle now joining with us \nto move forward on this issue in a serious way.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 a.m., tomorrow, \nMay 14, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar \nNo. 57, H.R. 1295, and Calendar No. 56, H.R. 644, en bloc; that the \nHatch amendments at the desk, the text of which are S. 1267 and S. \n1269, respectively, be considered and agreed to; that no further \namendments be in order; and that at 12 noon the bills, as amended, be \nread a third time and the Senate then vote on passage of H.R. 1295, as \namended, followed by a vote on passage of H.R. 644, as amended, with no \nintervening action or debate, and that there be a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold needed for passage of each bill; and that if passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. I \nfurther ask that following disposition of H.R. 644, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 1314 be agreed to, the motion to reconsider \nthe failed cloture vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1314 be agreed \nto, and that at 2 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1314; further, that if \ncloture is invoked, the 30 hours of postcloture consideration under \nrule XXII be deemed expired at 10 p.m. on Thursday night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  First of all, I want to take just a very brief minute and express my \nappreciation to all my Democratic colleagues who have been \nunderstanding and vocal in their opinions as to what we should do to \nmove forward. I also extend my appreciation to the Republican \nleadership, the majority leader, for having this suggestion to go \nforward. We have worked together the last 24 hours, and I think we have \ncome up with something that is fair.\n  The bipartisan majority of the Finance Committee reported out four \ntrade measures, fast-track, trade adjustment assistance, trade \nenforcement, and a bill expanding trade for Africa. Democrats want a \npath forward on all four parts of this legislation. Yesterday, we made \nit clear that we didn't accept merely a fast-track for new trade \nagreements. We also must enforce the trade agreements we make.\n  The proposal before us today will provide us that path forward. I \nlook forward to consideration today and tomorrow of the trade \nenforcement package and the Africa bill. Once we proceed to the fast-\ntrack measure, the majority leader has offered an amendment process \nthat in his words will be open, robust, and fair. I appreciate that \noffer.\n  This is a complex issue and one that deserves full and robust debate. \nOnce we get on the trade bill, then we have to debate and vote on a \nnumber of amendments. So with that background and the understanding \nthat we have on both sides, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. While I do not rise with the intention of objecting, may \nI propound a question to the majority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we get the approval first.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would prefer to propound the question first. Mr. \nLeader, as I understand it, the Africa bill and the trade enforcement \nbill will be in tandem together and not subject to amendment, and then \nwe will go to TPA and TAA, which will be open to amendments; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. In that case, I will not object, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Coons and I be able to make a 1-minute statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in the committee on the AGOA Act, we put \nin an amendment to ensure an in-cycle and out-of-cycle review of South \nAfrican trade practices vis-a-vis poultry and other issues important to \nthe United States. We would have offered an amendment on the floor had \nit been\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\npossible without this UC, but with this UC coming forward and not \nobjecting, we have gotten permission to talk to Ambassador Froman, who \nhas assured us he is willing to instigate an out-of-cycle review \nimmediately or whenever necessary to review the trade practices of \nSouth Africa vis-a-vis poultry. I commend him on doing that and wanted \nto memorialize that in the Record.\n  I yield to Senator Coons for the purpose of confirmation.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Isakson of \nGeorgia and express my shared concern that if we are going to proceed \nto a long-term renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which \nprovides duty-free, quota-free access to the U.S. markets to all of \nsub-Saharan Africa--which I support and have worked hard with the \nSenator from Georgia and many others to make possible--that we also \nensure there is effective trade enforcement. This is a basic principle \nthat underlies all the proceedings here today; that those of us who \nsupport free trade and global trade also support fair trade and \neffective enforcement.\n  As the good Senator from Georgia recently commented, we are acting in \nreliance upon a representation by the U.S. Trade Representative that \nthere will be enforcement action taken, if appropriate, on access to \nmarkets in South Africa.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I want \nto thank the Senate majority leader for working with us in a \nconstructive fashion to make it possible for all of the vital parts of \nthe trade package to be considered. I look forward to working closely \nwith him.\n  Colleagues, I will say that what has been done through the \ncooperation of the majority leader and the minority leader is, in \neffect, to say that trade enforcement will be the first bill to be \ndebated; and in doing so, it drives home yesterday's message of 13 \nprotrade Democrats who together said robust enforcement of our trade \nlaws is a prerequisite to a modern trade policy. In making this the \nfirst topic for debate, it is a long overdue recognition that vigorous \ntrade enforcement has to be in the forefront, not in the rear, and a \nrecognition that the 1990 NAFTA trade playbook is being set aside.\n  I am going to be brief at this point, but I would just like to give a \nlittle bit of history as to how we got to this point.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, would the Senator from Oregon yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BROWN. I want to thank Senator Wyden for his work on the Customs \nbill that we will be debating, the bill to which he is referring, \nespecially his amendment that we worked on, the prohibition of child \nlabor, closing an 85-year loophole, if you will, allowing child labor \nin far too many cases, and we as a nation were allowing the importation \nof goods produced by child labor. I appreciate his support and Senator \nHatch's support early in the process before the markup began on our \n``level the playing field'' language, which is particularly important \nto a number of industries in this country, to make the playing field \nmore level, as Senator Wyden was saying and, third, the importance of \ncurrency. We know how many jobs we have lost in my State and all over \nthe country because of what has happened with countries gaming the \ncurrency system. So I wanted to express my thanks to Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves the floor, I want to thank Senator Brown \nfor again and again putting in front of the committee and all Senators \nthe importance of this issue. I just want to read a sentence from the \npaper yesterday that really puts a human face on this enforcement issue \nthat Senator Brown has so often come back to. A quote in the New York \nTimes says: ``Candy makers want to preserve a loophole.''\n  Now, this is the loophole that was closed in the Customs bill. The \narticle goes on to say that ``Candy makers want to preserve a loophole \n. . . that allows them to import African cocoa harvested by child \nlabor.''\n  What Senator Brown has said is without, in effect, this enforcement \nlanguage, this vigorous enforcement language that is in the Customs \nbill, we would basically be back in yesteryear's policy, back in what \nwe had for decades and decades, where youngsters would be exploited in \nthis way.\n  So we are going to talk about trade here for a few days. I think \ncolleagues and--certainly my colleagues on the Finance Committee know \nthat I strongly support expanded trade. I look at the globe. There are \ngoing to be 1 billion middle-class people in the developing world in \n2025. They are going to have a fair amount of money to spend. We want \nthem to spend on the goods and services produced in the United States.\n  So we support expanding those opportunities, increasing those \nexports. The reality is expanding trade exports and enforcing the trade \nlaw are two sides of the same coin. Because what happens at home--I had \ncommunity meetings in all of my counties, had several in the last \ncouple of weeks. The first question that often comes up is a citizen \nwill say: I hear there is talk about a new trade deal. Well, how about \nfirst enforcing the laws that are on the books?\n  That is why the group of 13 protrade Senators yesterday wanted to \nweigh in, right at the outset of this debate, talking about how \nimportant trade enforcement is to a policy that I call trade done \nright--trade down right, a modern trade policy. I am going to be brief \nin opening this discussion, but I want to spend a few minutes \ndescribing how we got to this place.\n  A few weeks ago, the Finance Committee met and passed a bipartisan \npackage of four bills. These were more than a year in the making. The \nmessage I sought to send right at the outset was a message that would \nrespond to all the people in this country who want to know if you are \ndoing more than just going back to NAFTA. Those four bills suggest that \nthis will be very different.\n  The first, the trade promotion bill, the TPA as it is called, helps \nrid our trade policies of excessive secrecy. The reason this is so \nimportant is the first thing people say is, whether it is in South \nCarolina or Oregon or anywhere else: What is all of this excessive \nsecrecy about? If you believe strongly in trade and you want more of \nit, why would you want to have all of this needless secrecy that just \nmakes people so convinced that you are kind of sort of hiding things? \nSo we have made very dramatic changes in that area.\n  A second strengthens and expands the support system for our workers. \nIt is known as trade adjustment assistance. This is to make sure that \nwhen there are changes in the private economy, changes that so often \ntake place and cause workers to see positions they have had be \naffected, this is a section of trade policy that gives them a chance, \nalmost a springboard, into another set of job opportunities.\n  The third would finally put, as I have said, trade enforcement into \nhigh gear so we can crack down on trade cheats and protect American \nworkers and exports. The reality is trade enforcement is a jobs bill. \nIt is protecting jobs. That is another reason it is so important.\n  The fourth, which has been touched on by our distinguished \ncolleagues, the Senators from Georgia and Delaware, involves the trade \npreference programs that are so crucial to both our employers and \ndeveloping countries. Taken together, the bills form a package of trade \npolicies that are going to help our country create more high-skill, \nhigh-wage jobs in my State and across the land.\n  As I have said so often, if you wanted to explain what a modern trade \npolicy is in a sentence, what you would say is: This is the kind of \napproach that helps us grow things in America, make things in America, \nadd value to them in America, and then ship them somewhere, \nparticularly if you look to that developing world where there are going \nto be, in just a few years, 1 billion middle-class consumers. That \nstrikes me as a real economic shot in the arm that will be of long-term \nbenefit to our people.\n  Now, with respect to enforcement, I want to take just a few minutes \nto talk about why I think this is an appropriate opening step in the \nlegislative process. Now, I already talked about the 13, 14 protrade \nDemocrats who got\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\ntogether yesterday and weighed in as a group. Why we did it is that \ntrade enforcement in that particular bill, which is part of the initial \ndebate here, is a jobs bill. It is a cornerstone of a new trade \napproach that is going to reject the status quo.\n  As the President said, to his credit, during the State of the Union \nAddress, ``Past trade deals have not always lived up to the hype.'' My \nown view is a lot of that can be attributed to subpar trade \nenforcement. That, in my view, is because so many of the same old \nenforcement tools from the NAFTA era and decades prior just are not the \nright kind of tool to get the job done in 2015.\n  Our competitors overseas use shell companies, fraudulent records, and \nsophisticated schemes to play cat and mouse with U.S. Customs \nauthorities. Our competitors overseas, in a number of instances, \nintimidate American firms into relocating factories or surrendering our \nintellectual property. Our competitors often spy on our companies and \ntrade enforcers to steal secrets and block our efforts at holding them \naccountable.\n  To mask their activities, they hide their paper trails and engage in \noutright fraud. For a number of years, I chaired the trade subcommittee \nof the Finance Committee. I can tell you, these examples I have given \nof modern challenges is just touching the surface of what we found in \nour investigation. At one point, we set up a sting operation to try to \ncatch people who were merchandise laundering.\n  Not only does our trade enforcement need to catch up to these \nschemes, we have to have a trade enforcement policy that stays ahead of \nthe game. That is why the bipartisan enforcement package, the Customs \npackage, will take enforcement up to a higher level. This bill raises \nthe bar for all of our trade enforcers, whether it is the Customs \nagents at the border checking inbound shipments, the Commerce \nDepartment investigator looking into an unfair trade petition or the \nlawyer from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative following up on \npossible violations of trade agreements.\n  So I want to just quickly tick through a few of the major parts of \nthis trade enforcement package. A proposal that I pushed for a number \nof years to include will help Customs crack down on foreign companies \nthat try to get around the rules by hiding their identity and sending \ntheir products on hard-to-trace shipping routes.\n  Another will close a shameful loophole--a shameful loophole that \nSenator Brown and I just talked about--that allows products made with \nforced and child labor to be sold in our country. A third will build \nwhat I call an unfair trade alert to help identify when American jobs \nand exports are under stress before the damage is done. With this early \nwarning system in effect, you will have warning bells ringing earlier \nand more loudly than ever before when a country attempts to undercut an \nAmerican industry like China recently tried with solar panels.\n  I think that is especially important, because when you are home and \nyou are listening to companies and workers and organizations talk about \ntrade enforcement, they say: You know, it just gets to us too late. By \nthe time somebody back there in Washington, DC, is talking about \nenforcing the trade laws, the lights have gone out at the plant, the \nworkers have had their lives shattered, and the community is feeling \npain from one end to another.\n  So the point of the early warning system is we now have the kind of \ntechnology and access to the kind of information that can set off these \nearly warning signals. That is what the unfair trade alert provision is \nall about.\n  Fourth, for the first time in decades, the Congress would set out \nclear enforcement priorities with the focus on jobs and growth that \nwill build real accountability and follow through in our trade \nenforcement system.\n  Finally, it includes a proposal from Senator Brown that goes a long \nway toward ensuring that our trade enforcers use the full strength of \nour antidumping and countervailing duty laws to fight unfair tactics. I \nsaid months ago, repeatedly, making it very clear, when Chairman Hatch \nand I began working on this package, that strengthening trade law \nenforcement was at the very top of the list of my priorities.\n  I did, in starting all of those discussions and the debate, \nrepeatedly come back to the fact that for those of us who are protrade, \nwho think it is absolutely key for the kind of export-related jobs and \ngrowth that we need in this country, we have to shore up trade \nenforcement because it is not credible to say that you are pushing for \na new trade agreement if people do not find it credible that you are \ngoing to enforce the laws that are already existing on the books and \nrelate to the past trade agreements.\n  So strengthening trade enforcement has been at the top of my list of \npriorities for many, many years. The Finance Committee passed this \nenforcement measure with a voice vote. So that ought to indicate alone \nthat this was not some topic of enormous controversy. We had votes on \nthe trade promotion act, we had votes on the trade adjustment act. \nThere was pretty vigorous debate on those--voice vote on the \nenforcement provision and the Customs package because it includes so \nmuch of what I think Members, actually on both sides of the trade \ndebate, feel strongly about.\n  I have talked about why as a protrade Democrat I feel so strongly \nabout enforcement. My colleague Senator Brown speaks eloquently about \nanother point of view, but he feels strongly about trade enforcement. \nSo I am very pleased the Senate is on this bill, is beginning debate on \nthis legislation. I am thoroughly committed to getting this legislation \npassed before we leave for the recess. No one can ever make guarantees, \nbut I am sure going to pull out all the stops to do it.\n  I just want, as we close the opening of this debate, to thank both \nthe majority leader and the minority leader for working with myself and \nChairman Hatch and others to get us to this point. We had a bipartisan \neffort in the Finance Committee, and we are very pleased to see the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer join us on the Finance Committee. We \nhad a bipartisan package, as the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, \nin the Finance Committee, which passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n\n  Now, starting with this debate and with what is ahead of us, we have \na chance to build on the bipartisan work that took place in the Finance \nCommittee. It is very appropriate that we begin this discussion \nfocusing on trade enforcement, as the 14 protrade Democrats did \nyesterday in making an announcement with respect to the importance of \nthis topic. It is going to be a good debate.\n  The stakes are enormously high. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this legislation passed \nand to get a bill to the President of the United States to sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I have a concern. It is not about trade. \nQuite frankly, trade is one of the things we have done as a nation all \nalong. We were free traders before we were a nation.\n  One of the grievances we had in the Declaration of Independence was \nthe fact that King George was restricting our trade. We have always \nbeen individuals in a nation of trade.\n  My issue is particularly with this Preferences bill. Again, it is not \nabout the protections in it; it is about the way we pay for it. Now, as \nodd as it sounds, while we are doing trade and while we are trying to \nengage in things, we can't lose track of this simple thing called \ndeficit that is hanging out there as well.\n  We have basic rules on how we actually handle budget issues. For \nanything that we set out that is going to take several years to pay \nfor, we have basic rules. Those rules include that it has to be deficit \nneutral in year 6 and it has to be deficit neutral in year 11.\n  The way that is set up and the reason that it is set up is so that \nyou cannot game the system that way. You can't just backload the whole \nthing and say: We are going to be deficit neutral in the very last \nyear, but every other year we are going to run up the bill and have \nsome pretend pay-fors at the very end.\n  So the way this is set up is to have this basic gap. Halfway through, \nyou are deficit neutral. At the other end of it, you are also deficit \nneutral. Well, this is what the Preferences bill does.\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nThe Preferences bill sets up this unique something called the corporate \npayment shift.\n  So this is how it works. Six years from now, every corporation that \nhas $1 billion or more in assets has a 5\\1/4\\-percent tax increase in \nyear 6. In year 7, every one of those companies that has $1 billion or \nmore in assets gets a 5\\1/4\\-percent tax refund.\n  Let me run that by you again. This is set up, in the way the bill is \nwritten, so that 6 years from now taxes go up on every company--that is \n2,000 companies in America that have $1 billion or more in assets--by \n5\\1/4\\ percent, and in the next year they get a refund of that same \namount.\n  Can someone help me understand why every company in America has to \ngear up, change the way they do all their tax policies, pay an extra \ntax that year, and so that the next year they can get a refund? That is \nadditional cost. That is additional expense--only to help this body \ncircumvent the basic rules that we said we are going to abide by.\n  Now, in all likelihood, those companies won't actually do that 6 and \n7 years from now because, in all likelihood, this body will come \nthrough and will waive the corporate tax shift because it is now not \nyears 6 and 7. Now, it is years 7 and 8, and so it doesn't apply.\n  This is ridiculous. This is a problem--that this body is playing a \ngame in how we are trying to actually accomplish a basic rule.\n  Now, if anyone can stand in this body and say that is a good idea--\nthat we are going to raise taxes 6 years from now on all these \ncompanies and refund the same amount in the 7th year--if anyone can \nactually tell me that is a good idea, please do. All that this is set \nup to do is to be able to help us in our CBO scoring.\n  This is what I think we should do. Option No. 1 is to have a real \npay-for--not have some pretend and say this is a deficit-neutral bill, \nwhen it is not a deficit-neutral bill.\n  We have a $3.7 trillion budget. I think we can find a real pay-for to \nbe able to put it into this bill. If you are lacking for any of those, \nmy office can give you many options that are real pay-fors rather than \nsomething fake in year 6 and year 7.\n  This is option No. 2. At least admit that this is not a deficit-\nneutral bill and that these pay-fors are fake. There is something that \nthis body has called a budget point of order, and it should apply in \nthis sense because this is not a real pay-for.\n  Now, I have had these conversations with staff behind the scenes and \nwith individuals in this body, and I have been told the same thing over \nand over: This is how we always do it. In other words: You are a new \nguy here. You don't know this is how the game is played on the budget-\nneutral deficit, eliminating bills that really don't do that.\n  Yes, that is true. I am the new guy here, and I have heard this is an \nold practice--and it needs to go away, because no one can defend this.\n  How about this. How about next week I try to go get a car loan, and I \ntry to negotiate with the car dealer for a 5-year loan, and I tell him: \nI will pay all of my loan off year 4, but I want a full refund in year \n5 for all that I have paid off.\n  Do you think I am going to get that car loan? No, I am not going to \nget that car loan because he is going to say: That is fake. And I will \nsay: I have paid it off completely in year 5.\n  Yes, but we paid it all back in the next year.\n  We have to be able actually to have real accounting at the end of the \nday. This is not invisible money. This is debt that is being added. And \nwith a $3.7 trillion budget, we can find real pay-fors.\n  This is a practice that has happened in this Congress and in previous \nCongresses that has to stop. We have the ability to do that.\n  I oppose this bill because it is not genuine in how we are actually \npaying for it. Saying that we pay for it in year 6 and refunding it in \nyear 7 is not real, and we know it.\n  In the days ahead, I hope we can address this practice and not just \neliminate it for this bill, but that we can eliminate it from ever \nbeing used again in any bill as a gimmick pay-for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Amtrak Train Derailment\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today with a very heavy heart \nbecause of the horrific tragedy that occurred and is still unfolding \nright now.\n  Late last evening, an Amtrak train, train No. 188--a train I myself \nhave traveled on--carrying 243 passengers and crew derailed in \nPhiladelphia. It has been confirmed now that seven people have died, \nincluding Associated Press employee, husband, father of two, and \nPlainsboro, NJ, resident Jim Gaines. More than 200 people were injured. \nMy deepest thoughts and prayers are with those who are suffering today.\n  I am so grateful for the work of the hundreds of first responders, \nAmtrak crew, doctors, nurses, and many others who quickly, \ncourageously, and very professionally did their jobs and who no doubt \nsaved lives. As we speak, the search through the wreckage for more \npeople, living or dead, is still in process. All people have not been \naccounted for, and I hope and pray our brave first responders can soon \naccount for everyone who was expected to have been on board.\n  The 243 people--including passengers and crew--many of whom boarded \nAmtrak regional train No. 188 just half a mile from where I stand right \nnow--were headed to New York. They were on their way home, on their way \nto work, to see their husbands and their wives, their children, and \ntheir journey was horrifically interrupted when the train derailed \naround 9:30 p.m. in Philadelphia.\n  Since the incident, my staff and I have been in contact with Amtrak, \nthe National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, and the Department of Transportation. The exact cause \nof the derailment is unknown, although speed was definitely a factor. \nWe are in close contact with Amtrak officials and Federal investigators \nwho are working quickly to identify exactly what happened to cause this \ndisaster.\n  Amtrak train No. 188 was on a very familiar path. So many people take \nthis route. The train that derailed was traveling on the Northeast \ncorridor, which is one of the busiest corridors, a 457-mile rail \ncorridor that is the most traveled in North America. It is a \ntransportation lifeline, one of our main arteries connecting the people \nof Washington, DC, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New \nYork, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The Northeast \ncorridor transports 750,000 passengers every day and moves a workforce \nthat produces $50 billion each year toward our gross domestic product.\n  More people are traveling with Amtrak on the Northeast corridor than \never before. Just last year, 11.6 million passengers traveled the \nNortheast corridor. In New Jersey alone, 110 trains run daily along \nthis route. New Jersey Transit works in cooperation with Amtrak to move \ntrains along the Northeast corridor, where New Jersey Transit customers \ntake 288,000 trips on the corridor each day and 63.6 million trips a \nyear.\n  Yet, none of these numbers--none of them--are as important today as \nthat number of 243, the number of people riding on and working on \nAmtrak train No. 188 last evening, or the 7 people who died. We are in \na time of great sadness.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that has \njurisdiction over rail safety, I want to also say that my colleagues \nand I have been working in the Senate to develop policies and implement \nnew safety technologies that will improve rail safety and save lives, \nand we have been working diligently to finalize a draft of a passenger \nrail authorization bill.\n  Congress has not passed a passenger rail bill since 2008, and \nauthorization for that bill expired in 2013. It is unacceptable that \nCongress has not acted to provide the needed improvements, investment, \nand long-term certainty for Amtrak, and I will work hard to make sure \nthat we pass passenger rail, that it is a priority for this body.\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\n  In fact, today we had intended to introduce this bill authorizing \nfunding and improvements to passenger rail in the United States. Today, \nthat was our intention. However, in light of this tragic event, Senator \nWicker and I have decided to monitor the incoming information and take \nthis opportunity to evaluate what other actions might need to be taken \nas a part of the legislation.\n  I am proud of my colleagues who have worked so diligently to ensure \nwe get this bill done, and I thank the leadership, Chairman Thune and \nRanking Member Nelson, for their support. If there is an action that \nneeds to be taken to improve safety in the wake of this tragedy as we \nare finalizing this bill, I know we can work together to make it a \nreality.\n  That said, I must say I am disappointed in the direction of the House \nappropriations process, which risks starving Amtrak of vitally \nimportant funds at the very moment we need to be investing more in \npassenger rail and our country's crumbling infrastructure.\n  Failing to make the proper investments in our Nation's infrastructure \nis indeed crippling our competitiveness in a global economy. A 2012 \nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco report estimated that every \ndollar invested in our national infrastructure increases economic \noutput by at least $2. Failing to invest properly in infrastructure \nimprovement is threatening the public's safety.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends, and loved ones \nof the individuals who were killed or injured in last night's train \nderailment. We still aren't certain of the exact cause, but this \nincident is a searing reminder of the fragility of life. It is \nimportant that we also remember that we should do everything necessary \nto safeguard life, to make sure we have it and have it more abundantly.\n  Nothing can fix the damage that has been done to these families and \ntheir communities. We all grieve as a nation for the loss of life and \npray for those injured, that they recover.\n  I say now that we must work tirelessly to prevent another tragedy \nlike this from occurring and that we must do everything necessary so we \nas a nation can have a rail infrastructure and highways, roads, \nbridges--have an infrastructure as a whole that reflects the greatness \nof the people of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nthat, by some estimates, has cost the United States as many as 5 \nmillion jobs, which is a lot of jobs, and that is the issue of currency \nmanipulation.\n  We are going to have an opportunity, now that there is an agreement, \nto move forward on all of the issues related to trade, whether it is \nfast-track or helping workers or enforcement issues or the other pieces \nthat will be in front of us. We will have an important opportunity to \nseriously move forward in a positive way for our manufacturers and for \nagriculture and for all those who are impacted by currency \nmanipulation.\n  In fact, currency manipulation is the most significant 21st-century \ntrade barrier that American businesses and workers face today and is \nthe least enforced against. We take the least amount of action against \ncurrency manipulation, and yet it is the most significant 21st-century \ntrade barrier. If we don't take meaningful action to address this \nissue, we stand to lose even more jobs at a time when our economy is \ndesperately trying to recover.\n  Our workers are the best in the world, and we can compete with \nanybody--our businesses can compete with anybody as long as there is a \nlevel playing field and the rules are enforced. But we can't win when \nour trading partners cheat, and that is what is happening right now. \nWhen they manipulate their currency--when Japan does it, when China \ndoes it, when other countries do it--they are cheating.\n  A strong U.S. dollar against a weak foreign currency, particularly \none that is artificially weak due to government manipulation, means \nforeign products are cheaper here and U.S. products are more expensive \nthere. For example, one U.S. automaker estimates that the weak yen \ngives Japanese competitors anywhere from a $6,000 to $11,000 advantage \non the price of a car, depending on the make and model. It is hard for \nour American carmakers to compete when they are effectively seeing a \n$6,000 to $11,000 higher sticker price--more expensive than Japanese \nvehicles not because of any other difference at all, just currency \nmanipulation. That is a large difference that is based on currency \nmanipulation. In fact, we have seen some numbers that--at some points \nin time, the entire profit on a vehicle will be from currency \nmanipulation.\n  We keep hearing about opening Japan's markets to U.S. automakers. \nWhile that is fine and that sounds nice, it is really a red herring \nwhen we look at what is going on because Japan right now has zero \npercent tariffs on U.S. cars. So it is not the tariffs that are keeping \nout our cars; it is the complicated web of nontariff barriers that \nJapan uses to keep out American automobiles.\n  Beyond that, what is significant and what we have learned is there is \nlittle appetite for American cars in Japan. Last year, Ford's share of \nimports in Japan was 1.5 percent. Chevy was less than one-third of 1 \npercent. There were 13 times as many Rolls Royces imported into Japan \nlast year than Buicks, but that is not because there were all kinds of \nRolls Royces going into Japan. It is because there were only 11 Buicks, \nnot 1,100, not 11,000--11.\n\n  One of the things that is interesting is that in Japan they buy \nJapanese vehicles. I wish in America we bought American-made vehicles. \nWe would not be seeing as much of this challenge. It is a different \nculture there in terms of the pride of buying Japanese vehicles and, in \nfact, doing what they can to keep others out through nontariff trade \nbarriers. Taking down the trade barriers is a good thing. I support it, \nbut it is not enough. That is not what this is about when we are \ntalking about the transpacific trade agreement and the worries of \nAmerican automakers and other manufacturers as we do that. That is not \nthe big challenge. It is not about just trade barriers, making life \neasier for the handful of Japanese consumers who are looking to buy an \nautomobile from outside their country. Our manufacturers tell us that \nis not the main concern. It is not about competing in the United States \nor Japan; it is about competing everywhere else in the world. That is \nthe problem.\n  Japan has a population of 120 million people, but Brazil has a \npopulation of 200 million people. India has a population of 1.2 billion \npeople. In emerging markets, American-made vehicles are at a severe \ncompetitive disadvantage compared to vehicles produced in Japan or \nKorea, when those countries choose to manipulate their currency, which \nhas happened many, many times.\n  We are competing, Japan is competing, and the United States is \ncompeting for those 1.2 billion customers. If they can artificially \nbring down their price $6,000, $7,000, $10,000 or more to sell into \nthose areas, even though it is illegal in terms of the international \ncommunity--they have signed up saying they will not do it. But if they \nare allowed to do it and if our trade agreements allow them to do it, \nit is not fair.\n  Why would we do that to American companies? Why would we do that to \nAmerican workers? Why would we allow that kind of cheating to occur? \nThat is what the amendment that Senator Portman and I have is all \nabout, that we will be offering and asking support for.\n  This is not an issue that only impacts the auto industry or other \nmanufacturers. As everyone knows, I care deeply about agriculture, as \nthe current ranking member and former chair of the agriculture \ncommittee. Agriculture is impacted by currency manipulation as well. As \na competitive sector in the global economy, any practice that distorts \nthe economy, disrupts trade, and threatens employment has an impact on \nU.S. farmers and ranchers as well.\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the language currently included in the TPA bill does \nnot adequately address these issues, because if we are going to be \neffective around currency provisions, we have to make sure they are \nenforceable. There is some language there, but unlike other parts of \nthe TPA, there is not language requiring that any provisions in a trade \nagreement be enforceable. That is why Senator Portman and I have \nintroduced an amendment to this bill--to the TPA bill--that simply adds \nclear language to require that any future trade deals must include \nenforceable currency provisions. Very importantly, the provisions will \nbe consistent with existing International Monetary Fund commitments \nthat all of these countries have made. They signed up saying they are \nnot going to do currency manipulation, but we do not have enforcement \nto make sure it does not happen. Also, importantly, this does not \naffect domestic monetary policy.\n  I understand the arguments. I have great respect for our Secretary of \nthe Treasury, whom I work with all the time, and 99 percent of the time \nwe are singing the same song--not on this one and the same thing with \nthe President, someone whom I admire deeply. I have to say this \nadministration has done more than any other White House, I think, that \nI have worked with as a Senator or even in the House, to make sure we \nare enforcing our trade laws, taking trade actions, winning trade cases \nin the WTO. I am very grateful for that. But when it comes to currency, \nthere has been a debate saying that somehow our Fed policy, \nquantitative easing--what we do inside our country is somehow impacted \nby the definitions of the IMF, which is not accurate. A country can say \nit is. Anybody can say anything, but it would not hold up because it is \nnot accurate. We are talking about foreign transactions, the monetary \npolicies of foreign competitors in the global economy.\n  I am very pleased that we have bipartisan support for our amendment. \nWe are adding supporters all the time. Senator Rounds, Senator Burr, \nSenator Casey, Senator Shaheen, and we have other Senators that will be \njoining us as well. We have growing support and understanding of how \ncritical this is.\n  The inclusion of strong and enforceable currency provisions in our \ntrade agreements make clear to our trading partners that this \nuncompetitive trade practice will no longer be accepted. We are not \njust going to talk about it. We talk a lot about it. We talk a lot \nabout this issue and the loss of American jobs because of currency \nmanipulation. But by putting it in the core instructions for our \nnegotiators as they walk into a trade negotiation, to have listed \nalongside critical provisions regarding labor laws and environment and \nintellectual property rights and human rights and other areas, to say \ncurrency manipulation, your policies around currency we believe are \ncritically important in a global economy if we are going to compete on \na level playing field and not continue to lose American jobs.\n  Some would call this amendment a poison pill to the TPA. That could \nnot be further from the truth. It is absolutely possible. In fact, we \nhave Members supporting our amendment who also support TPA, the \nunderlying bill. They want to make sure it is a clear outline of the \npriorities and instructions for any negotiations.\n  I have not heard from a single one of my colleagues that he or she \nwill oppose the bill because our amendment is not adopted. This is not \na poison pill. What I do hear repeatedly, though, is that one of the \nprincipal justifications for granting the administration trade \npromotion authority, fast-track--a process where we can amend it, a \nsimple majority vote--is that Congress sets forth its priorities in \ntrade promotion authority.\n  We are laying out what is important for the people of our country, \nfor our businesses, for our workers in trade negotiations. If that is \nthe case, then how can something deemed appropriate, deemed a priority \nby all of us be a poison pill?\n  It is not our job to match our priorities with their negotiations. \nThe negotiations are supposed to match our priorities. They are laid \nout in TPA. Otherwise, why do we give fast-track authority?\n  It is our responsibility on behalf of American businesses, American \nworkers, and American communities to tell the administration what we \nexpect them to fight for on behalf of the people of our country. We \nalready insist on enforceable standards in other negotiating \nobjectives. I support these, and I believe they should be as strong as \npossible, including issues around labor law, environment, and \nintellectual property rights. Why should currency manipulation be any \ndifferent?\n  This is about Congress setting up the list of priorities for \nnegotiating objectives, and then in return for that, we then allow a \nfast-track process where any final bill cannot be amended. If we are \ngoing to give up that authority, that power, I think we have a right to \nlay out the conditions under which we would do that.\n  If we lost 5 million jobs around the globe--5 million jobs because of \ncurrency manipulation coming predominantly from Asian countries that we \nare now negotiating with--we have a right to say we want that to stop. \nWe expect there to be a strong, enforceable currency manipulation \nprovision in any law we pass that then gives up our right to amend a \ntrade agreement.\n  There is no way that I believe the entire transpacific agreement \nhinges on whether we include enforceable currency provisions. If that \nis true, it calls into question what else is in the agreement. Why are \nthere TPP countries that are so concerned about enforceable standards--\nwhich, by the way, they have all signed up through the IMF as part of \nthe global community--they have all signed that they will not do it. If \nthe argument now is that they are not doing it, then why are people \nfighting so hard to keep this requirement out of TPA if they are so \nconfident this will never occur again?\n  Our ability to address currency issues in trade agreements is not \ncomplicated, again, by our own domestic monetary policies, including \nquantitative easing. In fact, we specifically put in the amendment that \nit does not affect domestic monetary policies.\n  We have heard this over and over again. There has been confusion that \nhas been spread. The IMF has rules about what is and what is not direct \ncurrency manipulation. They are clear rules. They are rules that all of \nthe IMF countries have agreed to. They are rules that the United States \nhas followed while they are doing quantitative easing. They are rules \nthat Japan has flagrantly violated not once or twice but 376 times \nsince 1991.\n  We are hearing that we do not need enforceable language as a \nnegotiating objective in the fast-track bill because Japan is not \nmanipulating the currency anymore. Well, 376 times they have chosen to \ndo that. Once we pass this, there is nothing stopping them from making \nit 377. What stops them is if they know that Congress is giving \ndirection to the negotiators to make sure there is enforceable \nprovisions in the trade agreement.\n  Let's be clear. The United States is clearly following the rules with \nour domestic monetary policy. We are following the rules. Therefore, we \nwould not be affected by this, and our amendment specifically \nreferences that. We are not talking about domestic policy. Other \ncountries could say that. They would be wrong. They would have no legal \nstanding to say it. You can say anything. But we do know this: Japan \nhas flagrantly violated the rules of the IMF--that they signed on the \ndotted line to support--376 times since 1991. Adding enforceable \ncurrency provisions to a trade deal simply adds enforcement to the \ncommitments that Japan and 187 other countries have already made as a \npart of the International Monetary Fund.\n\n  On that point, I appreciate the efforts this administration has made \nto engage on this issue with our trading partners both bilaterally and \nthrough multilateral forms such as the G-20 and the IMF. But, quite \nfrankly, we have not seen enough meaningful progress despite, I am \nsure, our good efforts. The progress we have seen can be wiped out at a \nmoment's notice and without any meaningful recourse if we do not \nrequire enforceable provisions in the fast-track law.\n  Then there is China. While they are not currently a party to the TPP, \nit is no secret they are interested in joining\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\nit down the road. While China's exchange rate may be up nearly 30 \npercent since 2010, the Treasury's own report to Congress released just \nlast month concludes that China's currency remains significantly \nundervalued, which, by the way, is the reason we also need to make sure \nthe Customs bill, which will be coming before us, maintains what we did \nin the Finance Committee. It should maintain the important legislation \nwhich Senator Schumer and Senator Graham have been leading for years. I \nam proud to be a part of that, along with Senator Brown and many \nothers. We came together on a bipartisan basis to make sure that China, \nwhich is not involved in the negotiations right now, is also held \naccountable for currency manipulation.\n  These two issues are not mutually exclusive; they are part of the \nwhole effort. If they are part of a negotiating agreement and it is TPP \nor any other one, we want to make sure our negotiators put this in the \ndeal. If they are outside of it, we want to also make sure they cannot \ncheat. That is why both of these are very important policies, and I \nstrongly support both of them in order to move forward in a \ncomprehensive way on currency manipulation enforcement.\n  For too long, we have relied on handshake agreements and good-faith \nassurances from our trading partners around the world that they would \nadhere to the same standards we set for ourselves. For too long, we \nhave seen our trading partners ignore their commitments by breaking the \nrules and leaving American workers and businesses at a competitive \ndisadvantage. It is time for us to say enough is enough. We don't have \nto keep doing this to ourselves.\n  I am very pleased that we have taken a step forward in a couple of \ndirections. I mentioned the Schumer bipartisan proposal which so many \nof us have worked on. That is a very important piece of this puzzle. \nThe other piece of this puzzle is the Portman-Stabenow amendment. As I \nsaid, these are not mutually exclusive; they are complementary. I hope \nmy colleagues will support both of them to demonstrate a serious \ncommitment. It is not enough to support a policy in one bill and not \nsupport a similar policy in the other part of the picture here, the \nother bill. If you support enforcing against currency manipulation--you \neither do or you don't. You do or you don't. We want to make sure we \nare doing it against those not part of the TPP negotiations and those \nwho are. We want to make sure that they get signed into law and that \nthey, in fact, are the law of the land. It is long past due that we \ntake meaningful action on this issue.\n  I don't know how many times I have come to the floor since coming \nhere in 2001 to speak about this and to be a part of this effort. It \nhas always been bipartisan, and I am glad to see that. We need a \nstrong, bipartisan vote on the Portman-Stabenow amendment. We have \nunderstood--those of us who represent manufacturing and agricultural \nStates--that this is a critical piece that will help to level the \nplaying field so our businesses, our farmers, our ranchers, and our \nworkers have every opportunity to compete and win. I know they will. I \ndon't have a doubt in my mind.\n  Our job is to make sure that there is fairness, that we have the best \ntrade deals, that they are enforceable, and that we have the tools to \nenforce them, which is also in front of us with the Customs bill. We \nhave to have all of it. We are in a global economy. Everybody is \ncompeting. Our job is to make sure we are exporting our products and \nnot our jobs.\n  If we do not focus in a very serious, real way on addressing currency \nmanipulation, we will, in fact, leave a giant loophole which those \ncompanies will drive right through and will allow them to continue \ncheating and taking our jobs. We can fix that, and I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will join us on a bipartisan basis for a very strong vote so \nwe can send a message to the administration that we are serious--\nincluding this as one of the instructions to them--as to what we expect \nto be in trade agreements going forward.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this week, I introduced a bipartisan \nresolution to commemorate National Police Week, which this year began \non Monday, May 10, and ends on Saturday, May 16. Senator Leahy, the \nranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary, and 32 others have \njoined me as original cosponsors of this measure. The theme of this \nyear's Police Week is ``Honoring Courage, Saluting Sacrifice.''\n  Police Week is dedicated to the brave men and women in blue who \nselflessly protect and serve our communities every day, every week, in \nevery community all across the country. The week affords an opportunity \nto honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice while striving to \nmake our neighborhoods safer and more secure.\n  Events are scheduled in Washington, DC, this week not only to \nremember those officers who tragically lost their lives in the line of \nduty but also to honor outstanding acts of bravery and service by many \nothers.\n  Tens of thousands of police officers, as well as their friends and \nfamily members, will gather in our Nation's Capital for these events, \nwhich include a candlelight vigil and a Police Unity Tour arrival \nceremony, among other events.\n  On this day, the 34th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service \ntakes place here on the Capitol grounds. This solemn service offers an \nopportunity for all of us to pay our respects to fallen officers and \ntheir families, communities, and law enforcement agencies that have \nbeen permanently altered because these officers paid the ultimate \nsacrifice. We owe these brave men and women our utmost respect and \ngratitude as we honor them on this important day.\n  A report by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund \nshowed a 9-percent increase in the number of officers killed in the \nline of duty in 2014 compared to the previous year's fatalities. \nGunfire was the leading cause of death among law enforcement officers \nlast year, and ambushes were the leading circumstance of officer \nfatalities in these deaths, according to this report. The number of \nfirearms-related deaths in 2014 represents a 24-percent increase over \nthe previous year.\n  This is the fifth consecutive year that ambushes have been the No. 1 \ncause of felonious deaths of law enforcement officers, according to the \nNational Sheriffs' Association. In my home State of Iowa, there have \nbeen nearly 200 line-of-duty deaths over many years. The fallen include \nnumerous law enforcement personnel who were shot and killed or struck \nby vehicles while on duty.\n  At the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, the names of these \nIowans and approximately 20,000 other men and women who have been \nkilled in the line of duty throughout U.S. history are carved in the \nmemorial's wall. Regrettably, 273 new names will be added to the rolls \nthis week to depict the loss of a loved one who did not return home \nsafely at the end of his or her duty.\n  Already, in 2015, we have witnessed 44 tragic deaths and senseless \nmurders of our law enforcement protectors and our guardians of the \npeace. Just this past weekend, we all heard on television that \nHattiesburg, MS, Police Department Officers Benjamin Deen and Liquori \nTate were quickly and violently murdered during a traffic stop that was \nanything but routine. Our hearts go out to their families and the \nfamilies of all who have lost their loved ones in the line of duty.\n  The men and women of law enforcement go to work shift after shift, \nfrequently missing celebrations of birthdays, anniversaries, and \nholidays because they believe in serving something greater than \nthemselves. The work of law enforcement is not a job; it is a calling \nto these people. That calling and those officers' devotion to duty \nmerits our utmost respect and gratitude.\n  As I conclude, I call on all Americans this week to pause and \ncontemplate\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\nthe safety and security we all enjoy. We all must recognize that such \npeace is the result of sacrifices made by brave men and women of law \nenforcement.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for their \noverwhelming support of this year's resolution designating National \nPolice Week, which this week passed the full Senate by unanimous \nconsent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have all now heard the good news with \nregard to our ongoing efforts to advance U.S. trade policy. We are \ntalking about trillions of dollars over the years. After a lot of \ndiscussion and back and forth, we have come to an agreement on a path \nforward. I am very happy to say that finally, at long last, common \nsense has prevailed.\n  On April 22, the Senate Finance Committee reported four separate \ntrade bills--a bill to renew trade promotion authority, or TPA; another \nto reauthorize trade adjustment assistance, or TAA; a trade preferences \nbill; and a Customs and Enforcement bill.\n  Throughout the recent discussion on trade policy, the TPA bill has \ngotten most of the attention. That makes sense. After all, it is \nPresident Obama's top legislative priority. If we could get it passed, \nits impact would be felt immediately. And he is right on that, \nPresident Obama is right on this issue, and I am happy to help him get \nthis through, if we can.\n  The TAA bill--the trade adjustment assistance bill--although I am not \necstatic to admit it, is part of the effort. We have known from the \noutset that in order to ensure passage of TPA, that TAA must move along \nwith it. That is a concession we were always willing to make, although \nmost of us on the Republican side are not all that crazy about TAA and \nmany will vote against it, including me. TAA is trade adjustment \nassistance, and that is what the union movement has insisted on. \nDemocrats are unanimously in favor of it. Republicans are not ecstatic \nabout it at all. In fact, we think it is a waste in many ways, but it \nis the price of doing business on TPA.\n  The path to the other two bills, the preferences bill and the Customs \nbill, has always been a bit more uncertain, but once again, we knew \nthat from the beginning.\n  I am pleased to say that we have reached an agreement that will allow \nus to consider and hopefully pass all four of the Finance Committee \ntrade bills in relatively short order. Under the agreement, the Senate \nwill vote tomorrow on our Customs bill as well as our trade preferences \nbill. This will pave the way for another cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to a vehicle to move TPA and TAA.\n  Although I am wary of counting my proverbial chickens before they are \nhatched--no pun intended--I expect we will get a strong bipartisan vote \nin favor of finally beginning the debate on these important bills, and \nwe should.\n  This is, in my opinion, the best of all possible outcomes. This is \nwhat Republicans have been working toward all along--and, I might add, \nsome courageous Democrats as well. While we could not and still cannot \nguarantee that all four bills will become law, we certainly want to see \nthe Customs and preferences bills pass the Senate. I am a coauthor of \nboth of those bills. They are high priorities for me. It was never my \nintention to let them wither on the legislative calendar. I was always \ngoing to do everything in my power to help move them forward. That is \nwhy at the Finance Committee markup I committed to work with my \ncolleagues to try to get all four of these bills across the finish \nline. That is the agreement which was made, and as of right now, it \nappears we will be able to make good on that commitment on a much \nshorter timeline than I think any of us expected.\n  Yesterday was a difficult day. I think it was pretty obvious to any \nobserver that I was more than a little frustrated. Today, I am very \nglad to see that my colleagues have recognized our desire to move all \nof these important bills and that they have agreed with us on a \nworkable path forward. But now is not the time to celebrate. While this \nagreement solves a temporary procedural issue, now is when the real \nwork begins.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, it has been years--decades even--since we \nhave had a real debate over U.S. trade policy here on the Senate floor, \nand I am quite certain we have a spirited debate ahead of us. I am \nlooking forward to a fair and open discussion of all of these important \nissues. It is high time we let this debate move forward. Indeed, it is \nwhat the American people deserve.\n  I am glad we now have a pathway forward. This is something into which \nthe President has put an awful lot of effort. He has an excellent Trade \nRepresentative in Michael Froman, one of the best Trade Representatives \nwe could possibly have, a very bright man. He has worked very hard on \nthese trade deals. They won't come to fruition until we pass trade \npromotion authority. Keep in mind that is the procedural mechanism \nwhich will enable the administration to get final approvals by these 11 \ncountries in Asia and the 28 countries in Europe, plus ours.\n  This is very important, and I for one am very pleased that we have \nbeen able to get this through the Senate Finance Committee. That \ncouldn't have happened without the help of Democrats on the other side \nand in particular Senator Wyden. We did part ways in this fiasco that \noccurred, but hopefully we are back together now.\n  All I can say is that this is one of the most important bills in this \nPresident's tenure, and it is a bill that could benefit every State in \nthis Union and especially my State of Utah, where we did $7 billion in \nforeign trade last year alone. For a State our size--3 million people--\nthat is pretty good, but I expect us to do a lot better under trade \npromotion authority.\n  Hopefully, the final agreements that are made in TPP and TTIP will be \nagreements that everybody can agree will help our country move forward. \nIt will help us to have greater relations with other countries \nthroughout the world. It will help us to encourage our own industries \nto be improve and be the best in the world and will be one of those \napproaches that literally will shape the world at large.\n  TPA is an important bill. I hope we can pass it. I believe we will. \nAs I have said, I am not a fan of the TAA bill and never will be, but \nwe understand why that has to pass as well--because the bipartisan \ncoalition that supports it would probably not permit trade promotion \nauthority without it.\n  All I can say is that I have faith that we have arrived and resolved \nthis impasse, and I hope that in the coming days we will be able to \npass trade promotion authority and really put this country back on the \ntrade path which it really deserves to be on and on which the rest of \nthe world will be pleased to have us, where we can have greater \ncooperation and greater friendships and greater feelings throughout the \nworld than we have right now.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as this body moves to consider trade \nlegislation, it is our obligation to make sure that our existing and \nfuture trade laws are enforced and that we are looking out for those \nhurt by our trade agreements.\n  Nearly everyone who supports these agreements--conservatives, \nRepublicans, Democrats--nearly everyone who supports these agreements, \neven the most vocal cheerleaders for free trade, such as the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial board, all admit that trade agreements create \nwinners and losers.\n  So if this body is going to vote for a new trade agreement, if the \nPresident is going to insist that we pass a new trade agreement, it is \nup to all of us that when there are winners and losers, we take care of \nthe losers. If people lose their jobs because of a trade agreement \npassed by Congress, because of a\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\ntrade agreement pushed and negotiated by the White House and ultimately \nratified by Congress, approved by Congress, it is up to us to take care \nof those people who lost their jobs because of what we do; that is, to \nmake sure they get the training and support they need, whether they are \n30 years old, 40 years old or 55 years old, to find new careers. We owe \nit to American companies, and we owe it to American workers to make \nsure the laws we make are enforced and that they create a more level \nplaying field.\n  We cannot have trade promotion without trade enforcement. That is why \nthe provisions contained in the Customs bill are so important.\n  Let me go through three provisions--probably the most salient, \nprobably the most important provisions in the Customs bill.\n  Now, go back a few weeks, and in the Finance Committee we worked on \nfour bills. We worked on the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and it \npassed overwhelmingly--no opposition.\n  We worked on the Customs bill that had a number of trade enforcement \nprovisions. Those are the three I will talk about in a moment--the \nthree major provisions.\n  We also passed training adjustment assistance, where workers who lose \njobs because of trade agreements get help from the Federal Government, \nbecause we made these decisions here that ultimately cost them their \njobs.\n  And fourth is trade promotion authority, so-called fast-track.\n  What this Senate did yesterday, when Senator McConnell tried to bring \nup just trade adjustment assistance and fast-track to the floor, is \nthat the Senate said no--a denial of cloture--because so many of us \nwanted to make sure that we didn't leave the trade enforcement behind. \nYou simply shouldn't send a trade agreement to the President's desk--or \ntrade negotiating authority to the President's desk--without helping \nthose workers who lose their jobs, without provisions to enforce trade \nlaws.\n  Let me talk about the three. First, there is currency. For trade to \nwork, all parties have to play by the same rules. We must protect \nAmerican workers and American companies from foreign governments that \nartificially manipulate their currencies. This puts U.S. exports at a \nserious disadvantage and results in artificially cheap imports here at \nhome.\n  So in other words, when a Chinese company, benefiting from \nmanipulation of currency, sells a product into the United States, they \ncan sell it 15, 20 or 25 percent less expensively--more cheaply--\nbecause of their currency advantage. Because they have cheated on \ncurrency, they can sell it more cheaply than it would cost otherwise, \nwhich undercuts our businesses' ability to compete.\n  Conversely, when American producers try to sell something in China, \nit has a 15-percent, 20-percent or 25-percent add on the price, almost \nlike a tariff. It is not really a tariff. It is really a currency \nadvantage that the Chinese have created that makes our goods not \nparticularly sellable when trying to compete with Chinese goods.\n  China's currency manipulation has been a problem for years, resulting \nin artificially expensive American imports to China and artificially \ncheap Chinese exports to the United States. It is not only China. The \nPeterson Institute for International Economics estimates at least 10 \nother countries engage in these practices--many of them mimicking what \nChina does.\n  This puts our American manufacturers at a serious disadvantage. \nCurrency manipulations already cost our Nation up to 5 million jobs. It \ncontinues to be a drag on Ohio's economy and on our Nation's economy. \nDiplomatic efforts to address this cheating simply haven't worked, and \nwe will continue to lose jobs if we don't take action.\n  This is a problem under Presidents of both parties. We have been \nasking for currency legislation for over a decade--with President Bush, \nwho opposed it; with President Obama, who opposes it. That doesn't mean \nwe shouldn't do that.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that addressing currency \nmanipulation could support the creation of up to 5.8 million jobs and \nreduce our trade deficit by at least $200 billion. This provision \ncontained in the bill before us today would clarify that current \ncountervailing duty law can address currency undervaluation. It would \nmake it clear that the Department of Commerce cannot refuse to \ninvestigate a subsidy allegation based on the single fact that a \nsubsidy is available in other circumstances, in addition to export. \nAmerican businesses have been put at a disadvantage for too long, and \nit has hurt American workers. Now is the time to crack down on currency \nmanipulation.\n  Issue No. 2 is leveling the playing field. This year I introduced the \nLeveling the Playing Field Act, which was included in the Customs bill \nwe are debating. It would strengthen enforcement of our trade laws. It \nwould give U.S. companies the tools they need to fight back against \nunfair and illegal trade practices. It would restore strength to \nantidumping and countervailing duty statutes. It would allow industry \nto petition the Commerce Department and the International Trade \nCommission when foreign companies are breaking the rules.\n  It has been a particular problem in the steel industry. The domestic \nrebar industry, making steel reinforcement bars--the rebar used in \nhighways, bridges, and roadways--is operating at only 60 percent, an \nhistoric low, due to foreign dumping. I met today with a rebar steel \nmanufacturer from Cincinnati to talk about this. He has been involved \nin trade disputes with Turkey and other countries.\n  Finished steel imports grew 36 percent last year. In the first \nquarter of this year, finished steel imports are up another 35 percent. \nImports of these finished steel products have captured 34 percent of \nthe U.S. market as of March 2015.\n  An Economic Policy Institute report shows that the American steel \nindustry risks long-term damage, including putting more than half a \nmillion steel-related jobs at risk, nearly 34,000 in my State, unless \nthe U.S. Government fully enforces its trade remedy rules. We know that \nwhen foreign steel is dumped illegally in our country, American workers \npay the price.\n  Leveling the Playing Field--title V of the Customs bill, that section \nthat was amended that was put in the bill prior to markup--is critical \nto all American companies facing a flood of imports. It would restore \nstrength to U.S. trade remedy laws to ensure that our American workers \nand our companies are treated fairly.\n  The last issue is child labor. This bill includes a provision to end \nan embarrassing, shameful, disgusting loophole in our trade laws. It \nwould close an outdated, 85-year-old loophole that allows some goods \nmade with either forced or child labor--unbelievably, for 85 years we \nhave allowed this--to be imported into the United States. It would \nstrike language in section 307 of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act that \nprovides an exception to our prohibition on the importation of goods \nthat are made with forced labor.\n  This loophole, called the consumptive demand loophole--that sounds \nnot nearly as bad as the child labor loophole--allows goods made with \nforced labor, including child labor, to be imported into the country if \nthere isn't enough domestic supply to meet domestic demand.\n  This exception was included in Smoot-Hawley in 1930, before the \nUnited States passed a law banning child labor. That is how outdated \nthis provision is. So when this provision was adopted, child labor was \nstill legal. We banned child labor, but we have let this loophole stand \nto allow the importing of goods produced by child labor for 85 years. \nThe Fair Labor Standards Act, which outlawed child labor in the United \nStates, was signed into law in 1938, and yet this loophole still \nstands.\n  The United States has ratified the International Labor Organization \nConvention 182 against the worst forms of child labor. We have ratified \nthe International Labor Organization Convention 138 on the minimum age \nof work. We have passed laws against child labor in Congress and in \nState legislatures. We are a strong partner in international efforts to \neradicate child labor. Yet, the consumptive demand loophole--child \nlabor, forced labor--allows those products produced in that fashion to \ncome into the United States. We have allowed the consumptive demand \nloophole to stay on the books.\n  Since the 1990s, there have been valiant efforts by some of my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nto fix this. I want to acknowledge Senator Harkin for his efforts. He \nhas since retired, at the beginning of this year. Senator Sanders, the \njunior Senator from Vermont, has been involved in this issue for a long \ntime.\n  Child labor is never OK. We are talking about children being forced \nto work in deplorable conditions, often under extreme duress. There is \nnever--never a justification for that. And there is no compromise on \nthis issue. No product made with forced labor should be allowed to come \ninto the country, period. End of discussion. It is immoral. It is \nimperative to fix this, and we can fix this. The Senate should not \nremain silent on this issue. Now is the time to shut the door on this \nugly chapter of U.S. law. We do it by passing the Customs bill today.\n  All these provisions were added to the bill with strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Committee on Finance. It is imperative they make it to \nthe President's desk. If we are going to continue to pursue an \naggressive trade promotion agenda, we must combine it with equally \nstrong trade enforcement language. Without enforcement, we are \nwillfully stacking the deck for our foreign competitors and against \nAmerican businesses and American workers. We see what happens when \nsteel mills close. We see what happens when manufacturers close their \ndoors because they can't compete with artificially cheap imports.\n  Trade agreements and trade law without enforcement amount to no free \ntrade at all. They amount to lawlessness. Without proper trade \nenforcement, American producers who play by the rules will continue to \nbe undersold by foreign producers who are cheating the market. We can't \nleave our companies and our workers with no recourse against unfair, \nillegal business practices. That is why the Customs bill is so \nimportant. That is why the currency provisions, the level-the-playing-\nfield title V provision, and the ban on child labor are so very \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to \nthe floor to talk a little about the customs legislation that is now \nbefore us. As my colleague from Ohio just talked about, there are some \nvery important provisions in this legislation that help to ensure that, \nyes, while we are expanding exports, we are also ensuring we have a \nmore level playing field for our workers and our farmers.\n  My State of Ohio is a State where we like exports. We have about 25 \npercent of our factory jobs there because of exports. But we want to be \nsure we are getting a fair shake. Working with Senator Brown and \nothers, we put together some great provisions that are going to be part \nof this customs legislation. I am hopeful we can get this passed. It is \npart of the Customs bill as it passed in the Committee on Finance, but \nI am also hopeful it will be in whatever provision goes over to the \nHouse and also is signed by the President into law.\n  Growing exports, of course, is a top priority--I hope it is a top \npriority for everybody here in the Chamber--and therefore trade-opening \nagreements are a good idea because we want to knock down barriers for \nour farmers and our workers, who are doing everything we have asked \nthem to do to be more competitive and yet still face unfair trade \noverseas. So we want to knock down those barriers. Some are tariff \nbarriers and some are nontariff barriers.\n  Where we have a trade agreement, we tend to export a lot more. Only \nabout 10 percent of the world has a trade agreement with the United \nStates. We don't have trade agreements with Europe or Japan or with \nChina. But in that 10 percent of the global economy, we send 47 percent \nof our exports. So, yes, trade agreements are important to open up \nmarkets for us.\n  Ninety-five percent of consumers live outside our borders, so we want \nto sell to them. By the way, when we don't continue to sell to them and \nexpand that, what happens is other countries come in and take our \nmarkets, and therefore our economy becomes weaker and we lose jobs here \nin this country. That is what is happening right now. For the last 7 \nyears, we haven't been able to negotiate agreements because we have not \nhad this promotion authority to be able to knock down barriers to \ntrade. So that is important.\n  But, colleagues, while we do that, we also have to be darn sure this \nlevel playing field occurs because otherwise we are not giving our \nworkers and our farmers a fair shake. That is where we ought to be with \na balanced approach--opening up more markets to our exports but also \nensuring that trade is fair. There are a lot of ways to do that, and in \nthis legislation before us we really help to keep our competitors' feet \nto the fire to make sure they are playing by the rules. One is with \nregard to trade enforcement cases. There is language in here that makes \nit easier for American companies to seek the relief they deserve when \nanother country is selling products into the United States unfairly \nbecause they subsidize the product illegally or because they sell it at \nbelow their cost, which is called dumping.\n  There are a lot of companies in Ohio that have had the opportunity to \ngo to the International Trade Administration to seek remedy and some \nhelp, but often they find that it is so difficult to show they are \ninjured, by the time they get help, it is too late. So what this \nlegislation does is it says that when we have these trade cases, we \nwant to have the ability to actually make our case and in a timely \nmanner get some kind of relief. Otherwise, why do we have these laws? \nIf you can't get timely relief, sometimes you find yourself so far \nunderwater you can't get back on your feet. That is why I am really \nexcited about passing this Customs bill, because if we do that, we will \nput in place a better way for companies to go to their government and \nto seek the relief their workers deserve and to get it in a timely \nmanner so it can really help them.\n  I was recently in northwest Ohio meeting with steelworkers to discuss \none of these cases that has to do with Chinese tires coming into the \nUnited States. These particular workers were at Cooper Tire in Findlay, \nOH, which, by the way, just marked 100 years in business. We want them \nto be in business another 100 years, but they are having a tough time \nbecause they can't compete with tires being sold at below their cost. \nIn response to the concerns they raised with me, I sent a letter to the \nSecretary of Commerce and called on the administration to vigorously \ninvestigate this case and to stand up for United Steelworkers in \nnorthwest Ohio.\n  We now have a trade enforcement case we are working on involving the \nuncoated paper product made in Chillicothe, OH, at Glatfelter. Again, \nthese are United Steelworker workers who are just asking for a fair \nshake. They want us to be sure that the paper being sent into the \nUnited States from other countries is being fairly traded and not \nillegally subsidized and not sold at below cost or dumped.\n  So the tire case and the paper case are two examples where the \nmaterial injury standard would really matter.\n  This is an important time for us because in Ohio we have a lot of \nother cases too. In 2014, we had a couple of important trade victories. \nLast year, I worked with Senator Brown to support Ohio pipe and tube \nworkers in Cleveland and the Mahoning Valley who are manufacturing \nparts to support the energy renaissance taking place in our State and \naround the country. I visited these pipe and tube manufacturers and met \nwith the workers.\n  By the way, these workers are doing a great job. Again, they have \nmade concessions to be more competitive. The companies have put a big \ninvestment in their training and a big investment in technology, and \nthey can compete if there is a level playing field, and they can win in \nthe international competition.\n  We won two trade enforcement cases just last year, among others \nagainst China, where they were illegally underselling and subsidizing \ntheir products. These victories brought some relief for Ohio pipe and \ntube makers and again gave us a chance to get back on our feet.\n  We had another win just last month with regard to extending those \ntariffs to ensure we do have this more level playing field. That \nfollowed trade enforcement wins I supported for workers who manufacture \nhot rolled steel at ArcelorMittal in Cleveland; AK Steel in Middletown; \nwashing machines at Whirlpool in Clyde, OH; and rebar at the Nucor \nplant in Marion, OH, but\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nalso rebar made elsewhere, including Byer Steel in Cincinnati. I \nvisited both of those plants and talked to the workers. They are \nworking hard. They understand they have to compete. They understand it \nis a global marketplace. They are willing to compete, but they want to \nbe sure it is on a level playing field, and if we do pass this \nlegislation, it will help them in terms of getting that.\n  Again, I don't think it is fair for American companies to see \nproducts coming in here that are being subsidized and undersold and yet \nthey are not able to get the relief they need. So I am hopeful we will \nbe able to pass this legislation as part of the customs law that is \ngoing to come before the Senate. That material injury standard is what \nit ought to be to ensure that, although companies now have access to \nseek this remedy, that they can actually get the relief they need by \nhaving this relief provided more quickly and having the standard be one \nthat can be met by American companies and workers who are being hit \nwith these unfair trade practices.\n  I am pleased this effort is supported by a lot of manufacturers all \naround the country. Today, I met with the fasteners from Ohio. These \nare the folks in Ohio who makes the nuts and bolts and so on. They are \ninterested in this case because, again, they see the ability for them \nto get a remedy when they need it. It is also supported by US Steel, \nTimken Steel, Nucor Steel, United Steelworkers, and others. Again, it \nis a classic example of working together to help protect workers and \njobs in places such as Ohio.\n  By the way, I hope it will pass as part of the Customs bill, but, \nagain, I hope it is also made part of whatever legislation goes over to \nthe House and to the President for his signature, and that may well be \nthe legislation that includes trade promotion authority.\n  I am also pleased that this Customs bill includes a measure that \nprotects American workers and manufacturers called the ENFORCE Act. It \nis also part of this package of bills that is in the customs \nlegislation. I have supported and cosponsored this bipartisan bill with \nSenator Wyden since it was introduced back in 2011. I have been proud \nto be the lead Republican on this legislation because, just as I talked \nabout how that bipartisan bill with Senator Brown on the material \ninjury standard is so important, we have to be sure that once we win a \ntrade case, countries don't use diversion to go around whatever \nprovisions are put in place.\n  Let me give an example. Sometimes a case is won against one country, \nbut then they evade those higher tariffs by moving the production to \nanother country, and they do it precisely because the trade case has \nbeen won. It is kind of hard to keep up with that, and that is why this \nlegislation allows the administration to go after this issue of customs \nevasion. Sometimes companies are spending millions of dollars a year \nfighting these evasion schemes. A lot of time and effort is put into \nit.\n  It extremely concerning that these goods continue to illegally enter \nthe country through illegal transshipment and falsified country-of-\norigin labeling, sometimes undervalued invoices to pay less for duties, \nand sometimes misclassifying goods so they can slip through our customs \nwithout being subject to tariffs.\n  Let me give an example of this. Workers in Ohio produce prestressed \nconcrete steel wire strand, called PC strand. It is one of our big \nproducts in Ohio. We are proud to produce it. It is actually made from \ncarbon wire rod that is used to compress concrete structural members to \nallow them to withstand very heavy loads. This would be for let's say \nbridges, parking garages, and certain concrete foundations.\n  There are 250 workers at American Spring Wire in Bedford, OH, and I \nvisited them and talked to them. They are very interested in this \nprovision because it helps them. Along with two other producers, they \nwere a petitioner in a successful trade case against China a couple of \nyears ago.\n  As a result of that action, both antidumping duties and also \ncountervailing duties were put in place. Why? Because this product was \ncoming in illegally subsidized and it was dumped--in other words, sold \nat below cost. So they went through the right process and were able to \nget these tariffs in place as it related to China; however, Chinese \ntraders began to approach U.S. producers and importers with proposals \neven before the case ended to circumvent this so that the trade orders \nthat would be in place with regard to China would be circumvented by \nsending this product through a third country, where this strand would \nbe relabeled and possibly repackaged to reflect a different country of \norigin. By doing so, these antidumping and countervailing duties would \nbe avoided.\n  And once these trade orders against PC strand were entered, Malaysia \ndid indeed become a new source--a significant new source of imports \nthrough use of this transshipment approach.\n  So that is what this legislation goes after. It says, look, when you \ndo this--these kinds of schemes, the U.S. Government is required to \ninvestigate these cases, and requires Customs to make a preliminary \ndetermination when they have suspicion of this happening. This is a big \nstep forward. Again, it is going to help companies, not just \nsuccessfully go through the process and the great cost of winning one \nof these cases but actually having it mean something to them and their \nworkers by ensuring companies don't evade it by going to a third \ncountry.\n  Another way we can support American jobs that is in this customs \nlegislation is called the miscellaneous tariffs bill. I am pleased it \nincludes a bipartisan bill that I coauthored. I authored this bill with \nSenator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. I thank her, and I also thank a \ncouple of other cosponsors who have been very helpful in getting this \nlegislation into the Customs bill and getting it onto the floor of the \nSenate. That includes Senator Burr of North Carolina and Senator Toomey \nof Pennsylvania.\n  Senator Toomey has been very helpful, because under the old way, if \nwe dealt with miscellaneous tariff bills, it was really considered an \nearmark because it was sort of a rifleshot, where individual Members \nwould take up the cause. He has been very helpful in bringing that \nissue to the fore and ensuring that under our legislation we are not \ngoing to have earmarks. In fact, we are going to be able to have the \nInternational Trade Commission be involved to determine what the merits \nof the cases are, not individual Members of Congress. That is very \nimportant to me. Senator Burr has been very helpful to kind of bring \nthe textile interests to bear here, to ensure that as we are looking at \nthis issue of miscellaneous tariff bills, we are ensuring that the \ntextile industry is protected as are our other manufacturers.\n  The miscellaneous tariff bill is interesting. This is for extension \nof miscellaneous tariffs that suspend or lower tariffs on a product \nthat is an input to a manufacturing facility in the United States, \nwhere there is no available product in the United States of America.\n  Right now we are paying tariffs on products coming in here where \nthere is no competition in America. If we can, through these \nmiscellaneous tariff bills, either reduce or eliminate these duties, it \nwill be less costly for our manufacturers to compete around the world \nand less costly for our consumers. So this is a good thing for our \neconomy. It is something we ought to be promoting, and I thank our \nleadership for getting this into the customs legislation. Let's deal \nwith this MTB issue.\n  By the way, the old legislation expired back in January of 2013--\nJanuary of 2013. Since that time, American manufacturers and consumers \nhave been paying a much higher import duty, which is essentially higher \ntaxes, than they should have to pay. That means they can't put money \ninto raising wages, increasing benefits for American workers, and \nmaintaining our competitiveness.\n  There is a recent study out showing the failure to pass this MTB \nlegislation has resulted in a tax hike on U.S. manufacturers of $748 \nmillion--an economic loss of $1.8 billion over the past several years.\n  This legislation is backed by the National Association of \nManufacturers, along with 185 associations and companies that urge us \nto quickly act on this, including 8 of those companies and associations \nin my home State of Ohio. So this is a reform bill that immediately \nrestarts this MTB process\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nlater this year, resolves these earmark concerns that we had \npreviously, and allows us to preserve Congress's traditional and \nconstitutional role in trade policy. It is the right balance. I am \nexcited it is in this Customs bill, along with the other provisions I \ntalked about.\n  Next week, I plan to talk more about another issue. It is not in the \ncustoms legislation, but it will be in the legislation debate regarding \ntrade promotion authority.\n  We talked earlier about the importance of expanding exports through \ntrade promotion authority but also ensuring we had this level playing \nfield. Part of the level playing field is ensuring that countries do \nnot manipulate their currency, which takes away so many of the benefits \nof a trade agreement. Chairman Volcker of the Fed has said something I \nthink that is interesting in this regard. He has said that in five \nminutes, exchange rates can wipe out what it took trade negotiators ten \nyears to accomplish.\n  We will talk more about this next week as we talk about trade \npromotion authority, because I do intend to offer an amendment that is \ntargeted, that is not going to be a poison pill in any respect because \nI think it will actually help us get more votes for trade, which is an \nimportant thing, and it is also something that, frankly, does not \naffect the TPP countries immediately because none of them are violating \nthe provisions of the IMF--International Monetary Fund--which is what \nwe use for our definition of currency manipulation, but they have in \nthe past, and we don't want them to in the future. We don't want them \nto take away the very benefits that American workers and farmers get \nfrom these trade agreements.\n  I appreciate the time today to talk about this customs legislation. I \nam excited to have it on the floor tomorrow and have the chance to vote \non all these very important enforcement provisions, to ensure that our \nworkers and our farmers are getting a fair shake.\n  Then, next week, I hope we will have the opportunity to take up trade \npromotion authority and move that forward, again, in a way to ensure \nthat we are lowering these barriers overseas for our farmers, our \nworkers, our service providers, so we can access those 95 percent of \nconsumers who are outside of our borders and send more stuff stamped \n``Made in America'' all around the world, adding jobs in Ohio and \nAmerica.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, I voted in opposition to \ncloture on fast-track trade promotion authority.\n  This was a difficult vote for me. Maryland is pulled in two \ndirections on this issue. On one side Maryland's agricultural \nindustries, such as poultry on the Eastern Shore and the Port of \nBaltimore, where they believe this trade deal will bring economic \nbenefits for the State. On the other side, I have constituents in \nDundalk who don't have a steel industry anymore and wonder why Congress \ndidn't do more to protect them from the effects of trade.\n  Let me be very clear on one point. I support trade. I encourage \ntrade. Trade is very important to my State. Maryland workers can \ncompete successfully in a global marketplace if they are given a level \nplaying field. That is why I support expansion of fair trade.\n  In the past, I have supported bilateral trade agreements. We have \nleverage in those situations and can get strong, enforceable labor and \nenvironmental provisions into those agreements to improve living \nstandards and stop child labor in sweatshops. But I have always been \nsuspicious of multilateral agreements like NAFTA. I have seen too many \nof these big deals fail to deliver the promises of new jobs and \nbusinesses.\n  Why is the role of Congress so important? To make sure the American \npeople get a good deal. I am ready to support trade agreements that are \ngood for America, agreements that are good for workers and good for the \nenvironment. Congress should consider trade legislation and amendments \nusing the same procedures we use to consider other legislation.\n  We should use the leverage of our trade agreements to ensure fair \ncompetition. That means workers in other countries should have the \nright to organize into unions. Without the strength of collective \nbargaining, their wages will always be below ours. They should also \nhave worker safety protection and retirement and health care benefits.\n  We should use the leverage of our trade agreements to encourage \ncountries to respect the basic human rights of their citizens. Everyone \ndeserves the right to live in a healthy, clean, unpolluted environment, \nand every worker should be guaranteed their fundamental rights at work.\n  When considering trade deals, I also have to consider the impact on \nmy State of Maryland. I am a blue-collar Senator. My heart and soul \nlies with blue-collar America. I spent most of my life in a blue-collar \nneighborhood. My mother and father owned a neighborhood grocery store. \nWhen Bethlehem Steel went on strike, my dad gave those workers credit. \nMy career and public service is one of deep commitment to working-class \npeople. In the last decade, working people have faced the loss of jobs, \nlower wages, a reduced standard of living, and a shrinking \nmanufacturing base.\n  I believe that a renewal of fast-track negotiating authority means \nmore Americans will lose their jobs in the name of free trade. More \npeople will get TAA benefits, but more people will need them.\n  Proponents of fast-track say it is inevitable that there will be \nwinners and losers. The problem is America's workers and their families \nalways seem to be the losers. They lose their jobs. If they keep their \njobs or find new jobs, they lose the wage rates they have earned. I \nhave said before that I don't want to put American jobs on a fast-track \nto Mexico or a slow boat to China.\n  I had to base my decision on the facts and what I know to be true in \nmy State. I have to be with my constituents who have felt repeatedly \nbetrayed by the trade deals. I voted to stand up for American workers \nand consumers. I voted to stand up for the right and responsibility of \nCongress to fully consider trade agreements. That is why I voted \nagainst cloture on fast-track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2845-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2845-S2846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING DEPUTY SHERIFF JOE DUNN\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

COOK\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I take this occasion to honor Rear \nAdmiral Kevin S. Cook of the U.S. Coast Guard for his 36 years of \ndedicated service to our country. He is a man who, throughout his \ncareer, has led from the front, and our Nation has benefited greatly \nfrom his efforts.\n  A native of Freehold, NJ, Rear Admiral Cook earned his bachelor of \nscience degree in ocean engineering and his commission from the U.S. \nCoast Guard Academy in 1979. Rear Admiral Cook spent his early years in \nthe service afloat on ``work boats,'' the Coast Guard's black hull/aids \nto navigation fleet. He served as a deck watch officer on the Coast \nGuard Cutter Madrona, as Executive Officer on the Coast Guard Cutter \nBittersweet, and as commanding officer of the Coast Guard Cutter \nCowslip.\n  After his afloat career, Rear Admiral Cook developed proficiency in \nthe Coast Guard's marine safety missions. His first operational ashore \ntour was at Marine Safety Office Hampton Roads. He was later assigned \nas executive officer and, subsequently, commanding officer of Marine \nSafety Office Houston-Galveston--the position he held at the time of \nthe September 11, 2001, attacks. Under his leadership, the Marine \nSafety Office Houston-Galveston developed integrated tactics, \ntechniques, and procedures to ensure the safety of the ports under its \npurview. In the years immediately following 9/11, Rear Admiral Cook \ndirected homeland security operations while commanding the Regional \nTask Unit covering waters from Freeport, TX, to Lake Charles, LA. He \ncarefully balanced safety and security with the need to facilitate \ncommerce in the largest petrochemical complex in the United States. He \nexecuted these duties without any substantial disruption to the \nwaterways or the more than 150 facilities that comprise the Port of \nHouston. His work established the foundation for Coast Guard maritime \nsecurity operations today.\n  Rear Admiral Cook also spent time developing policy for the Coast \nGuard and the international maritime community. He was an engineer for, \nand later the Chief of, the Coast Guard's hazardous materials division. \nHe also served as the director of prevention policy, where he was \nresponsible for many of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety, Security, and \nStewardship missions affecting waterways management, domestic and \ninternational shipping, recreational and fishing boats, and port \nfacilities throughout the Nation. During this tour, our Nation would \nonce again need Rear Admiral Cook's leadership and, as before, he would \nanswer that call, serving as the national incident commander's \nrepresentative to BP headquarters for\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\noversight of well containment activities during the 2010 Deep Water \nHorizon response. His specialty knowledge and incident response \nexpertise was instrumental to the management of the first-ever \ndesignated Spill of National Significance, SONS, in U.S. history.\n  Rear Admiral Cook later served as deputy commander of the Atlantic \narea in Portsmouth, VA, overseeing operations spanning five Coast Guard \ndistricts and 40 States, from the Rocky Mountains to the Arabian Gulf.\n  Rear Admiral Cook presently serves as the commander of the Eighth \nCoast Guard District. Headquartered in New Orleans, the Eighth District \nis responsible for Coast Guard operations spanning 26 States, from \nNorth Dakota to Brownsville, TX; more than 1,200 miles of Gulf of \nMexico shoreline from South Padre Island to the Florida Panhandle; and \nmore than 10,300 miles of inland waterways, including the entire \nlengths of the Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and Tennessee \nriver systems. It also oversees more than 179,000-square-miles of the \nGulf of Mexico and the associated oil and gas exploration activities \nthat occur on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  Unique to the Eighth Coast Guard District are the wide and varied \nmissions carried out daily across the gulf and heartland of America. \nRear Admiral Cook has provided strategic vision and critical \noperational support to ensure that the nearly 10,000 Active Duty, \nReserve, Civilian, and Auxiliary members under his charge have the \nnecessary tools and direction to protect some of our Nation's busiest \nports and waterways. In fact, the Eighth District oversees 17 of the \ntop 40 busiest U.S. ports in terms of gross tonnage shipped annually--\nports such as Houston, Lake Charles, Corpus Christi, New Orleans, and \nMobile that are vital to our Nation's economic prosperity. The Eighth \nDistrict's boundaries also contain the majority of our Nation's river \nsystems, which facilitate the movement of 880 million tons of cargo \nannually via towboat and barge traffic. His responsibilities stretch \n200 miles from shore into the Gulf of Mexico, where there are more than \n6,500 oil and gas wells, over 100 mobile offshore drilling units, and \napproximately 30,000 people working on the Outer Continental Shelf \nevery day. This is a vast area to command, but Rear Admiral Kevin Cook \ndoes so admirably.\n  A lifelong learner, Rear Admiral Cook has taken advantage of every \nopportunity to improve himself for the betterment of the Coast Guard \nand his community. He earned a master of science degree in chemical \nengineering from Princeton University, and he is a 1999 graduate of the \nU.S. Army War College. He later served a 1-year appointment as the \nCoast Guard fellow to the chief of naval operations strategic studies \ngroup. Rear Admiral Cook has earned numerous military honors, including \nthe Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Coast Guard \nCommendation Medal, and the Coast Guard Achievement Medal.\n  Rear Admiral Cook is a Coast Guardsman, but that is not all he is. He \nis husband to Kristen, and, together, they are the proud parents of \nthree grown children: Erin, a second-grade teacher at Rosa Parks \nElementary school in Woodbridge, VA; Peter, a technician at a TV \nstation in Winter Park, FL; and Megan, who followed in her father's \nfootsteps and serves as a lieutenant junior grade on the Coast Guard \nCutter Juniper in Newport, RI.\n  This week, Rear Admiral Kevin Cook will leave his post in New Orleans \nand retire after 36 years of exemplary service to the Coast Guard and \nour Nation. Including his Coast Guard Academy time, Rear Admiral Cook \nhas served our Nation for 40 years. Just as he has stood the watch and \nhas been ``Semper Paratus . . . Always Ready'' during his career, I am \nsure that he is ready for the next phase of his life. The Coast Guard \nwill carry on, as will his service legacy, through the men and women \nwho he has led and mentored for the past four decades.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in thanking Rear Admiral \nCook for his distinguished service and, in Coast Guard tradition, wish \nhim fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2847-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING FRANK HENDERSON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of Frank \nHenderson, an outstanding Idaho leader who will be missed greatly.\n  Frank personified public service. He served our Nation in the U.S. \nArmy 33rd Division during World War II. He served our State and his \ndistrict in the Idaho State Legislature for five terms. He served \nKootenai County as Kootenai County commissioner, and he served his \ncommunity as mayor of Post Falls. Frank was a newsman by trade who \nattended the University of Idaho and began his career in journalism as \na reporter for the Chicago Herald American newspaper. He worked as a \nmarketing executive before returning to Idaho in 1976 and becoming the \nowner and publisher of the Post Falls Tribune.\n  Frank was a humble man who did not crave the spotlight. Throughout \nhis career and life, he was a focused, organized, direct, driven, and \nsolution-oriented leader. Frank worked hard, and utilized his ability \nto work well with others to make progress and deliver many significant \nachievements. These included drawing in and retaining businesses and \njobs in Idaho, building the infrastructure to sustain economic \nexpansion, and eliminating impediments to job growth.\n  He recognized the value of consensus building and the strength of a \ndiversity of experiences and abilities. Diversification was central to \nhis economic development efforts. Frank promoted a diversity of \nindustry and local educational opportunities to support those \nindustries and grow jobs. He wanted to make sure Idahoans had access to \na broad spectrum of job opportunities, and he worked diligently to draw \nthose industries to Idaho while assisting businesses already in Idaho \nwith remaining competitive.\n  It is no surprise that Frank's talents and achievements have been \nwidely recognized. He was inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame in 2014 \nand received many other recognitions for his work in furthering \neconomic development and in support of seniors, veterans, the Boy \nScouts of America, and others. Frank received a Presidential Lifetime \nAchievement Award for Volunteerism.\n  Frank was so dedicated that he worked well into what would be many \npeople's retirement years to make improvements for Idahoans. We have \nmuch to thank Frank Henderson for, including his example of effective \nleadership, his tenacity in seeing projects through to completion, and \nhis focus on strengthening Idaho. I express my deep condolences to \nFrank's wife, Betty Ann, his children and their families, and his many \nother friends and loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2847-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2847-S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, this spring, we celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of President Johnson signing legislation to establish the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, ARC.\n  The ARC represents a unique partnership between Federal, State and \nlocal government in 13 Appalachian States with the aim to address \npersistent poverty in Appalachian regions. In Virginia, 25 counties and \n8 cities are part of that region. Since its inception, the Appalachian \nRegional Commission has worked to combat problems such as poor health, \nlimited transportation infrastructure, and the digital divide. Over the \npast 50 years, ARC has funded projects that assisted in the reduction \nof distressed communities in the Commonwealth by providing assistance \nfor water and wastewater projects, encouraging the adoption of advanced \ntechnologies such as broadband service, and supporting the development \nof community leaders and entrepreneurs. ARC has also recognized the \nimportance of economic development that encourages tourism to help \ncreate communities where people want to live, work and visit.\n  In 1960, 43.2 percent of people lived in poverty in Virginia's \nAppalachian Region. That number has decreased to 18.6 percent today. In \n1970, 28 percent of homes lacked complete plumbing. Today, that number \nhas been reduced to 4 percent. This progress exemplifies ARC's \nsteadfast commitment toward achieving its objective to increase job \nopportunities and per capita income, strengthen the capacity of \nAppalachia's citizens to compete in the global economy, improve the \nregion's\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\ninfrastructure, and build the Appalachian Development Highway System, \nADHS.\n  Great strides have been made in Virginia's Appalachian Region, but \nmore work remains. I am proud to have signed a letter to the chairman \nand ranking member on Appropriations requesting fiscal year 2016 ARC \nfunding at the President's budget request of $93 million. This critical \nwork must continue until the 25 million Americans who live in the \nAppalachian Regions are helped out of poverty and can achieve \nsocioeconomic parity with the Nation.\n  With the Appalachian Regional Commission's continued work and \ndetermination, I am confident that the region will continue toward \neconomic progress, growth, and development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2848-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2848-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13611 OF MAY 16, 2012, WITH \n                        RESPECT TO YEMEN--PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

Mr. KAINE:\n  S. 1329. A bill to remove the use restrictions on certain land \ntransferred to Rockingham County, Virginia, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, this bill has a complex backstory, but it \nserves a simple purpose: To allow asmall day care facility in Virginia \nto undertake routine repairs and maintenance.\n  For more than 20 years, the Plains Area Day Care Center in Broadway, \nVA, has served children from moderate-income families in Rockingham \nCounty. This facility sits on a 3-acre parcel that was once Federal \nland before the National Park Service conveyed it to Rockingham County \nin 1989 under the Federal Lands to Parks Program. The county in turn \nleases this land to the center for $1 per year, with a contract that \nruns through the year 2027.\n  The center is in need of repairs and maintenance, including a new \nroof. However, it has had difficulty in securing private financing for \nthese activities because of the complex land ownership structure--\nFederal land conveyed conditionally to a county and leased to a private \ncompany. Due to Virginia's status as a ``Dillon Rule'' State, \nRockingham County cannot execute a loan either.\n  This bill would specify that the 1989 land conveyance is transferred \nin fee simple, with no further use restrictions. I appreciate the goal \nof the Federal Lands to Parks Program to preserve land as open space, \nparticularly after having overseen the preservation of 400,000 acres of \nopen space in Virginia during my time as Governor of the Commonwealth. \nThere are no plans to develop the open space on this site, only to fix \nthe day care center building--a former Forest Service garage that has \nbeen on the site since before its transfer from Federal ownership.\n  This is a small modification that simply removes unnecessary \nbureaucratic hurdles and allows the day care center to continue doing \nwhat it has been doing for 25 years. My Virginia colleague Congressman \nBob Goodlatte has introduced companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I am pleased to join him in this common-sense, \nbipartisan effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/13/senate-section/article/S2851-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2851-S2852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1222.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``AGOA Extension and \n     Enhancement Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, \n     development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and stability in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa \n     has more than tripled since the enactment of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct \n     investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost six-fold.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage \n     and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African \n     countries, to boost trade and investment between the United \n     States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and \n     strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n       (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is \n     enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the \n     fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate \n     sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, \n     stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify \n     sources of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen \n     regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     contribute to economic growth in the region.\n       (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced \n     localization requirements, restrictions on investment, and \n     customs barriers, will create opportunities for workers, \n     businesses, farmers, and ranchers in the United States and \n     sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve \n     utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \n     strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate \n     economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade \n     relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.
