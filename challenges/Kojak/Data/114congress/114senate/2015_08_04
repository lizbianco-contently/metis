Mr. President, I recently shared an AP news story with \nmy colleagues, and I think it is worth sharing again.\n  Here is the headline: ``Federal Agencies Are Wide Open to Hackers, \nCyberspies.''\n  I will read just a little bit of what it says.\n\n       The federal government, which holds secrets and sensitive \n     information ranging from nuclear blueprints to the tax \n     returns of hundreds of millions of Americans, has for years \n     failed to take basic steps to protect data from hackers and \n     thieves, records show. In the latest example, the Office of \n     Personnel Management is under fire for allowing its databases \n     to be plundered by suspected Chinese cyberspies in what is \n     being called one of the worst breaches in U.S. history. OPM \n     repeatedly neglected to implement basic cybersecurity \n     protections, its internal watchdog told Congress.\n\n  That story should worry every one of us, Democrats and Republicans \nalike. The AP referred to the massive cyber attack that recently struck \nthe Obama administration as ``one of the worst breaches in U.S. \nhistory.'' But while this massive breach may have been ``one of the \nworst,'' it certainly--unless the administration can be rescued from \nthe cyber security Dark Ages--will not be the last.\n  So the Senate will be considering bipartisan cyber security \nlegislation this week that would help the public and private sectors \ndefeat cyber attacks. The modern tools it contains, through the sharing \nof threat information, would provide for the construction of stronger \ndefenses. The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee says this \nbipartisan bill would also protect ``individual privacy and civil \nliberties.'' She is right. It contains strong measures to limit the \nuse, retention, and diffusion of consumers' personal information. \nInformation sharing with the government would also be voluntary under \nthis bipartisan legislation.\n  No wonder my colleague from California joined virtually every other \nDemocrat and every other Republican to endorse this bipartisan bill \noverwhelmingly in committee 14 to 1. No wonder this bipartisan bill is \nbacked by a diverse coalition of supporters, too--everyone from the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce to farm supply stores, to your local community \nbank.\n  This is a strong bipartisan, transparent bill that has been \nmeticulously vetted by both parties in committee and that has been \navailable online for literally months for anyone to read. My friend the \nDemocratic leader has also publicly declared that the Senate could \nfinish this bill in ``a couple of days.''\n  ``In a couple of days,'' he said, ``at the most.''\n  So with cooperation, we can pass the bipartisan bill this week. There \nwill also be an opportunity for Members of both parties to offer \namendments. I urge colleagues who wish to do so to begin working with \nthe bill managers right now.\n  This legislation is the work of many Members. I mentioned Ranking \nMember Feinstein earlier, who has been a key player on this issue. I \nalso wish to thank Chairman Burr for his strong leadership and his hard \nwork across the aisle in developing this bipartisan bill. I urge the \nSenate to allow us to act and pass it this week.\n  The House of Representatives has already passed two similar White \nHouse-backed cyber security bills. The sooner we pass ours, the sooner \nwe conference with the House to finally get a good cyber security law \non the books, and the sooner our country can be better protected from \nmore of these types of attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6247-6", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6247-S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this September, the Senate will \nformally weigh in on the nuclear deal struck between the White House \nand Iran. We will take a vote and answer a simple but powerful \nquestion: Will the agreement actually make America and its allies \nsafer? When we do, the Senate, as an institution, will be put to the \ntest.\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\n  The first test will come in which answer we arrive at. Some might \ntake the view that releasing billions of dollars to a state sponsor of \nterrorism while leaving the regime with thousands of nuclear \ncentrifuges, an advanced research and development program, and the \nmeans to improve its full-spectrum warfighting capability would \nrepresent an acceptable outcome. Those Senators will vote one way.\n  Others will say that ending Iran's nuclear program is worth the \nnecessary exertion of political leadership--leadership to keep the \ncoalition unified, to reveal Iran's development of ballistic missiles \nand its support of terrorism, and to resolve the IAEA concerns over \nTehran's refusal to allow access to nuclear scientists and facilities--\nbecause doing so would be in the best interests of our country and in \nthe best interests of our allies. Those Senators will vote a different \nway.\n  In answering this fundamental question, every Senator will reveal his \nor her view of America's standing, its leadership, and its capabilities \nin the modern world. They will demonstrate whether they think these \nthings can and should be brought to bear to defend our interests and to \ndefend against Iran's aggressive expansion and its threatening nuclear \nprogram.\n  We know that the next Senate and the next President will continue to \nbe faced with a threat posed by Iran. So we should conduct this debate \nwith our eyes on the future. This is a critical test, but it is not the \nonly one. The other test comes not in which answer we choose but in how \nwe answer the question.\n  Can we join together to conduct a debate worthy of the importance of \nthis agreement?\n  Can we call up the resolution and respectfully debate it without \nemploying delay tactics designed specifically to impede the Senate's \nreview of such a weighty matter?\n  Are Senators willing to focus on a matter of interest to the \ninstitution, defer committee activities, and sit in their chairs to \ntruly listen and debate their colleagues on a matter of such \nsignificance?\n  Nearly every Member of both parties voted to have this debate when \nthey passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. Surely, Senators \nwouldn't then turn around and block a proper debate from even \nproceeding.\n  My hope is that the Senate could reach agreement to call up the \nappropriate resolution, reach agreement to allow ample time for \nSenators to express their views, and then proceed to a thorough, \nthoughtful, and respectful debate, because it is hard to overstate the \nimportance of what we are about to consider: our role in the world, our \ncommitment to our allies, the kind of future we will leave our \nchildren. It is all wrapped up in this issue.\n  The debate we will conduct deserves the appropriate and respectful \ndeliberation that this body was designed to facilitate. Every Senator \nowes as much to this institution, and every Senator owes as much to \nthis country and to the people we serve.\n  We may disagree on the first test, but we should all agree on the \nsecond one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6248-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday President Obama took a very \nimportant step in addressing climate change and promoting clean energy. \nHis Clean Power Plan is the strongest action ever taken by our \ngovernment to fight climate change. The Clean Power Plan would reduce \nthe dangerous amounts of carbon pollution being pumped into the \natmosphere. By reducing pollution, the Clean Power Plan would yield \nsignificant public health benefits for our entire Nation.\n  Carbon pollution has many devastating effects on our environment, as \nwell as the health and well-being of all of us. Sadly, pollution from \nburning fossil fuels disproportionately affects low-income people and \nfamilies of color. Exposure to air pollution can aggravate preexisting \nhealth problems, especially respiratory maladies such as asthma.\n  For millions of Americans, carbon pollution affects their ability to \nbreathe and exacerbates the problems they have with asthma. Consider \nthese facts. Minority and lower income Americans are far more likely to \nlive near coal-fired powerplants. Statistically, that is terribly \naccurate. African Americans are three times more likely to be \nhospitalized from asthma. African-American children have an 80-percent \nhigher rate of asthma and are roughly three times more likely to die \nfrom asthma than their White peers. Roughly half of Latinos live in \nareas that frequently violate clean air rules, and Hispanic children \nare 40 percent more likely to die from asthma than non-Hispanic Whites.\n  In Nevada, just a short distance out of Las Vegas, about 35 miles, \nthere is an Indian reservation. Approximately 30 years ago, NV Energy--\nNevada Power--built this huge coal-fired generator there. Over the more \nthan three decades it has been in existence, tens of millions of tons \nof coal have been burnt in that powerplant. It is a football field away \nfrom the reservation. Those Native Americans have been really sick as a \nresult of that. Now there has been a court settlement that gives them a \nlittle bit of economic strength as a result of this, and, to its \ncredit, NV Energy's new ownership has decided it is going to phase out \nthat plant very quickly. That is good for the health of those Native \nAmericans.\n  Today the plant is being decommissioned and solar is being built on \nthe tribe's reservation. It is wonderful to see that. They have a lot \nof jobs, and it is giving some economic viability, in addition to the \ncourt settlement I just talked about.\n  President Obama put it best yesterday: ``If you care about low-\nincome, minority communities, try protecting the air they breathe.'' \nThat is exactly what the President's plan will do. It will clean the \nair we breathe, help curb health care costs, and improve the quality of \nlife for all Americans. But that is not all.\n  As the plan is implemented, we will see even more investment in clean \nand renewable energy, which is not only good for the planet and our \nhealth, but it is good for the economy. The Clean Power Plan will boost \nrenewable energy by 30 percent over the next 15 years, cutting \npollution but, of course, creating tens of thousands of jobs for all \nAmericans. President Obama's plan encourages programs and incentives to \nmake American homes more efficient and lower consumers' utility bills.\n  Under the Clean Energy Incentive Program, a jump start in new jobs is \nexpected from construction and installation of renewable energy and \nefficiency upgrades. This will incentivize new clean energy development \nand job creation before the new carbon standards even go into effect.\n  It has been disappointing, but not surprising, to see Republicans' \nknee-jerk opposition to addressing climate change. It is all the more \nfrustrating because they have no plan of their own, except to let the \nsmoke keep billowing. Instead, Republicans are clamoring to show \nspecial interests such as the oil baron Koch brothers how far they are \nwilling to go to kill commonsense protections for our air and public \nhealth because it might hurt the bottom line of their coal and energy \nbarons.\n  Last month, House Republicans passed legislation that would rescind \nPresident Obama's action addressing air pollution and climate change. \nSenate Republicans, for their part, are trying the same thing with \npolicy riders in the Senate Interior and Environment appropriations \nbill.\n  Republicans would leave our children and grandchildren to pay the \ndevastating costs of climate change. The Republicans have no solutions. \nThey are afraid to acknowledge that climate change is a problem. It is.\n  President Obama's Clean Power Plan is good for this country. It is \nthe\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\nstrongest action we can take today to ensure a cleaner, healthier \ntomorrow for our children and grandchildren, and it has to be done \nadministratively. We can't get anything done legislatively. It is all \nopposed by the Republicans.\n  It would be good for my State of Nevada, where investment in clean \nenergy is $6 billion. President Obama's plan gives States further \nflexibility to tailor programs for reducing carbon emissions while \nprotecting public health and keeping electricity affordable and \nreliable.\n  Already the plan has wide support in Nevada. An article from the \nAssociated Press yesterday reads:\n\n       Several Nevada government business leaders plan to voice \n     support for a federal campaign to limit carbon pollution from \n     power plants around the nation in an effort to address global \n     climate change. . . . Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval's energy \n     chief, Paul Thomsen, says Nevada is well-positioned to comply \n     with the first national limits on carbon dioxide from \n     existing power plants.\n\n  Nevada understands the benefits clean energy brings to communities \nand the lives that will be improved by cleaning the air we breathe. \nNevada is at the forefront of clean energy in the United States. Over \nthe past decade, our clean energy infrastructure has expanded \nsubstantially, bringing good-paying jobs and new industries to Nevada. \nThere can be no better place for President Obama to begin a dialogue \nwith the Nation about the Clean Power Plan than Nevada.\n  I am looking forward to President Obama's visit to Nevada later this \nmonth to speak at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas on \nAugust 24. This is the 8th annual National Clean Energy Summit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6249-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CYBER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all want to address cyber security. \nRepeatedly, in the last two Congresses, I worked to convene the \nchairmen and ranking members of the relevant committees to move cyber \nsecurity legislation, and we worked hard and came up with a number of \nbills, one of which we brought to the floor and was killed by the \nRepublicans. What was good for our Nation's security was bad for the \ntea party and the Republicans. They blocked the cyber security \nlegislation.\n  In this Congress, we have not been as uncooperative as the \nRepublicans were when they were in the minority. Democrats are willing \nto proceed to the cyber security bill, if we can get assurance that \nDemocrats can offer relevant amendments. It has to be done.\n  For the majority leader to say, as he did here today, that well, on \nthis massive bill we had, I stuck the cyber security bill with a lot of \nother things--he knew it wouldn't work there. It was only to check it \noff his list that he tried to do it. Realistically, we have already \nbeen on this legislation. We should have been on this legislation. The \nRepublican leader could have proceeded to cyber security instead of a \npolitically motivated bill to defund access to health care for women. \nUnlike Republicans, we don't need all the poison pill amendments that \ndeal with different subjects.\n  Democrats have amendments relevant to cyber security, and we must \noffer those. I have received a letter from Senators Wyden, Leahy, \nFranken, Whitehouse, and Coons yesterday that states:\n\n       We understand that the Senate may soon consider the \n     Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. We share the view that \n     increasing the security of U.S. networks while protecting \n     Americans' privacy is an important goal, and while we have \n     different views on this legislation, we are all interested in \n     offering relevant amendments that we believe would improve \n     this bill in various ways.\n       We look forward to working with you to ensure that there is \n     an adequate process for considering a reasonable number of \n     amendments.\n\n  The way Republican Senators used to talk about an open amendment \nprocess, our request to have a few relevant amendments should be \nreadily accepted by the Republicans. But then, looking at how the \nRepublican leader has led the Senate this year, there is plenty of \nreason for Democrats to be concerned.\n  Just look at the bill the Senate just considered last week--a major \nhighway bill with more than 1,000 pages. The Republican leader filled \nthe amendment tree twice, not allowing any amendments to be offered. \nAccordingly, if you look at what the Congressional Research Service \nsays, the Republican leader could potentially fill the amendment tree \nmore times than any other majority leader has done in the first year of \na Congress. So far he has done that more than I ever did.\n  Nevertheless, Democrats will work with Republicans to get on this \nbill and consider a reasonable number of important amendments. I hope \nthe Republicans will cooperate with us.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6249-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while Republicans were campaigning last \nfall, we promised the American people that if they put us in charge, we \nwould get the Senate working again. That wasn't a campaign slogan. That \nwas a commitment.\n  I am proud to report that we are delivering on that promise. The \nfirst 7 months of the 114th Congress have been some of the most \nproductive the Senate has had in a long time. We have passed more than \n70 bills to help strengthen our economy, reform our government, protect \nsome of the most vulnerable, and strengthen our national security.\n  We passed bipartisan legislation to authorize the Keystone Pipeline, \na valuable infrastructure project that would support more than 42,000 \njobs during construction and invest $5.3 billion in the U.S. economy, \nall without spending a dime of taxpayer money.\n  We passed a bipartisan bill to strengthen our efforts to eradicate \nhuman trafficking in this country and to help its victims. This \nlegislation, which passed the Senate with unanimous support from \nDemocrats and Republicans and was signed into law in May, gives law \nenforcement new tools to target traffickers, including increased access \nto wiretaps, and it significantly expands the resources available to \ntrafficking victims as they seek to rebuild their lives.\n\n  As negotiations with Iran over a nuclear agreement were repeatedly \nextended and as reports of significant compromises emerged, Democrats \nand Republicans alike grew concerned that the administration would fail \nto negotiate a deal that would be strong enough to prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon. To address these concerns, the Senate \npassed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This legislation, which \npassed the Senate with overwhelming support from Democrats and \nRepublicans and was signed into law by President Obama, was designed to \nensure that the American people, through their elected representatives, \nwould have a voice in any deal with Iran.\n  Without the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act there would be no \nopportunity for an up-or-down vote on this deal in Congress and no way \nto prevent the President from immediately waiving the sanctions that \nCongress put in place. Congress is currently reviewing the final \nagreement announced by the President, an agreement that has been \ngreeted, I might add, with bipartisan skepticism. We will be holding a \nvote on this deal in September.\n  Increasing access to jobs and expanding opportunities for American \nworkers is a priority of the Republican-led Congress. In May, with the \nsupport of 14 Democrats, the Republican-led Senate passed legislation \nto reauthorize trade promotion authority, which is key to securing \ntrade deals that are favorable to American workers and businesses. \nSince 2009, increasing exports have accounted for more than 1.6 million \nnew jobs in the United States.\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nManufacturing jobs that depend on exports pay an average of 13 to 18 \npercent more than other jobs in the economy. Thanks to the bipartisan \ntrade promotion authority legislation, the administration now has a key \ntool to negotiate trade agreements that will create more good-paying \njobs for American workers and open new markets for products labeled \n``Made in the U.S.A.''\n  After taking up bipartisan legislation to protect our economy, the \nSenate turned to another key Republican priority; that is, supporting \nour military men and women. The National Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich we considered in June, passed the Senate with strong bipartisan \nsupport. In addition to authorizing the funding our military needs to \ndefend our Nation, this bill contains a number of reforms that will \nexpand the resources available to our military men and women and \nstrengthen our national security.\n  Among other things, this legislation targets $10 billion in \nunnecessary spending and redirects those funds to military priorities \nsuch as funding for aircraft and weapons systems and modernization of \nNavy vessels. It implements sweeping reforms to the military's outdated \nacquisitions process by removing bureaucracy and expediting \ndecisionmaking. That will significantly improve the military's ability \nto access the technology and equipment it needs. It replaces the \noutdated military retirement system with a modern system that will \nextend retirement benefits to 75 percent of our servicemembers.\n  During the month of July, the Senate built on its bipartisan \nachievements with two important pieces of legislation: the Every Child \nAchieves Act and the DRIVE Act. The Every Child Achieves Act, which \npassed the Senate by an overwhelming margin, reauthorizes Federal K-12 \neducation programs and revokes problematic Federal mandates such as \nthose that resulted in the phenomenon of overtesting. This legislation \nrestores control of education to those who know students the best, such \nas parents, teachers, and local school boards.\n  The DRIVE Act, which passed the Senate by a strong bipartisan margin, \nis notable because it is the first Transportation bill in almost a \ndecade to provide more than 2 years of funding for our Nation's \ninfrastructure needs. Around the country, hundreds of thousands of \npeople and hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on the funding \ncontained in Transportation bills. When Congress fails to provide the \nnecessary certainty about the way transportation funding will be \nallocated, States and local governments are left without the certainty \nthat they need to authorize projects or make long-term plans for \ntransportation infrastructure. That means that essential construction \nprojects get deferred, necessary repairs may not get made, and jobs \nthat depend on transportation are put in jeopardy. The DRIVE Act will \ngive States and local governments the certainty they need to plan for \nand commit to key infrastructure projects.\n  Every bill I have discussed today passed the Senate with strong \nbipartisan support. One major reason for that is Senate Republicans' \ncommitment to opening up the legislative process here in the Senate. \nUnder Democratic control, the legislative process of the Senate had \nalmost ground to a halt. Instead of being developed in committee, bills \nwere frequently drafted behind closed doors, and not only the minority \nparty but many rank-and-file Democrats were shut out of the process.\n  When Republicans took control of the Senate in January, we changed \nall that. We opened up the committee process and debate on the floor. \nWe made it a priority to ensure that every Senator--every Senator--both \nDemocratic and Republican, has an opportunity to make his or her voice \nheard. During 2014, the Democratic leadership allowed just 15 amendment \nrollcall votes in the entire year--2014. Republicans allowed more than \n15 amendment rollcall votes in our first month. So far this year, we \nhave allowed more than 165 amendment rollcall votes, and we still have \n5 months to go in the year. The Republican-led Senate has accomplished \na lot over the past 7 months. But we know that we have a lot more to \ndo.\n  As the 114th Congress continues, we will continue to fight for the \nAmerican people's priorities. We hope the Democrats here in the Senate \nwill continue to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I like to say, there are only two types \nof companies: those that have been hacked and those that know they have \nbeen hacked. This was recently seen at JPMorgan Chase. Last summer the \ncompany suffered a cyber attack that involved the theft of contact \ninformation for about 76 million households. In the aftermath, JPMorgan \nChase is expected to double its budget for cyber security efforts this \nyear. But the case of JPMorgan is not unique nor a simply cautionary \ntale for other major companies.\n  In the last few months, we have seen one of the largest cyber attacks \non our Nation's technology infrastructure and other major cyber \nbreaches affecting our financial and transportation sector. I share \nthese comments in the context of having worked as an executive for a \ncloud computing company for 12 years prior to serving in the Senate. In \nthe midst of these attacks, we see radical Islamic terrorists \ninfiltrating American social media networks to recruit Americans to \njoin them as jihadists overseas.\n  We must work to address these challenges, and our response must be \nmeasured as well as thoughtful, not only about the immediate threats to \nour cyber infrastructure but also to the long-term effects on our \nnational security and our constitutional freedoms. As we are seeing \nwith the European Union, after years of debate, the EU is currently \nworking on a policy to ensure their citizens are notified of cyber \nbreaches within 72 hours and that victims of these attacks are notified \nwithout undue delay.\n  This is the type of response we need in the United States, much like \nthe notification reforms that I have worked for in Congress. On a near \ndaily basis, we see headlines in our major newspapers that underscore \nthe absolute importance of creating a concrete timeline for \nimplementing timely notification standards.\n  Having spent more than 12 years working on technology, I know \nfirsthand the power that Big Data holds. I also understand the \nimportance of setting standards and clear guidelines. As we always said \nin 28 years of business, if you aim at nothing, you will hit it. It is \nimportant that we not only expect more but that we also inspect. We \nwant to be assured that guidelines are being followed.\n  It is unacceptable that any American is left in the dark when their \npersonally identifiable information or PII may have been breached. That \nis why I have been fighting to strengthen notification requirements and \nensure that the American people know when their personal information is \ncompromised. When I was running customer service operations at RightNow \nTechnologies and looking out for our customers, when we had a problem, \nour policy was that we notified our customers as soon as we were aware \nof the problem. Maybe we did not always understand the magnitude at the \ntime of the problem, but we believed we owed it to our customers to get \nback to them as soon as possible.\n  The customers, the consumers of this country, should be served in a \nsimilar way. But as the Senate prepares to consider cyber security \nreforms, we also need to strike the right balance between protecting \nour cyber security infrastructure and the personal information of \nAmericans, while also protecting the constitutional rights and the \nliberty of the American people. We must protect our Nation's security \nwhile also preserving our civil liberties.\n  We must remain vigilant. We must ensure that we have robust and \ntransparent debate about cyber protection and what reforms must be \nimplemented to protect American civil liberties. We\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\nsee some of these protections in the legislation I cosponsored, \nspearheaded by Senators Mike Lee and Pat Leahy. The Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2015 modernizes our \nNation's electronic privacy laws and brings protections against \nwarrantless searches into harmony with the technological realities of \nthe 21st century.\n  The protections currently on the books may have been robust in 1986 \nwhen the ECPA was written, but they do not adequately defend our \ncitizens against the mass data storage that currently exists. Nobody in \n1986 would have ever envisioned where we are today as to the massive \namount of data that is collected and stored today on the American \npeople. This bill ensures that the Federal Government gives our law \nenforcement officials the tools they need, while ensuring that \nMontanans and the American people are not subjected to invasive and \nunwarranted searches.\n  Privacy and security both matter. I believe we can find a balance \nthat protects both. I urge my colleagues to join me in finding reforms \nthat stop cyber criminals from infiltrating our security networks and \nalso preserve the privacy and the civil liberties that Montanans and \nAmericans hold dear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6251-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE ADMINISTRATION'S CLEAN POWER PLAN AND COAL\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to shift gears for a moment \nand share some comments about President Obama's news that he made \nyesterday with the EPA. Yesterday, President Obama and the ``Employment \nPrevention'' Agency, the EPA, continued to wage their war on American \nenergy, American families, and American jobs. As President Obama was \nannouncing his plan to devastate Montana's coal industry and the good-\npaying jobs it provides, yet another coal company filed for bankruptcy.\n  At the same time, the J.E. Corette powerplant, in my home State of \nMontana in Billings, is being dismantled as we speak in the aftermath \nof President Obama's previous anti-coal regulation. In addition to \nsupporting 30 jobs, the Corette powerplant has powered tens of \nthousands of Montana homes and contributed several million dollars in \ntax revenue to Montana and Yellowstone County every year.\n  Over the past year, Montanans have braced themselves for the release \nof the Obama administration's final regulations, which were already set \nto wreak havoc on our coal industry and make construction of any new \ncoal-fired plant virtually impossible. The proposed rule was bad. The \nfinal rule is even more devastating to Montana jobs and to Montana \nfamilies.\n  The final rule announced by the Obama administration makes the \nretirement of existing coal-fired powerplants inevitable within the \nnext few decades.\n  The rules moved the goalposts and, I might add, to the wrong end of \nthe field. These rules will most likely lead to the shuttering of \nMontana's Colstrip Power Plant and countless others across the Nation. \nIt would be devastating for our economy and hard-working families \nacross the State.\n  Energy rates will increase. Thousands of Montana family-wage jobs \nwould be lost. Critical tax revenue for schools, for our teachers, \nroads, and our infrastructure would evaporate. In the Obama \nadministration's final rule, they took an already bad rule and they \nmade it worse.\n  The so-called Clean Power Plan forces Montana to achieve even more \naggressive standards than originally proposed. According to POLITICO, \nin 2012 Montana produced 2,481 carbon pounds per megawatt hour.\n  Under the President's plan, by 2030, he wants Montana to produce only \n1,305 carbon pounds per megawatt hour. That is a 47.4-percent reduction \nin Montana's carbon emissions because in Montana more than half of our \nelectricity comes from coal. In fact, my mobile device is powered by \ncoal. Coal also powers good-paying jobs for thousands of Montanans, \nincluding Montana tribal members and union workers, and generates \nnearly $120 million in tax revenue every year.\n  America is poised to lead the world's energy needs, but this will be \ndone through American innovation, through American ingenuity, not more \nregulations. The Obama administration's regulations are completely out \nof touch with global realities, and this is why: Global demand for \ncoal-fired energy will not disappear, even if the United States shuts \ndown every last coal mine and coal-fired powerplant.\n  Nations such as China, Korea, and Japan will continue using coal as \nit is reliable and it is affordable. These nations should be powered by \ncleaner Montana coal because the coal we produce in Montana is cleaner \nthan Asian coal.\n  In terms of the environmental picture for the world, we are better \noff using American coal, Montana coal--not coal from Asia. Rather than \ndismissing this reality, the United States should be on the cutting \nedge of technological advances in energy development and leading the \nway in promoting the use of clean, affordable American energy.\n  In fact, according to the International Energy Agency's 2013 data, \nthe world consumes about 6 billion metric tons of steam coal for power \ngeneration. Of that, the United States consumes 750 million metric \ntons.\n  Let's put that into apples-to-apples comparison. That means the \nUnited States consumes about 12 percent of the coal. The rest of the \nworld consumes 88 percent. As the world sees an increased demand for \npower, it is clear we need to be leading the way in clean coal and \nenergy innovation.\n  The United States should be leading. Let's be working toward clean \ncoal, clean energy, and leading the world as our 12 percent could have \nan influence on the other 88 percent.\n  America, we can and we should power the world, but we could only do \nit if the Obama administration steps back from its out-of-touch \nregulations and allows American innovation to thrive once again to not \nonly lead America but to lead the world.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I delivered my 19th ``Waste of \nthe Week'' and we actually reached our goal of $100 billion in savings \nfor the taxpayer by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse. This was money \nspent by the Federal Government, money collected from hard-working \nearners who paid their taxes, sent them to Washington, and expected \nthey would be used for essential purposes, such as providing for our \nnational security, supporting research at NIH for medical advances that \nwould provide lifesaving techniques and medicines to Americans, funding \nthe rebuilding of crumbling bridges and highways, and any number of \nthings the Federal Government is involved in that the American public \nagrees are essential functions that could be performed only by the \nFederal Government.\n  What we want you to do though, they are saying, is be as efficient as \nyou can. If there is excess money wasted on programs that have no place \nin the Federal budget, let's identify those, let's eliminate those, and \neither return our tax money and lower our tax rates or use it for \nsomething more essential.\n  We have reached our goal of $100 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse \nidentified by nonpartisan agencies--not Republican agencies, not \nDemocratic agencies or firms but nonpartisan agencies--that simply look \nat numbers, identify the projects, identify the spending, and ask the \nquestion: Do we truly need to do that?\n  Particularly at a time when the deficit clock keeps ticking, when we \ncontinue year after year after year to spend more than we take in, \ndespite raising taxes, despite looking for ever more sources of income, \nit is clear we need to take the necessary steps not to spend more than \nis absolutely necessary to function on behalf of the American people.\n  So today I am on the floor for speech No. 20. We reached the goal. It \nis just the beginning of August. The Senate has many more weeks in \nfront of it, but we are going to keep going because it is amazing the \namount of waste, fraud, and abuse that has been identified by some of \nthese nonpartisan groups looking at Federal expenditures. If we can add \nto our chart, I think we will have to add an extension to that chart or \ndevise another one--\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\nperhaps put another gauge over here--because we are going to keep doing \nthis every week the Senate is in session.\n  Today, as I said, we are looking at No. 20. I looked at two agencies \nthat exist in the Federal Government: the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, NEH, and the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA. These \ntwo agencies are engaged in cultural projects. Some of these are--\npeople would deem--somewhat essential, but we have looked at two \nagencies that we think ought to be identified today.\n  The public probably will remember the 87th Academy Awards--better \nknown as the Oscars--that took place in Hollywood a few months ago. \nMany Americans tune in and watch this high-profile event featuring \nAmerica's rich and famous. As always, a parade of actors pull up in \ntheir stretch limousines and step into the bright lights of the \nentertainment industry's media--the flashing lights, the march down the \nred carpet, and stop to have their pictures taken. There, in tailored \ntuxes and designer gowns--some of which cost, amazingly, over \n$100,000--everybody is trying to outdo everybody else.\n  The bottom line is Hollywood is not short of money. As Americans \nwatch this, they see the Oscars that are being offered. Then we look at \nthat and say: What in the world is a $25,000 check from the Federal \nGovernment to Hollywood doing in this process?\n  It is hard to understand the concept that Hollywood needs support, \nneeds a handout from the Federal Government, but they are developing an \nAcademy Museum of Motion Pictures in Hollywood. Somehow they have \napplied for a $25,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. \nNow, that is not a major amount compared to our budget problems here \nand the money we deal with, but the American public ought to be saying: \nWhy in the world are we giving a penny to Hollywood to support the \nbuilding of a museum?\n  It is simply because the process is open for anybody to submit for a \ngrant. But who is reviewing these things? Who is looking at this? Does \nHollywood truly need taxpayer money to construct a museum of motion \npictures through the National Endowment for the Arts?\n  We also discovered that the National Endowment for the Humanities got \nengaged in one of these efforts, spending considerably more--$914,000--\nto support a conference entitled ``What is Love? Romance Fiction in the \nDigital Age.'' The conference was full of speakers networking with each \nother and even giving the opportunity for adults to design and color \ntheir own title page.\n  Again, I am asking why. Why, given our $18.5 trillion debt growing \nevery day, do we have to give away a nearly $1 million grant to support \na conference on how in the digital age to develop romantic books?\n  While it might be fun to go deeper into this and examine just exactly \nwhat goes on at this conference, that is not really why I am speaking \non the floor today. I am simply here to ask why. Is this necessary? Is \nthis the kind of thing we need to be supporting and doing with hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars that are sent to Washington, not for these \npurposes?\n  So today, the cumulative runs close to $1 million--$939,000--of \ntaxpayer savings that would go onto our gauge, and we add yet another \nincrement to the gauge in determining how tax dollars are spent.\n  We are going to continue doing this. This is a small one today. You \ncan see we had some major chunks and major dysfunctions in the Federal \nGovernment, but I think it is important for every Senator to be able to \ngo home, talk to their people, and say: We are making every possible \neffort we can to be efficient and effective with the money you sent to \nWashington, and we are looking into every dollar to make sure it is \nspent on essential functions of the Federal Government.\n  It is astounding how much is being sent, used, and wasted, how much \nfraud and waste takes place. We will continue to identify that each \nweek.\n  That is our waste of the week. We will be back each week after our \nAugust recess when the Senate is in session to continue to identify \nways in which we can save the taxpayers' money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor many times to \ntalk about for-profit colleges and universities. This is a problem and \na challenge we face. What you need to know are three numbers to \nunderstand the for-profit college and university industry in America.\n  By way of preface, this is the most heavily subsidized private \nbusiness in the United States of America. What are we talking about? \nThe largest, the University of Phoenix; Kaplan University; DeVry \nUniversity; Rasmussen; Corinthian--you have heard all the names because \nthey advertise constantly, and the money they use to advertise comes \nfrom Federal taxpayers.\n  There are three numbers--and if I were a college professor or law \nschool professor, I would say this is going to be on the final--on for-\nprofit colleges and universities. Ten percent of high school graduates \nattend for-profit colleges and universities--10 percent. Twenty percent \nof all the Federal aid to education goes to for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. Why so much? They charge so much. Their tuition is so \nhigh. Ten percent of the students; 20 percent of the Federal aid to \neducation; 44 percent of all the student loan defaults in America are \nat for-profit colleges and universities. Ten percent of the students, \n44 percent of the defaults. Why? They charge so much that the students \ncan't finish their education or they end up with a worthless diploma. \nThat is the reality.\n  There is a second reality. This industry is in serious economic \ntrouble. Last week we had news of another Federal investigation of a \nfor-profit college. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the University of Phoenix--the largest for-profit college \nand university--revealed it is under investigation by the Federal Trade \nCommission for unfair and deceptive practices.\n  This news comes just weeks after the Center for Investigative \nReporting published a story about the University of Phoenix's thinly \nveiled, dubious marketing and recruiting efforts on military bases--\nexploitation of our men and women in uniform. Over the past several \nyears, the University of Phoenix has spent millions of dollars to \nsponsor events, including dances, parties, and concerts, on military \nbases. Is it because they love our men and women in uniform? No. It is \nbecause they want to sign them up. To the University of Phoenix, these \nsponsorships were simply advertising and marketing events to enroll \nmore men and women in uniform.\n  When you serve our country, we show our appreciation by saying there \nis a GI bill waiting for you at the end of your service--in fact, in \nsome cases, while you are still serving--and for your family, too, so \nthat you will be prepared after you have served our country to have a \ngood life with good education and training and job opportunities.\n  These for-profit colleges and universities can smell an opportunity \nto make even more money. The University of Phoenix is after these men \nand women in uniform. They are after tuition assistance dollars. TA is \na program that provides up to $4,500 a year, so servicemembers can use \nit toward a postsecondary education. And guess what. The money isn't \ncounted in the Federal 90/10 calculation that caps the amount of money \nthese for-profit schools can receive from the Federal Government. Did \nyou hear that? Ninety percent of their revenue comes from the Federal \nGovernment. That is why for-profit colleges and universities are the \nmost heavily subsidized private for-profit businesses in America. To \nfor-profit colleges, the money from servicemembers and veterans is \nunlimited\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nmoney. All they have to do is sign them up. And that is what they are \ndoing with these sponsorships.\n  After the article was published, I wrote to Secretary Ash Carter--\nDepartment of Defense--to ask him to take action. The University of \nPhoenix reportedly is in clear violation of Executive orders limiting \nthe access of these schools to our men and women in uniform. The \nDepartment of Defense has confirmed to me they have opened an inquiry \ninto the matter.\n  During the Senate's reconsideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, I filed an amendment to require the Department to \npost information on Federal and State investigations and lawsuits \nagainst schools on its online education resources for servicemembers.\n  As part of the Tuition Assistance Program, the Department of Defense \nhas created what it calls TA DECIDE. This allows servicemembers to find \ninformation about specific schools when deciding where to use their \ntuition assistance benefits. It includes information such as the \ngraduation and default rates. Do you know why? Because once that \nservicemember has used up that GI bill, it is gone. If they waste it on \none of these for-profit colleges and universities that give them little \nor nothing for their GI bill, they do not get a second chance.\n  Of course, servicemembers need accesses to this information. Publicly \ntraded companies such as the University of Phoenix have to disclose the \ninformation to the SEC when they are under investigation. Members of \nthe military should know that, as well as the general public. It only \nmakes sense.\n  My amendment wasn't taken up during the Senate's debate, but last \nweek 12 Senators joined me in writing Secretary Carter. This \ncommonsense step to ensure better information for servicemembers about \ntheir education options is one the Department of Defense needs to make.\n  I also want to say a word about another for-profit college that is \nnotorious for its exploitation of students--Ashford University. Ashford \nUniversity first came to my attention when former Senator Tom Harkin of \nIowa had an investigation. He took a look at this so-called university \nin his home State of Iowa. Do you know what he found? He found they had \npurchased a small Catholic girls college, purchased their \naccreditation, and then reopened it under the name ``Ashford \nUniversity.'' Do you know how many faculty members there were at \nAshford? One faculty member for every 500 students. It wasn't a real \nuniversity; it was an online scam. They announced last week they are \nclosing down their campus in Iowa. What a heartbreak that must be for \nthe people of Iowa--to lose such a stalwart higher education citizen. \nThat is the reality.\n  I have run into students in Illinois who said they had just graduated \nfrom college.\n  I said: Where did you go?\n  They said: Ashford.\n  And I thought, oh my goodness. What a disappointment. You have wasted \nyour time and your money, you are deep in debt, and that diploma, \nsadly, is worth very little.\n  The tide is turning against the for-profit colleges and universities. \nThe question is whether this Senate, this Congress, this government \nwill step up once and for all and defend those young men and women who \nare wasting their time and money and taxpayer dollars--and in many \ncases GI bill benefits--on these worthless for-profit schools.\n  It is time for us to wake up to this reality. I am glad to see this \nindustry is finally facing its day of reckoning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6253-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6253-S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SCHEDULES THAT WORK ACT\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to talk \nabout something that has been bothering me. Who is this Senate supposed \nto be working for? For years now, this economy has been great for those \nat the top, but for everyone else, it is getting harder and harder to \nmake it from paycheck to paycheck, harder and harder to build any real \nsecurity. The world is changing, and Congress can make decisions that \nhelp working people stay in the game and help level the playing field \nor we can just turn our backs.\n  What have the Republicans done over the past 6 months to try to make \nfamilies a little more secure, to give people a fighting chance? What \nhave they done? They have turned their backs. In the past 6 months, \nthey have burned huge amounts of time as they tried to shut down \nHomeland Security, tried to build a pipeline to help a Canadian oil \ncompany, tried to turn a human trafficking bill into a referendum on \nabortion, and now tried to defund Planned Parenthood--all this instead \nof working on the kinds of issues that would help level the playing \nfield for hard-working people.\n  You know, there is a lot we could do. For example, Democrats have \nbeen fighting to raise the minimum wage. And I strongly agree that no \none--no one--should work full time and still live in poverty. I think a \n$7.25-an-hour minimum wage is disgraceful. I support the Federal bill \nto raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020, and I applaud the fight for \n$15 that is springing up across this country.\n  When I am asked about whether we should raise the minimum wage, I \nhave three answers: Yes. Yes. Yes. But raising the minimum wage is only \nthe beginning. Half of low-wage workers have little or no say over when \nthey work, and an estimated 20 to 30 percent are in jobs where they can \nbe called in to work at the last minute.\n  I want us to think about what this means for someone who is busting \nher fanny trying to build some economic security. Imagine trying to \nplan for anything--for childcare, for going back to school, for getting \na second job--without knowing when you will be working next week. \nImagine trying to plan a monthly budget when your work hours and \npaycheck can fluctuate 70 percent in a single month. Imagine trying to \nschedule a doctor's visit or parent-teacher conference if you could get \nfired just for asking for a few hours off. This is the real world of \nmillions of workers who struggle to make ends meet.\n  This is something we can fix. A few weeks ago, I introduced the \nSchedules That Work Act, with 17 Democrats in the Senate and more than \n60 Democrats in the House of Representatives. The bill is just common \nsense and basic fairness: A single mom should know if her hours are \nbeing canceled before she arranges for daycare and drives halfway \nacross town to show up at work, a young man trying to put himself \nthrough school should be able to request a more predictable schedule \nwithout getting fired just for asking, and a worker who is told to wait \naround on call for hours with no guarantee of work should get something \nfor her time.\n  The Schedules That Work Act does two simple things: First, it gives \nall workers the right to request a change in their schedule without \ngetting fired just for asking, and, second, it gives workers who face \nthe worst scheduling practices--workers in retail, food service, and \ncleaning workers--2 weeks' notice of their work schedules and some \nadditional pay if they are required to wait on call but don't get any \nwork.\n  Now, look, this bill recognizes that there are emergencies, and when \nemployers have unexpected needs they can reschedule their workers, but \nwe are asking for a little basic fairness so that in ordinary times--\nday-by-day, week-by-week--workers will have a stable schedule and a \nchance to build some real economic security.\n  Democrats want to get to work on changes in the law that would give \nworking people a fighting chance. We want Republicans to let us take up \nthese proposals and let us vote on them. Instead, Republicans are \npushing a different agenda, focusing on defunding women's health care \nand protecting those at the top.\n  People say Washington doesn't work, but that is wrong. Washington \nworks great--for the right people. When the corporate lobbyists want a \ncarve-out or giveaway, when a giant oil company wants the Keystone \nPipeline or when Citibank wants to blast a hole in Dodd-Frank, \nRepublicans fall all over themselves to make it happen. When the \nrightwing wants to cut off access to health care, Republicans are ready \nto go, but when it comes to the things that will help families, they \nturn their backs. This has to stop. We are not here to work for the \nlobbyists. We are not here to make life easier for big oil companies or \nfor big banks. We are\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\nhere to make this country work for hard-working Americans. That is our \njob, and it is time for this Republican Senate to start doing that job.\n  Let's take up and pass the Schedules That Work Act. Let's give \nworking families a fighting chance to build a future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6254-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6254-S6256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MARINE CORPS AUDIT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday a very important Government \nAccountability Office report came out. I am going to present my view of \nthat report in a little bit backward way by giving a summary before I \nspeak about the fine points of this report.\n  Broken bookkeeping has plagued the Pentagon for years. Under deadline \npressure, the Marine Corps claimed to be ready for a clean audit. An \noutside auditing firm produced work papers in support of an opinion on \na clean audit that employees in the Defense Department inspector \ngeneral's office found lacking. However, a manager in the inspector \ngeneral's office overruled his lower level colleagues. That resulted in \nthe inspector general's release of a clean opinion on the audit of the \nMarine Corps.\n  Meanwhile, work papers began to creep out of the bureaucracy showing \nthe unsupported basis for such a clean opinion. The inspector general \nwas then forced to withdraw that opinion.\n  Now the Government Accountability Office is releasing a report that \nexposes the whole house of cards. One senior employee with an apparent \nbias toward the outside auditing firm led his agency down the wrong \npath. We need to get things back on track and prevent an embarrassing \nsetback like this from ever happening again.\n  I will go into those details. As I often do, I come to the floor to \nspeak about the latest twist in the 25-year struggle to fix the Defense \nDepartment's broken accounting system. Billions have been spent to fix \nit and achieve audit readiness, but those goals remain elusive. Defense \ndishes out over $500 billion a year. Yet the Department still can't \ntell the people where all the money is going, and now the drive to be \naudit-ready by 2017--that is what the law requires--has taken a bad \nturn and become a fight over the truth.\n  As overseers of the taxpayers' money, we in Congress need to get the \nAudit Readiness Initiative back on track, moving forward in the right \ndirection.\n  I last spoke on this subject a long time ago--December 8, 2011. On \nthat occasion, I commended the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, for \ntrying to get the ball rolling. He wanted to halt endless slippage in \naudit deadlines. He wanted to provide an accurate and regular \naccounting of money spent to comply with the constitutional \nrequirements. He turned up the pressure and in effect drew a line in \nthe sand.\n  He directed the Department to, in his words, ``achieve partial audit \nreadiness,'' with limited statements by 2014, and, in his words, ``full \naudit readiness'' with all-up statements by the statutory deadline of \n2017.\n  Not one of the major DOD components--including the Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, and Air Force--reached Leon Panetta's 2014 milestone. None was \nor is audit ready today.\n  That said, one component--the Marine Corps--stepped up to the plate \nand claimed to be ready for what Leon Panetta's goal was. To test that \nclaim, the accounting firm Grant Thornton was awarded a contract to \naudit five Marine Corps financial statements, 2010 to 2014.\n  The first two, 2010 and 2011, were unsuccessful. The Marine Corps was \nnot ready. The third one was the 2012 audit, which is finally finished.\n  The 2012 audit was put under a microscope and subjected to intense \nreview by the Office of Inspector General along with two other \nindependent watchdogs.\n  The Marine Corps audit was a disaster. First, it took an ugly turn. \nIt got twisted out of shape and turned upside down. Now it is getting \nturned right side up, thanks to the Government Accountability Office.\n  Grant Thornton was required to produce a conclusion memorandum. This \nhappens to be what we might call a quasi-opinion. Work was to be \nfinished by December 2012, but it took an extra year. So right off the \nbat it was running into trouble. The scaled-down financial statement \ndid not meet contract specifications. So this was a showstopper that \ngot glossed over. The contract was modified to accept a makeshift \ncompilation that was cobbled together. It is called a Schedule of \nBudgetary Activity. It covers only current year appropriations and not \nvast sums of prior year appropriations that are still lost in the \nstatutory and money pipeline. Of course, that is a far cry from a \nstandard financial statement.\n  Even reducing the scope of the audit wasn't enough to overcome all of \nthe other problems. The Office of Inspector General audit team was \nresponsible for issuing the final opinion. After completing a review of \nGrant Thornton's workpapers in early 2013, the team determined that the \nevidence presented did not meet audit standards. It concluded that an \nadverse opinion--or what they call a disclaimer--was warranted. The \nteam's rejection of Grant Thornton's conclusions embroiled the opinion \nin controversy and foul play. The trouble began when the Deputy IG for \nAuditing, Mr. Dan Blair, intervened and reportedly overruled his team's \nconclusions. He issued an unqualified or clean opinion that was not \nsupported by the evidence in the workpapers--quite a showboat approach.\n  Despite mounting controversy about the validity of the opinion, \nSecretary of Defense Hagel rolled out that opinion December 20, 2013--\nwith trumpets ``ablast.'' At a ceremony in the Pentagon's Hall of \nHeroes, he gave the Marine Corps an award for being the first military \nservice to earn a clean opinion. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, Gen. John Paxton, accepted the award. According to press \nreports, he did so with ``reluctance. . . . He mumbled something, then \nbolted from the stage at flank speed.'' Why would General Paxton take \noff like a scalded dog? Was it because he sniffed a bad odor with this \nso-called clean report and all the colorful presentations that were \nmade by Secretary Hagel?\n  At that point, the word was already seeping out: The opinion was \nallegedly rigged. I heard rumblings about it and began asking Inspector \nGeneral Rymer questions. Because of all the controversy, we asked his \nindependent audit quality watchdog, Deputy Assistant IG Ashton Coleman, \nto review the audit. Mr. Coleman sent Inspector General Rymer reports \nin October 2014 and May of this year. These reports ripped the figleaf \nclean off of Mr. Blair's charade. They reinforced the audit team's \ndisclaimer. After recommending ``the OIG rescind and reissue the audit \nreport with a disclaimer of opinion,'' Mr. Coleman zeroed right in on \nthe root cause of the problem. That root cause was impaired \nindependence. In other words, the people involved in this charade had \nan agenda that wasn't about good handling of the taxpayers' money, it \nwas protecting somebody.\n  Mr. Coleman concluded that Mr. Blair ``had a potential impairment to \nindependence.'' He and a Grant Thornton partner, Ms. Tracy Porter \nGreene, had a longstanding but undisclosed professional relationship \ngoing back to their service together at the Government Accountability \nOffice in the early 1990s. According to Coleman, that relationship by \nitself did not pose a problem. However, once it began to interfere with \nthe team's ability to make critical decisions, he said it created an \nappearance of undue influence. Coleman identified several actions that \nled him in this direction.\n\n  The appearance problem was framed by a four-page email on August 2, \n2013, from Ms. Greene to Mr. Blair but seen by the team and others, \nincluding me. It was a stern warning. If a disclaimer was coming--and \nMs. Greene knew it was--she wanted, in her words, ``some advanced \nnotice.''\n  She needed time then, as she thought, to prepare the firm's \nleadership for the bad news. A disclaimer, she said, would pose ``a \nrisk to our reputation.'' At the email's end, she opened the door to \nprivate discussions to resolve the matter.\n  The record clearly indicates that both Blair and Greene began holding \nprivate meetings--without inviting Contracting Officer's Representative \nBall and the Office of Inspector General team to participate in those \ndiscussions. Both believed the contracting\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\nofficer's representative and the team were--in the words of Greene and \nBlair--``biased toward a disclaimer rather than considering all the \nfacts.'' I attributed those words to Greene and Blair, but those were \nMr. Blair's words.\n  This shows how the independence of the audit and the review of the \naudit were questionable. To put these actions in perspective, I remind \nmy colleagues that the inspector general was exercising oversight of \nthe company's work. The inspector general needed to keep top company \nofficials like Ms. Greene at arm's length, and holding private meetings \nwith Greene wasn't the way to do it. These meetings may have violated \nthe contract.\n  Why would the top IG audit official prefer to hold private meetings \nwith Ms. Greene? Why would he seem so willing and eager to favor the \nfirm over his team--even when the evidence appeared to support the \nteam's position? Why would he favor the firm over the evidence and over \nthe truth? Why would he admit on the record that ``OIG auditors were \nnot independent of Grant Thornton''? Why would he order the team to \ngive the work papers to the firm so they could be ``updated to reflect \nthe truth''? The firm was not even supposed to have those documents, so \nwe get back to impaired independence again.\n  Coleman cited other indications of this impaired independence. \nContracting Officer's Representative Ball had rejected the firm's 2012 \ndeliverables because they were ``deficient.'' They did not meet quality \nand timeliness standards. The deliverables in question were the \ncompany's final work product, including the all-important quasi-opinion \ncalled a conclusion memorandum.\n  This posed a real dilemma. Until she accepted the 2012 deliverables, \nthe follow-on 2013 contract with Grant Thornton could not be awarded, \nand Blair wanted it done yesterday.\n  The impasse was broken with a crooked bureaucratic maneuver. A senior \nofficial, Assistant Inspector General Loren Venable, provided a \ncertification that there were no major performance problems and Grant \nThornton had met all contract requirements. Just then, with the stroke \nof a pen, that deceptive document cleared the way for accepting the \ndisputed materials, paying the firm all their money, and awarding them \nat the same time a follow-on contract. Yet the record shows that even \nMr. Blair admitted that ``we accepted deficient deliverables.''\n  Why would a senior Office of Inspector General official attempt to \ncover up a major audit failure by Grant Thornton in order to reward the \npoorly performing company with more money and a new contract? For a \nseries of audit failures, the firm got paid $32 million.\n  These actions appear to show how undue influence and bias trumped \nobjectivity and independence. Alleged tampering with the opinion may be \nthe most flagrant example of impaired independence.\n  While the team identified major shortcomings with Grant Thornton's \nwork and disagreed with its conclusions, the team was blocked from \nexercising its authority to issue a disclaimer. So where is the \nindependence? Instead, that team was forced to do additional work in a \nfutile attempt to find evidence to match the firm's conclusion, but \nthere was no such evidence.\n  Two weeks after Ms. Greene's email warning that a disclaimer could \ndestroy the company's reputation, the front office resorted to direct \naction. With the team's disclaimer staring him in the face and with \ncomplete disregard for evidence and standards, Mr. Blair gave the \nOffice of Inspector General team a truly stunning set of instructions. \nThese were as follows: No. 1, the Marine Corps earned a clean opinion; \nNo. 2, Grant Thornton has supported a clean opinion; and No. 3, do what \nit takes to reach the same conclusion as Grant Thornton.\n  In the simplest of terms, this August 14 edict says: There will be a \nclean opinion. Disregard the evidence. Figure out how to do it and make \nit happen.\n  These instructions provoked an internal brawl. The team manager, Ms. \nCecilia Ball, balked. She stated flatout:\n\n       I cannot do that. Our audit evidence does not support an \n     unqualified [clean] opinion. We are at a disclaimer.\n\n  She wanted justification for Mr. Blair's decision to overturn the \nteam's opinion. She asked:\n\n       Show me where my work is substandard and where my \n     conclusions are incorrect. And I want to know what standards \n     Mr. Blair used to reach his conclusions.\n\n  She never got a straight answer. From that point on, it was all \ndownhill. When the team ignored coaxing, they got steamrolled.\n  Mr. Blair attacked their competence, professionalism, and \nindependence. He repeatedly accused them of being ``biased.'' The \nteam's top manager, Ms. Cecilia Ball, reacted to the abusive treatment. \nShe said:\n\n       I don't appreciate the accusations to my professionalism \n     and my team's. I don't think we are the right fit as our \n     integrity is being questioned.\n\n  She later quit the team in disgust.\n  In early December, just as the clean opinion was about to be wheeled \nout, Ms. Ball made one final request for explanation: Why was ``the \nteam's disclaimer of opinion not the correct opinion''? We repeatedly \ndocumented and explained why Grant Thornton's conclusion was \nunsupportable. ``The vast knowledge of the Front Office could have \nprovided us insight as to where the team's logic was flawed.''\n  In this case, the front office was unwilling to consider anything \nother than a clean opinion. These words are from the horse's mouth. The \nclean opinion was handed down from on high. The front office was Mr. \nBlair's domain.\n  All of these actions, when taken together, appear to show a lack of \nindependence and a flagrant disregard for audit ethics, audit \nstandards, audit evidence, and accepted practices.\n  In his oversight role, Blair had a responsibility to be independent, \nobjective, and professionally skeptical. If the firm's work failed to \nmeet standards, as it did, then he had a responsibility to face the \ntruth and tell it like it is. He needed to be a junkyard dog and issue \nthe disclaimer. Maybe he lost sight of his core mission and turned into \na Grant Thornton lapdog. It sure looks that way.\n  Mr. Blair's words, deeds, and prior association with the Grant \nThornton partner, Ms. Greene--when coupled with their many emails that \nwere widely distributed--gave the appearance of undue influence by the \nGrant Thornton partner. The tone and the substance of the Blair-Greene \nemails suggest a professional relationship that was just too cozy--a \nrelationship that might have been wise to disclose according to audit \nstandards and professional ethics.\n  Inspector General Rymer disagrees with Mr. Coleman's findings of \nimpaired independence. However, Mr. Rymer's evidence does not square \nwith evidence presented by Coleman. For these reasons, Senator Johnson \nof Wisconsin and I will be asking the Comptroller General--the guardian \nof government auditing standards--to review all relevant evidence. \nSince independence is a cornerstone of audit integrity, we must be \ncertain it has not been compromised.\n  Now, just yesterday another blockbuster report has been rolled out. \nThe Government Accountability Office has issued a highly critical \nreport. It was prepared at the request of Senator Johnson, Senator \nMcCaskill, and Senator Carper. The Government Accountability Office \nreport is thorough and competent and tells the story as it happened.\n  Over the last 2 years, the GAO team held endless meetings with the \nOffice of Inspector General, including Jon Rymer and Dan Blair. So the \nIG has known for some time what was coming down the pike. They knew \nearly on the GAO report concluded that the evidence in the workpapers \ndid not support the clean opinion of the Marine Corps audit.\n  Echoing Ms. Ball's unanswered pleas, the Government Accountability \nOffice states: The OIG's management's decision to overturn the \ndisclaimer is--in their words--``undocumented, unexplained, and \nunjustified by evidence in the work papers as required by professional \nstandards.''\n  This is the evidentiary gap identified by the Government \nAccountability Office. There is no legitimate explanation for how the \nauditors got from point A--the disclaimer--to point B--the clean \nopinion. There is no crosswalk between the two poles. It is a bridge \ntoo far.\n  Despite mounting questions about the opinion, the IG turned a blind \neye\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\nto Blair's charade. The IG allowed it to go on and on. Countless man-\nhours and millions of dollars were wasted on cooking the books and on \nvicious in-fighting instead of productive problem-solving to right the \nship. Mr. Coleman and the GAO got that done.\n  On March 23, the day before the IG's final exit briefing with the \nGAO, came a bolt from the blue. The IG stepped forward with a brave, \nbold announcement. The clean opinion was formally withdrawn. It was \nlike a rush of fresh air in a very stuffy room. The inescapable truth \nfinally dawned on Inspector General Rymer. So I want to thank Mr. Rymer \nfor having the courage to do the right thing.\n\n  An audit failure of this magnitude should have consequences. This one \nis especially egregious. It leaves at least one former Secretary of \nDefense with egg on his face. Mr. Blair was removed as head of the \nAudit Office on June 10 but is still serving as the Office of Inspector \nGeneral's Deputy Chief of Staff. He is the chief architect of the now \ndiscredited clean opinion. He is the one who planted the seeds of \ndestruction when he allegedly quashed the audit team's disclaimer. Of \ncourse, those responsible for what happened ought to be held \naccountable.\n  Mr. Blair wants us to believe that the muffed opinion was the result \nof a routine dispute between opposing auditors' judgments over \nevidence, a mere difference of opinion among auditors. True, it \nreflects an unresolved dispute between the audit team and the \nmanagement, and yes, that happened; however, there is a right way and a \nwrong way to resolve the conflicts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete \nthis. I was told I would be given the time to do it, and I have about 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwon't object, I want to make certain that after Senator Grassley has \ncompleted his remarks, I will have time to make my remarks for up to 15 \nminutes. It will probably be less than that.\n  Is that all right, Senator?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Those responsible for what happened ought to be held \naccountable.\n  Mr. Blair wants us to believe the muffed opinion was the result of a \nroutine dispute between opposing auditors' judgments over evidence and \na mere difference of opinion among auditors. True, it reflects an \nunresolved dispute between the audit team and management, and yes, that \nhappened; however, there is a right way and a wrong way to resolve such \nconflicts. According to audit standards cited in the GAO report, the \ndispute should have been addressed, resolved, and documented in \nworkpapers before the report was issued. It was not because the two \nopinions were irreconcilable.\n  The team's disclaimer was based on evidence measured against \nstandards documented in workpapers. Blair's so-called ``professional \npreference,'' by comparison, is none of these things. As the GAO's \nevidence gap suggests, Mr. Blair's opinion was hooked up to nothing. It \nwas unsupported, and it was improper. So plain old common sense should \nhave caused senior managers to realize that issuing the report with the \nopinion hanging fire was a senseless blunder. Doing it had one \ninevitable result: The opinion had no credibility, and that opinion had \nto go.\n  True, the integrity of the Office of Inspector General audit process \nmay be damaged, but the final outcome of this tangled mess may help \nclear the way for recovery. That recovery ought to lead us to being \nable to have clean audits not only of the Marine Corps but all of the \nfour services. The Marine Corps audit was the first big one out the \nbox. If Inspector General Rymer had not embraced the truth, we might be \nstaring at a bunch of worthless opinions awarded to the Army, Navy, and \nAir Force. The Department of Defense could have declared victory and \nburied the broken bookkeeping system for another 100 years.\n  Hopefully, the Defense Department will begin anew with fresh respect \nfor the truth, audit standards, and the need for reliable transaction \ndata. Reliable transaction data is the lifeblood of credible financial \nstatements. Unreliable transaction data doomed the Marine Corps audit \nto failure from the get-go. Without reliable transaction data, the \nprobability of conducting a successful audit of a major component is \nnear zero.\n  With the right leadership and guidance, a plan with achievable \ndeadlines can and should be developed. In the meantime, we watchdogs--\nand that is all of us in the Congress of the United States, or at least \nit ought to be all of us--must remain vigilant. My gut tells me we are \nstill not out of the woods.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6256-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, on November 19, 1863, standing on the \nbloodstained battlefield of Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln delivered one \nof the most significant and best remembered speeches in American \nhistory. At the conclusion of the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln stated \n``that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in \nvain . . . that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of \nfreedom . . . and that government of the people, by the people, for the \npeople, shall not perish from the earth.''\n  In the year 2015, with a political campaign finance system that is \ncorrupt and increasingly controlled by billionaires and special \ninterests, I fear very much that, in fact, government of the people, by \nthe people, and for the people is perishing in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Five years ago, in the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court \ndecision, by a 5-to-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court said to the \nwealthiest people in this country: Billionaires, you already own much \nof the American economy. Now we are going to give you the opportunity \nto purchase the U.S. Government, the White House, the U.S. Senate, the \nU.S. House, Governors' seats, legislatures, and State judicial branches \nas well. In essence, that is exactly what they said, and, in fact, that \nis exactly what is happening as we speak.\n  As a result of Citizens United, during this campaign cycle, billions \nof dollars from the wealthiest people in this country will flood the \npolitical process. Super PACs--a direct outgrowth of the Citizens \nUnited decision--enabled the wealthiest people and the largest \ncorporations to contribute unlimited amounts of money to campaigns. \nAccording to recent FEC filings, super PACs have raised more than $300 \nmillion for the 2016 Presidential election already, and this election \ncycle has barely begun. This $300 million is more than 11 times what \nwas raised at this point in the 2000 election cycle. What will the \nsituation be 4 years from now? What will the situation be 8 years from \nnow? How many billions and billions of dollars from the wealthy and \npowerful will be used to elect candidates who represent the rich and \nthe superrich?\n  According to the Sunlight Foundation, more than $2 out of every $3 \nraised for Presidential candidates so far is going to super PACs and \nnot to the candidate's own campaign. This is quite extraordinary. What \nthis means is that super PACs, which theoretically operate \nindependently of the actual candidate, have more money and more \ninfluence over the candidate's campaign than the candidate himself or \nherself. Let me repeat that. The millionaires and billionaires who \ncontrol\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\nthe super PACs have more money and more influence over a candidate's \ncampaign than the candidate himself or herself. In other words, the \ncandidate becomes a surrogate, a representative for powerful special \ninterests and is not even in control of his or her own campaign.\n  Mr. President, 35 individuals or companies have already donated more \nthan $1 million to super PACs so far. According to the Associated \nPress, almost 60 donors have accounted for nearly one-third of all of \nthe money donated so far in the Presidential race, including donations \nto the campaigns themselves. Donors giving at least $100,000 account \nfor close to half of all funds raised. Let's be clear. This is all \ntaking place at the early stages of the campaign. We have a long way to \ngo.\n  We know, for example, that the Koch brothers, worth some $85 \nbillion--the second wealthiest family in America--have made public that \nthey intend to spend some $900 million on this election. This is more \nmoney than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party will \nspend. One family will be spending more money than either the \nDemocratic Party or the Republican Party. How do we describe a process \nin which one multibillion-dollar family spends more money on a campaign \nthan either of the two major political parties? Well, I define that \nprocess not as democracy but as oligarchy.\n  Let's be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about. We are \ntalking about a rapid movement in this country toward a political \nsystem in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests \nwill determine who gets elected or who does not get elected. That is \nnot, to say the least, what this country is supposed to be about. That \nwas not, to say the least, the vision of Abraham Lincoln when he talked \nabout a nation in which we had a government of the people, by the \npeople, for the people. That is not what Lincoln's vision was about.\n  This is not just Bernie Sanders expressing a concern. Last week, this \nis what former President Jimmy Carter had to say about the current \ncampaign finance system on the Thom Hartmann radio show. President \nCarter stated that unlimited money in politics ``violates the essence \nof what made America a great country in its political system.

Both Democrats and Republicans, Carter said, \n     ``look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to \n     themselves.''\n       Carter was responding to a question from Hartmann about \n     recent Supreme Court decisions on campaign financing like \n     Citizens United.\n\n\n                               Transcript\n\n       HARTMANN: Our Supreme Court has now said, ``unlimited money \n     in politics.'' It seems like a violation of principles of \n     democracy. . . . Your thoughts on that?\n       CARTER: It violates the essence of what made America a \n     great country in its political system. Now it's just an \n     oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence \n     of getting the nominations for president or to elect the \n     president. And the same thing applies to governors and U.S. \n     Senators and congress members. So now we've just seen a \n     complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to \n     major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get \n     favors for themselves after the election's over. . . . The \n     incumbents, Democrats and Republicans, look upon this \n     unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves. Somebody \n     who's already in Congress has a lot more to sell to an avid \n     contributor than somebody who's just a challenger.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the need for real campaign finance reform \nis not a progressive issue. It is not a conservative issue. It is an \nAmerican issue. It is an issue that should concern all Americans, \nregardless of their political point of view, who wish to preserve the \nessence of the longest standing democracy in the world, a government \nwhich represents all of the people and not a handful of powerful and \nwealthy special interests.\n  The need for real campaign finance reform must happen and it must \nhappen as soon as possible. That is why clearly we must overturn, \nthrough a constitutional amendment, the disastrous Citizens United \nSupreme Court decision as well as the Buckley v. Vallejo decision. That \nis why we need to pass disclosure legislation which will identify all \nthose wealthy individuals who make large campaign contributions. More \nimportantly, it is why we need to move toward public funding of \nelections.\n  Our vision for American democracy, our vision for the United States \nof America, should be a nation in which all people, regardless of their \nincome, can participate in the political process, can run for office \nwithout begging for contributions from the wealthy and the powerful. \nEvery Member of the Senate and every Member of the House knows how much \ntime candidates spend on the telephone dialing for dollars--\nRepublicans, Democrats, everybody. This is not what democracy should be \nabout.\n  Our vision for the future of this country should be one in which \ncandidates are not telling billionaires at special forums what they can \ndo for them. Our vision for democracy should be one in which candidates \nare speaking to the vast majority of our people--working people, the \nmiddle class, low-income people, the elderly, the children, the sick, \nand the poor--and discussing with them their ideas as to how we can \nimprove lives for all people in this country.\n  Let us be frank. Let us be honest. The current political campaign \nfinance system is corrupt and amounts to legalized bribery. How can we \nin the United States tell developing countries how they can go forward \nin developing their democracies when our system is corrupt? Our vision \nfor the future of this country should be a vision which is inclusive, \nwhich tells young people that if you are conservative, if you are \nprogressive, if you are interested in public service, you can run for \noffice without begging the rich and the powerful for campaign \ncontributions.\n  When Congress returns after the August break, I will be introducing \nstrong legislation which calls for public funding of elections, which \nwill enable any candidate, regardless of his or her political views, to \nrun for office without being beholden to the rich and the powerful. I \nhope very much the Republican leadership in the Senate will allow this \nlegislation to get to the floor, I hope we can have a serious debate \nabout it, and I hope very much we can go forward to restoring American \ndemocracy to a situation in which every citizen of this country has the \nright to vote and has equal power in determining the future of our \ngreat Nation.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of \nthe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. I had hoped Senator Burr, \nthe chairman of the committee, would be able to deliver the remarks \ninitially. However, he has been unfortunately delayed, and so I will go \nahead with my remarks as vice chairman of the committee.\n  There is no legislative or administrative step we can take that will \nend all cyber crime and cyber warfare, but as members of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, we have heard over the course of several years \nnow that improving the exchange of information and the sharing of that \ninformation, company to company and company to the government, can be \nvery helpful and yield a real and significant improvement to cyber \nsecurity.\n  Regrettably, this is the third attempt to pass a cyber security \ninformation sharing bill. In the almost 5 years that I have been \nworking on this issue, two things have become abundantly clear about \npassing the bill. First, it must be bipartisan. In 2012, I cosponsored \nthe Lieberman-Collins Cybersecurity Act, which included a title on\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\ninformation sharing based on a bill I had introduced. It was an \nimportant piece of legislation, but it received almost no Republican \nsupport and could not gain the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture. It \nbecame clear to me then that no cyber security legislation could pass \nwithout broad bipartisan support.\n  The second lesson that has been learned is, it must be narrowly \nfocused. The Lieberman-Collins bill sought to address many critical \nchallenges to our Nation's cyber security. Then-Majority Leader Harry \nReid, brought the chairmen of all committees of jurisdiction on our \nside together and asked them to draft legislation on cyber security in \ntheir areas. It soon became clear that addressing so many complex \nissues makes a bill very difficult to pass. That bill died on the \nSenate floor in late 2012.\n  Based on these lessons, we have tried to take a bipartisan and \nfocused approach so Congress can pass a cyber security information \nsharing bill. In the last Congress, in 2013 and 2014, then-vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee Saxby Chambliss and I sought to \ndraft legislation on information sharing that would attract bipartisan \nsupport. We worked through a number of difficult issues together, and \nwe were able to produce a bill that I believed would pass the Senate. \nThe Intelligence Committee approved the bill in 2014 by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 12 to 3, but it never reached the Senate floor due \nto privacy concerns about the legislation.\n  This year, Chairman Burr and I have drafted legislation that both \nsides can and should support. This bill is bipartisan, it is narrowly \nfocused, and it puts in place a number of privacy protections, many of \nwhich I will outline shortly. The bill's bipartisan vote of 14 to 1 in \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee in March underscores this fact.\n  I would like to thank Senator Burr for his leadership and his \nwillingness to negotiate a bipartisan bill that can and should receive \na strong vote. As he often says, neither one of us would have written \nthis bill this way if we were doing it ourselves. This Senator believes \nit is also true that by negotiating this draft, we will get \nsubstantially more votes than either of us can get on our own. I very \nmuch hope that is true.\n  I note that this bill has strong support from the private sector \nbecause it creates incentives for improving cyber security and protects \ncompanies that take responsible steps to do so. Companies are shielded \nfrom lawsuits if they properly use the authorities provided for in this \nbill. They can be confident that sharing information with other \ncompanies or with the government will not subject them to inappropriate \nregulatory action.\n  For these reasons, this bill has the support of over 40 business \ngroups, and it is the first bill that has the support of the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce. It also has the support of the most important \ncyber security and critical infrastructure companies in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent to have those \nletters printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   August 3, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: On \n     behalf of our diverse members, we write today in strong \n     support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (S. \n     754), a bipartisan bill approved earlier this year on a near-\n     unanimous basis by the Select Committee on Intelligence. We \n     strongly urge you to bring up S. 754 as expeditiously as \n     possible, defeat any amendments that would undermine this \n     important legislation, and support the underlying bill.\n       The threat of cyber-attacks is a real and omnipresent \n     danger to our sector, our members' customers and clients, and \n     to critical infrastructure providers upon which we--and the \n     nation as a whole--rely. S. 754 would enhance our ability to \n     defend the financial services sector and the sensitive data \n     of hundreds of millions of Americans. It is critical that \n     Congress get cybersecurity information sharing legislation to \n     the President's desk before the next crisis, not after.\n       Our members and the broader financial services industry are \n     dedicated to improving our capacity to protect customers and \n     their sensitive information but as it stands today, our laws \n     do not do enough to foster information sharing and establish \n     clear lines of communication with the various government \n     agencies responsible for cybersecurity. If adopted and signed \n     into law, this legislation will strengthen the nation's \n     ability to defend against cyber-attacks and better protect \n     all Americans by encouraging the business community and the \n     government to quickly and effectively share critical \n     information about these threats while ensuring privacy. More \n     effective information sharing provides some of the strongest \n     protections of privacy, as it is sensitive information from \n     our member firms' customers that we are asking Congress to \n     protect from those who attempt to steal or destroy that \n     information.\n       Each of our organizations and our respective member firms \n     has made cybersecurity a top priority and we are committed to \n     continuing to work with you and your colleagues in the Senate \n     so that effective cyber threat information sharing \n     legislation can be enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Bankers Association; American Insurance \n           Association; The Clearing House; Financial Services \n           Institute; Financial Services Roundtable; Investment \n           Company Institute; NACHA--The Electronic Payments \n           Association; The National Association of Mutual \n           Insurance Companies; Property Casualty Insurers \n           Association of America; Securities Industry and \n           Financial Markets Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 3, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: \n     The undersigned organizations reiterate their support for \n     cybersecurity information sharing and liability protection \n     legislation and urge the Senate to promptly take up and pass \n     S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of \n     2015. Enactment of such legislation is urgently needed to \n     further enhance and encourage communication among the federal \n     government, the North American electric power sector, and \n     other critical infrastructure sectors, thus improving our \n     ability to defend against cyber attacks.\n       While the electric sector already engages in significant \n     information sharing activities and has in place mandatory and \n     enforceable reliability and cybersecurity standards, there \n     remains an urgent need for the government and industry to \n     better share actionable security information in a timely and \n     confidential manner, including protections against public \n     disclosure of sensitive security information. CISA provides a \n     framework to help foster even more meaningful information \n     sharing while maintaining a critical balance between \n     liability and privacy protections.\n       The electric power sector takes very seriously its \n     responsibility to maintain the reliability, safety, and \n     security of the electric grid. Beyond mandatory standards, \n     the industry maintains an all-hazards ``defense in depth'' \n     mitigation strategy that combines preparation, prevention, \n     resiliency, and response and recovery efforts. We also work \n     closely with the federal government and other critical \n     infrastructure sectors on which the electric sector depends \n     through the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, and \n     share electric sector threat information through the \n     Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center. \n     Passage of CISA will enhance these activities.\n         American Public Power Association (APPA); Canadian \n           Electric Association (CEA); Edison Electric Institute \n           (EEI); Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA); \n           GridWise Alliance; Large Public Power Council (LPPC); \n           National Rural Electric Cooperative Association \n           (NRECA); National Association of Regulatory Utility \n           Commissioners (NARUC); Transmission Access Policy Study \n           Group (TAPS).\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Bankers Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2015.\n     Hon.

Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing on behalf of the members of the \n     American Bankers Association (ABA) to urge you to support the \n     Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA, S. 754) when it \n     is brought to the Senate floor, and to defeat any amendments \n     that would undermine this critically needed legislation.\n       CISA is bipartisan legislation introduced by Chairman \n     Richard Burr and Vice Chairman Dianne Feinstein, and reported \n     by a strong bipartisan 14-1 vote in the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee. It will enhance ongoing efforts by the private \n     sector and the Federal government to better protect our \n     critical infrastructure and protect Americans from all walks \n     of life from cyber criminals. Importantly, CISA facilitates \n     increased cyber intelligence information sharing between the \n     private and public sectors, and strikes the appropriate \n     balance between protecting consumer privacy and allowing \n     information sharing on serious threats to our nation's \n     critical infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\n       Cybersecurity is a top priority for the financial services \n     industry. Banks invest hundreds of millions of dollars every \n     year to put in place multiple layers of security to protect \n     sensitive data. Protecting customers has always been and will \n     remain our top priority and CISA will help us work more \n     effectively with the Federal government and other sectors of \n     the economy to better protect them from cyber attacks.\n       We urge you to support this important legislation and pass \n     it as soon as possible to better protect America's \n     cybersecurity infrastructure against current and future \n     threats.\n           Sincerely,\n     James C.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid: \n     On behalf of the members of the Information Technology \n     Industry Council (ITI), I write to express our support for S. \n     754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 \n     (CISA), and urge you to bring it to the Senate floor for \n     debate and vote. Given the importance of cybersecurity threat \n     information sharing to the high-tech industry, we will \n     consider scoring votes in support of CISA in our 114th \n     Congressional Voting Guide.\n       ITI members contribute to making the U.S. information and \n     communication technology (ICT) industry the strongest in the \n     world in innovative cybersecurity practices and solutions. We \n     firmly believe that passing legislation to help increase \n     voluntary cybersecurity threat information sharing between \n     the private sector and the federal government, and within the \n     private sector, is an important step Congress can take to \n     enable all stakeholders to address threats, stem losses, and \n     shield their systems, partners and customers. It is important \n     that the Senate act now to pass CISA and continue to move the \n     legislative process forward, so that Congress can reconcile \n     CISA with the House cybersecurity legislation, H.R. 1560, the \n     Protecting Cyber Networks Act, and H.R. 1731, the National \n     Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015, and send a \n     bill to the president.\n       ITI believes that legislation to promote greater \n     cybersecurity threat information sharing should:\n       Affirm that cybersecurity threat information sharing be \n     voluntary;\n       Promote multidirectional cybersecurity threat information \n     sharing, allowing private-to-private, private-to-government \n     and government-to-private sharing relationships;\n       Include targeted liability protections;\n       Utilize a civilian agency interface for private-to-\n     government information sharing to which new liability \n     protections attach;\n       Promote technology-neutral mechanisms that enable \n     cybersecurity threat information to be shared in as close to \n     real-time as possible;\n       Require all entities to take reasonable steps to remove \n     personally identifiable information from information shared \n     through data minimization; and\n       Ensure private sector use of information received through \n     private-to-private sharing is only for cybersecurity \n     purposes, and government use of information received from the \n     private sector is limited to cybersecurity purposes and used \n     by law enforcement only:\n       For the investigation and prosecution of cyber crimes;\n       For the protection of individuals from the danger of death \n     or serious bodily harm and the investigation and prosecution \n     of crimes involving such danger; and\n       For the protection of minors from child pornography.\n       We appreciate the progress made by the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee to include provisions that would protect personally \n     identifiable information while also allowing for a \n     cybersecurity threat information sharing framework that will \n     enhance our ability to protect and defend our networks.\n       We look forward to working closely with you, your committee \n     leadership, and the House of Representatives to further \n     address outstanding issues in conference to ensure it adheres \n     to our above cybersecurity threat information sharing \n     principles. ITI remains committed to refining the legislation \n     and supporting a final product that can best achieve our goal \n     of promoting greater cybersecurity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dean C.

Enactment \n     of bipartisan legislation that enhances voluntary cyber \n     threat information sharing while ensuring privacy protection \n     will be an important step in bolstering our nation's \n     cybersecurity capabilities.\n       Our members are on the front lines defending against cyber \n     attacks. Every day, bad actors are attacking networks to \n     extract valuable private and commercial information. We \n     believe it is now more important than ever to enact \n     legislation to break down the legal barriers that currently \n     discourage cyber threat information sharing between and among \n     the public and private sectors. Increased awareness will \n     enhance the ability of businesses, consumers, and critical \n     infrastructure to better defend themselves against attacks \n     and intrusions. We are confident that all of these goals can \n     be accomplished without comprising the privacy of an \n     individual's information.\n       I appreciate your leadership on moving this important \n     legislation forward to a successful outcome in the Senate. We \n     support this bipartisan effort and look forward to working \n     with you in the process to ultimately move a cyber threat \n     information sharing bill to the President's desk for \n     signature.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Victoria A. Espinel,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Protecting America's\n\n\n                                     Cyber Networks Coalition,\n\n                                                    July 21, 2015.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The Protecting \n     America's Cyber Networks Coalition (the coalition) urges the \n     Senate to take up and pass S. 754, the Cybersecurity \n     Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. Passing cybersecurity \n     information-sharing legislation is a top policy priority of \n     the coalition, which is a partnership of leading business \n     associations representing nearly every sector of the U.S. \n     economy.\n       In March, the Select Committee on Intelligence passed CISA \n     by a strong bipartisan vote (14-1). The Senate can build on \n     the momentum generated in the House to move CISA forward. In \n     April, the House passed two cybersecurity information-sharing \n     bills--H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), \n     and H.R. 1731, the National Cybersecurity Protection \n     Advancement Act (NCPAA) of 2015--with robust majorities from \n     both parties and broad industry support.\n       Our organizations believe that Congress needs to send a \n     bill to the president that gives businesses legal certainty \n     that they have safe harbor against frivolous lawsuits when \n     voluntarily sharing and receiving threat indicators and \n     defensive measures in real time and taking actions to \n     mitigate cyberattacks.\n       The legislation also needs to offer protections related to \n     public disclosure, regulatory, and antitrust matters in order \n     to increase the timely exchange of information among public \n     and private entities. Coalition members also believe that \n     legislation needs to safeguard privacy and civil liberties \n     and establish appropriate roles for government agencies and \n     departments. CISA reflects sound compromises among many \n     stakeholders on these issues.\n       Recent cyber incidents underscore the need for legislation \n     to help businesses improve their awareness of cyber threats \n     and to enhance their protection and response capabilities in \n     collaboration with government entities. Cyberattacks aimed at \n     U.S. businesses and government bodies are increasingly being \n     launched from sophisticated hackers, organized crime, and \n     state-sponsored groups. These attacks are advancing in scope \n     and complexity.\n       The coalition is committed to working with lawmakers and \n     their staff members to get cybersecurity information-sharing \n     legislation quickly enacted to strengthen our national \n     security and the protection and resilience of U.S. industry. \n     Congressional action cannot come soon enough.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA); Airlines for \n           America (A4A); Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers; \n           American Bankers Association (ABA); American Cable \n           Association (ACA); American Council of Life Insurers \n           (ACLI); American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers \n           (AFPM); American Gaming Association; American Gas \n           Association (AGA); American Insurance Association \n           (AIA); American Petroleum Institute (API); American \n           Public Power Association (APPA); American Water Works \n           Association (AWWA); ASIS International; Association of \n           American Railroads (AAR); BITS--Financial Services \n           Roundtable; College of Healthcare Information \n           Management Executives (CHIME); CompTIA--The Computing \n           Technology Industry Association; CTIA--The Wireless \n           Association; Edison Electric Institute (EEI); \n           Federation of American Hospitals (FAH); Food Marketing \n           Institute (FMI).\n         GridWise Alliance; HIMSS--Healthcare Information and \n           Management Systems Society; HITRUST--Health Information \n           Trust Alliance; Large Public Power Council (LPPC); \n           National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD); \n           National Association of Manufacturers (NAM); National \n           Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC); \n           National Association of Water Companies (NAWC); \n           National Business Coalition on e-Commerce & Privacy; \n           National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA); \n           National Rural Electric Cooperative Association \n           (NRECA).\n         NTCA--The Rural Broadband Association; Property Casualty \n           Insurers Association of America (PCI); The Real Estate \n           Roundtable; Securities Industry and Financial Markets \n           Association (SIFMA); Society of Chemical Manufacturers \n           & Affiliates (SOCMA); Telecommunications Industry \n           Association (TIA); Transmission Access Policy Study \n           Group (TAPS); United States Telecom Association \n           (USTelecom);\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\n            U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Utilities Telecom Council \n           (UTC).\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Chamber of Commerce of\n\n\n                                 the United States of America,\n\n                                                February 14, 2015.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: As the Senate \n     prepares to consider S. 754, the ``Cybersecurity Information \n     Sharing Act of 2015,'' the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \n     world's largest business federation representing the \n     interests of more than three million businesses of all sizes, \n     sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and \n     industry associations, and dedicated to promoting, \n     protecting, and defending America's free enterprise system, \n     writes to express our strong opposition to the adoption of \n     amendments that would weaken or overly complicate this \n     important bipartisan bill, including issues related to data \n     security, breach notification, or commercial privacy, which \n     are best addressed in other contexts.\n       The Chamber believes that all provisions of S. 754 must \n     support the important goal of protecting critical \n     infrastructure. Unrelated issues, such as data security, \n     breach notification, and commercial privacy legislation, have \n     not yet received any consideration in the committees of \n     jurisdiction and are not ready for consideration by the full \n     Senate. These sensitive topics should proceed through the \n     legislative process following regular order to ensure \n     complete and deliberate consideration separate from the \n     pending floor debate on cybersecurity information sharing \n     legislation.\n       Cybersecurity information sharing legislation meets a dire \n     national security need, and though the Chamber would like to \n     see meaningful data security, breach notification, and \n     commercial privacy legislation become law, for the benefit of \n     businesses and consumers alike, we are equally steadfast in \n     our belief that cybersecurity information sharing legislation \n     is important for national security and should be Congress's \n     immediate priority.\n       There are 47 separate state laws which deal directly with \n     data security and breach notification. The business community \n     has been working with members of Congress in both chambers \n     and on both sides of the aisle to find the right path toward \n     passage of a national data security and breach notification \n     law. However, much work remains to be done, as disagreement \n     continues regarding certain provisions which would be \n     contained in federal legislation. This disagreement is \n     evident in virtually every one of the significantly different \n     data security bills which have been introduced in the Senate \n     during the last several Congresses.\n       The Chamber has appreciated the opportunity to comment on \n     and offer edits to the various bills and looks forward to \n     working with their authors and cosponsors as legislation \n     works its way through the committee process. However, data \n     security legislation deserves its own due consideration and \n     deliberate debate, separate from the complicated and pressing \n     national security issue of cybersecurity information sharing. \n     For example, the House Energy and Commerce committee has held \n     multiple hearings on proposed legislation in addition to a \n     subcommittee markup and planned mark up at the full committee \n     level. Though there are issues which need to be resolved in \n     that legislation, the Chamber appreciates the process and \n     consideration given and that the bill has worked its way \n     through the proper channels.\n       Given the work that still needs to be done on data security \n     proposals, the Chamber urges you to keep them separate and \n     apart from cybersecurity information sharing legislation and \n     not rush to make changes to the current landscape of state \n     data security, data breach, and commercial privacy laws. \n     Doing so would have a fundamentally negative impact on a \n     broad segment of the American business community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. At the same time, the bill includes numerous privacy \nprotections beyond those contained in last year's bill. Senator Burr \nand I worked together to address the specific concerns raised by the \nadministration, some of our Senate colleagues, and other key \nstakeholders. Because of these changes, the administration said \nyesterday that ``cyber security is an important national security issue \nand the Senate should take up this bill as soon as possible and pass \nit.''\n  I believe this is a good bill and will allow companies and the \ngovernment to improve the security of their computer networks, but this \nis just a first-step bill. It will not bring an end to successful cyber \nattacks or thefts, but it will help to address the problem.\n  What does this bill do? It provides clear direction for the \ngovernment to share cyber threat information and defensive measures \nwith the private sector.\n  Two, it authorizes private companies to monitor their computer \nnetworks and to share cyber threat information and defensive measures \nwith other companies and with the Federal, State, local, and tribal \ngovernment.\n  And three, it creates a process and rules to limit how the Federal \nGovernment will and will not use the information it receives.\n  Companies are granted liability protection for the appropriate \nmonitoring for cyber threats and for sharing and receiving cyber threat \ninformation. This liability protection exists for both company-to-\ncompany sharing as well as company-to-government sharing consistent \nwith the bill's terms. Companies are also authorized to use defensive \nmeasures on their own networks for cyber security purposes.\n  Since the bill is complicated, let me describe what the bill does in \nmore detail.\n  First, it recognizes that the Federal Government has information \nabout cyber threats that it can and should share with the private \nsector and with State, local, and tribal governments. The bill requires \nthe Director of National Intelligence to put in place a process that \nwill increase the sharing of information on cyber threats already in \nthe government's hands with the private sector and help protect an \nindividual or a business.\n  Importantly, as the first order of business, there will be a \nmanagers' amendment which makes changes to specifically limit the ways \nthe government can use the cyber security information it receives. This \namendment was distributed on Friday. I would urge everyone to look at \nit because under the amendment, this bill can only be used for cyber \nsecurity purposes--no others. It is not a surveillance bill; it is \nstrictly related to cyber security. The bill previously allowed the \ngovernment to use the information to investigate and prosecute serious \nviolent felonies. That has drawn substantial opposition, and we have \nremoved it in the managers' package.\n  I would now like to take a minute to go over some of the privacy \nprotections in the bill.\n  No. 1, the bill is strictly voluntary. It does not require companies \nto do anything they choose not to do. There is no requirement to share \ninformation with another company or with the government. The government \ncannot compel any sharing by the private sector. It is completely \nvoluntary.\n  No. 2, it narrowly defines the term ``cyber threat indicator'' to \nlimit the amount of information that may be shared under the bill. \nCompanies do not share information under this bill unless it is \nspecifically about a cyber threat or a cyber defense--nothing else.\n  No. 3, the authorizations are clear but limited. Companies are fully \nauthorized to do three things: monitor their networks or provide \nmonitoring services to their customers to identify cyber threats; use \nlimited defensive measures to protect against cyber threats on their \nnetworks; and to share and receive information with each other and with \nFederal, State, and local governments.\n  No. 4, there are mandatory steps companies must take, before sharing \nany cyber threat information with other companies or the government, to \nreview the information for irrelevant privacy information. In other \nwords, the companies must do a privacy scrub. They are required to \nremove any personal information that is found. Companies cannot, as it \nhas been alleged, simply hand over customer information.\n  No. 5, the bill requires that the Attorney General establish \nmandatory guidelines to protect privacy for any information the \ngovernment receives. These guidelines will be public, and they will \ninclude consultation with the private sector prior to them being put \ntogether.\n  The bill requires them to limit how long the government can retain \nany information and provide notification and a process to destroy \nmistakenly shared information. It also requires the Attorney General to \ncreate sanctions for any government official who does not follow these \nmandatory privacy guidelines.\n  No. 6, the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of \nDefense or the intelligence community, is the primary recipient of \ncyber information. In the managers' amendment, we strengthen the role \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security has in deciding how information \nsharing will take place.\n  No. 7, once the managers' amendment is adopted, the bill will \nrestrict the government's use of voluntarily shared information, so the \ngovernment cannot use this information for law enforcement purposes \nunrelated to cyber security and cyber crime.\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\n  No. 8, the bill limits liability protections to monitoring for cyber \nthreats and sharing information about them and only--and only--if a \ncompany complies with the bill's privacy requirements. The bill \nexplicitly excludes protection for gross negligence or willful \nmisconduct.\n  No. 9, above and beyond these mandatory protections, there are a \nnumber of oversight mechanisms in the bill, including reports by heads \nof agencies, inspectors general, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board.\n  In sum, this bill allows for strictly voluntary sharing of cyber \nsecurity information and many layers of privacy protection.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman of our committee is here, so \nI would like to skip to the conclusion of my remarks and then be able \nto turn this over to him.\n  The House of Representatives has already passed two bills this year \nto improve cyber security information sharing. The Intelligence \nCommittee has crafted a carefully balanced bill that passed by a 14-to-\n1 vote in March and it has improved significantly since then through \nthe managers' amendment.\n  We very much need to take this first step on cyber security to \naddress the almost daily reports of hacking and cyber threats. I very \nmuch hope the Senate will take action now.\n  Now I will yield the floor. I want to thank the chairman. It has been \na pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to work with you. I think I speak for every \nmember of the committee. I am very pleased we have this bill on the \nfloor. God willing and the Members willing, we will be able to pass it \none day.\n  I yield the floor to the chair of the Intelligence Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend and vice \nchair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein. She has been in \nthe trenches working on cyber security legislation longer than I have. \nHer passion is displayed in the product that has come out. There has \nbeen no person more outspoken on privacy than Dianne Feinstein. There \nis no person who has been more outspoken on the need for us to get this \nright than Senator Feinstein.\n  Daily, she and I look at some of the most sensitive intelligence \ninformation that exists in this country. We are charged as a \ncommittee--15 individuals out of a body of 100--to provide the \noversight to an intelligence community to make sure they live within \nthe letters of the law or the boundaries set by Executive order. Every \nday we try to fulfill that job.\n  We are sometimes tasked with producing legislation, and that is why \nwe are here today with the cyber security bill. It has been referred to \nthat we are here because OPM got hacked. No. We are here because the \nAmerican people's data will be in jeopardy if government does not help \nto find a way to help minimize the loss.\n  So where is the threat? The threat is to business, it is to \ngovernment, and it is to individuals. There is no part of America that \nis left out of this. The legislation we are proposing affects everybody \nin this country--big and small business, State and Federal governments, \nand individuals, no matter where they live or how much they are worth. \nI think it is safe to say today that business and government have both \nbeen attacked, they have been penetrated, and data has been lost. In \nsome cases that intent was criminal; in some cases the intent was \nnation-states. It was towards credit cards on one side or Social \nSecurity numbers, and on the other side it was plans for the next \nmilitary platform or intellectual property that was owned by a company. \nBut we are where we are, and now we have a proposal as to how we \nminimize.\n  Let me emphasize this. You heard it from the vice chairman. This bill \ndoes not prevent cyber attacks. I am not sure that we could craft \nanything that would do that. What this bill does is for the first time \nit allows us a pathway to minimizing the amount of data that is lost \nand for the first time empowering government, once they get the \npertinent information, to push out to the rest of business and to \nindividuals and to governments: Here is the type of attack that is \nhappening. Here is the tool they are using. Here is the defensive \nmechanism you can put on your system that will provide you comfort that \nthey cannot penetrate you and provide the company that has been \nattacked comfort that it might be able to minimize in real time the \namount of data that is lost.\n  So, as the vice chairman said, these are key points on this piece of \nlegislation: It is voluntary. There is no entity in America that is \nforced to report. It is a purely voluntary system. To have \nparticipation in a voluntary system, you have to listen to the folks \nwho are the subjects of these attacks as to what they need to act in \nreal time and to provide pertinent data.\n  It is an information-sharing bill. It is not a surveillance bill. I \nsay to those who have characterized it that way that we have done \neverything we can to clarify with the managers' amendment that there is \nno surveillance. The only thing we are after is minimizing the loss of \ndata that exists.\n  Here is how it works. I want to break it into three categories.\n  This bill covers private to private. It says that if I am a private \ncompany and my IT system gets hacked and I get penetrated, I can \nautomatically pick up the phone and call the IT people at my \ncompetitor's business, and I am protected under antitrust, that we can \ncarry out a conversation so that I can figure out whether they got \nhacked, and if they did but they did not get penetrated, what software \ndid they have on their system that secured their data. I can \nimmediately go and put that on my system, and I can minimize the loss \nof any additional data. So we protect for that private-to-private \nconversation only for the purposes of sharing cyber information.\n  We also have private to government. We allow any company, in real \ntime--at the same time they are talking to a competitor, they can \ntransmit electronically the pertinent data that it takes to do the \nforensics of what happened. What tool did they use? They can transfer \nthat to government, and they are protected from a liability standpoint \nfor the transfer of that--the vice chairman got into all of this, so I \ndo not want to rehash it--with the correct protections of personal \ndata. The company is required not to send personal data. Any government \nagency that is the recipient of this data, as they go through it, if \nthey see personal data that is not relevant to the determination of \nwhat type of attack, what type of tool, what type of response, then \nthey have to minimize that data so it is not released.\n  In addition, we have government to private, which is the third leg. \nIt amazed me that the government did not have the authority to push out \na lot of information. What we do is we empower the government to \nanalyze the attack, to determine the tool that was used, to find the \nmost appropriate defensive software mechanism, and then to say to \nbusiness broadly: There is an attack that has happened in America. This \nis the tool they used. This is the defensive mechanism that will \nprotect the data at your company.\n  If you ask me, I think this is what we are here for. This is what the \nCongress of the United States is supposed to do--facilitate, through \nminor tweaks, a voluntary participation to close the door and minimize \npotential loss. That is all we are attempting to do.\n  I want to loop back to where the vice chairman was. We are now at the \npoint where we are asking our colleagues for unanimous consent to come \nto the floor and actually take up this bill. Moving to the bill allows \nour colleagues to come to the floor with relevant amendments to the \nbill, where they can be debated and voted on.\n  I actually believe, Vice Chairman, if we could do that now, we could \nprocess this entire bill and all of the amendments that are relevant by \nthis time tomorrow. That would mean we would have to work and we would \nhave to talk and we would have to vote, but we could do it because I \nthink when we look at the array of relevant amendments, they are pretty \nwell defined. Some of them are duplications of others that people have \nplanned to talk about.\n  But to suggest that this is a problem, which it is--we have seen it \nwith over 22 million government workers whose personal data and in some \ncases, because of the forms they had to fill out for security \nclearance, their most sensitive data has gotten out of the OPM system.\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\n  Just because OPM was the last one, don't think that somebody wasn't \nserious. Don't think that Anthem Blue Cross wasn't serious. Don't think \nthat some of the attacks that only acquired credit card information \naren't serious.\n  What we are attempting to do is to minimize the degree of that loss. \nAll we need is the cooperation of every Member of the Senate to say: I \nam willing to move to the bill. I am willing to bring up amendments--\nrelevant amendments--willing to debate them and willing to vote on \nthem.\n  Process is where we are. At the end of the day, we can determine \nwhether this is a bill that is worthy to move on. It is not the end of \nthe road because once we get through in the Senate we have to \nconference the bill with the House of Representatives. As the vice \nchairman pointed out, they have produced multiple pieces of \nlegislation. It is the Senate that is now holding us back.\n  I urge my colleagues: Let's agree to move to the bill. Let's agree to \nrelevant amendments, and let's process this cyber security bill so that \nwhen we come back from August, we can actually sit down with our \ncolleagues in the House, conference a bill, and provide the American \npeople with a little bit of security, knowing that we are going to \nminimize the amount of data that is lost, because of a voluntary \nprogram between the private sector and the government.\n  I think the vice chairman shares my belief that we are not scared to \nhave a debate on relevant amendments on this bill. We understand there \nare more views than just ours. But we have to get on the bill to be \nable to offer amendments, to be able to share what we know that might \nnot necessarily support the amendment.\n  Right now, we are sort of frozen because we cannot offer amendments, \nincluding the managers' amendment, which I would say to my colleagues--\nand the vice chairman said this in a very specific way--if you will \nread the managers' amendment, a lot of the concerns that people have \nwill vanish. Nobody will call it a surveillance bill because we have \naddressed the issues that people were concerned with. Although we \ndidn't think they were problems before, we clarified it in a way that \nit is limited only to cyber security. I could make a tremendous case \nthat through the cyber security forensic process, if we found another \ncriminal act, the American people probably would want that reported--\nwithout a doubt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In light of recent events that have dominated the news, \nincluding the breach of millions of Americans' privileged information, \nwhich could be used in ways to harm them, do you think it is a good \nidea for the Senate to go out into a month-long recess without at least \nhaving debates, votes, and amendments on this issue?\n  Does the Senator know of an issue right now that impacts the lives of \neveryday Americans such as this threat of cyber security attacks on the \ncitizens of the United States?\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator for the question, and I think he knows \nthe answer.\n  We should dispose of this. The easiest way, as I shared earlier, is \nthat if we get on this bill and we process amendments, if we really \nwanted to, we could finish tomorrow. The reality is that it doesn't \ntake a long time to debate amendments, to vote on amendments, and to be \ndone.\n  At the end of the day, every Member would have to make a decision as \nto whether they are supportive or against the bill. But not getting on \nthe bill, not offering amendments cheats the American people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will just ask one more question.\n  It is obvious that the Senator from California and the Senator from \nNorth Carolina have worked very closely together on this issue. They \nare the two leaders on intelligence now for a number of years.\n  Wouldn't it seem logical that with a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat addresses an issue--I guess my question is this: How many \nAmericans have been affected most recently by cyber attacks, and what \nwould this legislation do to try to prohibit that from happening again? \nDon't we have some obligation to try to address the vulnerabilities of \naverage American everyday citizens?\n  Mr. BURR. I think the answer is there have been millions of Americans \nwhose private data has been breached for numerous reasons. The Senator \nfrom Arizona is correct. We have an obligation to do what we can to \nminimize that loss.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And isn't this a bipartisan product?\n  Mr. BURR. Well, this is very much a bipartisan bill, and I think it \nis a bicameral effort. It is not as if this is a limb we are walking \nout on and the House isn't already out there. Emphatically, I implore \nmy colleagues: Let's get on the bill. Let's come and offer relevant \namendments, and let's process those amendments as quickly as we can. I \nthink we can accommodate both, the need to leave for August and to go \nsee the people we are married to and get away from the people we see \nevery day who influence us in numerous ways--I am speaking of the \nSenator from Arizona right now, and I know he is anxious to go \nsomewhere other than here--and to process this bill, which is to do our \nwork. To not get on the bill, to not offer amendments is to ignore the \nresponsibilities that we have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to just finally say to the Senator from North \nCarolina that I appreciate the hard work he and the Senator from \nCalifornia have put in on this issue. It has been said by our military \nleaders that right now one of the greatest vulnerabilities to national \nsecurity is the possibility or likelihood of cyber attacks. The \nimplications of that far exceed that of the invasion of someone's \nprivacy.\n  I thank him and the Senator from California for their hard work on \nthis. I think it at least deserves debate and amendments, and hopefully \nwe can pass it before we go out for the recess.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator from Arizona, who has worked closely \nwith us since the beginning to try to move this bill together. \nHopefully, at our lunches today, we will have an opportunity to talk to \nour Members in the hopes that we can come back from lunch and maybe get \nstarted on this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes, recognizing that it is after 12:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, in November 2013, the United States and \nfive global powers, the P5+1, announced an interim deal to freeze \nIran's nuclear program and negotiate a diplomatic resolution to one of \nthe most challenging issues affecting global security.\n  Since then, as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, I participated in scores of hearings, \nclassified briefings, meetings, and calls about this topic in Virginia, \nWashington, and during five trips to the Middle East, including two \ntrips to Israel.\n  I have listened to the administration, to allies in the Middle East \nand elsewhere, to current and former Senate colleagues--especially \nformer Armed Services Chairmen John Warner and Carl Levin--to national \nsecurity and foreign policy experts, to critics and proponents of the \ndeal, to American military leaders and troops, and also to my \nconstituents. I helped write the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, \nunder which Congress is currently engaging in a 60-day review period to \napprove or disapprove of the suspension of congressional sanctions as \npart of the final deal announced July 15.\n  Based on my review of this complex matter, I acknowledge that every \noption before us involves risk with upside and downside consequences.\n  I understand how people of good will can reach different conclusions, \nbut I also conclude that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is a \ndramatic improvement over the status quo at improving global security \nfor the next 15 years and, likely, longer.\n  In this deal, America has honored its best traditions and shown that \npatient\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\ndiplomacy can achieve what isolation and hostility cannot.\n  For this reason, I will support the deal.\n  Prior to the interim negotiation in November of 2013, and even in the \nface of a punishing international sanctions regime, Iran's nuclear \nprogram was marching ahead. Iran had amassed more than 19,000 \ncentrifuges to enrich uranium, and that number was growing. Iran had \nproduced more than 11,000 kilograms of enriched uranium, and that \nstockpile was growing. Iran had perfected the ability to enrich uranium \nto the 20-percent level, and that enrichment level was growing. Iran \nwas constructing a heavy-water facility at Arak capable of producing \nweapons-grade plutonium, and Iran only allowed limited IAEA access to \nits declared nuclear facilities, shielding its operation and inspection \nof covert nuclear sites.\n  The program, when diplomacy began, was months away from being able to \nproduce enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon.\n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations in \n2012:\n\n       For over seven years, the international community has tried \n     sanctions with Iran. Under the leadership of President Obama, \n     the international community has passed some of the strongest \n     sanctions to date. . . . It's had an effect on the economy, \n     but we must face the truth. Sanctions have not stopped Iran's \n     nuclear program.\n\n  We must face the truth. A punishing sanctions regime did not stop \nIran's nuclear program. The nuclear program will only stop by a \ndiplomatic agreement or by military action. While military action has \nto be an option, it is in America's interest--and in the interest of \nthe entire world--to use every effort to find a diplomatic resolution. \nIn fact, that was the purpose of the Iranian sanctions to begin with--\nto open a path to a diplomatic solution.\n  We now have a diplomatic solution on the table. The JCPOA is not \nperfect because all parties made concessions, as is the case in any \nserious diplomatic negotiation. But it has gained broad international \nsupport because it prevents Iran from getting sufficient uranium for a \nbomb for at least 15 years. It also stops any pathway to a plutonium \nweapon for that period, and it exposes Iranian covert activity to \nenhanced scrutiny by the international community forever.\n  Under the deal, Iran does the following: It affirms that ``under no \ncircumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear \nweapons,'' it reduces its quantity of centrifuges by more than two-\nthirds, and it slashes its uranium stockpile by 97 percent to 300 \nkilograms for 15 years. This is dramatically less than what Iran would \nneed to produce even a single weapon. It caps the enrichment level of \nthe remaining uranium stockpile at 3.67 percent. It reconfigures the \nIraq reactor so that it can no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium. \nIt commits to a series of limitations on R activities to guarantee \nthat any nuclear program will be ``for exclusively peaceful purposes'' \nin full compliance with international nonproliferation rules. Finally, \nIran agrees to a robust set of international inspections of its \ndeclared nuclear facilities, its entire uranium supply chain, and its \nsuspected covert facilities by a team of more than 130 international \ninspectors.\n  After year 15, the unique caps and requirements imposed on Iran are \nprogressively lifted through year 2025. After year 25, Iran is \npermanently obligated to abide by all international nonproliferation \ntreaty requirements, including the extensive inspections required by \nthe NPT Additional Protocol, and its agreement that it will never \n``seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons'' continues forever.\n  If Iran breaks this agreement, nuclear sanctions may be reimposed. \nThe United States reserves the right to sanction Iran for activities \nunrelated to its nuclear program, including support for terrorism, arms \nshipments, and human rights violations.\n  Finally, and importantly, the United States and our partners maintain \nthe ability to use military action if Iran seeks to obtain a nuclear \nweapon in violation of this deal. The knowledge of the Iranian program \ngained through extensive inspections will improve the effectiveness of \nany military action, and the clarity of Iran's commitment to the \nworld--in the first paragraph of the agreement--that it will never \npursue nuclear weapons will make it easier to gain international \nsupport for military action should Iran violate their unequivocal \npledge.\n  This deal does not solve all outstanding issues with an adversarial \nregime. In that sense, it is similar to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \nPresident Kennedy negotiated with the Soviet Union in the midst of the \nCold War. Iran's support for terrorism remains a major concern, and we \nmust increase efforts with our regional allies to counter those malign \nactivities. But at the end of the day, this agreement is not about \nmaking an ally out of an adversary, it is about denying an adversary a \npath to obtaining nuclear weapons.\n  This deal takes a nuclear weapons program that was on the verge of \nsuccess and disables it for many years through peaceful diplomatic \nmeans with sufficient tools for the international community to verify \nwhether Iran is meeting its commitments. I hope this resolution might \nopen the door to diplomatic discussion of other tough issues with Iran.\n  In conclusion, monitoring this agreement and countering Iran's \nnonnuclear activity will require great diligence by the United States, \nour allies, and the IAEA, and there will be an important role for \nCongress in this ongoing work. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on measures to guarantee close supervision and enforcement \nof this deal. That work will be arduous, but it is far preferable to \nallowing Iran to return to a march toward nuclear weapons. It is also \nfar preferable to any other alternative, including war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6263-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend from \nFlorida, Senator Nelson, for allowing me to speak for 5 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be recognized immediately following me--not \nthe Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 754, the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act. I want to thank my colleagues \nChairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein for their leadership on this \ncritically important legislation. This bill, of which I am an original \ncosponsor, was overwhelmingly approved by a 14-to-1 vote in the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence in March.\n  Enacting legislation to confront the accumulating dangers of cyber \nthreats must be among the highest national security priorities of the \nCongress. Cyber attacks on our Nation have become disturbingly common. \nMore recently, it was the Office of Personnel Management. A few weeks \nbefore that, it was the Pentagon network, the White House, and the \nState Department. Before that it was Anthem and Sony--just to name a \nfew. The status quo is unacceptable, and Congress needs to do its part \nin passing this legislation. But the President, as our Nation's \nCommander in Chief, must also do his part to deter the belligerence of \nour adversaries in cyber space.\n  The threats from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran--not to mention \nthe aspirations of terrorist organizations like ISIL and Al Qaeda--are \nsteadily growing in number and severity. And our national security \nleadership has warned us repeatedly that we could face a cyber attack \nagainst our Nation's critical infrastructure in the not too distant \nfuture. I believe our response to such an attack, or lack thereof, \ncould define the future of warfare.\n  To date, the U.S. response to cyber attacks has been tepid at best, \nand nonexistent at worst. Unless and until\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\nthe President uses the authorities he has to deter, defend, and respond \nto the growing number and severity of cyber attacks, we will risk not \njust more of the same but emboldened adversaries and terrorist \norganizations that will continuously pursue more severe and destructive \ncyber attacks.\n  As ADM Mike Rogers, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, told \nlisteners at the Aspen Security Forum a couple weeks ago, ``to date \nthere is little price to pay for engaging in some pretty aggressive \nbehaviors.'' According to James Clapper, the Director of National \nIntelligence, ``we will see a progression or expansion of that envelope \nuntil such time as we create both a substance and psychology of \ndeterrence. And today we don't have that.''\n  According to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nDempsey, our military enjoys ``a significant military advantage'' in \nevery domain except for one--cyber space. As General Dempsey said, \ncyber ``is a level playing field. And that makes this chairman very \nuncomfortable.'' Efforts are currently underway to begin addressing \nsome of our strategic shortfalls in cyber space, including the training \nof a 6,200-person cyber force. However, these efforts will be \nmeaningless unless we make the tough policy decisions to establish \nmeaningful cyber deterrence. The President must take steps now to \ndemonstrate to our adversaries that the United States takes cyber \nattacks seriously and is prepared to respond.\n  This legislation before us is one piece of that overall deterrent \nstrategy, and it is long past time that Congress move forward on \ninformation sharing legislation. The voluntary information sharing \nframework in this legislation is critical to addressing these threats \nand ensuring that the mechanisms are in place to identify those \nresponsible for costly and crippling cyber attacks and, ultimately, \ndeter future attacks.\n  Many of us have spent countless hours crafting and debating cyber \nlegislation back to 2012. Mr. President, 2012 was the last time we \nattempted to pass major cyber legislation. This body has come a long \nway since that time. We understand that we cannot improve our cyber \nposture by shackling the private sector, which operates the majority of \nour country's critical infrastructure, with government mandates. As I \nargued at that time, heavyhanded regulations and government bureaucracy \nwill do more harm than good in cyber space. The voluntary framework in \nthis legislation represents the progress we have made in defining the \nrole of the private sector and the role of the government in sharing \nthreat information, defending networks, and deterring cyber attacks.\n  This legislation also complements actions we have taken in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, currently in conference \nwith the House. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, cyber \nsecurity is one of my top priorities. That is why the NDAA includes a \nnumber of critical cyber provisions designed to ensure the Department \nof Defense has the capabilities it needs to deter aggression, defend \nour national security interests, and, when called upon, defeat our \nadversaries in cyber space.\n  The NDAA authorizes the Secretary of Defense to develop, prepare, \ncoordinate, and, when authorized by the President, conduct a military \ncyber operation in response to malicious cyber activity carried out \nagainst the United States or a United States person by a foreign power. \nThe NDAA also authorizes $200 million for the Secretary of Defense to \nassess the cyber vulnerabilities of every major DOD weapons system. \nFinally, Congress required the President to submit an integrated policy \nto deter adversaries in cyber space in the fiscal year 2014 NDAA. We \nare still waiting on that policy, and this year's NDAA includes funding \nrestrictions that will remain in place until it is delivered.\n  Every day that goes by, I fear our Nation grows more vulnerable, our \nprivacy and security are at greater risk, and our adversaries are \nfurther emboldened. These are the stakes, and that is why it is \nessential that we come together and pass the Cybersecurity Information \nSharing Act.\n  Mr. President, I thank again my friend from Florida, who is a valued \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for his indulgence to \nallow me to speak. I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce my decision on the \nIranian nuclear agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  This decision of mine comes after considerable study of the issue--as \nhave our colleagues in the Senate taken this quite seriously. I have \ntalked with folks on all sides of the issue. These include colleagues \nas well as constituents. It includes experts on the Middle East and \nCentral Asia, arms control experts, foreign allies, and, as we say in \nmy constituency, it includes just plain folks. I want to say that \nSecretary Moniz, a nuclear physicist, has been especially helpful.\n  Needless to say, I wish that the three Americans jailed in Iran and \nBob Levinson, a former FBI agent missing in Iran for 8 years, had been \na part of an agreement--of this agreement--to return them. The Levinson \nfamily in Florida is anxious for information and help to return Bob. \nThis is personal for me.\n  I am a strong supporter of Israel, and I recognize that country as \none of America's most important allies. I am committed to the \nprotection of Israel as the best and right foreign policy for the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  I am blessed to represent Florida, which also has among our citizens \na strong and vibrant Jewish community, including many Holocaust \nsurvivors and Holocaust victims' families, some of whom I have worked \nwith to help them get just compensation from European insurance \ncompanies that turned their backs on them after World War II and would \nnot honor their insurance claims.\n  In our State we are also proud to have a Floridian, a former U.S. and \nMiami Beach resident, as the Israeli Ambassador to the United States. \nAmbassador Ron Dermer grew up in Miami Beach. His father and brother \nare former mayors. He is someone I have enjoyed getting to know and \nhave had several conversations with over the years and recently spent \ntime talking to him about his opposition to this joint agreement.\n  I acknowledge that this has been one of the most important \npreparations and will be one of the most important votes that I will \ncast in the Senate because the foreign and defense policy consequences \nare both huge for the United States and our allies.\n  Unless there is an unexpected change in the conditions and facts \nbefore the vote is called in September--and it will be called on the \nvery first day that we return in September--unless there is an \nunexpected change, I will support the nuclear agreement between Iran \nand the P5+1--which are the United States, the UK, France, Russia, \nChina, and Germany--because I am convinced it will stop Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years. No \nother available alternative accomplishes this vital objective.\n  The goal of this almost 2-year negotiation--culminated in this deal--\nwas to deny Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This objective has \nbeen fulfilled in the short term. For the next 10 years, Iran will \nreduce its centrifuges--the machines that enrich the uranium--by two-\nthirds. They will go from more than 19,000 centrifuges to 6,000. Only \n5,000 of those will be operating, all at Natanz, all the most basic \nmodels. The deeply buried Fordow facility will be converted to a \nresearch lab. No enrichment can occur there, and no fissile material \ncan be stored there. For the next 15 years, Iran's stockpile of low-\nenriched uranium--which currently amounts to 12,000 kilograms; enough \nfor 10 bombs--will be reduced by 98 percent, to only 300 kilograms. \nResearch and development into advanced centrifuges will also be \nlimited. Taken together, these constraints will lengthen the time it \nwould take for Iran to produce the highly enriched uranium for one \nbomb--the so-called breakout time. It will lengthen it from 2 to 3 \nmonths that they could break out now to more than 1 year. That is more \nthan enough time to detect and, if necessary, stop Iran from racing to \na bomb.\n  Iran's ability to produce a bomb using plutonium will also be blocked \nunder this deal. The Arak reactor--which as currently constructed could \nproduce enough plutonium for one to\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\ntwo bombs every year--will be redesigned to produce no weapons-grade \nplutonium. And Iran will have to ship out the spent fuel from the \nreactor forever.\n  Iran signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, in which \nthey agreed they would not pursue nuclear weapons. Iran has reaffirmed \nthis principle in this joint agreement. Iran also says they want to \neventually make low-grade nuclear fuel, as other NPT-compliant nations \ndo, in order to produce electricity. If they comply, they will \neventually be allowed to do so under this joint agreement. Our \nexpectation is that in 15 years, when Iran can lift the limit of 300 \nkilograms of low-enriched uranium, if they have not cheated, they will \ncontinue to abide by their NPT obligations and use their fuel only for \nelectricity and medical isotopes. If they deviate from those civilian \npurposes, then harsh economic sanctions will result, and, very \npossibly, U.S. military action.\n  The world will be a very different place in 10 to 15 years. If we can \nbuy this much time, instead of Iran developing a nuclear bomb in the \nnear future, then that is reason enough for me to vote to uphold this \nagreement. If the United States walks away from this multinational \nagreement, then I believe we would find ourselves alone in the world \nwith little credibility, but there are many more reasons to support \nthis agreement.\n  The opponents of the agreement say that war is not the only \nalternative to the agreement. Indeed, they, as articulated by the \nIsraeli Ambassador, say we should oppose the agreement by refusing to \nlift congressional economic sanctions, and the result will be that the \ninternational sanctions will stay in place, that Iran will continue to \nfeel the economic pinch, and therefore Iran will come back to the table \nand negotiate terms more favorable to the United States and our allies.\n  If the United States kills the deal that most of the rest of the \nworld is for, there is no question in this Senator's mind that the \nsanctions will start to erode, and they may collapse altogether. We \njust had a meeting with all the P5+1 Ambassadors to the United States, \nand they reaffirmed that exact fact. Sanctions rely on more than just \nthe power of the U.S. economy, they depend on an underlying political \nconsensus in support of a common objective. China, Russia, and many \nother nations eager to do business with Iran went along with our \neconomic sanctions because they believed they were a temporary cost to \npay until Iran agreed to a deal to limit their nuclear program. That \nfragile consensus in support of U.S. policy is likely to fall apart if \nwe jettison this deal.\n  I think it is unrealistic to think we can stop oil-hungry countries \nin Asia from buying Iranian oil, especially when offered bargain \nbasement prices. It is equally unrealistic to think we can continue to \nforce foreign banks that hold the Iranian oil dollars--banks in China, \nIndia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that have sequestered Iranians' \noil dollars--it is unrealistic to expect that they will hold on to that \ncash simply because we threaten them with U.S. banking sanctions. How \nwill such threats be taken seriously when these countries, taken \ntogether, hold nearly half of America's debt, making any decision to \nsanction them extraordinarily difficult. Killing this deal by rejecting \nit means the sanctions are going to be weaker than they are today, not \nstronger, and the United States cannot simply get a better deal with \nIran, with less economic leverage and less international support. That \nis a fact we are having to face. Of course, if we rejected it and if \nthe sanctions crumbled, all of this would probably happen while Iran \nwould be racing to build a bomb. Without this deal, Iran's breakout \ntime could quickly shrink from months to a handful of weeks or days.\n  It is reasonable to ask why Iran would agree to negotiate a delay in \ntheir nuclear program that they have advanced over the years at the \ncost of billions of dollars. The simple answer is they need the money. \nThe Iranian economy is hurting because of the sanctions, and Iran's \nSupreme Leader needs to satisfy rising expectations of average \nIranians, who are restless to have a bigger slice of the economic pie \nwith more and better goods and supplies.\n  So they have an interest in striking a deal, but does that mean we \ntrust Iran's Government? No, not at all. The Iranian religious \nleadership encourages hardliners there to chant ``Death to America'' \nand ``Death to Israel.'' Therefore, this agreement can't be built on \ntrust. We must have a good enough mechanism in place to catch them when \nand if they cheat; in other words, don't trust but verify.\n  I believe the agreement sets out a reasonable assurance that Iran \nwill not be able to hide the development of a bomb at declared or \nundeclared sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors \nwill have immediate access to declared sites--the Arak reactor and the \nenrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow.\n  For the next 20 to 25 years, inspectors will also have regular access \nto the entire supply chain, including uranium mines and mills, \ncentrifuge production, assembly, and storage sites. That means \ninspectors will catch Iran if they try to use the facilities we know \nabout to build a weapon or if they try to divert materials to a secret \nprogram. To confirm that Iran is not building a covert bomb, this \nagreement ensures that inspectors will have access to suspicious sites \nwith no more than a 24-day delay. I know there has been a lot of \nconversation about that. It is broken off into days. At the end of the \nday, it must be physical access. Now, would this Senator prefer they \nget in instantaneously? Of course. Could Iran hide some activities \nrelevant to nuclear weapons research? Possibly. But to actually make a \nbomb, Iran's secret activity would have to enrich the fuel for a \ndevice--and they couldn't cover that up if they had years, let alone do \nso in a few weeks. Traces of enriched uranium or a secret plutonium \nprogram do not suddenly vanish, and they can't be covered up with a \nlittle paint and asphalt. So I am convinced that under the agreement, \nIran cannot cheat and expect to get away with it.\n  On top of the unprecedented IAEA inspections established by this deal \nis the vast and little understood world of American and allied \nintelligence. This Senator served on the Intelligence Committee for 6 \nyears and now has clearances on the Armed Services Committee. I can \nstate unequivocally that U.S. intelligence is very good and extensive \nand will overlay IAEA inspections. Remember, we discovered their secret \nactivities in the past, even without the kinds of inspections put in \nplace by this joint agreement. So if Iran tries to violate its \ncommitment--its commitment not to build nuclear weapons--and if the \nIAEA doesn't find out, I am confident our intelligence apparatus will.\n  What about the part of the joint agreement that allows the \nconventional arms embargo to be lifted in 5 years and missile \ntechnology to be lifted in 8 years? I understand it was always going to \nbe tough to keep these restrictions in place, and I don't like that \nthose restrictions are not there. Fortunately, even when the arms \nembargo expires, five other U.N. resolutions passed since 2004 will \ncontinue to be in force to prohibit Iran from exporting arms to \nterrorists and to militants. These have had some success, albeit \nlimited, as in the case of the U.S. Navy stopping arms shipments to the \nHouthis in Yemen. These same U.N. resolutions will stay in place to \nblock future Iranian arms shipments to others. We also have nonnuclear \nsanctions tools we can--and we must--continue to use to go after those \nwho traffic in Iranian arms and missiles.\n  Will this agreement allow Iran to continue to be a state sponsor of \nterrorism? Yes, but they now have the capability to develop a nuclear \nweapon within months and still be a state sponsor of terrorism. I \nbelieve it is in the U.S. interest that Iran is not a nuclear power \nsponsoring terrorism. As dangerous a threat that Iran is to Israel and \nour allies, it would pale in comparison to the threat posed to them and \nto us by a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\n  Would I prefer a deal that dismantles their entire program forever \nand ends all of Iran's bad behavior? Of course I would. But how do we \nget a better deal that the opposition wants? We don't have that \nopportunity if the sanctions fall apart, and that is exactly what would \nhappen if we reject this deal. Iran will emerge less isolated and less \nconstrained to build a nuclear weapon.\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\n  Under the deal, we keep most of the world with us. That means, if the \nIranians cheat, they know we can snap back the economic sanctions and \ncut off their oil money. This joint agreement declares that Iran will \nnever ever be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. If they break their \nagreement, even in 10 or 15 years, every financial and military option \nwill still be available to us, and those options will be backed by \never-improving military capabilities and more and better intelligence.\n  So when I look at all the things for the agreement and against the \nagreement, it becomes pretty obvious to me to vote in favor of the \nagreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our government was recently struck by a \ndevastating cyber attack that has been described as one of the worst \nbreaches in U.S. history. It was a major blow to the privacy of \nmillions of Americans. We know the private sector is vulnerable to \nattack as well. The House has already passed two White House-backed \ncyber security bills to help address the issue. Similar legislation is \nnow before the Senate. It is strong, bipartisan, and transparent. It \nhas been vetted and overwhelmingly endorsed 14 to 1 by both parties in \ncommittee.\n  It would help both the public and private sectors to defeat cyber \nattacks. The top Senate Democrat on this issue reminds us it would \nprotect individual privacy and civil liberties too. Now is the time to \nallow the Senate to debate and then pass this bipartisan bill.\n  In just a moment, I will offer a fair consent request to allow the \nSenate to do just that. The Democratic leader previously said that both \nhe and the senior Senator from Oregon believe the Senate should be able \nto finish the bill ``in a couple of days . . . at the most.'' And just \ntoday he said the Democrats remain willing to proceed to this \nbipartisan bill if allowed to offer some relevant amendments. The \nsenior Senator from New York has also said that Democrats want to get \nto the bill and that they want to get a few amendments too.\n  Our friends across the aisle will be glad to know that the UC I am \nabout to offer would allow 10 relevant amendments per side to be \noffered and made pending. That is a good and fair start that exceeds \nthe request from our friends across the aisle.\n  Now that we have a path forward that gives both sides what they said \nthey need, I would invite our colleagues to join us now in moving \nforward on this bill. I invite our colleagues to allow the Senate to \ncooperate in a spirit of good faith to pass a bill this week so we can \nhelp protect the American people from more devastating cyber attacks.\n  I notified the Democratic leader that I would propound the following \nconsent request: I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed to calendar No. 28, S. 754, be withdrawn and that the \nSenate immediately proceed to its consideration. I further ask that \nSenator Burr then be recognized to offer the Burr-Feinstein substitute \namendment and that it be in order during today's session of the Senate \nfor the bill managers, or their designees, to offer up to 10 first-\ndegree amendments relevant to the substitute per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader is my friend, and I don't mean in any \nway to disparage him, other than to bring out a little bit of history. \nI can't imagine how he can make this offer with a straight face. Have \namendments pending? That is like nothing. We tried that before, as \nrecently as the highway bill. Having amendments pending doesn't mean \nanything.\n  We want to pass a good cyber security bill. We have a bill that has \nbeen crafted in the intelligence committee. Other committees have been \ninterested in participating in what we have here on the floor, but they \nare willing to say: OK. We have a bill from the intelligence committee.\n  There have been no public committee hearings, no public markups. \nThere has been nothing done other than a rule XIV which, of course, my \nfriend said he would not do if he got to be the leader and there would \nbe a robust amendment process. Having a robust amendment process has \nnothing to do with having amendments pending.\n  We want to pass a good bill. But we want to have a reasonable number \nof amendments, and there will be votes on those amendments. We are not \nasking for longtime agreements. The Republican leader's proposal would \nnot lead to votes on the amendments. He would allow the amendments to \nbe pending, but if the Republican leader were to file cloture, as he \nhas done repeatedly the last few months--and an example is what he did \nwith the recent highway bill--all amendments that were not strictly \ngermane would fall.\n  Remember, we are not asking for germane amendments. We are asking for \nrelevant amendments. We are willing to enter into an agreement that \nprovides votes on a reasonable number of amendments that would be \ngermane in nature, and we should be working on that agreement.\n  In contrast, if we fail to get that agreement, we are going to have a \ncloture vote an hour after we come in in the morning, and 30 hours \nafter that--sometime late Thursday afternoon or early Thursday \nevening--he would have to file cloture on that. That puts us right into \nthe work period when we get back on September 8.\n  When we get back, we have the 8th to the 17th, including weekends and \na holiday that is celebrated every year that we always take off, which \nincludes 2 days. It is a Jewish holiday. I can't imagine why we would \nwant this to interfere with what we are trying to do in the month of \nSeptember.\n  We are willing to do this bill. We can start working on these \namendments right now if we can have votes on them, but we are not going \nto agree to some arrangement like this. If the Republicans are going to \npush this, we can come in here tomorrow, and we will vote. The 30 hours \nof time will go by--and we know how to use 30 hours; we were taught how \nto do that--30 hours of postcloture time. And Thursday afternoon, the \nleader can make whatever decision is necessary.\n  We want a cyber bill. This bill is not the phoenix of all cyber \nbills, but it certainly is better than nothing. We should--following \nthe recommendation and the suggestion and what the Republican leader \nhas said he would do--be allowed some amendments to vote on. We can \nstart that today. Today is Tuesday. We can finish these amendments--I \nwould hope on the Democratic side--in a fairly short order of time.\n  As for the Republicans, I don't know. All I heard following the \ncaucus is one Republican Senator wanted to offer an amendment on the \ncyber bill dealing with auditing the Fed. I can't imagine why that has \nanything to do with this bill.\n  We are serious about legislating. We want to do something that is \ngood, we believe, for the country, good for the order of the Senate. \nOtherwise, we will look at each other around here until Thursday \nafternoon, and the Republican leader can look forward to this being the \nfirst thing we take up when we get back in September. We are willing to \nbe fair and reasonable to finish this, with our amendments, in a very \nshort period of time. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say, I think there may well be a \nway forward here. What I thought I heard the Democratic leader say is \nthat they are interested in passing a bill. That is important. He said \nwhen it was offered on the defense authorization bill that it was a 2-\nday bill, and we could agree to a limited number of amendments.\n  I think we both agree this is an important subject. I can't imagine \nthat either the Democrats or the Republicans want to leave here for a \nmonth and not pass the cyber security bill. I think there is enough \ninterest on both sides to try to continue to discuss the matter and see \nif there is a way forward. That would be in the best interest of the \ncountry if we could come together and do this. This bill came out of \nthe intelligence committee 14 to 1.\n  Chairman Burr and Vice Chair Feinstein have been asking for floor \ntime. They are anxious to move this bill\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\nacross the floor. I am hoping the Democratic leader and I can continue \nto discuss the matter and that we can find a way forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I look forward to that discussion. Keep in \nmind, being reported out of committee--this is a committee that holds \neverything in secret. They do nothing public. So having a 14 to 1 vote \nin a meeting that takes place in secret doesn't give the other Senators \nwho are not on that committee a lot of solace.\n  I look forward to the Republican leader and me and our staffs working \ntogether to try to come up with some way to move forward on this \nlegislation. We want to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my good friend the Democratic leader \nused to remind me, the majority leader always gets the last word.\n  This is not a new issue. It was around during the previous Congress. \nOther committees acted--other committee chairmen like what Chairman \nBurr and Vice Chair Feinstein have done. Hopefully, we can minimize \nsort of manufacturing problems here that keep us from going forward \nwhen it appears to me that both sides really would like to get an \noutcome and believe it would be best for the country to get an outcome \nbefore we go into the recess. We will continue to discuss the matter \nand hope that we can find a way forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I understand there \nhas already been an objection.\n  I will speak later in the afternoon or early evening in some detail \nabout why I have significant reservations with respect to this \nlegislation.\n  To say--as we heard again and again throughout the day--that this is \nabout voluntary information sharing is essentially only half true. The \nfact is, companies could volunteer to share their customers' \ninformation with the government, but they wouldn't have to ask for \npermission from their customers before handing it over. That is one \nreason every major organization with expertise and interest on privacy \nissues has had reservations about the bill. It may be voluntary for \ncompanies, but it is mandatory for their customers and their consumers. \nThey are not given the opportunity to opt out.\n  The legislation has been public for months, and dozens of cyber \nsecurity experts have said it wouldn't do much to stop sophisticated, \nlarge-scale attacks such as the horrendous attack at the Office of \nPersonnel Management.\n  On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security--an absolutely \nessential agency as it relates to this bill--wrote a letter to our \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Franken, and \nsaid if this bill's approach is adopted, ``the complexity and \ninefficiency of any information sharing program will markedly \nincrease.'' The Department of Homeland Security added that the bill \n``could sweep away important privacy protections.'' That is a pretty \nstrong indictment from the agency that would be in charge of \nimplementing the legislation.\n  As I have indicated a couple of times in the last day or so, I think \nthe managers, Senator Feinstein and Senator Burr, have made several \npositive changes, but the bottom line is it doesn't address the very \nsubstantial privacy concerns that relate to this bill. The fact is, \ncyber security is a very serious problem in America.\n  Oregonians know a lot about it because one of our large employers was \nhacked by the Chinese. SolarWorld was hacked by the Chinese because \nthey insisted on enforcing their rights under trade law. In fact, our \ngovernment indicted the Chinese for the hack of my constituents and \nothers.\n  So cyber security is a serious problem. Information sharing can play \na constructive role, but information sharing without robust privacy \nsafeguards is really not a cyber security bill. It is going to be seen \nby millions of Americans as a surveillance bill, and that is why it is \nso important that there be strong privacy guidelines.\n  The fact is, in the managers' legislation, the section allowing \ncompanies to hand over large volumes of information with only a cursory \nreview would be essentially unmodified. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity asked for some specific changes to the language, which the \nmanagers' amendment does not include. So my hope is, we are going to \nhave a chance to have a real debate on this issue. Personally, I would \nrather go down a different route with respect to cyber security \nlegislation. In particular, I recommend the very fine data breach bill \nof our colleague from Vermont Senator Leahy, but if Senators have their \nhearts set on doing the bill before us, it is going to need some very \nsubstantial amendments, both to ensure that we show the American people \nthat security and privacy are not mutually exclusive, that we can do \nboth, and to address the very serious operational reservations the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has raised. Neither set of concerns is \nthoroughly addressed by the managers' amendment.\n  So my hope is that we are going to have a chance to make some very \nsignificant reforms in this legislation. After seeing what has happened \nover the last few weeks, where the government isn't exactly doing an \nideal job of securing the data it has, and now we are going to propose \nlegislation that has private companies, without the permission of their \ncustomers, for example, to dump large quantities of their customers' \ndata over to the government with only a cursory review--this \nlegislation is not going to be real attractive to the millions of \nAmericans who sent us to represent them.\n  In fact, in just the last few days, I read in the media that some of \nthe opponents of this legislation have sent something like 6 million \nfaxes to the Senate--and people wonder if there are still fax machines. \nI guess the point is to demonstrate it is important that we understand, \nas we look at digital communications, what the challenge is.\n  I will have more to say about this later in the afternoon and in the \nevening, but I wanted to take this opportunity, since we have just \ngotten out of the party caucuses, to make some corrections with respect \nto what we were told this morning and particularly on this question \nabout how this is a voluntary bill. Ask millions of Americans whether \nit is voluntary when companies can hand over their private information \nto the government without their permission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, cyber security is an important issue, but I \ncome to the floor to talk for a bit about one of the most consequential \ndecisions that I, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, and my colleagues \nwill make, and that concerns the negotiated agreement between the P5+1 \nand Iran--the proposed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. In \nmy view, it provides too much relief in return for too few concessions. \nThe deal implicitly concedes that Iran will become a nuclear power and \nwill gain the ability and legitimacy to produce a weapon in a matter of \nyears while gaining wealth and power in the meantime.\n  I serve on the Senate Banking Committee. The sanctions that were \ncreated by Congress originate from that committee. Those sanctions were \nput in place to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power--a country \ncapable of delivering a nuclear weapon across their border. Those \nsanctions were not put in place to give Iran a path or a guideline to \nbecome a nuclear-weapon-capable country. The key is to keep nuclear \nweapons out of the hands of Iran's Government. The key to that is to \npermanently disable Iran from nuclear capability and remove the \ntechnology used to produce nuclear materials. This deal fails to \nachieve this goal by allowing Iran to retain nuclear facilities. Though \nsome of it will be limited in use in the near term, the centrifuges \nused to enrich nuclear matter will not be destroyed or removed from the \ncountry. This deal allows Iran's nuclear infrastructure to remain on \nstandby for nuclear development when the restrictions expire.\n  Also troubling is the agreement's lack of restrictions on nuclear \nresearch and development. Iran seeks to replace its current enrichment \ntechnology\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nwith a more advanced centrifuge that more efficiently enriches nuclear \nmaterial. By failing to restrict research and development now, we are \npriming Iran's nuclear program to hit the ground running toward a bomb \nonce the restrictions are lifted in a matter of years.\n  Also, the inspection regime agreed to in this negotiation is \ndangerously accommodating. The agreement provides Iran a great deal of \nflexibility regarding the inspection of military sites just like those \nwhere Iran's past covert nuclear development work took place. The deal \nallows Iran to hold concerned international inspectors at bay for \nweeks, if not months, before granting access to a location suspected of \nbeing a site for nuclear development.\n  The value of any access to suspected Iranian nuclear sites that \ninternational inspectors ultimately do receive will depend upon their \nunderstanding of Iran's past nuclear weapons research. A comprehensive \ndisclosure of possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear research \nis necessary for inspectors to fully understand Iran's current \ninfrastructure and is critical to their ability to rule out any future \nefforts to produce nuclear weapons.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, has not made public its \nsite agreement with Iran about their previous nuclear developments. \nThis is an aside, but I would say none of us should agree to this \nnegotiated agreement without seeing, reading, and knowing the content \nof that agreement. Under the proposed deal, that vital full disclosure \nof Iran's nuclear past may not occur, diminishing the value of \ninspections and increasing the risk that another covert weaponization \nof Iran will take place.\n  Painfully absent from the agreement's requirements is Iran's release \nof American hostages: Saeed Abedini, Jason Rezaian, Robert Levinson, \nand Amir Hekmati. The freedom of Americans unjustly held in Iran should \nhave been a strict precondition for sanctions relief instead of an \nafterthought.\n  In return for very limited concessions, this deal gives Iran way too \nmuch. If implemented, the agreement would give Iran near complete \nsanctions relief up front. This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue. \nCommon sense tells us that you don't give away a leverage until you get \nthe result that you are looking for, and this agreement provides \nsanctions relief upfront, delivering billions in frozen assets to the \nIranian Government and boosting the Iranian economy. Included in this \nrelief are sanctions related to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which \nwere to be lifted only when Iran ceased providing support for \ninternational terrorism.\n  The sanctions relief in this proposal not only fails to require \npreconditions and cooperation regarding nuclear disarmament but will \nremove sanctions from the Iranian Guard, despite their status as a top \nsupporter of terrorist groups around the Middle East and globe.\n  This type of gratuitous flexibility for Iran is found elsewhere in \nthe agreement. The P5+1 acceptance of Iranian demands for a relaxed \nU.N. arms embargo is both perplexing and scary. This deal would relax \ntrade restrictions on missiles after 8 years, while immediately erasing \nlimits on missile research and development. It would also lift \nrestrictions on Iranian centrifuge use and development after just 8 to \n10 years. The deal grants Iran the ability to more efficiently produce \nnuclear material just as it gains the ability to access the delivery \nweapons system.\n  Earlier this month, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN \nMartin Dempsey, said: ``Under no circumstances should we relieve \npressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms \ntrafficking.'' Lifting the U.N. arms embargo was ``out of the \nquestion.'' Yet, just 1 week later, negotiators announced the lifting \nof the embargo in 5 to 8 years or less. I wonder what has changed. \nUnless the menace of an increased flow of weapons in and out of Iran \nsomehow substantially decreased during the intervening week, the \nconsequence of this sudden capitulation should have us all greatly \nconcerned.\n\n  This fear of increased money flow to terror organizations linked to \nthe Iranian Government is not based upon merely an outside possibility; \nit is a likelihood. Last week Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister stated: \n``Whenever it's needed to send arms to our allies in the region, we \nwill do so.'' More money and more weapons in the hands of terrorist \norganizations are the fuel for increased violence and further \ndestabilization in the conflict-torn Middle East.\n  We have little reason to believe Iran's behavior will change as a \nresult of this agreement. In fact, their chants of ``Death to America'' \nbecome more real.\n  Since the announcement of the agreement, the leader of Iran has been \nopenly antagonistic to the United States. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has \npromised to continue to incite unrest and said Iran's ``policy towards \nthe arrogant U.S. will not change.'' These anti-American statements \ncome from an Iranian leader whose commitment the Obama administration \nis relying on for the nuclear accord to work. It should trouble every \nAmerican that the Obama administration is asking us to support a deal \nthat relies on the total cooperation of those who, as I say, strongly \nstate their commitment to bringing about ``death to America.''\n  Given the Obama administration's troubling efforts to push through \nthis deal to the United Nations and restrict the influence of the \nAmerican people through this Congress in the decision, it is all the \nmore important that we follow through with a serious assessment of this \nnuclear agreement. We are faced with a circumstance that, by the \nadministration's own previous standards, concedes too much and secures \ntoo little.\n  I strongly oppose this nuclear deal. It is intolerably risky, and the \nresult will be a new Iran--a legitimized nuclear power with a growing \neconomy and enhanced means to finance terror, to antagonize, and to \nultimately pursue a nuclear weapons program. I will support the \ncongressional resolution to express Congress's explicit disapproval.\n  President Obama has used fear in his agenda in seeking our support \nfor this agreement. The warning has been that a vote against his policy \nis a vote for war with Iran. The President's political scare tactics \nare not only untrue but also illogical.\n  Incidentally, we were not at war with Iran when the agreements were \nin place before the negotiation. The absence of agreeing to the \nnegotiated agreement would not mean we will be at war thereafter.\n  The President's claims undermine numerous statements his own \nadministration has made about the negotiation process, the nature of \nthe Iranian nuclear program, and the proposed agreement's prospects for \nsuccess. If true, the President's words concede that his foreign policy \nhas led America into a dangerous position.\n  We would expect a President to provide the American people as many \nalternatives to war as possible, not just a single narrow and risky one \nsuch as this. According to the President, the only alternative to war \nis this agreement--a deal that results in better financed terrorists, a \nweakened arms embargo, and the need for boosting U.S. weapons sales to \nIran's regional rivals. If this prospect of war is his concern, the \nPresident would benefit by reevaluating the geopolitical consequences \nof the deal and seeking out much better options.\n  I had hoped these negotiations would result in a strong but fair deal \nto dismantle Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Again, the purpose of \nplacing sanctions on Iran was to get rid of their nuclear capability as \nfar as delivery of nuclear material across their borders. Yet this \nagreement leaves that infrastructure in place and puts them on a \npromising path toward that nuclear capability.\n  Regrettably, that kind of deal was not reached. Now my hope is a \nsimple one: that we are able to reverse some of the damage that is \nalready done and that this agreement is rejected.\n  I would say that there are those who argue that we would be isolated \nby rejection of this agreement, that other countries would approve and \nthe United Nations may approve. This is an issue of such importance \nthat we need to do everything possible to see that Iran does not become \na nuclear power, and we need to have the moral character and fiber to \nsay no to this agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Economic Security for Our Country's Workers\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, across our country today, so many of our \nworkers clock in 40 hours a week. They work very hard, and yet they are \nunable to provide for their families.\n  Just last fall, NBC News interviewed a woman named Latoya who worked \nin a fast food restaurant. She was protesting as part of a fast food \nworkers strike. Latoya is raising four children alone on $7.25 an hour. \nThat is less than $300 a week and is well below the poverty line for \nher and her family. For part of last year, she was living in a homeless \nshelter. She told the reporter: ``Nobody should work 40 hours a week \nand find themselves homeless.'' On top of rock-bottom wages, Latoya \nsaid she and her colleagues experienced unpaid wages, unpredictable \nscheduling, and having to make do with broken equipment on the job.\n  In today's economy, too many of our workers across the country face \nthe same challenges as Latoya. They are underpaid, they are overworked, \nand they are treated unfairly on the job. In short, they lack \nfundamental economic security.\n  Several places around the country and in my home State of Washington \nare working to address this at the local level. This Senator believes \nwe need to bring the Washington State way here to Washington, DC. In \nCongress, I believe we need to act to give workers some much needed \nrelief. We need to grow our economy from the middle out, not the top \ndown, and we should make sure our country works for all Americans, not \njust the wealthiest few.\n  There is no reason we can't get to work today on legislation to do \njust that. That is why I have joined with my colleagues over the past \nfew months in introducing several bills that will help restore some \nmuch needed economic security and stability to millions of workers. \nThat is why I am hoping we can move some of these bills forward before \nwe all go back home to our States.\n  For too long we have heard from some Republicans the theory--a deeply \nflawed theory--that if we would only grant more tax cuts to the \nwealthiest Americans and if we would just keep rolling back regulations \non the biggest corporations, those benefits would eventually trickle \ndown and reach working families in our country. Not only does that \ntheory not work, as we have seen over the past few decades, that \ntrickle-down system has done real damage to our Nation's middle class \nand our working families. While worker productivity has actually \nreached new heights, workers have lost basic protections they once had.\n  While trickle-down economics allows corporations to post big profits, \ntoo many of our workers are paying the price. Let me give some \nexamples. Today the Federal minimum wage can leave a family in poverty \neven after working full time and even without taking a single day off. \nNot only that, today some businesses are using unfair scheduling \npractices to keep workers guessing about when they are going to be \ncalled in to work, with no guarantee of how much money they will earn \nin a given week. Those types of scheduling abuses take a real toll on \nworkers' lives and prevent them from getting ahead. Attending college \nclasses is not an option when someone's work schedule is always in \nflux. Taking on a second job to earn more money is nearly impossible \nwhen you can't plan around your first job. And that is not all. Today, \n43 million workers in this country don't have paid sick leave. When \nthey get sick, they have to choose between toughing it out at work and \npassing that illness on to others or staying at home and potentially \nlosing their job. When their child is sick, they have to choose between \nlosing money on their paycheck or missing out on caring for their son \nor daughter. If that is not enough, in our country women are paid just \n78 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is not just unfair to \nwomen, by the way; it is bad for families and it hurts our economy.\n  Many businesses are doing the right thing and are supporting their \nworkers, but other corporations that don't, put those businesses that \nare doing the right thing at a competitive disadvantage by running a \nrace to the bottom and pulling their workers down with them.\n  This worker insecurity isn't just devastating for the millions of \nworkers and their families who are impacted by it, it is also hurting \nour economy. Truly robust and strong economic growth comes from the \nmiddle out, not the top down. When our workers lack security, when they \nare not treated fairly, they can't invest in themselves and their \nchildren or spend money in their communities or move their families \ninto a middle-class life.\n  I believe we have to address this challenge on multiple fronts. We \ncan start by making sure our workers are treated fairly so they can \nearn their way toward rising wages and increased economic security.\n  There are important things we can do here in Congress to expand \neconomic security and stability for millions of our working families \ntoday. For starters, we should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act that the \nsenior Senator from Maryland has championed for so many years to \nfinally close the pay gap between men and women. The Paycheck Fairness \nAct would tackle pay discrimination head-on. This Senator hopes we can \nall agree that in the 21st century, workers should be paid fairly for \nthe work they do, regardless of their gender.\n  We should also raise the minimum wage to make sure hard work does pay \noff. My Raise the Wage Act increases the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 \nand is enough to lift a family of three out of poverty. It will put \nmore money in workers' pockets so they can spend it in their local \ncommunities. It will help to build a strong floor--a Federal minimum--\nthat workers and cities can build off of and go even higher where it \nmakes sense, like in Seattle in my home State in Washington. It is a \nlevel that Republicans should be able to agree with and start moving \ntoward right now.\n  I have also worked on a bill, along with Senators Warren and Murphy, \nto crack down on the scheduling abuses I just talked about, so \nbusinesses would no longer keep their workers guessing on when they \nwould be called in or how many hours they might get in a given week.\n  In February I introduced the Healthy Families Act to allow workers to \nearn up to 7 paid sick days. I want to move forward on that legislation \nto give our workers some much needed economic security because no one \nshould have to sacrifice a day of pay or their job altogether just to \ntake care of themselves or their sick child.\n  We as a nation should not turn our backs on empowering our workers \nthrough collective bargaining, especially since strong unions ensure \nworkers have a strong voice at the table. It is the very thing that \nhelped so many workers climb into the middle class in this country.\n  Enacting these critical policies won't solve every problem facing our \nworkers and their families today. It is not the only way that I and \nSenate Democrats will be fighting to protect workers and making sure \nthe economy is growing from the middle out, not the top down. But these \npolicies would be very strong steps in the right direction to bring \nback that American dream of economic security and a stable middle-class \nlife for millions of workers who have seen it slip away.\n  When workers succeed, businesses succeed and thus the economy \nsucceeds. We know this works. I have seen it in my home State of \nWashington where State and local governments have taken the lead on \nproposals such as raising the minimum wage and paid sick days. I think \nit is time to bring some of that Washington State way right here to \nWashington, DC.\n  I recently heard from a small business owner by the name of Laura. \nShe owns a small auto repair shop in Renton, WA. She shared something \nthat I hear all the time from business owners: Doing the right thing by \nworkers starts a virtuous cycle. Laura said, ``When workers have more \nmoney, businesses have more customers. With more customers, businesses \ncan hire more workers, which in turn generates more customers.''\n  Working families in our country have been waiting long enough for \nsome relief from the trickle-down system that hurts the middle class. \nThat is why I\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\nam going to be asking for unanimous consent to work on the policies \nthat would restore economic security and stability to more workers.\n  Let's finally restore some stability and security for workers across \nour country. Let's make sure hard work pays off. Let's help more \nfamilies make ends meet, expand economic opportunity, and grow our \neconomy from the middle out.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 3 minutes and that I be followed immediately by the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is the parliamentary procedure that there \nwas an objection to the Senate moving forward with the consideration of \nthe cyber bill? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was an objection that was heard to the \nrequest of the majority leader.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor, I tell the Senator from Washington.\n  This is unbelievable. It is unbelievable that this body would not \nmove forward with a cyber bill with the situation of dire consequences \nand dire threats to the United States of America. Admiral Rogers, the \ncommander of U.S. Cyber Command, told listeners at the Aspen Security \nForum that ``to date there is little price to pay for engaging in some \npretty aggressive behaviors.''\n  According to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, \n``we will see a progression or expansion of that envelope until such \ntime as we create both the substance and psychology of deterrence. And \ntoday we don't have that.''\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, our \nmilitary enjoys ``significant military advantage'' in every domain \nexcept for one--cyber space. General Dempsey said cyber ``is a level \nplaying field. And that makes this chairman very uncomfortable.'' The \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is uncomfortable about the cyber \nthreats to this Nation.\n  What just took place is millions of Americans had their privacy \nhacked into. God only knows what the consequences of that are. The \nother side has decided to object to proceeding with a bill that passed \nthrough the Intelligence Committee by a vote of 14 to 1. This is \ndisgraceful--this is disgraceful. I tell my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, by blocking this legislation, you are putting this \nNation in danger. By blocking this legislation, you are putting this \nNation in danger by not allowing the Senate of the United States to act \nagainst a very real threat to our very existence.\n  I say this is a shameful day in the Senate. I urge the Democratic \nleader to come to the floor and allow us to consider amendments, move \nforward with this legislation because the security of the United States \nof America is in danger.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1138) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow Senators, today is a historic day \nfor the State of Idaho. This is the creation of a wilderness area in \nthe Sawtooth area of Idaho, the Boulder-White Clouds area, and the \nJerry Peak area. These two mountain ranges and one mountain peak area \nhave been under consideration for about 10 years.\n  I want to talk very briefly about what we are dealing with. These are \nsome of the most magnificent pieces of land, not only in Idaho but in \nthe United States. Before anyone goes abroad to see the Champs-Elysees \nor to see the magnificent works of art in Italy, you need to put on \nyour list seeing the Boulder-White Clouds area. It is truly a \nmagnificent area.\n  What we just did was we created a wilderness of about 275,000 acres \nthat creates these three wilderness areas, plus a buffer zone around \nthem. It is a great day for Idaho. This is an Idaho solution to an \nissue that has been pending for some time.\n  I conclude by simply stating that all credit for this goes to \nCongressman Mike Simpson. Congressman Simpson started working on this \nabout 10 years ago and wanted to put together, in a collaborative \nfashion, a wilderness bill for this particular area. He did that. He \nbrought it back to Washington, DC. Because of the situation in DC at \nthe time, the bill was changed greatly and was no longer an Idaho \nsolution to the Idaho problem.\n  Congressman Simpson did not give up. He worked and he worked and he \nworked at it. It is truly his long-term commitment to this and his long \nwork on this that got us to this point. What he did was take this land \nthat there was virtually unanimous agreement should be in wilderness; \nthat is, the heart of this area, the Boulder Range, the White Cloud \nRange, and the Jerry Peaks area.\n  There was unanimous agreement that this is the kind of land that \nneeds to be in wilderness. Indeed, when I was Governor, I wrote this \nrule for several million acres. This was included in it. It was \nprotected as wilderness. This is not changing the character of it in \nthat regard. What it does is put it in statute instead of in rule.\n  The difficulty was, as always with these kinds of areas, the buffer \narea around what everybody agrees is truly unique ground that should be \nhandled as wilderness. Obviously, it is an area that ingrains passion \nin people. It causes people to have strong feelings about the area. As \na result of that, people fight to protect what they think should be \nprotected, and just as much, people who use the buffer zones for \ndifferent reasons feel just as passionately the other way.\n  What Congressman Simpson was able to do was get everybody to the \ntable in a very collaborative fashion, to where he got the wilderness \npreservationists, the hikers, the backpackers, the horse people, the \nmotorized users, including snowmobile, ATV, and motorcycle people, to \nall agree to a management plan for everything that is included in this \nbill.\n  Congressman Simpson was tenacious on this. He gets the full credit \nfor this. I think Idahoans will truly appreciate this for many years. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that the efforts Congressman Simpson put \ninto this will be greatly appreciated for years and years to come.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague, my good \nfriend, Senator Mike Crapo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank Senator Risch.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to rise with my colleague Jim \nRisch to celebrate the passage of this legislation. It has been years \nand years in the making. This legislation culminates from the hard work \nby people all over Idaho. As Senator Risch has indicated, the credit \nfor making this all finally come together goes to Representative Mike \nSimpson. I wholeheartedly agree with that.\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\n  Passage of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak \nWilderness Additions Act, also called the SNRA+ Act, is the result of \ntremendous efforts by Representative Simpson and Senator Risch. He \ndeserves tremendous credit as well. I do want to say that I honor \nRepresentative Simpson's dogged determination and his persistence to \nfight through many obstacles associated with this treasured region of \nour State for a very long period of time.\n  Representative Simpson's efforts have given Idaho a homegrown \nsolution to what was rapidly becoming a national problem. As I said, \nsimilarly, my colleague Senator Risch has fought through many \nchallenges in his pursuit of developing a consensus on this issue that \nhas been hard to achieve. Both of my colleagues, in their respective \nways, have expressed again the power of collaboration in the attempt to \nfind consensus to deliver local solutions to longstanding public land \nmanagement challenges in Idaho.\n  Local governments and local stakeholders must be empowered to shape \nand manage decisions relating to our public lands. In the process, such \nefforts must respect private property rights and the owners of private \nproperty as well as other impacted stakeholders. Such initiatives are \nnever easy to achieve, and consensus takes dedication, patience, and \npersistence. For too long, westerners have been saddled with top-down \nland management decisions that are both harmful to the landscape and \nthe people living in and subsisting off of our natural treasures. The \nSNRA+ is a win for Idaho and an example of how local governments and \ninterests can achieve solutions to some of the most persistent public \nland management issues we face.\n  I have to conclude by saying that while we have succeeded today in \npassing a milestone in Congress, the focus must now shift to the hard \nwork of successful implementation that will require commitment from the \nvarious Federal agencies and all of the affected interests.\n  Again, I commend Senator Risch and Representative Simpson for their \nincredibly important work that has been accomplished today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleagues from Idaho on \nthis particular piece of legislation, proving it can be done right. It \nwas just a few weeks ago that the President unilaterally declared a \nmonument in the State of Nevada the size of Rhode Island, with two \ncounties that had no input in the process. Our delegation had no input. \nThe collaborative effort that we saw from Idaho and how it works and \nhow the system should work needs to be recognized. What happened in \nNevada, I feel, was a disgrace.\n  It is a shame we are standing here today with a monument in the State \nof Nevada the size of Rhode Island with no input from Nevada's \ndelegation or counties, just a single action made by one person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6271-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6271-S6286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I would like to talk about personal \nprivacy rights for American citizens. It was just 2 months ago that the \nSenate took action to restore privacy rights of American citizens \nthrough the USA FREEDOM Act--part of action that was taken, as I \nmentioned, just 2 months ago. Both Chambers of Congress and the \nPresident agreed it was time to end the bulk collection of American's \ncall records pouring into the Federal Government.\n  I was a proud supporter of the USA FREEDOM Act and believed it was \nthe right thing to do on behalf of U.S. citizens. My constituents all \nacross Nevada--from Elko, to Reno, Ely, and Las Vegas--all understand \nhow important these rights are and will not accept any attempts to \ndiminish them. Today, I am here to continue protecting these privacy \nrights and uphold our civil liberties.\n  Protecting privacy will always be important to Nevadans. It is \nnonnegotiable to me, very important. Similar to many of my colleagues \nin the Senate, I believe addressing cyber security is also important.\n  When I was ranking member of the commerce committee's consumer \nprotection subcommittee, I worked on these issues in detail. I \nunderstand very well the impact of data breaches, cyber threats. In \nfact, back in my State of Nevada, one of the top concerns is identity \ntheft. Not only can these identity thieves wreak financial havoc on a \nconsumer's life, but these threats also pose a serious national \nsecurity concern.\n  We saw with OPM's breach that personal information for 21.5 million \nFederal employees, even those who received security clearances, was \ncompromised. In my office, in fact, a member of my staff was breached \nthree times in just the last 4 years. These thieves cross international \nborders. They break and enter into private homes. They hack their way \nto intrusion with a keyboard and a simple click of the mouse.\n  So I share the desire to find a path forward on information sharing \nbetween the Federal Government and the private sector as another tool \nin the cyber security toolbox, but I have always stood firm with these \ntypes of efforts that they must also maintain American's privacy \nrights.\n  The bill I see today, including the substitute amendment, does not do \nenough to ensure personally identifiable information is stripped out \nbefore sharing. That is why I filed a fix. Let's strengthen the \nstandard for stripping out this information. Right now, this bill says \nthe private sector and the Federal Government only have to strip out \npersonal information if they know--if they know--it is not directly \nrelated to a cyber threat.\n  I would like to offer some context to that. Let's say you are pulled \nover for speeding, not knowing the speed limit does not absolve you of \nguilt. If your company fails to follow a Federal law or regulation, not \nknowing about the law does not exempt you from the consequences of \nviolating it. Ignorance is no excuse under the law, so why should this \nparticular piece of legislation be any different?\n  My amendments ensure that when personal information is being stripped \nout, it is because the entity reasonably believes--not knows but \nreasonably believes--it is not related to a cyber threat. One of my \namendments addresses the Federal Government's responsibility to do \nthis, and the other addresses the private sector's responsibility to do \nthis.\n  This term ``reasonably believes''--let me repeat that--``reasonably \nbelieves'' is an important distinction that this bill needs. It creates \na wider protection for personal information by ensuring these entities \nare making an effort to take out personal information that is not \nnecessary for cyber security. Our friends over in the House of \nRepresentatives already agree the private sector should be held to this \nstandard, which is why they included this language in the cyber \nsecurity bill which they passed. I hope to see this important \nprotection retained in any conference agreement should this bill move \nforward.\n\n  Furthermore, in a letter to a Senator last week, DHS directly \nacknowledged the importance of removing personally identifiable \ninformation and even went so far as to say this removal will allow the \ninformation-sharing regime to function much better. Even DHS agrees \nthat with this amendment it would function much better. So what it \ncomes down to is our Nation's commitment to balancing the needs for \nsharing cyber security information with the need to protect America's \npersonal information.\n  I believe my amendment, No. 2548, to hold the Federal Government \naccountable strikes that balance, and I will continue strongly pushing \nforward to get this vote. I encourage my colleagues to support this \ncommonsense effort to strengthen this bill and keep our commitment to \nupholding the rights of all U.S. citizens.\n  As we discuss this issue, I hope we will continue having the \nopportunity to truly debate and make improvements to this bill. I \nbelieve that if given the opportunity, we can strengthen this \nlegislation even more to protect against cyber security threats while \nalso protecting American citizens' private information.\n  No bill is perfect, as the Presiding Officer knows, but that is why \nwe are here and that is why there is an amendment process. That is why \nI wish to see\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\nthe Senate openly debate and amend this bill, including my amendment. \nThe privacy rights of Americans are too important an issue and a very \nimportant issue to all of us.\n  I acknowledge that some of my colleagues want the opportunity to \ndebate issues related to the bill and those issues that are unrelated \nto the bill. I recognize there are many important issues Members would \nlike to see addressed before August--or at least the August recess--\nsuch as my friend from Kentucky, who filed an amendment regarding \nfirearms on bases. Like my colleague, I recognize the importance of \nthis issue, which is why I introduced this legislation days ago. My \nlegislation would simply require the Secretary of Defense to establish \na process for base commanders in the United States to authorize a \nservicemember to carry a concealed personal firearm while on base. Men \nand women who serve our country deserve to feel safe and should be able \nto defend themselves while stationed in the United States. That is why \nI feel strongly that Congress should give our Nation's base commanders \nthe authority they need to create a safer environment for our heroes \nserving across America.\n  At this time I recognize it is unclear if there will be an \nopportunity to debate this issue on this particular piece of \nlegislation, but it is an important issue. Once again, I hope that as \nwe continue to debate this bill that we will find a path forward on all \namendments.\n  I appreciate the willingness of both Senator Burr and Senator \nFeinstein to work with me on my amendments, and I look forward to \ncontinuing this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 30 \nminutes be equally divided between Senators Schumer, Boxer, Whitehouse, \nMarkey, and Schatz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I ask for a modification that I be \nable to speak for 1 minute on the cyber issue before we go into that 30 \nminutes?\n  With that modification, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, in my 1 minute, I just wish to respond to what my \nfriend, the Senator from Arizona, said. We are very keen to get a good, \nstrong cyber security bill passed.\n  My concern about the amendment process is that amendments that will \nstrengthen the bill and make it a better cyber bill ought to have a \nchance to get a vote. I have one that I worked out with Senator Graham, \nwho I think has good national security credentials and whom Senator \nMcCain respects, and another one with Senator Blunt, who also has good \nnational security credentials and whom I think Senator McCain also \nrespects. I believe both of the bills have now been cleared by the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, so they don't have a business community objection. \nBut I also fear that if we followed the majority leader's proposal, he \nwould file cloture and they wouldn't survive a germaneness test.\n  So I think our leader's offer, basically, of a specific list of \namendments--none of which are ``gotcha'' amendments, all of which \nrelate to this bill--would be a very good way to proceed, get on the \nbill, and get something passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I think \nthere is a broad agreement--I certainly do--that we want to move to \nthis bill and, if given an agreement on a limited number of amendments, \nall relevant to cyber security, with no intention to be dilatory, and \nwith time limits, we can get this done. But it is only fair on a major \nbill to offer some amendments and not just to fill the tree and have no \namendments at all.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  On the issue at hand, I thank Senators Whitehouse, Markey, Schatz, \nand Boxer for speaking today and participating in this colloquy. I join \nmy colleagues in appealing for meaningful action on climate change in \nthis body, which thus far has been stymied by my friends on the other \nside of the aisle on behalf of special interests, and that is an \nabsolute shame.\n  Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. Left \nunchecked, the changing climate and rising seas will threaten our \nshoreline cities and communities, as I personally witnessed after \nSuperstorm Sandy buffeted New York. Left unchecked, a changing climate \nwill have dramatic consequences for our children and grandchildren. \nPope Francis's papal encyclical represents as much. He said climate \nchange ``represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in \nour day.''\n  We know we have to act. We know the American people want us to act. \nAccording to a New York Times-Stanford University poll, 74 percent of \nAmericans said the Federal Government should be doing a substantial \namount to combat climate change. That is 74 percent.\n  Democrats agree the Federal Government must do something. We tried to \npass several bills through Congress, but my friends on the other side \nof the aisle blocked action time and time again on behalf of the \nspecial interests in the fossil fuel industry.\n  Now the President has a bold plan to reduce carbon emissions, which \nhe announced yesterday and today, but already the groups on the other \nside are marshaling their forces. The New York Times reported today \nthat fossil fuel lobbyists and corporate lawyers have been working \nsince 2014, over 1\\1/2\\ years ago, to bring down these new rules.\n  Some of these Republicans admit that climate change is real and a \nthreat. Yet they still block and block and block. My friend, the \ndistinguished majority leader, has urged governors across the country \nto simply ignore the new climate rules while they cook up lawsuits to \ndelay and frustrate their implementation.\n  OK. So you don't like the actions we propose or what the President \nproposes. Fine. What do you propose? I say to those on the other side \nof the aisle: What is your plan to meet this existential challenge? I \nhave heard none. That is why this chart says:\n\n                               --WANTED--\n\n       A GOP plan to combat climate change and reduce dangerous \n     air pollution\n\n                        #WhatstheGOPClimatePlan\n\n  There is none. We all know it is happening. Just look at the news, \nread the weather reports, and ask what scientists who are totally \nimpartial and nonpolitical say. Unfortunately, I have a funny feeling \nthat our colleagues on the other side are using the same playbook they \nare using on health care, immigration, and a host of other issues. \nBlock, repeal, oppose, but propose nothing.\n  So I conclude my brief remarks by repeating the question. What is the \nRepublican plan to act on climate change? Let me ask again in case they \ndidn't hear me. What is the Republican plan to act on climate change?\n  Let me suggest that my friends on the other side join us in seeking \nsolutions on climate change rather than obstructing our efforts and the \nwishes of the American people on behalf of special interests. Again, I \nthank my friends for organizing this colloquy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order in terms of time \nallocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes have been allocated. Each \nSenator has about 6 minutes to speak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Chair remind me when I have spoken for 5 minutes \nso I can wrap up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  In 2007, in its landmark decision called Massachusetts v. EPA, the \nU.S. Supreme Court found very clearly that carbon pollution is covered \nunder the Clean Air Act. I think it is important to note that the Bush \nadministration took the position that carbon pollution could not be \ncovered under the Clean Air Act. They wasted about 8 long years \nlitigating the matter, and we lost a lot of time. But when the Supreme \nCourt finally spoke out, this is what they said, and I quote from the \ndecision:\n\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\n\n  \n\n       Because greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act's \n     capacious definition of ``air pollutant,'' we hold that EPA \n     has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of such \n     gases. . . .\n\n  Following the Supreme Court decision, the Obama administration issued \nan endangerment finding which showed that current and future \nconcentrations of carbon pollution are harmful to our health. This \nfinding built on the work of the Bush administration, and we found some \nof the raw data from the Bush administration, and we went public with \nit. This is what the endangerment finding said, among other things:\n  No. 1, severe heat waves are expected to intensify, which can \nincrease heat-related death and sickness.\n  No. 2, climate change is expected to worsen regional smog pollution, \nwhich can cause decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, increased \nemergency-room visits, and premature deaths.\n  So once that endangerment finding was made, the Clean Air Act clearly \nrequires the Environmental Protection Agency to act to control \ngreenhouse gas pollution because it is determined that that pollution \ncauses harm.\n  I wish to say, when I still had the gavel of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, we called four former EPA administrators who \nserved under Republican Presidents from Richard Nixon to George W. \nBush. Every single one of those Republicans called on us to act now to \nreduce carbon pollution.\n  In that hearing, former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who \nserved under George W. Bush, summed it up best--and I know my friends \nremember this. She said:\n\n       I have to begin by expressing my frustration with the \n     discussion about whether or not the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has the legal authority to regulate carbon emissions \n     that is still taking place in some quarters. The issue has \n     been settled.\n\n  This is a former Republican EPA administrator under George W. Bush. \nContinuing:\n\n       EPA does have the authority. The law says so, the Supreme \n     Court has said so twice. That matter, I believe, should now \n     be put to rest. Given that fact, the agency has decided, \n     properly in my view, that it should act now to reduce carbon \n     emissions to improve the quality of our air, to protect the \n     health of our people and, as part of an international effort, \n     to address global climate change.\n\n  Now, I was so proud in that particular hearing because I haven't \nfound a Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee who \nreally even believes that climate change is real, to be honest. So to \nhave a Republican--the former head of the EPA under George W. Bush--\ntell us it is time to move was very heartening to me because I believe \naction can't come too soon. The impacts that scientists predicted years \nago are all around us and they are happening now.\n  I wish to share a couple of charts. The prediction quite a while ago \nwas that we were going to see extreme heat more frequently all around \nthe world. Well, 2014 was the hottest year on record, according to NASA \nand NOAA, and 2015, the first half of this year, is the hottest on \nrecord, according to NOAA.\n  Then, heat waves are more frequent. In Australia, in 2014, towns 320 \nmiles northwest of Sydney hit 118 degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Areas affected by drought will increase. Look at what is happening in \nmy great State, the worst drought, according to scientists, in 1,200 \nyears. Fires are increasing--same thing--and I am just so disheartened \nby the fact that we lost a firefighter, a visiting firefighter. \nFirefighters are fighting those fires right now and putting their lives \non the line every single day. Tropical storms, hurricanes--this is all \nhappening--heavy precipitation, flooding events. Houston got 11 inches \nof rain in 24 hours in 2015. And there is decreasing polar ice, and, in \naddition, rising sea levels.\n\n  So I will close with this. The evidence of climate change is here. To \nsay you are not a scientist is no answer. We know you are not a \nscientist. Politicians as a group are not. But we should listen to the \n98, 99 percent of scientists who are telling us our planet is in \ntrouble. Our people are going to be in trouble.\n  As long as I can stand up on my feet in this body, I am going to \nstand shoulder to shoulder--well, not quite; in my high heels shoulder \nto shoulder--with my friends because this is a moment in our Nation's \nhistory when our kids and grandkids will look back and ask: Why didn't \nthey protect us? Why didn't they save us? As far as I am concerned, it \nis our duty and our moral responsibility.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to start my remarks with this \nphotograph I have in the Chamber, which is a photograph of--I guess the \nminiplanet is what they call it now--Pluto. Why do I start remarks on \nclimate change and carbon pollution with a picture of Pluto? I do so \nbecause of the amazing achievement it was for our NASA scientists to \nfly a craft close enough to Pluto to take that picture. That is a heck \nof an accomplishment by our American NASA scientists.\n  But that is not their only one. While this craft was shooting by \nPluto taking these pictures, they had a rover rolling around on the \nsurface of Mars. They sent a vehicle the size of an SUV to the surface \nof Mars and are driving it around. Do you think these scientists know \nwhat they are talking about when they say something as simple as \nclimate change is real? Of course, they do.\n  But our Republican friends can't acknowledge that. They have even \nsaid these NASA scientists are in on a hoax. Can you imagine anything \nmore demeaning to the people who put a rover on Mars and shot this \npicture of Pluto than to say: Oh, they do not know what they are \ntalking about. They are in on a hoax. Forget about it. That is just not \ntrue.\n  The real issue is this. Here is Kentucky's electric generation fuel \nmix. That is its fuel mix. Guess what the gray is? Coal. That is \nbasically all they have. There is a tiny little strip of blue at the \nbottom for the hydro. There is a little tiny strip here of red for oil. \nAnd there is a tiny little bit of natural gas here at the top, for \nwhich you need a magnifying glass. You can look and, with a magnifying \nglass, you can see this tiny little green line at the top that is their \nentire renewables portfolio. Really?\n  The last I heard the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home. \nRight? So why no solar? None. How about wind? Do you think the wind \nblows through the Kentucky hills? None. You have to use a magnifying \nglass to see it. They are not even trying. They are not even trying. \nThe coal industry has that State so locked down they are doing nothing.\n  Go to Iowa. There are two Republican Senators from Iowa--hardly some \nliberal bastion--and they get about 30 percent of their electricity \nfrom wind. It is not a Communist plot. It is not a Socialist \nfabrication. It is Iowa, and the farmers love it.\n  But no, we have to protect coal at all costs. So this is the GOP \nsignal for what they are doing on climate change. I think it would \nprobably be wise to take out the smile and actually put a little band \nof tape over the mouth so that it is clear that nobody is allowed to \nsay a word.\n  This is really astonishing. Here we are, in which every State--just \nask your home State university if climate change is real. You don't \nhave to go far. Ask the University of Kentucky, ask the University of \nLouisville, ask your home State university. They know. Everybody knows. \nThe problem is the coal industry and the Koch brothers have this place \nlocked down, and it is ridiculous.\n  The Koch brothers have pledged to spend $889 million in this election \nthrough this group called Americans for Prosperity. And they have also \nsaid that ``anybody who crosses us on climate change will be at a \nsevere disadvantage.'' When you are swinging a $900 million club and \nyou are telling folks, disagree with us and you will be at a severe \ndisadvantage, this is what you get--no plan on climate change.\n  You are going to hear endless complaining from our friends on the \nother side about the President's plan. What are you not going to hear? \nWhat their plan is. What is the alternative? What have they got? If you \nhave nothing, if you have nada, zip, you really have to get into this \nconversation because even your own Republican young voters are \ndemanding it. Republican voters under\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\nthe age of 35 think climate denial is ignorant, out of touch or crazy--\ntheir words in the poll, not mine.\n  So it is time we broke through. It is time the majority leader got \naway from this 100-percent coal situation that he is defending, allowed \nthe future to take place, and allowed a conversation to take place here \nin the Senate. We are ready for it. We are ready for it.\n  I yield the floor to my wonderful colleague, Senator Markey, who has \nbeen working on this a good deal longer than I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Rhode Island, \nmy friend from California, Senator Boxer, Senator Schatz from Hawaii, \nand all the Members who work on these issues.\n  This is the big one. This is the issue. This is the threat to the \nentire planet. Young people want us to do something about it. They are \nwondering when the older generation is finally going to get around to \ndoing something about it, from moving to sending pollution up into the \nair to moving to clean energy, moving to new energy technologies.\n  So as they look at this, they look at coal, they look at a 19th \ncentury technology--coal--and they say: When are we moving to the new \nera? Well, that is a good question because in 2005 in the United States \nof America we deployed a grand total of 79 megawatts of solar. In 2014, \nwe deployed 7,000 megawatts of solar--100 times more--because we \nstarted to have a plan.\n  Democrats put a plan in place by creating tax breaks for solar, by \nincentivizing more investment in solar across the country. Individual \nStates started to put new regulations on the books--7,000 megawatts. \nNow we have 20,000 megawatts of solar in the United States. But we only \ndeployed 79 in 2005.\n  Now, if you really want some great news as to what is possible, in \n2015 and 2016, we are going to deploy 20,000 more--in just 2 years. So \nwe are going to double the total amount of all solar ever deployed in \nthe United States in just 2 years.\n  Over on the wind front, we are going to have about 80,000 megawatts \ntotal deployed by the end of next year, bringing it up to 120,000 \nmegawatts. How much is that? When you look at a big nuclear powerplant \nand you see the picture of it, that is 1,000 megawatts. So we are \ntalking about 120 of them being deployed by the end of next year.\n  So the young generation looks at us and they say: Can we do this? Can \nwe meet the goals President Obama is setting? Can we meet the objective \nof having 28 percent of all of our electricity coming from renewables \nby the year 2030?\n  Well, if you hear from the coal industry or you hear from the nuclear \nindustry, if you hear from the other fossil fuel industries, they say: \nWell, that is impossible. You can't do it. It is absolutely just going \nto be a very small part of the total amount of electricity that we \ngenerate in our country.\n  Well, they are just dead wrong. We are proving that in 2015 and 2016 \nbecause of the fight that is taking place at the State level--the tax \nbreaks for wind and solar that were put on the books largely by \nDemocrats here nationally. We are doing it. It is there. We now have \nover 200,000 people working in the solar industry in the United States. \nThere are only 85,000 people who are in the coal industry. Got that? It \nis 2015. There are 80,000 people working in the wind industry in our \ncountry.\n  These are the growth industries. These are the Internet corollaries \nin clean energy. This is where young people are going. This is where \ninnovation is going. This is where venture capital in America is going. \nThis is where the innovation around our planet is going. We can do \nthis. We can reduce greenhouse gases dramatically, increase employment \nsimultaneously, and create wealth and health for our planet.\n  The President's plan will reduce by 90,000 per year the number of \nasthma attacks in our country. It will reduce by 90 percent the total \namount of sulfur that is sent up into the atmosphere. It will be \nsomething that is supported by doctors and nurses and by Presidents and \nPopes. That is what we have. That is what this plan is. It is a \nbeautiful plan. It is a plan that spans not just the technological and \nthe political but also the moral imperative that is presented by this \nproblem.\n  So yes, the big question that is being asked is this: Where is the \nRepublican plan? Well, of course, there is none because they are still \nin denial that there is a problem, notwithstanding the fact that every \nsingle national academy of sciences of every single country in the \nworld says there is a problem.\n  This is basically a small cabal of fossil fuel executives still \ntrying to peddle 19th century technologies in the 21st century. It \nwould be as though there were a cabal to stop us from moving from black \nrotary dial phones to wireless devices so that people could walk around \nwith the new technologies. Oh, wait. There was a cabal. They fought it \nfor years and years and years and years because they had the monopoly. \nThe black rotary dial phone in the living room was all anyone would \never need. We had to break down those monopolies, and we have to break \ndown these as well.\n  But here it is more than just having a phone in your pocket. Now it \nis actually saving the planet. It is ensuring we put in place the \npreventive measures that will reduce greenhouse gases while creating \nnew jobs.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I are part of a plan called the Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative across New England, New York, Delaware, and \nMaryland. We already have a plan in place that has, in fact, reduced \ngreenhouse gases, which has simultaneously seen dramatic increases in \nwealth, creating $1.5 billion in savings for consumers. We can do this. \nWe can do this.\n  The auto industry said we could not increase the fuel economy \nstandards of the vehicles that we drive. We just went right past them. \nThe telecommunications industry did not want us to be moving to this \nwireless revolution. We just went right past them. The coal industry \ndoes not want us to act right now. For the sake of the planet, for the \nsake of generations to come, we must go right past them and ensure \nPresident Obama's plan is enacted.\n  I thank the Chair, and I now yield to the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nSchatz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and \nSenators Whitehouse and Boxer for their great leadership. I am really \nappreciative of the senior Senator from New York for taking the time to \ncome to the floor to demonstrate his commitment to this issue.\n  There is an incredible opportunity here for American leadership. In \nHawaii, in various places across the State, in 1 month we had 33 record \nhighs--in the month of July. So we all know this is the challenge of \nour generation, and we all know the next most important step is the \nfull implementation of the President's Clean Power Plan.\n  I wish to make a couple of points about the particulars of the plan. \nThe first is that this is really done well. Normally, regulatory \nfunctions can be a blunt instrument. They can be a little less than \ncareful in terms of how they are going to impact the economy. But this \nis done with great precision, with great care, and with great \ninteraction with the incumbent utility companies and distribution and \ngeneration companies. So this is done with enough flexibility to say: \nWhatever your mix in terms of energies, we are not going to dictate \nexactly how you do it at a powerplant level, at a county level, at a \ncity level. All we are saying is you have to meet these targets. And if \nyou meet these targets through distributed generation or wind or solar \nor geothermal or hydro, that is not the Federal Government's concern.\n  Our concern is that carbon is a pollutant--and that has been \ndetermined by the courts, and it has been determined by scientists--and \nthe Clean Air Act requires that airborne pollutants are regulated. So \nwe are simply going to tell every State: This, like all other \npollutants, has to be reduced over time.\n  I think the EPA took great pains to make sure this was done in a way \nthat wouldn't cause too much upheaval in the economy. This is legally \nsound. There is no question that the EPA doesn't just have the \nauthority and the discretion to move forward with carbon pollution \nregulations, they are actually required to under the last Supreme Court \ndecision. And it is doable. Hawaii has a 100-percent clean energy goal. \nThe Northeast has its RGGI program.\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\nCalifornia has a cap-and-trade program. And all of our economies \ncontinue to grow. It is not that individuals and companies don't \ncontinue to have their challenges, but it is not because of our leaning \nforward into clean energy.\n  I will make one point about the kind of layering of obstruction. The \nfirst layer, which I think we have been successful in the last 6 months \nat breaking through, is the whole ``I am not sure whether climate \nchange is real.'' Then they sort of pivoted to ``Well, I am not a \nscientist.'' So I don't think that is going to last for very long.\n  I think the next layer of obstruction is going to be ``I think \nclimate change is real. I am not sure what percentage of climate change \nis caused by humans and how much of it is naturally occurring.'' I \nthink we will be able to punch through that opposition.\n  The next layer of opposition will be this: ``America should wait.'' \nThey will tell us that America should not lead in this, that we should \nwait for China, that we should wait for India, that we should wait for \nGermany, that we should wait for Japan. So let me ask this question: \nSince when does the United States wait for other countries to lead? \nThis is the challenge of our generation, and it strikes me as \npreposterous that anybody who believes in American leadership would be \nwilling to say ``Let's see what other countries do about this problem \nfirst. Why don't we give this a few years?'' We don't have a few years. \nThis is an incredible opportunity for America to display the leadership \nit has always displayed in the international community. We finally have \nthe high ground going into the Paris discussions. We are on legally \nsound ground, we are on morally sound ground, and I think politically \nwe are increasingly on sound ground.\n  I am a full supporter of the President's Clean Power Plan. The one \nthing that causes me great dismay and I think causes some of the other \nparticipants in this colloquy dismay is that we are not even having a \ndebate.\n  This is the Democrats asking you to come down to the floor and \ndisagree with us. Disagree with the President. Disagree with Gina \nMcCarthy. Tell Sheldon and me that our bill is a piece of garbage and \nthis is what should be done instead. But let's have the great debate in \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. Right now, it is entirely one-\nsided. If we are going to display American leadership, we need some \nRepublican leadership as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? I \ndon't know if the Senator is aware of this, but I do know Senators \nWhitehouse and Markey know this since they serve with me on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, \nthe Republicans on the Environment and Public Works Committee are going \nto put forward two bills, and they expect to pass them. One would stop \nthe President's Clean Power Plan in its tracks without putting in \nanything to replace it--as a matter of fact, putting up obstacles, as I \nunderstand it, to any other plan. So it would stop it in its tracks and \nset up huge obstacles for another rule. The other one would say that if \nyou spray pesticides on bodies of water and the pesticides get into the \nwater, that spraying should be exempted from the Clean Water Act.\n  I mean, it pains me. It pains me to say that this is coming from the \nenvironment committee. Why don't they just rename it the ``anti-\nenvironment committee'' when they are in charge because every week, \nevery day on the environment they go in the wrong direction for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. I know my friend has young children. I \nhave young grandchildren.\n  Isn't it a shame that at the moment in time when the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee--they did a great job--we did a great job, all \nof us, on transportation. We had a 20-to-0 vote. We are so proud of it. \nBut on the environment, we are split down the middle, with Republicans \ntrying to stop the Clean Power Plan, stop the advances in fighting \nclimate change, stop the ability of regulators to protect the waters \nfrom pesticide spraying. Isn't it just shameful that this will be \nhappening tomorrow?\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Through the Chair, I understand the time for the colloquy \nis about to expire. Just to respond to the Senator from California, if \nthere is no objection, I would just say that we really do need \nRepublican leadership here. Prior to about 10 years ago, the Republican \nParty had a long history and an august history of working with \nDemocrats to protect our air and our water, and we are all sincerely \nhoping we can get back to that place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                  Prescription Opioid and Heroin Abuse\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a public health \nissue that is devastating communities and families in New Hampshire and \nthroughout this country; that is, prescription opioid and heroin abuse.\n  I actually see my colleagues from Rhode Island and Massachusetts \nhere. This is an issue where, on a bipartisan basis, we are focused on \nimportant legislation to address this terrible public health crisis.\n  Right now in New Hampshire, heroin--sometimes combined with a very \npowerful synthetic drug called fentanyl--is taking lives, ruining \nfamilies, and harming communities. Public safety officials are \nconfronting overdoses every single day.\n  My good friend, Manchester police chief Nick Willard, said recently: \n``I'm up to my eyes in heroin addiction.'' Unfortunately, the \nstatistics underscore Chief Willard's statement. In all of 2014, \nManchester police seized over 1,300 grams of heroin. As of just last \nmonth, Manchester police had seized over 27,000 grams of heroin in \n2015. That is nearly 26,000 more grams in just 7 months. In 2014, there \nwere over 320 fatal drug-related overdoses in New Hampshire--up from \n193 in 2013--and heroin and fentanyl were the primary drivers of nearly \n250 of those deaths. In Manchester alone--our largest city--overdose \ndeaths so far have increased 90 percent over 2014 and over 269 percent \nif we go back to 2013. That is the crisis we are facing. That is how \nmany lives are being taken by opioids, by overdosing on prescription \ndrugs and heroin, and it is devastating.\n  I worked with law enforcement when I was attorney general of New \nHampshire. I know how hard they are working on this. They are working \ntirelessly to get these drugs off the streets. But they will tell you \nthat we simply cannot arrest our way out of this problem. I have \nactually heard from law enforcement in New Hampshire that what they \nbelieve we need most to confront this public health crisis and to \nconfront the public safety issues that go with it are more prevention, \nmore treatment options, and more support for individuals in recovery.\n  We know that addiction to prescription pain medication can often \nbecome a gateway to heroin abuse. Unfortunately, right now the price of \nheroin on the streets has gotten so cheap that people are often going \nfrom prescription drug addiction to heroin addiction because of the \nprice and the high and the way they feel. It is so tragic. According to \na study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, approximately 4 out of every 5 new heroin users \npreviously used nonmedical prescription opioids before using heroin.\n  I wish to briefly mention two pieces of legislation that I believe \nrepresent critical steps in the right direction.\n  In February I helped reintroduce the bipartisan Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, who \nis in this Chamber, as well for his important work on this legislation. \nThis legislation would expand opioid prevention and education efforts \nand expand the availability of naloxone to first responders and law \nenforcement. It would also support additional resources to identify and \ntreat incarcerated individuals suffering from substance abuse disorder \nand encourage prevention by expanding drug take-back sites to promote \nthe safe disposal of unwanted or unused prescription drugs, \nstrengthening prescription drug monitoring programs, and launching a \nprescription opioid and heroin treatment and intervention program.\n  This summer I had the privilege of doing a ride-along with the \nManchester fire department. Within half an hour of being at the fire \ndepartment, we were called to a heroin overdose. I watched the first \nresponders give Narcan to a young man who was on the ground who I \nthought was going to die, and he came right back. But what I noticed\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\nwas that in that room in a corner was an infant--an infant child whom \nthe firefighter gave to another young woman in the room. Think about \nthe impact of that. What chance does that child have when her father is \non the floor, is not getting treatment, and is getting back in this \ncycle?\n  Often what I hear from our first responders is that when they save \nsomeone's life using a drug such as Narcan, they see the same people \nagain because they are not getting the treatment they need to get the \nrecovery they need from this horrible addiction they have.\n  Earlier this year I also reintroduced the Heroin and Prescription \nOpioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act with Senator \nJoe Donnelly of Indiana. This bipartisan bill would reauthorize \nprograms related to prescription drug monitoring programs that are \nhelpful to our physicians so they can get good information when they \nare prescribing pain medication; grants for local law enforcement; and \nestablishing an interagency task force to develop best practices in \nprescribing pain medication.\n  The headlines we are seeing in New Hampshire every day in our local \nnewspapers underscore the sad reality of this problem. Here are some we \nhave seen in recent weeks:\n  The Union Leader: ``Mom, dad overdose on heroin while bathing \nchild.''\n  The Nashua Telegraph in May: ``Nine die from drug overdoses in Nashua \nso far this year, including three in one weekend.'' Nashua is where I \nwas born and where I lived.\n  The Telegraph on May 14: ``Toddler left in care of men, one of whom \ndied of an overdose.''\n  There was more on that same day: ``Hampton man on heroin causes 5-car \ncrash.''\n  May 29: ``Ossipee mom accused of selling heroin with 2 kids in the \ncar.''\n  These news stories mirror the heartbreaking personal stories of loss \nI have been hearing about from families in our State. I want to share a \ncouple of these stories.\n  Recently, I met with the family of Courtney Griffin, a 20-year-old \nyoung woman from Newton, NH. Tragically, Courtney lost her life to a \nheroin overdose last September. I was very moved by her family's story.\n  Courtney aspired to join the Marine Corps and had already attended \nboot camp. She was a charter member of the Kingston Lions Club. She \nplayed the French horn in high school and was a member of the tennis \nclub.\n  During high school, Courtney started hanging out with a different \ncrowd, and at some point the Griffins' prescription medication in their \ncabinet started disappearing. After Courtney graduated from high \nschool, her addiction grew worse. She was stealing from her father's \nbusiness and from her family in a desperate attempt to feed her \naddiction.\n  Courtney entered drug treatment, but she relapsed. When she finally \nadmitted she had a problem, she tried to seek treatment but was denied \ncoverage because the Griffins' insurance company said it wasn't a life-\nor-death situation. With some help from local law enforcement, Courtney \nwas finally able to find a place to receive treatment. Tragically, she \ndied of a heroin overdose about a week before she was set to begin \ntreatment.\n  Her father Doug is doing everything he can to turn Courtney's story \nof tragedy into a cautionary tale so that he can save other families \nfrom what his family has been through.\n  Doug and others like him have a perspective on this crisis that is \nimpossible for anyone who has not personally experienced a loss like \nthis to understand. I admire his courage in sharing the story of his \nfamily so that he can save other families' lives.\n  Unfortunately, this story is all too common. In April, Molly Parks, a \nwaitress at Portland Pie Company in Manchester, lost her life to a \nheroin overdose while she was at work. Her father is also speaking out \nto warn other families of the dangers of drug addiction.\n  I want to share as a final point one story that really moved me on \nMemorial Day. That story came from Keith Howard. He served our country \nwith distinction. I know him personally. When he returned home from his \nenlistment, he struggled with alcohol and heroin abuse and he became \nhomeless. Unfortunately, we hear too many of these stories about our \nveterans, what they are carrying with them, the wounds from war, and \nthey become addicted to drugs and alcohol. Keith was one of those \nindividuals who served our country and who became addicted. Today Keith \nis sober, and he helps run Liberty House in Manchester, NH, which \nprovides sober housing for American veterans transitioning out of \nhomelessness and helps our homeless veterans. Keith has dedicated his \nlife to this.\n  On Memorial Day--on that important day on which we honor those who \nhave sacrificed so much and made the ultimate sacrifice for our \nfreedom--he shared stories with us of veterans who have come to Liberty \nHouse and turned their lives around, but he also shared stories of \nothers who came but could not overcome their addiction, eventually \ncosting them their homes, their families, and in some cases their \nlives.\n  Keith and Liberty House are doing incredibly important work for \nveterans in Manchester, but he believes there is more to be done. On \nMemorial Day of this year when we were honoring those servicemembers \nwho gave their lives in service to our country, Keith reminded us of \nsomething else when he told a crowd at Veteran's Park in Manchester--\nand you could have heard a pin drop when he said this: ``Let us honor \nour dead by creating hope for our living.'' He is absolutely right.\n  It is clear to me that we need to work together. This is a bipartisan \nissue. This is a public health crisis. This is about the quality of \nlife in our country. This is a problem on which we need to work \ntogether at the local, State, and Federal level in partnership to \nidentify effective strategies to help save lives and take back our \ncommunities.\n  For my part, I will remain committed to fighting against this public \nhealth epidemic and taking it up at its roots to make sure for our \nchildren that this addiction and heroin--that we get it off our streets \nbut that we get help for those who are addicted and that they \nunderstand they shouldn't feel the stigma I know many of them do, that \nwe want them to come forward, we want to help them, and we understand \nthis is incredibly difficult. We want them to know we stand with them \nso they can get the help and the treatment they need to lead productive \nlives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Hampshire \nleaves the floor, I wish to thank her for her work on the comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act. She has been a very good partner in that \neffort. I know her home State, like Rhode Island, is suffering an \nextraordinary wave of opioid addiction and opioid fatalities. I know \nshe is also working hard to make sure we get a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee under present leadership. I am getting good signals on that. \nI hope we can pin that down before too long. I think this is a very \nimportant issue for us to get a hearing on, and I think it is one that \nall of the Presidential candidates are seeing. It is one so many of us \nsee in our home States.\n  One of the smallest towns in Rhode Island is a little town called \nBurrillville. It is a beautiful place. It is in the northern rural area \nof our State. People laugh when I say ``the rural area of Rhode \nIsland,'' but we really do have them. Burrillville is a very bucolic \narea, and there are very wonderful people there.\n  In the first quarter of this year, in little Burrillville, six people \nlost their lives to overdose. When I went to the Burrillville High \nSchool to do an event there about this bill and to listen and get ideas \nfor our legislation, there were three recovering folks who came to talk \nabout their situation. Like so many folks in recovery, they were \nunbelievably inspiring and noble in the way they discussed it. All \nthree of them had gone to Burrillville High School.\n  It is a real problem, and I appreciate very much the leadership of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, this is actually the time of the week for me to \ndeliver my 109th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. I find it a little bit \nfrustrating these days because climate change used to be a bipartisan \nissue. Over and over again, we\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\nhad bipartisan, serious climate change bills. In fact, the first big \nclimate change bill in the EPW Committee was Warner-Lieberman--John \nWarner, Republican of Virginia, and Joe Lieberman, Democrat of \nConnecticut. But then came Citizens United and all that dark money \nbegan to flow, all that fossil fuel money began to flow, all that Koch \nbrothers money began to flow. Now, even as the evidence of climate \nchange deepens to irrefutability, it is hard to find a Republican in \nCongress who will do anything. Here is the formula: Duck the question, \ndeny the evidence, and disparage the scientists. Duck, deny, and \ndisparage. That is some strategy for an issue which so many people take \nseriously.\n  As Congress sleepwalks through history, the warnings are painfully \nclear. Carbon pollution piles up in the atmosphere. Temperatures are \nrising. Weather worsens at the extremes. The oceans rise, warm, and \nacidify. These are all measurements. This isn't theory. The \nmeasurements confirm what the science has always told us about dumping \nso much excess carbon into oceans and atmosphere.\n  So hurray for the President's Clean Power Plan. For the first time, \nwe have a national effort to reduce carbon pollution from powerplants, \nwhich are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions. This plan is \nbig. This plan is good. And this plan is urgently needed. I \ncongratulate the President, I congratulate Administrator McCarthy, and \nI congratulate the good and public-spirited people of the EPA and other \nFederal agencies who worked hard to listen and make this plan final.\n  Of course, we will still have the usual complaining from all of the \nusual suspects. The Senate majority leader, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, opposes any serious conversation about climate change. In \nfact, he is ready to lead his modern version of massive resistance \nagainst the Federal Clean Power Plan. The Republican leader has written \nto Governors urging defiance of the EPA regulations, calling them \n``extremely burdensome and costly,'' which would be a more credible \nconclusion had he not reached it months before the regulations were \neven finalized.\n  Actually, if we want to get into the actual world here, a report just \nout from that famous liberal, Socialist bastion Georgia Tech found that \nthe clean power rule could be enacted in a very cost-effective manner \nand could lower folks' energy bills in the long term. But let's not let \nthe facts get in the way when there are fossil fuel interests to be \nplacated.\n  As the Washington Post reported, folks expect to comply with the \nClean Power Plan with relatively little effort, even in Kentucky. ``We \ncan meet it'' is what Dr. Leonard Peters, Kentucky's energy and \nenvironment secretary, has to say about the Clean Power Plan. ``We can \nmeet it.'' In fact, Dr. Peters praised the EPA for working with States \nlike his to build this rule. ``The outreach they've done, I think, is \nincredible,'' he said. EPA had an ``open door policy. You could call \nthem, talk to them, meet with them.'' The Kentucky experience was \nechoed around the country, as EPA listened closely to the concerns of \nutilities, regulators, experts, and citizens. They have made big \nadjustments to accommodate the concerns of stakeholders in the States.\n  When the usual complaining comes from the usual suspects, please ask \nthem: What is your plan? How would you do a better job of addressing \nthe carbon emissions that are polluting our atmosphere and oceans? What \nis your alternative?\n  Spoiler alert: You will look far and wide before finding a Republican \nplan. Don't look here. Don't look in the Senate. Republicans in the \nSenate have exactly zero legislation for addressing carbon pollution in \nany serious way. None. Zip. Nada. Duck, deny, and disparage is all they \nhave. Don't look at their Presidential candidates. In recent weeks I \nhave used these weekly climate speeches to look at Republican \nPresidential candidates' views on climate change. It is pathetic. There \nis nothing. What are we up to--87 Republican Presidential candidates? \nAnd not one has a climate change plan. OK, I was exaggerating about the \n87.\n  Florida, ground zero for sea level rise, two Republican Presidential \ncandidates, and what do the two of them have? Nothing. Republican \nmayors from Florida, State universities in Florida, the Army Corps \noffice in Florida--nothing gets through to the candidates. Duck, deny, \ndisparage is all they have.\n  The Wisconsin Presidential candidate ignores his own home State \nuniversity, his own State newspapers, and his own State scientists. But \nGovernor Walker can actually top duck, deny, and disparage. His \nresponse to climate change? Use your budget to fire the scientists at \nthe State environmental protection agency.\n  How about our Presidential candidate, the junior Senator from \nKentucky? What do we hear from him? He has said that the EPA rules are \nillegal, and he has predicted that they will result in power \nshortages--no lights and no heat. But does he have an alternative he \nwould prefer? No. He has nothing, and, like all the other got-nothing \nRepublican Presidential candidates, he is out of step with his own home \nState.\n  Kentucky isn't just easily able to comply with the Clean Power Plan; \nagencies and officials all across Kentucky are working seriously on \nclimate change.\n  By the way, here is a look at why compliance is easy in Kentucky: \nKentucky's fuel mix, which this charts, is a wall of coal. As the song \nsays, the Sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home, but good luck \nfinding any solar in there. You will need a magnifying glass to find \nthis tiny little green line at the top that is barely visible that is \nsolar and wind combined. I mean, really? Iowa can get to 30 percent \nwind. Iowa has two Republican Senators. It is not impossible. In \nKentucky, they haven't even tried.\n  Kentucky's cities--Lexington, Louisville, Frankfurt, Bowling Green, \nand Villa Hills--get it. They have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate \nProtection Agreement in order to--quoting officials from Lexington--\n``act locally to reduce the impacts of climate change by lowering \n(manmade) greenhouse gas emissions.''\n\n  The hills of Kentucky are some distance from the shores of Rhode \nIsland and the shores of New Hampshire as well. Living by the sea, I \nhave to worry about climate change and what it is doing to our oceans \nand coasts. Kentucky is landlocked. So imagine my surprise to read the \nKentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources warning about sea \nlevel rise. I will quote them.\n\n       With the predicted increases in severity of hurricanes and \n     tropical storms, coupled with potential shoreline losses in \n     Florida and throughout the eastern seaboard, people may begin \n     migrations inland. If and when these events occur, Kentucky \n     may experience human population growth unprecedented to the \n     Commonwealth.\n\n  So I say to our candidate from Kentucky, the junior Senator, and our \nmajority leader, the senior Senator, with Kentucky, their home State, \nprojecting that people on the coasts will be hit so hard by climate \nchange that we may have to flee inland to landlocked Kentucky, I hope \nthe Senators from Kentucky will understand my persistence on this issue \nwhen their own State thinks that my citizens might have to flee to \nKentucky to get away from this threat.\n  Kentucky is renowned for its horses. So I turned to Horse & Rider \nmagazine and found a great article on ``how climate change might affect \nour horses' health.'' Horse & Rider's expert was none other than Dr. \nCraig Carter of the University of Kentucky. He had specific concerns in \nthe article for equine health, but he also offered us this general \nreminder:\n\n       It's not just horses (and people) at risk: crops are being \n     affected, as are trees, due to beetle infestations. Climate \n     change affects all forms of life.\n\n  That is from Dr. Carter of the University of Kentucky.\n  Kentucky Woodlands Magazine reports that ``the world is changing \nright before our eyes. . . . [O]ur natural systems are changing as a \nresult of a warming climate.'' The magazine even warns that ``climate \nchange is happening as you read this article.''\n  Meanwhile the Senators from Kentucky are not sure why that may be. \nThe junior Senator has said that he is not sure anybody knows exactly \nwhy all of this climate change is happening. The majority leader \ninvokes that climate denial classic: I am not a scientist. Well--and I \nsay this thankfully--the scientists are here to help, including \nKentucky scientists.\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\n  At Kentucky's universities, the science seems pretty clear about \nexactly why all of this climate change is happening. Dr. Paul Vincelli \nis a professor at the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension \nService. He says:\n\n       In the scientific community, it is widely accepted that the \n     global climate is changing and that human activities which \n     produce greenhouse gases are a principal cause. Greenhouse \n     gases have a strong capacity to trap heat in the lower \n     atmosphere, even though they are present at trace \n     concentrations.\n\n  Elsewhere, Professor Vincelli and his University of Kentucky \ncolleagues write:\n\n       Scientific evidence that our global climate is warming is \n     abundant. . . . Practicing scientists consider the evidence \n     of human-induced global warming to be extremely strong.\n\n  The University of Kentucky is not the only place. Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity offers concentrations in environmental sustainability and \nstewardship, including courses on global climate change. Northern \nKentucky University signed the American College and University \nPresidents' Climate Commitment, pledging Northern Kentucky University \nto ``an initiative in pursuit of climate neutrality.''\n  At the University of Louisville, Professor Keith Mountain is the \nchair of the department of geography and geosciences. He has lectured \nabout ``how climate change is a measurable reality and how people have \ncontributed to the trends.''\n  Despite all of the experts in Kentucky saying that human-caused \nclimate change is real, despite the harms that State and local \nofficials foresee for Kentucky and the rest of the country, and despite \nthe easy steps being taken in Kentucky to comply with the President's \nClean Power Plan, the Senators from Kentucky have no plan--nothing. \nThey are part of the ``duck, deny, and disparage'' caucus.\n  And the Presidential candidates? There is almost nothing they won't \nmake up to try to jam a sick in the wheels of progress--imaginary wars \non coal when it is really coal's war on us, imaginary cost increases \nthat have been completely debunked by actual experience, imaginary \nreliability failures when the real reliability problem is already \nhappening around us thanks to climate-driven extreme weather. On and on \nthey go. Yet they offer no alternative. Republicans simply have no plan \nother than a shrug.\n  Why do they have no climate plan? Why do they present nothing by way \nof limits to carbon pollution? Here is a clue: Look where the money \ncomes from. It comes from fossil fuel billionaires and fossil fuel \ninterests. Look at the beauty pageant hosted this weekend by the Koch \nbrothers in Dana Point, CA, where Republican Presidential candidates \nwent to display their wares to the big donors.\n  Do you think the Koch brothers want to hear about climate change? \nHere is another clue: Americans for Prosperity, part of the Koch \nbrothers' big-money political organization, has openly warned that any \nclient who crosses them on climate change will be ``at a severe \ndisadvantage''--subtle as a brick from an outfit threatening to spend \npart of the $889 million total that the Koch brothers have budgeted for \nthis election. And yes, $889 million in one election is big money. \n``For that kind of money, you could buy yourself a president,'' said \nMark McKinnon, a Republican and former George W. Bush strategist and a \ngood Texan. ``Oh, right,'' he continued, ``that's the point.''\n  Even the Donald called the Republicans out on this one, calling the \nKoch brothers' California event a ``beg-a-thon,'' and saying: ``I wish \ngood luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to \nCalifornia to beg for money, etc., from the Koch Brothers.''\n  What a shame, to be a Presidential candidate willing to ignore your \nhome State universities, ignore your home State newspapers, ignore your \nhome State scientists--unless, of course, you are trying to fire them--\nignore your own home State farmers, foresters, and fishermen, all so \nyou can prance successfully at pageants for the big-money fossil fuel \ninterests that today control the Republican party. Duck, deny, and \ndisparage is what gets you through the beauty pageant. So duck, deny, \nand disparage it is.\n  Eventually, the Republican Party is going to have to come up with a \nplan on climate change. The American people are demanding it, \nIndependent voters, whom they will need in 2016, are demanding it. Even \nRepublican voters demand it, at least if they are young ones. And it \nreally matters that we get this right. It is the responsibility of the \nUnited States of America, as a great nation, to set an example for \nothers to follow and not just sit back and wait for others to act.\n  Failing to act on climate change would both dim the torch we hold up \nto the world and give other nations an excuse for delay. Failure, I \ncontend, when the stakes are so high becomes an argument for our \nenemies against our very model of government. How do we explain the \ninfluence of this special interest interfering with what must be done? \nThere will be no excuse when a reckoning comes to say: I really needed \nthe political support of those fossil fuel billionaires; so, sorry, \nworld.\n  President Abraham Lincoln, a native Kentuckian, warned us that ``the \ndogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.'' Before \nthe present gets too stormy, I urge my colleagues from Kentucky to heed \nthe experts in their home State, heed the local leaders in their home \nState, and wake up to what needs to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I came to the floor expecting to hear my \nfriend and colleague talk about the bill that we are trying to get on, \nwhich is the cyber security bill, but again, I hear him returning to \nhis favorite topic, which is climate change. I know he thinks that is \nthe most important subject that we could possibly discuss on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I will just say--and I certainly don't purport to be the expert he \nis--that when you look at the President's proposed new rules with \nregard to electricity generation, it looks to me like it is all pain \nand no gain. The experts, perhaps that he has referred to, said that \nCO2 reductions would actually be less than one-half of 1 \npercent, and, of course, energy prices on low-income individuals, \nseniors, and people on fixed income would go up--people who have \nalready been suffering through flat wages and slow wage growth for a \nlong time. Of course, in this economy, which grew last year at the rate \nof 2.2 percent, it would be a further wet blanket on economic growth \nand job creation.\n  The Senator and I have worked together closely on a number of issues, \nand I enjoy his company, his intellect, and his energy, but I would say \nhe is all wrong on this one. It sounds to me like so many of our \ncolleagues sound like Chicken Little: The sky is falling, the sky is \nfalling. Well, I don't think the facts justify it.\n  There are more important things we can do today and this week--for \nexample, to pass a cyber security bill.\n\n\n                           Work in the Senate\n\n  But first, I want to take a minute to consider what we have done this \nyear under the new leadership. I know some like to focus on things that \nwe haven't done, but I assure my colleague that we are just getting \nstarted, and there is a lot of important work that remains to be done. \nLast November the American people elected a new majority in the Senate, \nand I believe they elected us to represent their interests, to flesh \nout legislation, and to get this Senate back to work. We were elected \nto run the government and get things done; that is, of course, in a way \nthat is consistent with our principles.\n  I even heard some people suggest that working with folks on the other \nside of the aisle in a bipartisan way is wrong, that we shouldn't do \nanything with Democrats on the Republican side or that Democrats \nshouldn't do anything with Republicans. That is a completely warped \nperspective.\n\n  I think the better perspective is that expressed by one of our \nconservative colleagues whom I asked when I got to the Senate: How is \nit that you work so productively in an important Senate committee with \nSenator Teddy Kennedy, the liberal lion of the Senate? This question \nwas asked to one of the most conservative Members of the U.S. Senate. \nHow can a conservative Senator and a liberal Senator work together \nproductively to the best interests of their constituents and the \nAmerican people? And he said: It is easy. It is the 80-20 rule. Let's \nfind the\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n80 percent we can agree on, and the 20 percent we can't we will leave \nfor another fight on another day. I believe we have been applying for \nthe benefit of the American people the 80-20 rule, trying to find those \nthings we can agree on, and we have been making substantial progress.\n  Since January we have delivered real results, proving that our back-\nto-work model was not just another empty campaign promise. Early this \nsummer we passed the important trade bill, legislation that will help \nAmerican goods get to global markets. Then we passed the Defense \nauthorization bill, a bill that provides our men and women in uniform \nthe resources and authority they need to keep us safe in an ever more \ndangerous world. We passed an important education bill, the Every Child \nAchieves Act, legislation that would actually do what my constituents \nin Texas want us to do, which is send more of the authority from \nWashington back into the hands of our parents, teachers, and local \ncommunities and out of the Department of Education here in Washington, \nDC. Just last week we passed the 3-year highway bill. Actually, it is a \n6-year highway bill. We were able to come up with funding for the first \n3 years and left open for us work to be done to come up with additional \nfunding working with our colleagues in the House. Transportation \ninfrastructure is something that supports our States and local \ncommunities and allows them to prepare for the growing infrastructure \nneeds in the future while keeping commerce rolling, public safety \nprotected, and protecting our environment.\n  Of course, we all know that we are just getting started. We have been \nhere in the new Congress for 7 months. We are now on another important \nbill requiring every Senator's full and immediate attention. The Cyber \nSecurity Information Sharing Act is legislation that is long overdue. \nIf it sounds familiar, it is for a good reason because we actually \ntried to pass this earlier this summer before it was blocked by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. This legislation would provide \nfor greater information sharing by people who have been subjected to \nhacks and would address the rampant and growing cyber threats facing \nour country.\n  One of the things that is so dangerous now is when a private company \nor an individual is hacked, they can't actually share that information \nthrough a central portal with other people to protect them if they \nhaven't yet been hacked themselves. Of course, there are all sorts of \nconcerns about liability and the like, but we need to address this to \nhelp the Nation deter future cyber attacks and to help the public and \nprivate sector act more nimbly and effectively when attacks are \ndetected.\n  As I said, we had a chance to vote on this in June as an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill. Unfortunately, this was about the time \nthat some on the other side--I think most notably the next Democratic \nleader--announced something they called the filibuster summer. These \nare not exactly encouraging words when it comes to trying to work \ntogether to get things done. In spite of the real and frightening \nthreats all around us, our Democratic friends filibustered that cyber \nsecurity bill in June. We know what happened soon thereafter. The need \nfor real cyber security legislation became even more apparent.\n  Many of us recall that in June there was an initial disclosure that \nhackers had accessed sensitive background information used for security \nclearance purposes at the Office of Personnel Management. The estimate \nin June was that about 4 million people were affected--their personal \ninformation. Then on July 9, after our Democratic friends filibustered \nthe cyber security bill on the Defense authorization bill, there was a \nsecond report. This time that report informed us that more than 21 \nmillion people's private, secure information had been accessed. This \ninformation, illegally accessed, includes passport information, which \nwould show anywhere and everywhere you have traveled; Social Security \nnumbers, which are portals to all sorts of secure financial \ninformation; private information, background details, extensive \ninformation from previous places of residence. You can imagine. On a \nform you fill out in order to get a security clearance, you literally \nhave to give your whole life history. That is the kind of sensitive \ninformation that was acquired on 21 million people as announced on July \n9. Of course, it also provides the names of contact information, close \nfriends, and family members.\n  While many of these reports indicate that China, one of the worst \noffenders along with Russia when it comes to malicious cyber attacks--\nmany reports indicate China was responsible. The Obama administration \nfor some reason has been unwilling to acknowledge that or tell us who \nattacked and accessed 21 million sensitive pieces of information. Of \ncourse, they have done nothing to respond to this growing threat of \ncyber attacks.\n  The Office of Personnel Management was not the only government agency \naffected. In early June, it was also reported that the Internal Revenue \nService had similar problems and that data from more than 100,000 \ntaxpayers had been stolen--again, the kind of information that if you \nwere to disclose it about private taxpayers, it would be a felony. It \nwould be a criminal offense. This is sensitive information that has now \nbeen stolen for 100,000 taxpayers. This breach included access to past \ntax returns, sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, \naddresses, birthdays--all stolen and potentially in the hands of \ncriminals. It is exactly the kind of information that identity thieves \nwant in order to pretend they are somebody they are not in order to \nsteal your money.\n  Clearly, we don't have time to waste when it comes to cyber security \nlegislation. I would point out that the Democratic leader himself, \nsomeone who is quick to dismiss the earlier vote when we tried to do \nthis in the context of the Defense authorization bill in June, has said \nthat he is committed to getting cyber legislation done. Well, I would \nask: If not now, when?\n  This bipartisan legislation that passed the Intelligence Committee in \nthe Senate by a margin of 14 to 1 provides us another opportunity this \nweek. With cyber threats so clearly in evidence all around us, we \nshould act quickly to implement a solution. I would encourage all of \nour colleagues to try to find that 80-20 solution on this bill.\n  No one is claiming it is perfect. I already talked to the committee \nchairmen in the House who say they have some different views, but that \nis customary around here. Once the Senate passes the bill, it can be \nreconciled with the differences in the House bill in a conference \ncommittee.\n  Surely we all agree that this type of legislation and the protection \nit provides is desperately needed. As the vote in July suggests, this \nis a bill in and of itself that will be the product of a functioning \nbipartisan Senate. Let's continue our progress for the American people.\n  I would add, by way of closing, that more than 70 pieces of \nlegislation have passed the Senate since January 1, and 30 of those \nhave been signed into law. More than 160 bills have been reported out \nof committee. That is what a functioning Senate looks like.\n  As I said before and I will say again, even our colleagues who are in \nthe minority must enjoy getting to do what they were elected to do, \nwhich is to come here and cast a vote on behalf of their constituents \non important issues that the Senate is addressing. I hope we can get \nthis legislation passed this week.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, yesterday Republicans in the Senate put \nforward legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. Unfortunately, this \nbill was a clear partisan attack on access to health care for women, \nand especially women in rural and underserved areas.\n  One in five American women have relied on Planned Parenthood health \ncenters at some point in their lifetime. Often, Planned Parenthood is \nthe woman's only option for basic, preventive health care, including \nprenatal care, physicals, and cancer screenings.\n  For example, take Mary, a 20-year-old student in my home State of \nMichigan, who went through her campus health center when she found a \nlump on her breast. They told her it was nothing and not to worry. When \nshe visited Planned Parenthood a year\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n\nlater for an unrelated matter, the clinician expressed concern that the \nlump was still there. Through Planned Parenthood she got referred to a \nprogram for low-income women with breast cancer, and she received the \ntreatment that she needed. Today, Mary is thankfully cancer free. \nPlanned Parenthood provides upward of a half million breast cancer \nexams every year and can save the lives of women just like Mary across \nthe Nation.\n  Planned Parenthood also provides about 400,000 potentially lifesaving \ncervical cancer screenings annually. Katie, another young woman from \nMichigan, went in for her annual exam at a Michigan Planned Parenthood \ncenter. Her exam revealed that she had cervical cancer, and Planned \nParenthood helped her weigh options to cover the biopsy and subsequent \nsurgery. Today she, too, is thankfully cancer free.\n  The doctors and nurses at these facilities provide affordable, \npotentially lifesaving health care to 2.7 million people per year. \nMichigan has 21 Planned Parenthood health centers, 11 of which are \nlocated in rural or medically underserved areas. These numbers mirror \nnational numbers, with over half of their 700 health care centers \nlocated in areas with limited access to medical care. Federal funding \nfor Planned Parenthood supports access to treatment at these health \ncenters for women like Mary and Katie in States all across this \ncountry.\n  Let's be clear. Federal funding for Planned Parenthood or any other \norganization is not used for abortion. Let me say this again because it \nis a very important fact. Federal funding for Planned Parenthood or any \nother organization is not used for abortion. This has been settled \nFederal law for decades.\n  Despite this fact, we have seen the adoption of extreme measures that \nrestrict a woman's fundamental right to make her own decisions about \nher reproductive health, including in Michigan. A woman should have \naccess to reproductive health services and the freedom to make her own \ndecisions about her health care, and I will fight to protect this right \neach and every day that I serve here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Yesterday evening I voted to stop the Senate from moving forward with \nlegislation to defund Planned Parenthood. This bill would have \njeopardized access to health care for 2.7 million men and women who \nrely on Planned Parenthood for their health care needs. While I am \npleased that the Senate did not move forward with the bill, it is clear \nthat we have not seen the end of these types of partisan attacks on \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  I urge my colleagues to move away from efforts to restrict access to \nhealth care and, instead, focus on crafting bipartisan agreements to \nfund our government, provide certainty to American employers and \nworkers, support small businesses, and grow our middle class.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 1922, \nS. 1923, and S. 1929 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Clean Power Plan\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncommending President Obama for putting forth his Clean Power Plan.\n  Theodore Roosevelt said:\n\n       Of all the questions which can come before this nation, \n     short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great \n     war, there is none which compares in importance with the \n     great central task of leaving this land even a better land \n     for our descendents than it is for us.\n\n  I think it captured very well the challenge we face with carbon \npollution and global warming because we are facing that great central \ntask of leaving this land better for our descendents than it is for us.\n  We are facing a situation in which there is an accelerating quantity \nof carbon dioxide pollution in the atmosphere, and it is having a \nprofound impact on, basically, the temperature of our planet. If we \nsimply look at the carbon pollution itself, scientists have said that \nwe are in trouble if it rises over 350 parts per million. Well, here we \nare with pollution that last year hit 400 parts per million. So we are \nabove the danger zone. We are going deeper into the danger zone--let me \nput it that way--and that is not where we need to be.\n  Furthermore, we are accelerating the rate at which we are polluting \nthe planet with carbon dioxide. It was just a few decades ago that the \nrate of carbon pollution was increasing by about 1 part per million per \nyear, and now it is increasing by something closer to 2 parts per \nmillion per year. So where we need to be decreasing the overall \npollution, bringing it down, we are increasing it and increasing the \nrate at which we are polluting, and that is a very bad place for \nhumankind to be on this planet.\n  There is incontrovertible evidence of how quickly the planet is \nwarming. We have, by scientific record--14 of the warmest 15 years in \nrecorded history have occurred in the last 15 years. So 14 of the 15 \nwarmest years over the centuries of measurement have all occurred in \nthe last 15 years. That is not just one little warm spell on some \nlittle piece of land; that is a global temperature.\n  As carbon pollution is increasing, we see the global temperature \nincreasing, and it is reverberating all across the planet. We see \ndramatic changes in the Arctic. The rate of warming in the Arctic is \nroughly four times the rate of warming in more moderate latitudes. So \nwe are seeing an incredible decrease in the ice, huge changes that are \ncoming so quickly, it is very hard for animals to adapt. Of course, \npeople are well aware of the crisis the polar bears are facing, but \nthat is just one particular visible species as an indicator of the \nchallenges that are going on.\n  We are seeing the feedback mechanisms in the polar zone. We are \nseeing the open waters where ice is not reflecting the sunlight back \nup. More water is absorbing more sunlight, and that is creating an \naccelerated heating impact. We are seeing that as thawing occurs in the \npermafrost, we have these situations with what are called drunken \nforests, where the trees that all stood straight are now staggering in \none direction or the other as they lean slightly, as the ground \nunderneath them that was frozen is melting. As it starts to melt, it \nwill start to release methane gas, which is a very potent global \nwarming gas. So that is another feedback mechanism we should all be \nconcerned about.\n  Let's take my home State of Oregon, and I think one could do this \ntype of checkup, if you will, on any State in the Union. In my home \nState, we had a very severe series of droughts in the Klamath Basin, \nwhich is a major agricultural basin. We have had the three worst ever \ndroughts in a period of 15 years. It corresponds with the period of the \nwarmest years on planet Earth in recorded history. And that has a huge \nimpact on our farming industry. So if you care about farmers, you \nshould care about global warming.\n  Then we had a big challenge with our forests because as these summers \nare becoming dryer and as the types of storms we have are producing \nmore lightning strikes, we are having a lot more forest fires. The fire \nseason is getting longer and more devastating. Far more acres are being \nburned. Over several decades, the fire season has increased by several \nweeks in length, and the amount of acres burning each summer, on \naverage, is increasing. So if\n\n[[Page S6281]]\n\nyou care about timber, if you care about forests, then you should care \nabout global warming.\n  Another impact of this changing pattern is that we are getting very \nlittle snowfall in the Cascades. Just as Glacier Park is now becoming \nthe park of disappearing glaciers--you have to look very hard to find \nany glaciers left in Glacier Park--the Cascades also--a different \nmountain range--are losing their snowpack. In fact, we have virtually \nno snowpack now feeding the mountain streams that come down. So if you \nare a fisherman, you are looking at smaller and warmer streams, which \nis very unhealthy for fish.\n\n  That is not all. Right now we have sockeye coming up the Columbia \nRiver and getting to the Snake River, and they are dying because the \ntemperature of the river is too warm for them to continue upriver to \nspawn. Some estimates that I have seen in the last week are that as \nmany as 80 percent of the sockeye now returning are dying in the \nColumbia River before they make it to the Snake River. So if you care \nabout fishing, you should care about global warming.\n  Then we look at our coastal shellfish and we discover that we have a \nsignificant problem with our oysters. Oregon produces a lot of oyster \nseed. Those are the baby oysters that get distributed to oyster \nfishermen. There is a similar process going on in Washington State at \nanother hatchery. The challenge for the hatcheries is that the water \nthat is pumped out of the ocean to produce the baby oysters, get them \ngoing, is becoming too acidic. This also is about global warming \nbecause the higher rates of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are being \nabsorbed by the ocean, and that creates carbonic acid. It has been \nenough that there is a 30-percent increase in the acidity of the ocean, \nand that is causing a big problem with baby oysters as far as forming \nshells. So if you care about the seafood industry, you should care \nabout global warming.\n  When we talk about the issue of global warming, we are not talking \nabout computer models and things that are 50 years into the future; we \nare talking about real-life effects seen on the ground right now, \nthings that are having a big impact on our seafood, a big impact on our \nfishing, a big impact on our farming, and a big impact on our forestry. \nIf you care about rural America's resource-driven economies across this \ncountry, you should care about global warming.\n  As a nation, it is incumbent on us to take on this challenge. We are \nthe first generation--as has been said by others--to feel the impact of \nglobal warming and the last generation that can do something about it. \nIt is incumbent on us, the Senators in this Chamber, the U.S. Senate, \nto take on this issue. It is incumbent on the Presidents and the \nexecutive teams they put together to take this on in partnership with \nthe rest of the world because this is absolutely a tragedy of the \ncommons.\n  Very clearly, if the United States takes some action to reduce our \ncarbon dioxide or to reduce our methane production, it will have a \nmodest impact but not enough. Nations across the planet have to act, \nand they will act more or less as a community because very few nations \nare going to say they will act alone knowing they won't have a big \nenough impact unless nations join together. So it is up to our \nleadership role in the world that we act actively, aggressively, and \nreach out with other nations to partner.\n  Earlier this year there was an agreement struck with China. China is \ngoing to produce as much renewable energy from electricity by 2030 as \nall the electricity we currently produce in the United States. I am not \njust talking about our renewable energy. If you take the U.S. renewable \nenergy, our nuclear energy, our energy produced from gas-fired plants, \nour electricity produced from coal-fired plants, and you add it all \ntogether, that is the amount of electricity China is going to produce \nwith just renewable energy between now and 2030. They are taking on a \nmassive commitment to renewable energy. They wouldn't be doing it if \nthe United States wasn't also responding aggressively. India is \nstarting to become interested in doing their share, seeing that other \nnations are stepping up.\n  The United States should never be sitting on its hands and saying: We \nwill wait for everybody else to act--not when there is an issue that \nthreatens the success of the next generation of humans on this planet \nand the generation after and the generation after.\n  I said earlier that not only are we the first generation to feel the \nimpact of global warming, but we are the last generation that can do \nsomething about it. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that the \nfurther you get into global warming, the further you get into carbon \npollution, methane pollution, and more feedback mechanisms, the harder \nit is to stop. There is momentum that builds behind the warming of the \nplanet. It becomes much harder to take it on. That is why we need to \nact decisively now.\n  So the Clean Power Plan the President launched, put forward \nyesterday, is responding to the moral demand of this generation to take \non carbon pollution. It is doing so in a most cost-effective fashion, a \nfashion that will create jobs in the United States, a fashion that will \nreduce deaths in the United States.\n  Let me give an example of the health benefits. It will avoid up to \n3,600 premature deaths, lead to 90,000 fewer asthma attacks in \nchildren, and prevent 300,000 missed workdays and schooldays. That is \nincredible. It will save the average family nearly $85 in their annual \nenergy bill by the year 2030. So that is powerful.\n  In addition, we are going to create jobs in this fashion. It has the \ntremendous impact of putting people to work--tens of thousands to work, \ndriving new investments in cleaner, more modern, and efficient \nrenewable energy technologies.\n  I close by turning back to President Theodore Roosevelt, who said \nthere is no more important mission than ``leaving this land even a \nbetter land for our descendants than it is for us.''\n  There are individuals who will come to this floor and they will say: \nLet's act someday but not now. Let's do it when it will not have an \nimpact on jobs. Well, this will actually create jobs right now. Let's \ndo it when it will cost less. Well, it never costs less if the problem \ngets bigger. It costs less to invest now. Let's pass it on to the next \ngeneration. They will solve it. That is morally irresponsible.\n  Every State is feeling the direct impact. Every rural community, \ntimber community, fishing community, shellfish community, and farming \ncommunity is feeling the impact today of our failure to address this \nyesterday. Our children, our children's children, and our children's \nchildren's children are counting on us in the Senate to act \naggressively, to support a strong plan to take on carbon pollution--a \nstrong Clean Power Plan. So let's do so.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I come from an energy State--Oklahoma. \nWe truly do all of the above. We have coal, oil, gas, wind, solar, \nhydro, geothermal, and we are just missing nuclear. Quite frankly, we \nprobably would have nuclear if the regulations weren't so incredibly \nhigh and so incredibly expensive to do. In my State and in my region, \nwe want diverse, inexpensive, healthy, plentiful, and reliable energy. \nWe don't think that should be such a high goal that it is only limited \nto Oklahoma. Quite frankly, I think just about every area of the \ncountry wants that.\n  In fact, that used to be a bipartisan goal. It used to be that \nDemocrats also supported ``all of the above'' energy. At some point, \nthey shifted to the ways of Solyndra and determined if you want to be \nin that party, you have to commit to a certain environmental orthodoxy. \nIt makes it a tougher conversation to have about real energy policy \nbased around facts.\n  It is another day. It seems to be another day for the EPA to release \nmassive new regulations. People wonder why their paycheck doesn't go as \nfar nowadays, why food costs more, why products cost more, and why \nenergy costs more. I can tell you why. It is this ever-growing \nregulation on the basic cost of energy. It changes the cost of \neverything.\n  The EPA stated they are not responsible for determining the benefits \nof\n\n[[Page S6282]]\n\nclimate change, just that it would happen. As they put out their new \nClean Power Plan, they said they didn't have to actually list or abide \nby the cost. They did determine the cost anyway--$8.4 billion a year to \nthe American consumer; $8.4 billion on top of the energy regulations \nthat already exist.\n  They also said they weren't responsible for having to be able to run \nthrough the actual effects on climate change, they just said it is \nhappening and so we need to do something. In fact, it has been \ninteresting for me to hear so many of my colleagues in the past 24 \nhours say: Republicans, put out your plan. We are doing something. You \nneed to put out a plan to show you are doing something as well.\n  We ran the numbers on it and tried to evaluate it through the EPA \nmodels and looked for somewhere where someone who ran the EPA model \nwould note how much change there would be in the environment if this \nplan is fully implemented. The model came back that it would slow the \nrise of the sea 0.3 millimeters once this is fully implemented--0.3 \nmillimeters of sea change difference. To give an example, the head of \nthis pen is 0.7 millimeters. So half the head of this pen is what we \nare going to save in sea level change if we fully implement this plan.\n  This seems to be about fear--severe weather, imminent danger. If you \ndon't change everything in your life to the way we think you should \nlive your life, the whole Earth is going to fall into chaos and ruin.\n  We need to have an energy debate on this floor. I completely agree. \nWe even need to have a climate debate on this floor, but it doesn't \nneed to be out of fear. It needs to be about the facts--what really \nneeds to happen.\n  Let's start with some basic questions about energy policy and about \nenergy future: What will it take to have reliable energy for the United \nStates during a summer heat wave so we don't have rolling blackouts and \nsenior adults suffering from heatstroke during an August afternoon?\n  What will it take to protect our grid so that doesn't occur? What \nwill it take to have reliable energy for the hardest nights of winter \nto make sure Americans are protected in those coldest nights so their \npower doesn't go out because of rolling blackouts? What energy sources \nare plentiful in the United States and what energy sources leave us \nvulnerable to international pressures? What energy sources do we have \nthat we should export to gain economic benefits and geopolitical power \nfor the United States? What energy sources are economical so we can \nattract manufacturing to the United States to create more jobs for \nAmerica? How can we ensure that the energy we use has the least amount \nof health risks so we can have a healthy nation and a healthy world? \nHow about this question. What is the best way to keep energy diversity \nand distribution to protect our economy from rapid price swings or \nlocalized acts of terrorism?\n  That is how you begin to set an energy policy, which is to ask some \ngeneral questions and then start answering some of those and asking, \nWhat is the best way to accomplish that? Instead, our energy policy is \nbeing run by environmental policy and fear of what could possibly \nhappen in the future or protecting ourselves from 0.3 millimeters of \nsea rise.\n  Over the past 10 years, CO2 emissions have drastically \nbeen reduced. Since 2005, CO2 emissions from electric \ngeneration has been reduced by 364 million metric tons to 2,051 metric \ntons. The future goal, by the way, in this new Clean Power Plan is to \nhave 788 metric tons of reduction from 2005, but we are already 364 \nmetric tons there because there has already been a pretty dramatic \nreduction, much of that from a very slow economy--so 424 more metric \ntons by 2030. That would mean, even with an ever-increasing population, \nincreasing energy needs, and hopefully a recovering economy, we need to \ncut much more.\n  Let me try to set this in context. I am going to throw around some \nnumbers for a while, but I think we as a body can handle it. Let me \ngive some perspective on where things are going on this.\n  The last time the United States emitted this target amount for \nCO2 that has now been laid out as the targeted amount was in \n1985, with 237 million people. If you want a little bit of throwback \ntime, that is when Duran Duran, Huey Lewis, and the Commodores had all \nthe big hits. That is when there were no personal computers or cell \nphones or iPads, cloud computing had never even been discussed, and \nthere weren't all the electric devices we have now. We had 237 million \npeople at the time.\n  The target is to get to that same amount of CO2 usage, but \nwe will have 363 million people at the time. That is the estimate from \nthe Census Bureau. So the plan is to have 126 million more people emit \nless carbon and use less electricity. That sounds like an interesting \nplan. If you want the real number by percentage, let me break that down \nfor you. In 1985, every 1 million people used 6.86 metric tons of \nCO2--6.86 metric for every 1 million people. Now, in 2015, \nevery 1 million people use 6.38 metric tons of CO2.\n  That means, in the past 30 years, we have reduced for each 1 million \npeople about half a ton of CO2 because of energy \nefficiencies, because of the changes in the way we do energy. We do it \nmuch cleaner now than we did it in the 1970s and 1980s. Good for us. We \nachieved a lot in 1985--a lot of changes--but we have half a ton less \nCO2 per 1 million people.\n  What the administration is proposing in their plan is that for every \n1 million people in the United States in 2030, we would use 4.48 \nmillion tons of CO2. That means, in the last 30 years, with \nthe energy efficiency movement, with everything that has been done, \nwith the remarkable shift in renewables, we have gained half a ton. The \nadministration wants us now to get 2 tons of additional amount in the \nnext 15 years.\n  Do you understand why a lot of people say this is just not rational? \nYou can't get to an acceleration that fast with that big a goal. Here \nis what happens, though. I look at the facts and the requirements and \nimmediately I am called a Neanderthal who just wants dirty air and \ndirty water. Actually, I have children, too, and I like clean air and \nclean water, but facts are very stubborn things.\n  A government mandate doesn't create reality. Remember Jimmy Carter in \n1979? He declared his policies would create an energy path so that by \nthe year 2000, 20 percent of America's energy would be produced by \nsolar power--20 percent by the year 2000. How are we doing with that? \nLess than 2 percent of our energy in 2015 is produced by solar power.\n  Mandates don't create realities. If we drastically change all our \nelectric generation to wind, solar, nuclear, and some natural gas, we \nwill hit our annual number, but the amount of decrease per year will \namount to approximately what China puts out in 1 month. You see, they \nare talking about reducing per year about 450-or-some metric tons of \nCO2 that America would put out. China emits 800 metric tons \nper month. This is why so many people say this is a very expensive goal \nfor America that will have no effect on the global reality.\n  Just to add a dose of cold water to the reality, it usually takes \nmore than 10 years for a powerplant to even get a permit and start the \nconstruction because the Department of Energy, FERC, and EPA \nrestrictions are so high. So this plan that in the next 15 years we are \ngoing to have all this rollout, we can't even get through the \npermitting time in that time period.\n  I haven't even touched on the legal issues of the new mandates of the \nadministration. They haven't been in front of the American people or in \nfront of the Congress. The existing law--the Clean Air Act--does not \nallow EPA to add another layer of regulations on top of the existing \nregulations. That is clear in the law. You cannot do that. Even the \nformer Sierra Club general counsel, David Bookbinder, found this new \nproposal is based on what he called a ``legally dubious ground.''\n  As a nation, we don't need more pie-in-the-sky energy ideas. We need \nreal solutions and a right direction that will benefit the United \nStates and the world. We lead the world in power and ideas. We should \nset high goals. But our goals should help us as a nation, not hurt us. \nEvery American pays more at the pump right now because of the \nincreasing regulations in the ethanol mandates. Every American is \npaying more for gasoline than we should. Every American is paying more \nfor electricity than we should because of\n\n[[Page S6283]]\n\nthe cost of all these mandates. People ask me all the time why their \ndollars don't go as far; the regulations are the reason.\n\n  Many people want to talk about our energy future--great, so do I. But \nI also want to talk about our energy present. The goal of a quarter of \nAmerica's electricity produced by renewables is a good goal. It is a \nhuge jump. We are just at around 5 percent right now in renewables. But \nthat will still leave us--even if that goal is accomplished--with 75 \npercent of our energy coming from coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear. \nThat is base power. It is not effective at night or on hot still days \nin the summer when the wind doesn't blow. It is base power.\n  Solar is more efficient than ever. Let's keep going. It is a good \nthing. I am glad we are able to harness some of that. It takes a \nmassive amount of acreage. There is a new solar facility that just came \ninto Oklahoma. Great, we are glad to have it. It has 15 acres of \nsolar--15 acres of panels. It powers two neighborhoods--two \nneighborhoods--and it takes 15 acres to get that accomplished.\n  Windmills are much more efficient right now than they have ever been. \nIn fact, they are efficient enough that we should probably stop \nsubsidizing them. They are not a startup anymore. We started \nsubsidizing utility-grade windmills more than 20 years ago, saying \nsomeday this thing is going to be efficient enough that it is going to \nwork. I think we are already there. In fact, there are more than 48,000 \nutility-scale wind turbines in the country right now--48,000 windmills \nin the country right now. To give some perspective, there are 36,000 \nMcDonald's in the world. We have 48,000 windmills. There are 36,000 \nMcDonald's in the world. I don't exactly think the windmill thing is a \nstartup anymore. I think maybe that is fairly well established. So \nmaybe the need for the subsidy is not there.\n  Geothermal is a great energy source. We have yet to tap the full \npotential for heating and cooling our homes and businesses. But we \nstill need natural gas, oil, coal, and nuclear to provide power for the \nforeseeable future. Even the Obama administration lays out over the \nnext 30 years what they anticipate energy use will be, and they still \nanticipate we are going to need gas, coal, oil, basic base power.\n  So let's do it the cleanest way we can, the most efficient way we can \nso the consumer is not punished for using energy. We should keep \ninnovating for the future, but we should make rational choices on \nenergy.\n  Let me give an example of an irrational choice. Can I do that? Here \nis an example of an irrational energy choice: the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nNow, I know everyone is going to say we are going to talk about \nKeystone again. This is day 2,510 of a permit request to build a \npipeline. Today is day 2,510 of a permit request sitting on the \nPresident's desk for a pipeline. Let me give an example.\n  All of these black lines that we see here are crude oil pipelines in \nthe United States currently there. This is how many thousands of miles? \nMore than 60,000 miles in the United States of crude oil pipeline--\n60,000. It is another pipeline. Why does it take 2,510 days to be able \nto make a decision on this? Oh, it is an international pipeline. That \nis right. Well, let me add something to it. We have 19 international \npipelines currently running--19 of them. This would be No. 20. This is \nnot something new and radical. We are already buying a significant \namount of Canadian oil. That oil is coming from right up here. Look at \nall of these pipelines already coming from the same spot. Look at that, \nthey cross the border, and it has been safe and reliable. This has not \nbeen a big challenge for us.\n  That oil is not just being blocked from Canada. Many people think \nthat if we don't put in a pipeline, it won't come. Actually, it is \ncoming by rail already. It is already moving into the country. This is \njust cleaner and more efficient to be able to move it that way. Canada \nis discussing taking a pipeline and bringing it all the way over here, \ndropping it off and bringing it to the coast, and bringing it by ship \nover to the U.S. gulf coast.\n  Does someone think that is more efficient than bringing a pipeline \nin? Now, it is not more efficient by rail. It is not more efficient by \nthis way. If we are going to bring it in and Canada is going to sell \nit, why don't we have an international pipeline--that No. 20, right \nthere--and be able to bring it in?\n  Now, I have heard multiple people say it is because of the aquifer in \nNebraska. Let me try to discuss this because I have heard this over and \nover: We can't run pipelines because of the aquifer in Nebraska.\n  Here is the aquifer that is being discussed all in the purple here. \nEvery line that we see is an existing pipeline running through that \naquifer. This tiny blue line is the proposed Keystone that is to go \nright through there as well.\n  They make these comments: We can't run it through the aquifer \nbecause, oh, my gosh, we can't run a pipeline there. That is how many \nwe already have in that spot. This is not radical. This is not \ndifferent.\n  In fact, let me give one more image. This is the number of pipelines \nthat we have in America right now of all types. This is both natural \ngas and crude and all kinds of petroleum products that move through the \nUnited States all the time--every single one of those lines. This is \nirrational energy policy that is knee-jerk that is happening. To say \nthat we can't add one more pipeline because somehow that would go over \nthe top ignores the reality of what we already have in the United \nStates.\n  Moving energy by pipeline is clean and efficient. It is also a \nrational way to do it. We have to move from fear-based energy policy to \nfact-based energy policy--to look not only at our energy future but \nwhat may happen in the decades to come. I hope my car one day runs on a \npinwheel on the hood ornament. That would be great. But that doesn't \nhappen right now. My car still runs on gas. So does everyone else's \nhere. And for every single person here that gets on an airplane every \nweek, it doesn't run on water. It still runs on energy that we pull out \nof the ground.\n  So for the foreseeable future we need to deal with the facts. Stop \nhurting consumers for some proposed future hope of what may happen. \nLet's do it clean. Let's do it innovative. But let's not hurt consumers \nin the process.\n  People want to know where their money has gone. It is being spent \naway on regulations. Let's get to work on an energy plan.\n  I am glad to have this conversation, but this should not be a \nconversation in the hallways of the EPA. This should be a conversation \nin this room to determine where energy policies go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Economic Growth\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about seizing the \nopportunity to drive real economic growth right now. But first, I wish \nto give a little context by referencing our great Nation's desperate \nfiscal condition.\n  Decades of overspending by both parties and mismanagement by both \nparties have led to a crushing $18 trillion of Federal debt. Even more \nsobering to me is the upcoming over $100 trillion of future unfunded \nliabilities coming at us like a freight train. We have a fiscal crisis \nin this country. Everybody can see it. People back home can feel it. As \nan outsider, my role is to bring a new sense of urgency to Washington \nto help solve this fiscal crisis.\n  While I am encouraged by the work my colleagues on the Budget \nCommittee completed this year--we completed a balanced budget for the \nfirst time since 2001--it was merely a good first step in the right \ndirection. But we have a lot of heavy lifting to do. We must act right \nnow to get our fiscal house in order before it is too late.\n  Yes, we must cut unnecessary spending. Yes, there are redundant \nagencies and programs that should be eliminated. And yes, we do need to \nhave a national dialogue on how we keep the commitments that were made \nto our seniors, while saving those important programs for future \ngenerations. However, discretionary spending cuts and long-term reforms \nto mandatory programs alone will not solve this problem. The numbers \njust simply don't add up to solve this crisis. Economic growth is \nreally the only answer.\n  Economic growth supports good-paying jobs across the entire country, \nand economic growth eventually means\n\n[[Page S6284]]\n\nmore revenue for the Federal Government without raising taxes. If we \nare ever going to get out of the hole that Washington has dug for our \ncountry, we are going to have to grow our way out of it economically. \nOne of the biggest opportunities to infuse energy and investment into \nour economy right now is before us as I speak, just waiting for us to \nact on it.\n  There are approximately $2.1 trillion in corporate profits of \nAmerican multinational companies sitting abroad trapped by our archaic \ntax laws. Imagine if we could lure just a portion of that back in terms \nof capital investment in our economy. The multiplier effect alone would \nbe incredible as it rippled its way throughout our domestic economy.\n  In recent weeks we have heard a lot of talk about how we in \nWashington can get those overseas earnings repatriated back into the \nUnited States economy. For me, the solution is quite simple. We simply \neliminate the barrier to repatriation by completely eliminating the tax \non repatriation.\n  My approach isn't just based on my business career. It is not just \nbased on my desire to give our economy a much-needed shot in the arm. \nCompletely eliminating this tax on repatriation is an absolute \nnecessity for global competitiveness and to create a level playing \nfield with the rest of the world.\n  I rarely compare other countries to the United States for simple \nreasons. No. 1, we have an 18 trillion economy. No. 2, we are the \ninnovator in the world. No. 3, we have the rule of law. No. 4, we have \nreally a very dynamic and diverse economy. Very few countries compare. \nBut this is one time where a comparison is warranted because it is \nabout how we compete for economic development and jobs with the rest of \nthe world.\n  A company headquartered in the United States not only has to pay \ntaxes in every single country in which it does business, but when it \nelects to bring back the remaining profits from abroad, that \ncorporation is forced to pay an additional tax--a repatriation tax. \nThis doesn't happen if the corporation is based in Canada, France, \nGermany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan or, indeed, the remainder \nof the 39 OECD countries. In fact, there is only one country on the \nlist of 39 OECD countries that has a repatriation tax--the United \nStates. The United Kingdom actually eliminated their repatriation tax \nin 2009, and over the last decade they have reduced their corporate tax \nrate from 28 percent to 18 percent.\n  We continue to see companies leave the United States because they can \ngo pretty much anywhere else and benefit from much lower tax rates than \nhere in America. We have seen a rash of those inversions over the last \nfew years, and it is not going to stop until we deal with the \nunderlying problem; that is, our corporate tax rate is not competitive \nwith the rest of the world. The repatriation tax is a derivative of \nthat primary causal problem.\n  What I am talking about today is simply the elimination of the \nrepatriation tax. But sooner or later, we have to deal with the fact \nthat our corporate tax rate is simply not competitive. The question \nsimply before us is, Do we want multinational companies--in many cases \niconic American brands--to continue to call the United States home or \nnot?\n  As a former CEO of a large branded company that manufactured in \ndozens of countries and sold in dozens more, I have firsthand \nexperience, and I can tell you that, based on that experience, we are \nlosing our competitive advantage with the rest of the world. In fact, I \nsee us now at a growing disadvantage for our American companies to \ncompete with companies in other countries.\n  The hostile regulatory environment the current administration has \ncreated is killing American jobs, and our outdated tax system is \nforcing them to expand abroad. Executive orders and regulatory mandates \nhave created a punitive atmosphere in which to try to grow businesses \nor start businesses here in the United States. Unfortunately, in \ntypical Washington fashion, the dialogue on repatriation is focused on \nhow to get a short-term solution--a short-term Federal tax increase--\ninstead of using repatriation as a tool to grow the economy and make us \nmore competitive. In my estimation, this kind of thinking is dead wrong \nand another example of how we got in this mess in the first price.\n\n  We should not be looking at repatriation as a way to pay for the \nhighway trust fund or any other short-term solution to Washington's \nspending problems, for that matter. That kind of shortsighted thinking \nwill only make our fiscal situation worse. It will only cause more \nAmerican companies to look for a new home.\n  Repatriation is a big idea with a big potential impact for our \neconomy. If we encourage repatriation the right way, it means sustained \ngrowth for our economy. It means more American jobs and innovation. \nUltimately, it means an organic increase in Federal tax revenue based \non pure economic growth. This growth can allow us to deal with our \neconomic and fiscal priorities and finally develop a long-term plan to \nbegin to pay down our overburdened debt.\n  Before I conclude, I have one final thought. I hope this thought will \ncompel my colleagues to act with a sense of urgency on this issue and \nothers that impact our economy. We actually have fewer people working \nthan at any time in the last 30 years. When I go back home, the number \none question that is put before me is: How can I get my hours up? How \ncan I get more work?\n  People back home know we have a crisis. It is not just bureaucrats in \nWashington looking for a few more tax dollars so we can make government \nbigger. This is about putting people back to work--helping us compete \nagainst the growing economies of China, India, Russia, and other rivals \nin today's world.\n  The approval rating of Congress today is somewhere in the mid-single \ndigits, and that is only because our mothers voted. I believe it is \nbecause this town's priorities are not aligned with those of the people \nwho sent us here for their bidding. Folks back home know that \nshortsighted, short-term solutions to the big problems are how \nWashington got in this mess in the first place.\n  Today we can continue to argue about temporary ways to pay for trust \nfunds that are going bankrupt every few weeks, or we can simply finally \nget serious about solving this systemic problem before we have to hand \nit to our children and our children's children. I know the American \npeople expect the latter. In fact, they are demanding it. That can \nhappen, but we must make real tax reforms right now that will set us on \na new course for economic growth and opportunity for generations to \ncome. The time for serious debate about repatriation has come.\n  We have an opportunity. I implore my colleagues in the Senate to \ndebate this earnestly, and let's move on this right now and put people \nback to work and make America more competitive for our children and our \nchildren's children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                               ARENA Act\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, yesterday President Obama and his \nEnvironmental Protection Agency announced their final clean power grab, \ncontinuing the economic assault on energy-producing States like West \nVirginia.\n  Yesterday, Alpha Natural Resources, one of the Nation's largest coal \nproducers, filed for bankruptcy. As of the end of 2014, Alpha had 4,870 \nemployees at 33 active mines and 13 prep plants in West Virginia. Alpha \nfollows Patriot Coal, Jim Walter Resources, and James River mining--all \nof which have filed bankruptcy since 2014.\n  According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, coal mining \nemployment has dropped from 143,437 in 2011 to 98,310 in the first \nquarter of this year. That represents a 31-percent drop over the last 4 \nyears.\n  Earlier this year when Murray Energy announced hundreds of layoffs in \nnorthern West Virginia, the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper reported \nthat the impact would mean almost $62 million in annual income lost \nwages for Ohio Valley residents. Other communities have also been hard \nhit. Nicholas County--a small county in my State--was forced to lay off \nsheriff's deputies because they could no longer pay their county \ncommitments because of a decline in coal severance revenues.\n  Now, 17 coal units in West Virginia have retired due, at least in \npart, to\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\nEPA policies. The electricity produced by these units is enough to \npower 2.7 million homes. Put another way, the units that have already \nclosed in West Virginia would generate enough electricity to power the \nentire State of Hawaii.\n  These are not the same old talking points, as the administrator of \nthe EPA and the President said. These are not stale. This is not \nmotivated by special interests. These are real Americans, real jobs, \nreal families, and real communities that have been negatively impacted \nby this administration's overreaching regulations. These are people \nlike Tammy Rowan of Coalton, WV, who wrote me a letter:\n\n       My whole family has concerns with the regulations that seem \n     to be out of control. EPA, government officials, and the \n     president are putting families out of work.\n\n  Or Patrick Sparks in Warriormine, WV, who said:\n\n       I know the EPA has been trying to force strict regulations \n     on coal. It's hurting a lot of people, not just here in West \n     Virginia, but a lot of businesses are suffering from it.\n\n  And Theresa Simmons of Tridelphia, WV, whose family has worked in \ncoal mines for generations, wrote:\n\n       My husband was able to provide for our family with just his \n     income. We were able to donate money to local charities and \n     help needy families around the holidays. Now that is going to \n     be my family, looking for donations.\n\n  Put simply, yesterday's announcement will make an already bleak \nsituation in our State much worse. Working families across the Nation \nwoke up to the sad news that their jobs just don't count. Much has been \nsaid about the open process that led to this final rule. In fact, West \nVirginia, which is one of the States most deeply affected by this \nregulation, was not even visited by the EPA after I and others extended \nmany invitations. Instead, they went to cities like Chicago, Boston, \nand San Francisco. Talk about special interests. Talk about being bold.\n  The administration's final clean power grab will force States away \nfrom affordable, reliable energy toward expensive, intermittent power \nsources, many of which are heavily subsidized by the taxpayer. It \nproposes benchmarks that are more stringent and less attainable.\n  In West Virginia, our emissions rate under the proposed rule was to \ndrop 20 percent. On Monday, the final rule requires our rate to drop by \n37 percent--a drop that is almost twice as severe. There is no way for \nWest Virginia to comply with this rule without significant cuts to our \ncoal production, coal jobs, and coal use.\n  According to the EPA's own calculations, the final rule is worse for \ncoal than the proposed rule. Coal's share of electric generation will \ngo to 27 percent by 2030 under this rule--as compared to 39 percent, \nwhich we currently have or did have in 2014.\n  If this misguided final rule is ever implemented, pain will be felt \nby all Americans with fewer job opportunities, higher power bills, and \nless reliable electricity. Studies of the proposed rule projected that \nthe Clean Power Plan will increase electricity prices in a State like \nmine 12 to 16 percent.\n  What does this mean for American jobs? A recent study by the National \nRural Electric Cooperative Association found that a 10 percent increase \nin electricity prices can mean as much as 1.2 million jobs lost. \nRoughly one-half million of these job losses will be in rural \ncommunities like those in West Virginia. Put simply, affordable energy \nmatters. It especially matters to those who the administration \nincorrectly says will benefit the most from this rule, which is the low \nand moderate income.\n  More than half of West Virginia's households take home an average of \nless than $1,900 per month and already spend 17 percent of their income \non energy. These families are especially vulnerable to the \nadministration's clean power grab. While States are given additional \ntime to comply under the final rule, it does not change the fact that \nthe EPA is picking winners and losers in the energy economy. The losers \nwill be the American families who rely on affordable and reliable \nenergy. We can and we should innovate for the future but not with a \nsledgehammer bearing down on us. Thankfully there are several \nlegislative options that Congress can pursue to challenge this rule.\n  Tomorrow the EPW Committee will be taking up my legislation--the \nARENA Act. Let me explain that briefly. This bipartisan legislation \nwould empower States to protect families and businesses from electric \nrate increases, reduced electric reliability, and other harmful \neffects. It will force the EPA to reconsider this misguided rulemaking.\n  The ARENA Act holds the EPA accountable by requiring the agency to \nissue State-specific model plans demonstrating how each State will meet \nthe required reductions. It gives States the ability to opt out if the \nplan hinders economic growth.\n  For existing powerplants, the ARENA Act delays implementation of the \nClean Power Plan until the courts determine the legality of the rule. \nRecently, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA had unlawfully failed to \nconsider costs when formulating its MATS regulation. Because the rule \nwent forward while it was still being litigated, millions of dollars \nwere spent to comply with a rule that was ultimately deemed illegal. \nStates should not be forced to proceed until the legality of the rule \nhas been determined. I hope that many States will follow Leader \nMcConnell's suggestion and delay implementation of this rule until the \nlegal process is completed.\n  Mr. President of the United States, your clean power grab will \ndevastate already hurting communities in my State. It will cause \neconomic pain for working families across the country. It will forever \nharm our energy landscape.\n  The proposed rule was bad. The final rule announced yesterday is even \nworse, doubling down on the destruction of our economy. There is no \nquestion that we must take steps to protect our environment, but it \nsimply cannot be at the expense of our families.\n  We can do better. Let Congress, the elected representatives, make \nthese decisions. That is the way it should be. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me by supporting the ARENA Act and sending these overreaching EPA \nregulations back to the drawing board.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                         Wildfires in the West\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares for the month of \nAugust in our home States, I want to discuss tonight what I believe to \nbe an urgent issue: The West is on fire. There is a really serious \nprospect that my part of the country is going to get hit by what I call \nthe terrible trifecta--drought, high temperatures, and enormous fuel \nload on the forest floor. When you couple that with a lightning \nstrike--which is not exactly a rarity in my part of the world--all of a \nsudden you can have on your hands an inferno. The fires are getting \nbigger, they are lasting longer, and they are doing more damage.\n  Senators here on both sides of the aisle--Democrats and Republicans--\nhave come to realize that our system for fighting fire is a broken, \ndysfunctional mess. What happens is, historically, prevention gets \nshort shrift. The agencies can't do enough thinning; they can't do \nenough of the preventive work to reduce the fuel load on the forest \nfloor. Then you have one of those lightning strikes, and all of a \nsudden there is a huge fire because the fuel buildup is so great on the \nforest floor.\n  The agencies then run out of money putting these fires out because \nthey are getting bigger, and they are lasting longer. The problem just \nkeeps getting worse because the agencies then have to rob the \nprevention fund in order to fight these big fires. In other words, the \nagencies borrow from the prevention fund, and the problem gets worse \nbecause by shorting the prevention fund it creates the prospect of \nstill more big fires in the future.\n  With the West burning, the Western Governor's Association--a \nbipartisan group--put out a new update of how big the recent fires \nare. So far in 2015, nearly 6 million acres have burned. That is an \narea bigger than the State of New Jersey, scorched in massive fires.\n\n  In my home State, a wildfire in Douglas County in southern Oregon has \nspread to over 16,000 acres, with 1,400 crew members battling a blaze \nthat is threatening more than 300 homes. According to recent reports, \n20,000 acres were scorched by one single fire in northern California in \na matter of only\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\n5 hours. That is 20,000 acres--nearly the size of the entire city of \nBend, OR--that burned in the time span of an extra-inning baseball \ngame.\n  With the Forest Service budget effectively flatlined and the higher \ncost of fighting fires producing this robbing of other programs that I \nhave described--the fire borrowing--what you have is a vicious, self-\ndefeating circle of firefighting and shoddy budgeting, which, in \neffect, will cause an even bigger crisis in the future because you \nshorted the prevention fund. In 10 years, if this isn't fixed--what is \nknown as fire borrowing--the Forest Service says it will be spending \ntwo-thirds of its entire budget on suppressing wildfires, and my \nconstituents say they will be calling the Forest Service the Fire \nService because that is essentially what they will be.\n  This is particularly serious right now, which is why I came to the \nfloor tonight to try to drive home the urgency of this issue, because \nit is so dry in the West. This year Governor Brown of my home State has \ndeclared drought emergencies in 23 of our 36 counties. All 36 counties \nare experiencing severe drought, according to the National Drought \nCenter. It is a very dangerous mix of factors, what I have come to call \nthe terrible trifecta of drought and temperatures and fuel load. They \nall came together and turned the West into a virtual tinderbox.\n  To try to fix this, my colleague Senator Crapo and I have worked \ntogether for quite some time to in effect say that what we ought to do \nis break this dysfunctional system of fighting fires and go with a \ndifferent approach. What we would say is that the biggest fires--the 1 \nor 2 percent of the megafires--we ought to fight them from the disaster \nfund because they really are disasters. Use the prevention fund for \nwhat it is intended, which is prevention, so we can keep from having \nthose megafires.\n  The good news is that the Congressional Budget Office--my colleague \nis new here, but he already knows that the Congressional Budget Office \nis our official scorekeeper--says that there really aren't added costs \nfor this approach because while you would spend a bit more money trying \nto put out those megafires, you would save some money by not cheating \nthe prevention fund and not having so many fires in the first place.\n  In effect, it is a lot smarter for the agencies to focus on keeping \nour forests healthy and clear of the fuels that go up in flames when \nlightning strikes. So we do the preventive work and we no longer are \nshorting it by all the fire borrowing which I have just described.\n  Senator Crapo and I have been able to get well over 250 organizations \nto go on record in support of our idea. These are groups associated \nwith forestry policy, environmental folks, industry personnel, people \nacross the political spectrum. More than 250 groups have said they are \nin support of this. The Under Secretary of Agriculture, Robert Bonnie, \nnoted in a recent letter that the proposal Senator Crapo and I have \noffered is one that both fixes fire borrowing and provides the \nresources needed to prevent these catastrophic wildfires down the line. \nFifteen of our colleagues here in the Senate have supported the bill, \nand 123 Members in the other body have also supported the bill. The \nadministration is on board. The agencies that battle these fires are \nwaiting for the Congress to act.\n  Each day, the reality in the West is that immensely brave men and \nwomen are on the ground fighting fires, and they risk their lives to \nkeep our homes and communities protected. It is long, long, long past \ntime for the Congress to step up, fix this budgetary mess, and \nguarantee that the funding is there to fight fires and to prevent them \nin the first place.\n  I filed our bipartisan bill as an amendment to the Transportation \nbill. I filed a wildfire amendment to the budget resolution. I filed \nthe Senate Interior appropriations wildfire language as an amendment to \nthe Transportation bill. And I believe this is the fourth time in \nrecent months I have been on the floor talking about this issue, and \nthat is in addition to talking about it in the budget markup and in \nseveral hearings in the natural resources committee that I had the \nhonor to chair in the last Congress.\n  I see my new colleague in the chair, and he has been doing good work \non this fire borrowing issue. And even with everything else we are \ndealing with here in the Senate, I think it is very important that we \nfocus on an actual way to leave with an agreement on how this is \nactually going to get fixed and get done. In that regard, I have been \ntalking in the last day or so with colleagues in both political \nparties, and I think there is now this sense of urgency because we see \nit not only on TV, but every time we are home, we go to fire briefings. \nAs the Presiding Officer knows, even fire briefings have changed very \ndramatically. We used to have a fire briefing in July, and now we have \nfire briefings--as I did--in the winter because the Forest Service and \nthe folks at BLM often say they are not even sure when one fire season \nhas ended and the next one has begun because these challenges have \ngotten so great.\n  Senator Crapo and I, with this bill that has gotten more than 250 \norganizations sponsoring it, have talked in just the last few hours. We \nwant to work with all of our colleagues to make sure that we get some \nsense because our constituents are going to ask about this. They are \ngoing to ask about this issue this summer. They are going to ask: How \nis the Senate actually going to get this done? How is the Senate going \nto fix this broken, dysfunctional system of fighting fires? In effect, \nyear after year--and I gather there will be some new analyses coming \nout--the entire budget for the Forest Service is getting eaten up in \nfighting these counterproductive fires.\n  Senator Crapo and I have a proposal that received a favorable score \nfrom the Budget Committee. I know my colleague in the chair has also \ndone very good work on these issues, as have a number of Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. Given the good will I have seen among Senators \nhere in the last couple of days as we talked about what this really \nmeans, given the urgency and because we are going home and seeing \nconstituents in August, I am convinced we can have an agreement on how \nthis is going to get fixed. That is why I wanted to come to the floor \ntonight, because there are a lot of topics that are still going to be \ntackled in the next few days before the Senate wraps up. I want it \nunderstood that our part of the country is on fire. It is on fire. We \nhave communities burning up, and business as usual is unacceptable.\n  Senator Crapo and I have offered a proposal that we think will turn \nthis around, and other colleagues have very good ideas as well. What is \nnonnegotiable is just saying: Oh, you know, maybe we will take care of \nit at the end of the year or on standard congressional time. That is \nnot good enough for the West, which is burning up.\n  I invite my colleagues here, as we move forward in the last few days \nbefore the August recess, to join me, Senator Crapo, and colleagues in \nboth political parties to make sure that people see--as we go home to \ntalk to the people we have the honor to represent--that this is now \ngoing to actually get fixed and that the Senate is coming together to \nmake sure it actually gets done. We are going to turn this around so \nthat we can do more to prevent fires in the rural west, No. 1, and No. \n2, fight them in a more cost-effective way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6286-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished \ncareer of Scott ``Scotty'' Watts, who served as the president of the \nNevada Alliance for Retired Americans, NARA, from 2001 until his \nretirement in 2014.\n  Building on the work of its predecessor, the Nevada National Council \nof Senior Citizens, NARA has been at the\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nforefront of advocating for the interests of retired Nevadans for more \nthan a decade. Scotty Watts, who was the founding president of NARA, \nled the organization and played a critical role in its progress and \nsuccess. Under his steadfast leadership, Scotty helped NARA build a \npowerful grassroots network to support the economic and health programs \nthat are important to retirees throughout Nevada. Today, NARA has grown \nto include more than 19,330 members and 28 chapters, making it the \nlargest progressive senior citizen organization in the Silver State.\n  Prior to becoming the president of NARA, Scotty was a leading \nadvocate for retirees and seniors in the Silver State. He served two \nterms as the president of the Nevada National Council of Senior \nCitizens. Through his leadership positions in these organizations, he \nled the effort in our State to protect and strengthen the benefits \nseniors have earned under Social Security and Medicare and has been a \nfierce advocate for the Affordable Care Act. I am pleased that this \nmonth NARA will honor Scotty during the organization's State convention \nfor his career in dedicated service and advocacy.\n  I have had the pleasure of meeting with Scotty, and I can say without \nreservation that Nevada's retirees were fortunate to have him in their \ncorner, fighting on their behalf. I commend Scotty for his service to \nthe Silver State, and I wish him the best in his retirement and future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6287-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DOMINICANS OF HAITIAN DESCENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have traveled to the Dominican Republic \nand Haiti and am familiar with the history of racial tensions between \nthe population of Haitian migrants and Dominicans of Haitian descent \nand other citizens of the Dominican Republic. These problems are by no \nmeans unique to these two neighboring countries, nor are there easy \nsolutions. In addition to race there is competition for land, social \nservices, and jobs. But while this situation should not be \noversimplified, the way the Dominican Government is dealing with it is \nunfortunate.\n  In a September 2013 Dominican Constitutional Court ruling the \ncitizenship of more than 200,000 people--mostly Dominicans of Haitian \ndescent--was summarily revoked, and they lost access to education, \nhealth care, and other essential social services, as well as their \nbasic rights. Since that ruling the Dominican Government has threatened \nto enforce strict and prejudicial immigration laws. Many affected \nresidents live under constant fear of deportation, and according to the \nUnited Nations nearly 20,000 have already fled the country in the past \nmonth, putting the island on the brink of a mass refugee crisis.\n  By threatening to deport Haitian migrants and Dominicans of Haitian \ndescent, the Dominican Government is on a path that not only disregards \nfundamental principles of international humanitarian law, but may \nprovoke a reaction that makes the situation worse. Even as we are \nalready seeing the consequences of the threat of mass deportations, \nfollowing through with such a policy would likely greatly exacerbate \ntensions in the Dominican Republic and create a regional diplomatic and \nhumanitarian crisis. Haiti, impoverished and still recovering from the \ndevastating 2010 earthquake, does not have the capacity to handle the \nsudden arrival of thousands of homeless, jobless, Dominicans.\n  The United States, with 319 million people spread across 50 States is \namong the most ethnically and racially diverse countries in the world. \nThe challenges this has posed for our own democracy over the past two \ncenturies are well known. We have not always handled these challenges \nas we should have. I hope the Dominican Government will learn from our \nexperience and recognize the need to reverse course and reaffirm the \nlegal status and rights of these people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6287-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOMINATION OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous \nconsent request at the present time relating to the nomination of David \nMalcolm Robinson to be Assistant Secretary for Conflict and \nStabilization Operations and Coordinator for Reconstruction and \nStabilization.\n  I will object because the State Department has engaged in \nunreasonable delay in responding to Judiciary Committee investigations \nand inquiries. Since June of 2013, the Judiciary Committee has \nrequested a number of documents related to an investigation into Ms. \nHuma Abedin regarding her possible conflicts of interest created by her \nsimultaneous employment with the State Department and private sector \nentities. In addition, the Judiciary Committee has inquired about \nformer Secretary Clinton and Ms. Abedin's questionable email practices \nthat may be in violation of Department policy and Federal law. \nFurthermore, the committee's inquiry also centers on the possible \ninterference of Freedom of Information Act requests by State Department \npersonnel, including Secretary Clinton's former Chief of Staff, Ms. \nCheryl Mills. To this day, the committee has not received a complete \nresponse. Moreover, the committee recently acquired information that \nshows the State Department has been in possession of material that \nwould answer some of the Committee's inquiries. Yet, the requested \nmaterial is still not forthcoming.\n  This willful lack of cooperation is made more evident by the example \nof repeated failures by State Department personnel to respond to emails \nor respond days or weeks later. And in yet another recent committee \ninvestigation beginning in June 2015, the State Department has still \nfailed to provide any communication, via email or a phone call, to \nacknowledge or confirm that they have received a committee letter, \ndespite three emails sent by committee staff.\n  Not only has the Judiciary Committee experienced unacceptable delays \nin receiving information, other entities inside and outside of the \ngovernment have experienced delays as well. The Associated Press sued \nthe State Department over the failure to satisfy repeated document \nrequests under the Freedom of Information Act related to these same \nissues. One of these requests dates back 5 years ago. Judge Richard \nLeon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the judge \nresponsible for this case, chided the State Department for its failure \nto produce documents on time, ``Now, any person should be able to \nreview that in one day--one day. Even the least ambitious bureaucrat \ncould do this.''\n  In total, these actions illustrate a pattern of conduct that clearly \ndemonstrates a lack of cooperation and bad faith in its interaction \nwith Congress. This is unacceptable and cannot continue.\n  In order to maintain the proper balance of separation of powers and \nin order for Congress to exercise its proper oversight function, \ngovernment agencies must respond to inquiries. The State Department \napparently believes that it can simply ignore Congress. It is important \nto note that my objection is not intended to question Mr. Robinson's \ncredentials in any way. However, withholding consent to suspend Senate \nrules on nominations is one tool a Senator has to incentivize executive \nagencies to respond to congressional inquiries. Frankly, this should \nnot be necessary, and the nominee is an innocent victim of the State \nDepartment's contemptuous failures to respond to congressional \ninquiries. I urge the State Department to change its ways and if they \nchoose not to, I will be forced to escalate the scope of my intent to \nobject to include unanimous consent requests relating to Foreign \nService officer candidates as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6287-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6287-S6288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RAYMOND T. ODIERNO, 38TH CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my cochair of the \nArmy Caucus, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, I rise \ntoday to honor GEN Raymond T. Odierno, the 38th Chief of Staff of the \nU.S. Army, and one of our Nation's finest military officers. General \nOdierno will retire from Active military duty in August 2015, bringing \nto a close 39 years of distinguished service to our great Nation.\n  In 1976, General Odierno was commissioned as a second lieutenant in \nthe Field Artillery upon graduation from the United States Military \nAcademy at West Point. He commanded units at\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\nevery echelon, from platoon to theater, with duty in Germany, Albania, \nKuwait, Iraq, and the United States. General Odierno deployed in \nsupport of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; commanded the 4th \nInfantry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom from April 2003 to \nMarch 2004; served as the commanding general, Multi-National Corps--\nIraq, III Corps, from 2006 to 2008; and later served as the commanding \ngeneral, Multi-National Force--Iraq and subsequently United States \nForces--Iraq, from 2008 until 2010. General Odierno went on to serve as \nthe commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command from 2010 to 2011, where he \nled the development and integration of joint capabilities in support of \ncombatant command requirements around the world.,\n  On September 7, 2011, General Odierno became the 38th Chief of Staff \nof the U.S. Army. Since assuming this position, General Odierno's \nleadership and commitment to his soldiers, to the Army, and to the \nNation have significantly contributed to the U.S. Army being the most \nhighly trained and professional land force in the world.\n  General Odierno developed and implemented the U.S. Army's vision \nestablishing a path for the Army of 2025 and beyond. He envisioned how \nfuture Army forces would prevent conflict, shape security environments, \nand win wars. He ensured that we possessed the capability and capacity \nto provide globally responsive and regionally aligned forces, as well \nas expeditionary and decisive land-power across the range of military \noperations in defense of our Nation at home and abroad, both today and \nagainst emerging threats.\n  But the one thing that remained constant was General Odierno's \ntireless commitment to soldiers and their families. He built leaders \ncapable of navigating the complex challenges of the world we face today \nand cared for our families by focusing on keeping the total Army--\nsoldiers, families, and civilians alike--healthy, ready, resilient, and \ntotal Army strong. General Odierno is an exceptional leader, an \nAmerican patriot committed to our Army and Nation, but most \nimportantly, General Odierno is a great man of character. It is for GEN \nRay Odierno, a soldier, leader, and selfless servant, whom we with \nprofound admiration and deep respect pay tribute to for all he has done \nfor the U.S. Army and our Nation. We thank General Odierno, his wife \nLinda, and his three children, Tony, Katie, and Mike, for their \ndedication and sacrifice, and we wish them well in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6288-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LARRY AND MARGO BEAN\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on September 1, 2015, the Boys & Girls \nClub of Central Wyoming will be holding their Annual Awards and \nRecognition Breakfast where they will honor Casper philanthropists, \nLarry and Margo Bean.\n  The Boys & Girls Club of Central Wyoming has been making positive \ndifferences in the lives of our children since 1978. The club provides \na supportive environment and an extensive array of programs and \nservices to enhance the development of our youth. Through entertaining \nactivities and with the guidance of volunteer mentors, participants \nlearn the important values of independence, community, and belonging. \nEvery year, the Boys & Girls Club plans a breakfast to honor a member \nor members of the community who make outstanding contributions to both \nthe Boys & Girls Club and the city of Casper. This year's honorees, \nLarry and Margo Bean, are incredible champions in the Casper community \nand worthy of this special recognition.\n  Growing up on farms in Iowa, Larry and Margo moved to Casper as young \nadults with a desire to help, encourage, and bring joy to those who \ncrossed their paths, particularly children. Anyone who knows the couple \nknows that the care and support they show for each other equals their \npassion for philanthropy and civic engagement. Next year, the couple \nwill celebrate their 50th anniversary. They will celebrate this \nmilestone occasion with their children Joshua, Amber, Nathan, and \nNicole, and grandchildren Ella, Xavier, Mia, Mars, Sullivan, Cassius, \nand Vincent--who will be born next month.\n  As a couple, they are a powerhouse, yet they have significant \nindividual accomplishments. As an author of four children's books, \nMargo's inspiration to write stories for children came from her father, \nMax Cronbaugh. Her father was an amazing storyteller who never failed \nto capture the imagination of children and the excitement of everyday \nlife on the farm. With her experience as an elementary school teacher \nand growing up on her family's Iowa farm, Margo's books reflect her \nunique experience and the special place children have always held in \nher heart. Her continued dedication to educating children in Wyoming is \nshown by leadership efforts at the St. Anthony Tri-Parish Catholic \nSchool, where some of their grandchildren attend school. Additionally, \nMargo was chairman of the Wyoming Medical Center board of directors and \nran a successful business.\n  Larry is a certified public accountant and he provides valuable \nguidance and financial advice. In addition, Larry serves on the board \nof directors for several important organizations including the Martin \nFamily Foundation, the Converse County Bank, and the Central Wyoming \nCounseling Center. As so many folks in Wyoming know, Larry is the \nultimate letterwriter. His letters are individual masterpieces. In \nevery letter from Larry, you see his smile and feel his friendship. \nLarry freely gives encouragement and inspiration--one letter at a time. \nOver the years, Bobbi and I have looked forward to the Bean's annual \nChristmas letter.\n  Together, Larry and Margo have touched the lives of thousands of \nchildren and families in Wyoming through their philanthropic and \nvolunteer work. At Christmastime, their ``Love in Action'' project \ncollects presents for families in need. They sponsor and coordinate \nyouth events in the community including The American Dream Essay \ncontest, The Uprising, and the Global Leadership Summit. The Beans also \nsupport youth faith-based organizations such as Child Evangelism \nFellowship and Youth for Christ. They also have been strong supporters \nof the Nicolaysen Discovery Center and the Central Wyoming Rescue \nMission.\n  Their kindness and generosity expands across the globe. Larry and \nMargo are diligently working to develop faith-based schools in Zambia \nand Haiti. These neighborhood schools will bring hope and opportunities \nto these children as well as to these communities.\n  My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our congratulations to Larry \nand Margo Bean and thanking them for their dedication to Wyoming and \nits youth. All of us privileged to know them are blessed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6288-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6288-S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S TENNIS TEAM NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Concord, \nNH--a city in Merrimack County that is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding. I am proud to join the citizens across the \nGranite State in recognizing this special occasion.\n  Concord, settled in 1725 by colonists from Massachusetts, was \nincorporated in 1733 as the town of Rumford, and later the parish of \nConcord where it experienced several border disputes with the \nneighboring town of Bow. The parish of Bow officially became part of \nConcord in 1765.\n  Concord includes the villages of Penacook, East Concord, and West \nConcord. The city's population has grown to over 40,000 residents with \nover 6,000 acres of protected land. Concord residents have access to \nnumerous hiking and biking trails, and the town's location on the \nMerrimack River significantly adds to its natural beauty.\n  In 1808, Concord was established as the State capital of New \nHampshire. The statehouse is the oldest legislative building in the \nNation still in use by the State's house and senate. The house chamber \nis also home to the largest State legislative body in the country.\n  Concord has produced many innovative businesses, including the Abbot-\nDowning Company that designed and built the world-famous Concord Coach \nin 1827, revolutionizing travel throughout the world.\n  Today, Concord is a civic, cultural, business, and medical hub for \nthe Granite State. It is where New Hampshire's lone U.S. President, \nFranklin Pierce had an office, and it is the location of his final \nresting place. Concord is also home to the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery \nCenter, named after Christa McAuliffe, a Concord educator who bravely \nvolunteered to become the first teacher in space aboard the fatal \nChallenger space shuttle mission in 1986, and New Hampshire astronaut \nAlan Shepard. Today, new generations can visit the planetarium to learn \nabout our universe. On Concord's thriving Main Street, residents and \nvisitors can find an outstanding collection of New Hampshire small \nbusinesses that represent the heart of the city. Downtown Concord is \nfull of history and culture--including the Museum of New Hampshire \nHistory, the Capital Center for the Arts, and the Red River Theater.\n  The spirit of community and volunteerism is strong in Concord as \nevidenced by the hard work and dedication of all involved with the \nplanning and celebration of this special sestercentennial anniversary.\n  Concord, as our State's capital, has greatly contributed to the life \nand spirit of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards to \nthe people of Concord as they celebrate the city's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6289-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PITTSBURG, NEW HAMPSHIRE 175TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nPittsburg, NH--a town in Coos County that is celebrating the 175th \nanniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the \nGranite State in recognizing this historic occasion.\n  Pittsburg is nestled deep within New Hampshire's Great North Woods \nand sits in the shadows of Stub Hill and Magalloway Mountain. It is the \nlargest town by area in the State, and contains all four Connecticut \nLakes. Pittsburg is the only town that shares a border with both Maine \nand Vermont, and contains the only portion of New Hampshire west of the \nConnecticut River. Pittsburg holds the only New Hampshire crossing into \nCanada, sharing an international border with the Province of Quebec.\n  The area known as Pittsburg was settled in the early part of the 19th \ncentury, but an unclear boundary line between the United States and \nCanada allowed for the formation of a region known as the Republic of \nIndian Stream. Shortly thereafter, the town was incorporated in 1840 \nand named for English Prime Minister William Pitt.\n  Pittsburg is home to scenic lakes, rivers, streams, and forestland, \nand has become the perfect venue for all recreational outdoor \nactivities. Thousands of off-highway recreational vehicle enthusiasts \nvisit each season to enjoy the hundreds of miles of snowmobile and ATV \ntrails that have earned Pittsburg the title, ``snowmobile capital of \nNew England.''\n  On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my \ncongratulations to the residents of Pittsburg on reaching this special \nmilestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life \nand spirit of the State of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6289-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LOIS HORVITZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Lois Horvitz, a beloved mother, grandmother, \npublic health advocate, and extraordinary philanthropist who passed \naway on July 23, 2015. She was 88 years old.\n  Lois Horvitz was born April 22, 1927 in Cleveland, OH. She attended \nthe University of Wisconsin before marrying Harry R. Horvitz, a World \nWar II naval officer and newspaper publisher.\n  In 1962, Lois met Dr. Claude S. Beck, a renowned cardiac surgeon and \npioneer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the lifesaving technique more \ncommonly known as CPR. Inspired by his work, Lois became an early \nadvocate of CPR training, championing a wide spread public awareness \ncampaign and establishing the Resuscitators of America to teach CPR \nclasses.\n  Lois' efforts to promote CPR awareness sparked her lifelong passion \nfor philanthropy, inspiring her to dedicate her time and resources to \nimproving lives in her community and country. In addition to serving on \nthe boards of the Eisenhower Medical Center and the Betty Ford Center, \nLois established the Harry R. Horvitz Center for Palliative Medicine at \nthe Cleveland Clinic in honor of her late husband of 44 years. An \nactive member of her Indian Wells community, Lois created the Desert \nTown Hall in 1993, which became an annual speaker series featuring \nworld leaders.\n  I send my deepest condolences to Lois' children, Michael, Pam, and \nPeter, and their families. Lois' legacy of commitment and compassion \nwill continue to inspire others for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6289-4", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SERGEANT SCOTT LUNGER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to Sergeant Scott Lunger, an exceptional law \nenforcement officer, loyal friend, and beloved father who was \ntragically killed in the line of duty on July 22, 2015.\n  Scott Lunger was born on March 13, 1967 and grew up in Dublin, CA, \nwhere he played baseball and football at Dublin High School. After \ngraduation, Scott followed his father and older brother's footsteps and \nentered the electrical trade, becoming a member of IBEW Local 595. \nHowever, a lifelong interest in law enforcement prompted Scott to \nswitch career paths, and he began working as a Contra Costa County \nsheriff's deputy before transferring to the Hayward Police Department \nin 2001.\n  During his 15-year career with the department, Sergeant Lunger was \nassigned to some of the most critical units, including the gang task \nforce, SWAT team, and the special duty unit. Sergeant Lunger also \nworked as a field training officer and became the head of the field \ntraining unit, allowing him to mentor dozens of young officers on the \nforce. Sergeant Lunger's colleagues recalled admiringly his ability to \nencourage his fellow officers to give their best effort, always leading \nby example.\n  Sergeant Lunger dedicated his life to his family, his community, and \nhis country. On behalf of the people of California, whom he served so \nbravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to his daughters, \nAshton and Saralyn; father, Paul; brothers, Mike and Todd; sisters, \nMichelle and Ciara; nieces and nephews; and entire extended family.

After attending college at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, Joey \nreturned to Marin County to work in the family business, becoming a \nthird-generation dairyman.\n  I first met Joey during my time as a Marin County supervisor, and \nalthough we did not see eye to eye on every issue, Joey was always \nwilling to work together to try to forge consensus. He never let \npolitical differences get in the way of personal relationships, and \nover the years we formed an unwavering friendship.\n  A well-respected and beloved member of the Marin community, Joey gave \ngenerously of his time and energy to numerous organizations throughout \nhis career, including the Western United Dairymen and the Marin County \nFarm Bureau. A lifelong farming advocate, Joey worked tirelessly to \npreserve California's North Bay agricultural heritage. It is a \ntestament to his lifelong passion that his children decided to follow \nin their father's footsteps by operating their own ranches, with Joey's \nson maintaining the family's operation at B Ranch nearly 100 years \nafter his great-grandfather worked the land. Joey and his family's \nlegacy will help ensure that ranching and dairy operations will be part \nof the fabric of the Marin community for generations to come.\n  With his warm and welcoming nature, Joey remained a leading voice for \nthe ranching community until his final days. I send my deepest \ncondolences to Joey's wife Linda, his son Jarrod, his daughter Jolynn, \nhis brother Jim, and his grandchildren, Collin, Luke, and Layla, along \nwith his entire extended family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6290-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING OFFICER DAVID JOSEPH NELSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio urging the United States \n     Congress to provide an adequate budget for the Department of \n     Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish \n     rules relative to environmentally friendly energy; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n              AMENDED HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NUMBER 9\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6294, August 4, 2015, in the first column, the heading \nreads: A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: AMENDED HOUSE \nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION NUMBER 9\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       Whereas, Ohio has many finite natural energy resources; and\n       Whereas, World energy demand and usage are expected to \n     increase; and\n       Whereas, It is vital to the country's energy future to \n     provide abundant base-load power and peaking energy-on-demand \n     power affordably; and\n       Whereas, Extending Ohio's current energy boom will rest in \n     creating a long-term energy plan and developing clean and \n     affordable energy technologies such as liquid core molten \n     salt reactors and small modular reactors; and\n       Whereas, America possesses a nearly inexhaustible supply of \n     thorium and uranium (more than a billion years) that \n     dramatically exceeds all known potential energy reserves; and\n       Whereas, The elements thorium and uranium have the \n     practical potential to provide unlimited energy resources for \n     Ohioans and Americans on demand in the near future and to \n     provide many other tangible benefits; and\n       Whereas, Better utilization of thorium and uranium in \n     specially designed reactors such as molten salt reactors, \n     including liquid fluoride thorium reactors, can provide \n     energy security from other nations by utilizing Ohio coal and \n     a reactor's nuclear heat energy to produce an abundance of \n     synthetic liquid transportation fuels. These synthetic fuels \n     can be produced for many future generations of Ohioans in a \n     safe, affordable, and in a most environmentally friendly \n     manner; and\n       Whereas, The efficient use of thorium or uranium in a \n     specially designed molten salt reactor allows for greatly \n     increased environmentally friendly energy production that \n     improves the economics of many recycling technologies and \n     raises the standard of living; and\n       Whereas, It is incumbent upon Ohio legislators to be \n     forward-thinking in addressing the future energy challenges \n     for the next generation of Ohioans; and\n       Whereas, Ohio is uniquely capable to commercialize small \n     modular reactors, liquid core molten salt reactors, and \n     integral fast reactors with its research and development \n     assets of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     Plum Brook (Sandusky, Ohio), the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration John H. Glenn Research Center \n     (Cleveland, Ohio area), the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base \n     (Dayton, Ohio), USEC's uranium-enrichment facility (Piketon, \n     Ohio), The Ohio State University's nuclear-research-and-\n     development facilities (Columbus, Ohio), and other private \n     companies and nonprofit organizations that specialize in \n     nuclear-technology development in Ohio; and\n       Whereas, The academic, scientific, manufacturing, and \n     business communities in Ohio have some of the best talent and \n     research and development records in the world. Development of \n     this groundbreaking and economic game-changing technology \n     would serve Ohio's and America's economy better than current \n     federal efforts to develop this technology in partnership \n     with China; and\n       Whereas, Advanced technology using thorium and uranium can \n     affordably provide medical isotopes of materials for medical \n     uses such as treating cancer and HIV/AIDS, diagnostic \n     procedures, and improved health care; and\n       Whereas, S.99, the ``American Medical Isotopes Production \n     Act of 2011,'' was signed into law by President Barack Obama \n     on January 2, 2013, and mandates a reliable domestic supply \n     of molybdenum-99 for medical imaging and diagnostics; and\n       Whereas, Molybdenum-99 is used in more than sixteen million \n     medical procedures annually in the United States; and\n       Whereas, No domestic supply of molybdenum-99 currently \n     exists, and present suppliers use old reactors that result in \n     frequent supply disruptions; and\n       Whereas, The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with \n     licensing nuclear reactors, is not well-funded for \n     establishing procedures for new, advanced reactor designs \n     based on different architectures from today's fleet of light \n     water reactors; and\n       Whereas, Small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt \n     reactors represent a business opportunity that Ohio's \n     manufacturing base is well-suited to exploit. This could \n     potentially result in creating forty thousand manufacturing \n     jobs in total within Ohio, because these jobs have the \n     ability to complement Ohio's coal industry, oil industry, and \n     natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry by increasing jobs \n     in those industries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 131st General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, make the following \n     recommendation for solutions to energy and medical-isotopes \n     production; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Ohio shall create a long-term \n     energy plan that addresses the long-term energy needs of the \n     country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Ohio shall encourage the \n     research and development of liquid-core-molten-salt-reactors \n     and small-modular-reactors technologies as a long-term \n     solution to Ohio's energy needs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Ohio shall advocate that the \n     Congress of the United States mandate, and provide an \n     adequate budget for, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission to establish rules for manufacturing, \n     siting, and licensing of small modular reactors and liquid \n     core molten salt reactors to be built and operated in the \n     United States by private industry for the production of \n     energy and medical isotopes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Ohio shall invest in, seek to \n     acquire grants for, implement programs for, encourage its \n     institutions of higher learning to conduct research into, and \n     attract companies for the development of future technologies \n     that will provide greater energy resources more affordably, \n     abundantly, and in a more environmentally friendly manner \n     than is being done at present; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, the Secretary of the United \n     States Department of Energy, the Commissioners of the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, the Speaker and Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore \n     and Secretary of the United States Senate, each member of the \n     Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-75.

A bill to amend titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act \nto provide for quality reviews of benefit decisions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak once again on the Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance--or DI--Program. As everyone in this \nChamber should know, the DI trust fund is projected to be exhausted \nnext year. That means, absent any change in law, we will be seeing \nacross-the-board benefit cuts of close to 20 percent for DI \nbeneficiaries. Over the last several months, I have come to the floor \non a handful of occasions to talk about this program and the imminent \ndepreciation of its trust fund.\n  I have called on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work \nwith me to address these issues. I will repeat that call today.\n  In addition, today I have introduced three separate bills that are \ndesigned to help update and improve the administration of the DI \nprogram. As we talk about solutions to address the depletion of the DI \ntrust fund, we should also be talking about ways to update the DI \nprogram, ways to make it easier for beneficiaries who can and who \ndesire to return to work to be able to explore those opportunities and \nways to improve efforts to deter and prevent waste and fraud.\n  The first bill I introduced today would update and expand the Social \nSecurity Administration's tools to deter and punish fraudsters who \ncheat the system. The second bill would authorize the Commissioner of \nSSA to provide denied DI applicants with information about employment \nsupport services that are provided by both public agencies and private \nnonprofit organizations.\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\n  That information will help denied applicants find opportunities to \nreenter the workforce, instead of continually cycling through the DI \napplication process. The third bill would require SSA to review hearing \ndecisions by administrative law judges to ensure that they are \nfollowing the law as well as Social Security regulations and policy. \nAll three of these bills are designed to improve the administration of \nthis disability program and make it work better for beneficiaries and \ntaxpayers. They will not, by themselves, solve all of the program's \nfiscal problems, but they will improve the DI system.\n  More work will need to go into this effort, and as chairman of the \ncommittee with jurisdiction over the DI program, I am committed to \nsolving these problems and preventing the massive benefit cuts we will \nsee under current law. I would like to point out three things about my \nstated approach to dealing with the DI program.\n  First, you will note I have not used the word ``crisis'' to describe \nwhat is happening with the DI trust fund. Second, you would be hard-\npressed to find any proposal I have submitted that could credibly be \ncharacterized as ``slashing'' DI benefits. Third, nothing I have put \nforward either today or in the past could conceivably be thought of as \n``privatizing'' disability insurance.\n  I have to point this out because a number of people, including some \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle, have described the \nRepublican efforts to address the DI trust fund depletion using some of \nthose very same words.\n  These individuals are currently more interested in turning this issue \nand the coming benefit cuts into a political football than in actually \nsolving the problem. My question is, What good will that do for the DI \nprogram or its beneficiaries? It is not just the DI program that has \nproblems. Social Security, in general, faces a number of significant \nfiscal and policy challenges.\n  In their most recent report, the Social Security board of trustees, \nwhich includes several members of President Obama's Cabinet, \nrecommended ``that lawmakers address the projected trust fund \nshortfalls in a timely way in order to phase in necessary changes \ngradually and give workers and beneficiaries time to adjust to them.''\n  That says to me the sooner we act to put Social Security on a \nsustainable fiscal path the better it is for Americans and their \nsecurity. It clearly does not mean we should ignore the financial \nproblems facing Social Security or kick the can down the road, hoping \nsome future Congress will get its act together and solve the problems.\n  Of course, providing financial sustainability to Social Security is \neasier said than done. There are reasonable disagreements over how best \nto address Social Security's fiscal shortfalls, including different \nviews on payroll tax revenues that fund the program and how quickly \npromised benefits will grow in the future. Yet we should not limit the \ndiscussion to taxes and outlays.\n  We also should look at how the program can be improved and brought \nup-to-date. For example, the vocational grids and medical guidelines \nthat SSA uses in the disability program are woefully out of date, and \nmuch of the existing structure of Social Security's retirement program \nwas developed long ago, when labor markets and work patterns were much \ndifferent than they are today.\n  We should be working to address all of these challenges, both the \nfiscal and policy challenges now, instead of putting them off for later \ndays. With respect to the DI program in particular, I have been working \nfor some time now to obtain input from experts and stakeholders across \nthe spectrum to figure out how we can make the program work better. \nJoined by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Ryan and Social \nSecurity Subcommittee Chairman Johnson, I have solicited input from \nstakeholders in various venues and continue to welcome ideas or \nproposals from anyone who wants to submit them.\n  The bills I have dropped today are just the latest in a series of \nbills I have introduced to help jump-start the discussion of DI \nreforms. We should not sit idly by and wait for another financing cliff \nto appear around the end of next year. As the Social Security trustees \nmade clear, the sooner Congress acts to address these shortcomings, the \nbetter. Neither DI beneficiaries nor taxpayers benefit from lingering \nuncertainty about how the impending trust fund depletion will be \nresolved.\n  As I have said many times, I am ready and willing to have this \nconversation. Sadly, up to now, I have heard nothing in response from \nthe Obama administration and very little from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. Anyone familiar with the current state of the \nDI trust fund would likely acknowledge that we are going to have to \nreallocate resources into the fund if we are going to prevent the \nimpending benefit cuts from happening next year.\n  Most proposals I have seen, including those from the President's \nbudget, involve a shuffling of money from Social Security's retirement \nfund to the DI trust fund, but even if we have to reallocate resources \nto shore up the DI program, we should not delay confronting the obvious \nneed for reform. On this point, I will once again quote the most recent \nreport from the Social Security trustees, which says, ``Reallocation of \nresources in the absence of substantive relief might serve to delay DI \nreforms and much-needed corrections for Social Security as a whole.''\n  It is true that as many of my colleagues have noted, there have been \nbipartisan agreements to reallocate resources within Social Security in \nthe past. However, in virtually every case, the reallocations were \naccompanied by substantive policy changes. This time should be no \ndifferent. The last time we reallocated resources from the retirement \nto the DI trust fund, DI awards were increasing unexpectedly and \nCongress needed to examine the reasons for this increase before acting \nto change the way the DI system worked.\n  At the time, most people agreed that reforms were necessary and that \nthe reallocation would buy the time Congress needed to come up with \nthose reforms, get them enacted, and put the trust fund on sound fiscal \nfooting. That was more than 20 years ago. Sadly, though not \nsurprisingly, Congress did not follow through with the reforms, and we \nnow face another reserve depletion in the trust fund.\n  Needless to say, doubling down on the same strategy, a strategy that \nhas already failed to produce the needed policy changes, is not a \nprudent course of action. In my view, any resource reallocation that \ngets enacted must be accompanied by changes in the DI program. However, \nthe President does not seem to share this view. The administration has \ncalled for a stand-alone reallocation of payroll tax receipts away from \nthe retirement and survivor's trust fund and into the DI trust fund.\n  This proposal would, depending on the estimate, extend the life of \nthe DI program to the early 2030s, at which point both Social Security \ntrust funds, disability and retirement, will be exhausted at the same \ntime, triggering massive benefit cuts for all beneficiaries. In fact, \nthere are those who would argue that the Social Security retirement \nfund is already exhausted and deeply in debt.\n  That is their idea of a responsible approach to a widely acknowledged \nfiscal problem. Outside of the stand-alone reallocation scheme, the \nPresident's budget offers precious little in the way of reforms to the \nDI program or Social Security in general. In other words, the Obama \nadministration's entire answer to all of Social Security's many fiscal \nproblems is literally to just let future Congress's and administrations \ndeal with those problems.\n  This, to me, would be the height of irresponsibility. While it may \nnot be possible, absent some kind of resource allocation, to keep the \nDI program's current promises between now and the end of the year, we \ncan and should take meaningful steps now to improve the program. That \nis my goal. I hope enough of my colleagues share this goal to make it a \nreality.\n  If we are going to get there, it is going to require bipartisan \ncooperation on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. In other words, we are \ngoing to need to see more from the administration than we have seen \nthus far. It is already August. Despite my repeated requests to the \nadministration and my friends on the other side of the aisle to engage\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\nwith me to work on this issue, I have yet to hear a meaningful \nresponse. I hope that will change.\n  There is no harm in discussing options. I am willing to discuss any \nand all options to fix these problems. There is, on the other hand, a \ngreat deal of potential harm to DI beneficiaries if we continue to \nignore the problem while waiting for a financial cliff to force \npeople's hands. Once again, I urge my friends on both sides of the \naisle to engage on this issue now, and do not wait until it is too late \nto take meaningful action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/04/senate-section/article/S6299-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6299-S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2549.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``The Law Enforcement Access \n     to Data Stored Abroad Act''.\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \n     (Public Law 99-508; 100 Stat. 1848) (referred to in this \n     section as ``ECPA'') was intended to protect the privacy of \n     electronic communications stored with providers of electronic \n     communications services and remote computing services, while \n     balancing the legitimate needs of law enforcement to access \n     records stored by such providers.\n       (2) To strike this balance, ECPA authorized governmental \n     entities to obtain certain categories of communications data \n     from providers using established, pre-existing forms of \n     process--warrants and subpoenas. It also created a new form \n     of court order, in section 2703(d) of title 18, United States \n     Code, that governmental entities could use to obtain \n     additional types of communications data.\n       (3) It has been well established that courts in the United \n     States lack the power to issue warrants authorizing \n     extraterritorial searches and seizures, and neither ECPA nor \n     subsequent amendments extended the warrant power of courts in \n     the United States beyond the territorial reach of the United \n     States.\n       (4) Nevertheless, Congress also recognizes the legitimate \n     needs of law enforcement agencies in the United States to \n     obtain, through lawful process, electronic communications \n     relevant to criminal investigations related to United States \n     persons wherever that content may be stored. Therefore, this \n     title authorizes the use of search warrants \n     extraterritorially only where the Government seeks to obtain \n     the contents of electronic communications belonging to a \n     United States person.\n\n     SEC. 203. SCOPE AND CLARIFICATION OF WARRANT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 121 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 2702(a), by amending paragraph (3) to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(3) a provider of remote computing service or electronic \n     communication service to the public shall not knowingly \n     divulge to any governmental entity the contents of any \n     communication described in section 2703(a), or any record or \n     other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of \n     such service.'';\n       (2) in section 2703--\n       (A) by striking subsections (a) and (b) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) Contents of Wire or Electronic Communication in \n     Electronic Storage.--A governmental entity may require the \n     disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service \n     or remote computing service of the contents of a wire or \n     electronic communication that is in electronic storage with \n     or otherwise stored, held, or maintained by the provider only \n     pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described \n     in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case \n     of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) by a \n     court of competent jurisdiction.
