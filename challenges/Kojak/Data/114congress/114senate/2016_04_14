Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        FAA Reauthorization Bill\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate is closer to passing \nthe most comprehensive aviation security reforms in years, and I hope \nwe will do so today. This important legislation will bolster security \nfor travelers and look out for consumers' interests.\n  Here is how it will help improve security: by improving vetting and \ninspections of airport employees to deter terrorist attacks; by \nexpanding security measures and prescreening zones, which are often \nvulnerable; by shoring up security for international flights coming \ninto our airports; and by improving preparation for everything from \ncyber security attacks to active shooter scenarios to outbreaks of \ncommunicable diseases.\n  This legislation will also benefit consumers by requiring airlines to \noffer refunds for lost or delayed bags, by providing more information \non things like seat availability, and by improving travel for \npassengers with disabilities. It accomplishes this without increasing \ntaxes or fees on passengers and without imposing heavyhanded \nregulations that diminish choice for travelers.\n  This important FAA reauthorization and airport security legislation \nis the result of strong leadership by Senator Thune, the chair of the \nCommerce Committee, and Senator Ayotte, the chair of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, as well as their Democratic counterparts, Senators Nelson \nand Cantwell. They worked diligently across party lines, listened to \ntheir colleagues' ideas, and never stopped working for legislation both \nsides could support.\n  In the Commerce Committee, nearly 60 amendments were accepted from \nboth sides, and the bill passed by voice vote. On the floor, more than \na dozen amendments were accepted from both sides, and I am optimistic \nthat we will soon pass it here on a bipartisan basis. I appreciate the \nefforts of the bill managers to work through amendments and move the \nbill forward.\n  This important FAA reauthorization and airport security legislation \nwas bipartisan from the start. It shows why returning to regular order \nis so important. It is another example of what can be achieved in this \nRepublican-led Senate--a Senate we put back to work for the American \npeople.\n\n\n                    Energy Policy Modernization Bill\n\n  Mr. President, thanks to an agreement reached last night, the Senate \nis now poised to pass broad, bipartisan energy legislation too. We have \nan agreement to take the Energy Policy\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nModernization Act back up, consider even more amendments, and then take \na final vote on it.\n  I was encouraged to see the Democratic leader yesterday agreeing that \nthis is important legislation. It will support more American jobs, more \nAmerican growth, and more American energy independence, and we will \nfinish our work soon.\n  Passage of this bill will represent the culmination of more than a \nyear's worth of hard work, countless listening sessions and oversight \nhearings, numerous amendment votes and debate hours, and impressive \nreserves of determination from both the chair, Senator Murkowski, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Cantwell.\n  Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell never gave up. Even when \npassage of this bill seemed impossible, they never stopped pushing for \nit. I have been impressed by their efforts just as I have been \nimpressed with what this broad bipartisan energy bill can achieve for \nour country.\n\n\n                   Recognition of The Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Energy and FAA Bills\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with the Republican leader that the \nenergy bill is a good bill. As I said yesterday, it is just 3 years \nbehind time. We have tried many times to move forward on it, but \nfilibusters took place by the Republicans, and we were unable to get it \ndone.\n  He is right that Senator Cantwell and Senator Murkowski never gave up \nand they worked through lots of problems. I wish we could have taken \ncare of Flint in the process. That held things up for a little while \nbut not long, and we are still looking at ways to take care of the \npeople of Flint who have been really damaged by bad government.\n  So we are glad that Flint will come up in the near future, and we \nthink we have ways of getting that done. Maybe we will see it in the \nappropriations bills that we are doing.\n  Energy is good, and I am glad we got it done. Now, we have allowed \nthis to move forward. We have not been blocking the bill. We agreed, \neven though the bill is long overdue, and we are not going to treat \npeople the way we were treated. So we are glad that is done.\n  On the FAA bill, I am glad we are going to get something done. As we \nknow, we missed an opportunity to take care of a lot of people who are \ndesperate for help. People in the State of Nevada--geothermal--they \nneed help. Fuel cells, biomass, and other energy initiatives were left \nout. By inadvertence in the drafting of the bill, they were left out. \nThe Republican leader said he will take care of that, and I am \nconfident that he will. It is a longer wait for people, and it makes it \ndifficult for people to hang on to their businesses. I know that his \njob is hard. He has told me and he has told Leader Pelosi that he will \nget this done this year. So we are looking forward to that.\n\n\n   Passing a Budget Resolution and Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow is April 15. Under the Congressional Budget \nAct, that is the day by which Congress is supposed to have completed a \nbudget resolution.\n  This Republican Congress will not meet tomorrow's deadline. We have \nknown that for some time. By all indications, they have no intention of \ndoing anything to pass a budget resolution any time soon.\n  As the Republican leader told reporters earlier this week, in the \nabsence of a budget resolution, Republicans will simply use the top-\nline spending numbers that we agreed upon last year. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       We're waiting to see if the House is able to do a budget. \n     In the meantime I've already announced, and I'll announce \n     again today that we're going to move to appropriations next \n     week, probably starting with energy and water, and we'll mark \n     these bills to the top line that we agreed to in the \n     agreement last year.\n\n  As we know, just a minute ago, he filed cloture on the energy and \nwater bill.\n  If this statement he made sounds familiar, it should, because that is \nwhat we did when we were in the majority. We used the top line numbers \nin the Murray-Ryan budget agreement as a basis for spending bills. \nRepublicans will begin that same process today as the appropriations \nprocess gets under way with the first full committee markup of the \nyear.\n  But how did Republicans react when we did the same thing? They were \nfalling all over themselves--speech after speech--to criticize us. They \nhad charts and graphs and anything to focus on there being no budget. \nThey came out endlessly to taunt us with over-the-top rhetoric. They \nshed crocodile tears by the bucket. They even threatened to withhold \nMembers' pay as punishment. There was legislation produced to that \neffect, but it was all for show.\n  Republicans promised voters that, once in power, they would pass a \nbudget each and every year. That is what the Republican leader promised \nin 2012, saying:\n\n       I don't think the law says, ``Pass a budget unless it's \n     hard,'' so I think there's no question that we would take up \n     our responsibility. . . . We will be passing a budget. . . . \n     Every year.\n\n  That was the Republican pledge: Give us the majority, and we will \npass a budget every year.\n  Well, it is pretty clear that they are going to break that promise.\n  This is just the latest example of the Republicans refusing to meet \ntheir commitments--refusing to do their jobs--even according to their \nown terms.\n  It is just like the refusal to consider Supreme Court nominee Merrick \nGarland. We have years and years' worth of statements from the \nRepublican leader and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in which \nthey said unequivocally that it is the Senate's duty to consider the \nPresident's Supreme Court nominees. I have read their quotes on this \nfloor endlessly.\n  These statements go back decades. The Republican leader wrote papers \nin law school demanding the Senate give Supreme Court nominees all due \nconsideration. Well, all due consideration is not refusing to meet with \na man, not holding hearings, and not allowing a vote.\n  But now that he, the Republican leader, is in a position to do \nsomething about that article he wrote in law school and the other \nstatements that have been made by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, he won't give Merrick Garland a hearing or a vote. He won't \neven meet with him, even though the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nmet with him in secret, not in his office but in the private dining \nroom downstairs, and then went out the back door, described as \nstumbling over chairs to vacate the premises.\n  So, basically, what I ask is this: Where are all the Republican \nSenators who came to the floor to bash Democrats for the lack of a \nbudget resolution? They have gone silent. I am just asking: When are \nthe Republicans going to do their job?\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor wishing to speak, so I ask \nthe Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2068-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2068-S2085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 636, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 636) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell (for Thune/Nelson) amendment No. 3679, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Thune amendment No. 3680 (to amendment No. 3679), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The senior Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the motion \nto end debate so the Senate can vote and pass the pro-security and pro-\nconsumer provisions within the bipartisan Federal Aviation \nAdministration Reauthorization Act of 2016.\n  For the past 2 weeks on the Senate floor and earlier at the Commerce \nCommittee, we have engaged in a constructive and open process to \nconsider amendments making important changes to this legislation that \nsets\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\naviation policies for our country. On the Senate floor we added 19 \namendments, 10 from Democrats and 9 from Republican Senators, and at \nthe Commerce Committee we approved 57 amendments, 34 from Democrats and \n23 from Republicans. A number of these amendments were substantial, \nincluding the vast majority of the aviation security provisions within \nthe legislation.\n  We have also agreed to set aside discussions on certain issues for \nnow so we could continue to have a bill with broad bipartisan support. \nOn some policy issues where there was disagreement, we found the will \nof the Senate through negotiation and votes. Our debate has been \nconstructive, and I value the process by which we have allowed Senators \nto make their mark on this bill.\n  After 2 weeks of consideration, it is now time to conclude our work \non the bipartisan legislation I introduced along with my friend, the \nranking member from Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, and our Aviation \nSubcommittee leaders, Kelly Ayotte and Maria Cantwell.\n  The bill we can vote on today has been described in the Washington \nPost as ``one of the most passenger-friendly Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization bills in a generation.''\n  Even more important, this bill includes strong, new security measures \nthat address the threat that ISIS and other terrorist groups pose to \nairline passengers. It is a comprehensive bill addressing needs in \ncyber security, the aircraft design approval process, undue regulatory \nburdens on noncommercial pilots, airport infrastructure, rural air \nservice, lithium battery safety, mental health screening for pilots, \ncommunicable disease preparedness, drone safety, and many other \nimportant issues. This bill helps the public that relies on our air \ntransportation system, and we shouldn't let them down.\n  A vote yes on the motion to end debate allows us to move forward and \nto get these reforms going forward by agreeing to ultimately vote on \nthem and to vote on passage of this bill.\n  Again, I thank all who are involved. Senator Nelson and I started \nthis process months ago. I think we had somewhere on the order of seven \nhearings, full committee and subcommittee, in debating and helping \nshape the bill. It was a very constructive process as we went through \nthe markup, where we incorporated the suggestions and good ideas that \ncame from many Members of our committee. We tried to continue that \nprocess on the floor of the Senate, and we have been successful in \nadding some amendments that strengthen the bill. I wish we could add \nmore. I hope we can still reach agreement. There are still negotiations \nunderway for another package of 25 or 30 amendments that we would like \nto get added to this bill if we can get the level of cooperation that \nis necessary to accomplish that.\n  In the end, we need to pass this. It is important for the American \npeople. It is a piece of legislation that needs to get voted on in the \nSenate, hopefully on to the House, and eventually on the President's \ndesk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. He \nhas been a real friend and a champion in being able to work together in \nthe best traditions of the Senate in trying to craft--and I think we \nhave successfully--a bipartisan piece of legislation that continues, as \nthe Senator has quoted from one of the papers, to advance the FAA in a \nway that we should be sensitive to the needs of the flying public.\n  It is also this Senator's hope that where we have disagreements on \njust a few amendments, that after we have a big vote invoking cloture \nso we can move on with the bill, that a package of 30-some amendments--\nnoncontroversial, bipartisan--would then be allowed to be adopted by \nunanimous consent, and then it is possible that we could move on to the \nfinal passage early this afternoon. That is this Senator's hope.\n  Let me underscore what the Senator has already said. There are a lot \nof challenges in how we conduct ourselves in the airspace of this \ncountry. There are a lot of important things that we have to do, such \nas modernizing the air traffic control system, the next generation of \ntechnology in moving us efficiently, and in the process it has to be \nsafe.\n  Therefore, as we see new kinds of challenges because of technology--\nfor example, unmanned aerial vehicles, drones--we have to approach that \nwith great caution and make sure we know what we are doing so the \nflying public is safe.\n  I hope we get a big vote on this motion for cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 3679.\n         Mitch McConnell, Daniel Coats, Roger F.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 627\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, America was horrified 2 years ago as the \nscandal at the VA unfolded. We heard about veterans dying while they \nwere waiting for care. Meanwhile, we discovered that VA employees \nmanipulated appointment wait lists to hide the fact that the VA \ncouldn't provide the care our veterans needed in a timely fashion.\n  The denial of earned care is always tragic, but it is inexcusable \nwhen the denial is driven by bureaucratic tampering and falsifications. \nCooking the books was one bureaucratic offense, but not holding \naccountable those responsible is an additional bureaucratic failure, \nand one that continues to haunt our system.\n  These weren't just a few scattered incidents either. The VA inspector \ngeneral investigated 73 VA facilities across\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nthe country and found problems in 51 of them, ranging from rule \nviolations to outright fraud. These reports demonstrate that \ninappropriate scheduling practices were systematic at the VA.\n  This map shows how widespread the wait-list rule violations and \nmanipulations have been. The inspector general's office found out how \nour veterans were treated when they called up looking for care. The \ninformation the VA gave was manipulated to make it seem as though the \nVA was doing much better than it was. We literally know that veterans \ndied while waiting for care. That is shameful, and we owe it to those \nwho served this Nation to serve them. They earned this by defending us \nand our freedoms.\n  Unfortunately, one of those 51 cases was the VA medical center in my \nhome State of New Hampshire.\n  A New Hampshire newspaper summarizes the inspector general's report \nas follows:\n\n       Staff at the Manchester VA Medical Center manipulated \n     appointment dates and refused to schedule referrals beyond 14 \n     days in some speciality departments, all to make it appear \n     patients were being seen quickly.\n       One report also shows that top officials at the Manchester \n     VA discouraged the use of electronic waiting lists.\n       Another shows extremely long waits at the facility's Pain \n     Clinic, where one patient waited an average of seven to eight \n     months for injection treatments.\n       The reports show a near obsession with keeping numbers down \n     when it comes to the length of time that veterans had to wait \n     for appointments, which is one of the ways bonuses for \n     hospital officials were determined.\n\n  Bonuses were determined by how you performed on the scheduling and \nwhether you were actually meeting the needs of our veterans on time. \nYet we know they were manipulating wait lists across the country to \nshow that they were, in fact, serving our veterans when they were not.\n  Last week I met with the current Manchester VA medical center \ndirector to discuss the findings of the inspector general's report. \nEven though it didn't occur under her leadership, these findings are \nserious and must be dealt with appropriately. While I was encouraged to \nhear of the steps the director has taken to address the scheduling \nmisconduct, I will be closely following the medical center's practices \nand performance.\n  We cannot let this happen again. Part of not letting it happen again \nis what brings me to the floor today. I will make sure we aren't \nincentivizing misconduct and allowing wrongdoers to get away with it, \nwhether it is the wait-list manipulations or misconduct.\n  Unfortunately, the wait-list scandal isn't the only scandal at the \nVA. There is a common theme with all these scandals: Those committing \nmisconduct are getting bonuses--yes, bonuses. Those involved in \nwrongdoing are getting checks paid by the American taxpayer. That is \nunacceptable, and that is why I introduced bipartisan legislation to \nimprove accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs by \nrequiring the VA Secretary to claw back bonuses paid to VA employees \nwho were involved in serious misconduct or felonies. It would also \nrequire the VA to retain a copy of any reprimand or admonishment given \nto an employee by the Department which would then be in that employee's \npermanent record. Keeping that information in someone's employment \nrecord seems like common sense, but we have to pass this bill in order \nto do that. Amazingly, the Secretary of the VA doesn't currently have \nthe authority to claw back bonuses even if, as with the wait list, the \nperpetrator's misconduct led to a bigger bonus check. That is \nunacceptable. We cannot reward those who commit fraud and misconduct by \ndoling out taxpayer dollars.\n  A recent report noted that in 2014 the VA paid out $140 million in \nbonuses. Nearly half of the VA's employees got bonuses. More \nimportantly, we know that individuals who were implicated in an array \nof scandals also received bonuses. For example, the director of the \nPhoenix VA hospital who was fired for her misconduct got a $9,000 \nbonus. The VA senior managers who improperly leveraged their positions \nto get hundreds of thousands of dollars in relocation funds to move to \nnew facilities, along with a bump in pay--even though they were \ncommitting misrepresentations and fraud--got bonuses. A VA employee who \nrecently pleaded the Fifth Amendment before a congressional committee \ngot a bonus. Executives overseeing the $1 billion-over-budget VA \nmedical center construction project in Colorado got bonuses. A doctor \nimplicated in overprescribing opioids at the Tomah VA facility called \n``Candy Land,'' where veterans were harmed--bonus.\n\n  We can't let these bonuses keep going to wrongdoers. It will just \ncontinue the erosion of trust of our veterans, who have done so much to \ndefend this Nation and our freedom. That is why we need to pass this \nbill. The VA Secretary must be active in pursuing the disciplinary \nactions against VA employees guilty of misconduct so they aren't \ngetting bonuses and taking away resources that could go to help our \nveterans. Without my legislation, the VA Secretary does not have the \nauthority right now to go after a bonus, even if the bonus is given to \na wrongdoer, to claw that money back.\n  This bill passed out of committee by a voice vote. The records \nretention provisions in this bill passed out of the House of \nRepresentatives by voice vote. Let's put this authority into law so \nthat those who break the law don't get bonuses. That is why I am \nstanding on the floor today asking for unanimous consent to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 240, S. 627. I further ask that \nthe Ayotte and Brown amendments be agreed to; the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time and passed; the title amendment be agreed to; and \nthat the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I agree \nwith much of what the Senator from New Hampshire said, and that is that \nour veterans deserve to have the highest quality care by the Veterans \nAdministration. Those employees at the Veterans Administration who have \nnot carried out their responsibility should be disciplined, and when \nthere are adverse findings, there should be consequences to them. So I \nagree with much of what she has said.\n  However, let us be mindful that the overwhelming number of Federal \nworkers, including those at the Veterans Administration, are hard-\nworking public servants, asked to do more with less resources. They \nhave been through freezes, furloughs, government shutdowns, \nsequestration--you name it.\n  I understand that the Veterans' Affairs Committee is considering more \ncomprehensive legislation, as they should. As my colleague from New \nHampshire has mentioned, this deals with one aspect of those who have \nadverse findings in regard to their ability to get bonuses or the \nreprimand on their record.\n  Here is my problem. If we use a unanimous consent request, there is \nno opportunity for amendment, and there is no opportunity for debate. \nWhen I finish my comments, I am going to ask that the Senator amend her \nunanimous consent request to include an amendment that I wish to offer. \nLet me explain what it does.\n  Yes, we want to hold the employee accountable--those who have not \ncarried out the public trust in which there are adverse findings. But \nthere also has to be accountability for the supervisors, for those who \nshould be managing the agency so that we don't have employees doing \nwhat they did.\n  Managers need to have tools. They need to be able to manage their \nemployees. They need to be able to determine how their employees are \nhandled if we are going to hold them accountable, and I want to hold \nthe supervisors accountable. So my amendment would allow the supervisor \nto determine the length of the suspension of the bonus that the \nindividual could receive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If I could just ask Members to take their \nconversations out of the Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I appreciate that, and I thank the Presiding Officer very \nmuch. I thought I was getting an agreement here.\n  So to continue, it could be longer than the 5 years that is in the \nbill of the Senator from New Hampshire, but it would be the manager or \nsupervisor who would determine the length of the suspension of the \nright to receive the\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\nbonus, so that the manager has the tools in order to manage the \nworkforce and we can hold the supervisor accountable.\n  The second amendment is similar, as it relates to the reprimand being \nretained in the records. It allows the manager to have the discretion \nas to the length of time.\n  The bill that the Senator from New Hampshire is recommending is a \nhard 5-year period, and it doesn't give the manager the ability to use \nthese tools as ways to advance service to our veterans.\n  The bottom line here is service to our veterans. That is the bottom \nline--that they get the services they deserve.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify her request so \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. \n240, S. 627; that in lieu of the committee-reported substitute and \ntitle amendments, that the Cardin substitute amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed; that the Cardin title amendment be agreed to; and that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  That would carry out the modifications that I said, giving the \nmanager the ability to impose either a shorter or longer period of time \nthan the bill of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Hampshire so modify \nher request?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. No, I do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nMaryland. I agree, and I believe there are many hard-working Federal \nemployees. The reason that I have been fighting for this bill in \nparticular is, No. 1, to make sure that those who commit misconduct are \nheld accountable. No. 2, I actually want to make sure that we aren't \nsending the wrong message to the people who are working hard and doing \ntheir jobs. When they see someone else who has committed misconduct by \nliterally manipulating wait lists get a bonus, that actually \ndemoralizes the good, hard-working employees who are doing their jobs \nand serving veterans.\n\n  So this is about making sure that the people who actually do a good \njob get recognized. But when you give a bonus to someone who has \ncommitted misconduct, you not only obviously undermine our system--\nthinking about the veterans who have served our Nation with so much \ncourage and done so much for us--not only do we corrode their trust, \nbut I think we corrode the trust of the workforce that is doing really \ngreat work every day, and I want to thank those who are doing the good \nwork on our behalf. I have had a chance to meet many of them.\n  I want to address the point of the Senator from Maryland about giving \nmanagers authority. I wish to point out that the problem we have here \nis that this is rampant--absolutely rampant. If we look at what \nhappened with the director of the Phoenix VA who lost her job--fired \nfor misconduct--where literally wait lists were manipulated and \nveterans died, she got a $9,000 bonus. So who are we going to leave \ndiscretion to here? Many of the managers, I know, need to manage the \nfacilities, which is important. But when it comes to the bonus issue, \nwe literally would be putting, for example in the Phoenix situation, \nthe individual who gets fired for overseeing all of this in charge of \nwhether and how long other people's bonuses are clawed back. I would \nalso say that this has been rampant, unfortunately, about management, \nand not just of the director of the Phoenix VA but the other examples I \ngave, including the VA senior managers who improperly leveraged their \npositions to get hundreds of thousands of dollars in relocation funds. \nSo, in other words, they were misappropriating taxpayer dollars. They \ngot bonuses too. They are managers.\n  We have executives overseeing the huge cost overrun in the Colorado \nVA who got bonuses. We have many examples. If we put this at the \ndiscretion of how long this is going to go in place instead of putting \na logical time period in place, which my bill does, then we are going \nto keep perpetuating the same situation where the discretion makes it \nso it doesn't happen. That worries me, because, unfortunately, we have \na pattern here that needs to be addressed.\n  Second, I would just say that, as we look at even the ability to \nretain records, most employers do have standard recordkeeping in terms \nof if you receive a reprimand or an admonishment and how long that is \nretained. So if we just leave that completely loosey-goosey discretion \namong managers, where we have already established some of them have \nbeen part of this misconduct, then I fear there really will be no \naccountability and these provisions will not have the teeth in them \nthat they should.\n  Let me just say that this bill that we have been working on, that did \npass out of committee, is something that I have been working on and \nnegotiating for months, working and taking people's concerns into \naccount. It does ensure that, before any employee is subject to having \nthe bonus clawed back, they do have the opportunity for due process. So \nthat is built into this to challenge the underlying claims made against \nthem. But if we put this all into a discretionary basis, then we are \njust going to be in the same situation that we are right now and not \nhave the teeth that we need in this commonsense measure.\n  I talked to some of my constituents about this issue, and they can't \nbelieve that we actually have to pass a law to say that if you got a \nbonus and you committed misconduct--in fact, one of the reasons you got \nthe bonus is because of the misconduct, because you manipulated the \nwait list--yes, you can give that money back, and you shouldn't be \nreceiving a bonus. It is kind of shocking that this isn't just common \nsense. But right now the VA Secretary does not have this authority.\n  Our veterans deserve better. This is plain common sense. I am \ndisappointed that the modification that was sought on the floor would \nweaken this commonsense bill. I am going to continue to fight for more \naccountability in our VA. But let's have some common sense in all of \nthis. We shouldn't be rewarding our employees who are committing \nmisconduct for the very conduct that they are committing and that \nunfortunately is harming our veterans who have done so much for this \nNation.\n  I am the granddaughter of a World War II veteran. My husband is an \nIraq veteran. I have had the privilege in my job of meeting so many of \nour veterans, both current Active-Duty military and those who have \nserved in conflicts going back to World War II. There is no greater \nexample of patriotism and what makes our country great than our \nveterans. Really, if we think about what has happened in our VA and how \nshameful it is, this is something that we need to make sure we get \nright once and for all for those who have defended this Nation and who \nreally show us what it means to be an American.\n  So I am going to continue to fight for such a commonsense piece of \nlegislation, but I hope my colleagues will join me in this so that we \ncan make sure that the VA performs its mission, which is to give our \nveterans the best care they can receive and that they certainly have \nearned defending our great Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work Senator Ayotte \nhas put into her bill and her willingness to work across the aisle with \nthe ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator \nBlumenthal, and Senator Brown. Since I objected to her unanimous \nconsent request and she objected to my counteroffer, I would like to \ntake a few moments to outline my concerns about her bill and explain \nwhy I offered a complete substitute amendment that reflects those \nconcerns and an amendment to change the title.\n  At the outset, I want to make it clear that I do not condone \nmalfeasance by any Federal executive or employee. The well-documented \nproblems at the Veterans Administration, VA, are particularly troubling \nbecause they harmed the men and women who have defended our Nation--and \ntheir families. That is unacceptable.\n  There is an old proverb, ``You can fix the blame or you can fix the \nproblem.'' Actually, VA Secretary Robert McDonald, his leadership team, \nand the VA rank-and-file are doing both.\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\n  To that end, I would encourage my colleagues to read the December 9, \n2015, testimony of Sloan D. Gibson, Deputy Secretary of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  In the context of patient access and scheduling data manipulation \nconcerns that came to light at the Phoenix VA Medical Center, Deputy \nSecretary Gibson reported that, as of October 2015, VA completed 97 \npercent of appointments within 30 days of the clinically indicated or \nveteran's preferred date; 91 percent within 14 days; 87 percent within \n7 days; and 24 percent on the same day. VA's average wait time for \ncompleted primary care appointments is 4 days; specialty care is 5 \ndays; and mental health care is 3 days.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration, VBA, completed 1.4 million \nclaims in fiscal year 2015, nearly 67,000 more than the previous year \nand the highest completion rate in VA history. Fiscal year 2015 marked \nthe 6th year in a row of more than 1 million claims.\n  VBA reduced its claims backlog 88 percent from a peak of 610,000 in \nMarch 2013 to a historic low of 75,122 and reduced inventory 58 percent \nfrom a peak of 884,000 in July 2012 to 369,328, 28 percent lower than \nfiscal year 2014.\n  The average number of days a veteran is waiting for a claims \ndecision, pending, is 91 days, a 191-day reduction from a peak of 282 \ndays in March 2013 and the lowest average number of days pending in the \n21st century. VBA's average days to complete is now 129 days--a 60-day \nreduction from fiscal year 2014. So VA is improving its services to \nveterans. That is fixing the problem.\n  Now, what about VA supervisors and employees who engaged in \nmisbehavior or wrongdoing? There is a popular misconception that you \ncan't get rid of Federal workers. In fact, in fiscal year 2015, 2,348 \nVA employees were removed, terminated during probation, or retired or \nresigned with a removal action pending. Over 1,800 of these \nindividuals--or more than 75 percent--were fired. To be clear, these \nnumbers pertain to the entire Department for all infractions and are \nnot limited to the wait list problem.\n  It is a mistake just to focus on those numbers. As Secretary McDonald \nand Deputy Secretary Gibson wrote in the January 21, 2016, Wall Street \nJournal, ``You can't fire your way to excellence.'' But the point here \nis that punishments have been and are being meted out; people have had \ntheir careers ended. That is fixing the blame.\n  I will briefly outline my concerns with S. 627, even as reported and \nas it would be modified by the Ayotte and Brown amendments.\n  First, the bill deprives the Secretary of the discretionary authority \nneeded to manage and discipline the VA workforce appropriately.\n  Second, the bill establishes new precedents for punishing Federal \nworkers that haven't been thoroughly vetted and may have harmful \nunintended consequences.\n  Third the bill has two major components. The first deals with \nbonuses; the second deals with employees' personnel records and \nreprimands and admonishments. The second component was added at mark-up \nand was not a subject considered when the Veterans Affairs Committee \nheld its hearing on bonuses on May 13, 2015. The Republican leader \ntalks about the need to restore regular order. There ought to be a \nhearing regarding the second component. And fairness dictates that a \nwitness from a Federal employee union, such as the American Federation \nof Government Employees, which represents many VA workers, should be \ninvited to testify.\n  As Senators Blumenthal, Murray, Sanders, Brown, Tester, and Hirono \nstated in their Minority Views in Senate Report 114-148:\n\n       Besides the substantive issues with the provision that we \n     have identified, section 2 of S. 627 was derived from S. \n     1496, a bill that has not been considered in a legislative \n     hearing. For a significant and controversial provision like \n     section 2 of S. 627, the Committee should have held a \n     legislative hearing to give all Members the opportunity to \n     hear from witnesses and fully understand the consequences of \n     this provision.\n\n  I am not objecting simply to object. I would like to work with the \njunior Senator from New Hampshire to see if we can find common ground, \nand that is why I sent a substitute amendment and title change \namendment, which needs to be done separately, to the desk, and asked \nher to modify her consent request to reflect these two amendments.\n  Let me explain exactly what I am proposing. The unanimous consent \nthat has been hot-lined consists of three elements. The first is S. 627 \nas reported. The second is an Ayotte amendment modifying provisions of \nthat bill dealing with bonuses. The third is a Brown amendment \nmodifying provisions of that bill dealing with reprimands and \nadmonishments.\n  What I have done is to combine all three elements into a single \nsubstitute and modify it to restore to the Secretary some managerial \ndiscretion, which I feel is essential for someone charged with running \na department the size of a Fortune Six company.\n  As reported, the title of the bill is ``To require the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to revoke bonuses paid to employees involved in \nelectronic wait list manipulations, and for other purposes''.\n  While the wait list problem may have spawned this bill, that title is \ninaccurate. The bill has no such limitations implied by that title; it \napplies Department-wide for any offense.\n  So I propose a simple amendment changing the title to read: ``To \namend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to recoup inappropriate bonuses paid to or on behalf \nof employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other \npurposes.''\n  Section 1 of S. 627 as reported and as further modified by the Ayotte \namendment prohibits the Secretary from awarding bonuses for 5 years to \nany employee who is the subject of an ``adverse finding.'' My \nsubstitute amendment changes that provision to give the Secretary \ndiscretion to withhold future bonuses ``until such date as the \nSecretary considers appropriate.''\n  Now, my language theoretically empowers the Secretary to withhold \nbonuses for more than 5 years. The point here is to provide the \nSecretary with the flexibility needed to manage, discipline, and \nincentivize 340,000 people in an appropriate fashion. I wonder if there \nis any Senator who has managed a workforce as large as the VA's and, if \nso, would have preferred surrendering his or her discretion to make \npersonnel decisions as he or she thought necessary.\n  Section 1 of S. 627 as reported and further modified by the Ayotte \namendment of the bill states in part that:\n\n       The Secretary may base an adverse finding . . . on an \n     investigation by, determination of, or information provided \n     by the Inspector General of the Department or another senior \n     ethics official of the Department or the Comptroller General \n     of the United \n     States . . .\n\n  I believe the Secretary must base an adverse finding on an \nindependent determination. As I have stated, I fully support increasing \naccountability at the VA--and that includes making sure that a VA \nemployee does not receive a bonus while engaging in misconduct.\n  Senator Ayotte's bill, however, does not require the Secretary to \nbase an adverse finding on the determination of an independent \ndecisionmaker. My amendment would cure this defect and set appropriate \nlimits by requiring the Secretary to base an adverse finding on an \nindependent determination. By doing so, it would ensure that bonus bans \nare not arbitrary.\n  Section 1 of S. 627 as reported and further modified by the Ayotte \namendment requires the Secretary to recoup bonuses paid to employees if \nthey are subsequently subject to an adverse finding with respect to the \nyears during which the bonuses were awarded.\n  Furthermore, section 1 requires VA employees to certify that they \nwill repay any bonus received during a year in which an adverse finding \nmay subsequently be made.\n  These provisions raise many unanswered questions, including how such \nactions would be treated with respect to determining Federal and State \ntax liabilities. But I have left these provisions unchanged.\n  Section 1 of S. 627 as reported and further modified by the Ayotte \namendment states that ``The Secretary may promulgate such rules as the \nSecretary considers appropriate to carry out this section.''\n  Considering the unprecedented nature of the sanctions in section 1, I \nbelieve it is imperative that the Secretary engage in a formal \nrulemaking\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nto allow all interested parties the opportunity to weigh in with their \nconcerns and suggestions.\n  S. 627 is characterized as a legislative response to a specific \nmanagement crisis at the VA. Yet it sets several new precedents and \npenalties that will be applied in a much broader context. As such, I \nbelieve it would be appropriate to sunset the bill after 3 years to \nencourage Congress to revisit whether it is an appropriate legislative \nremedy to the ``wait list'' problem at the VA and whether the bill is \ncausing any adverse unintended consequences.\n  My original proposal to the junior Senator from New Hampshire \nincluded two sunset provisions, for section 1 and for section 2, which \nI will discuss momentarily. Senator Ayotte objected to the sunset \nprovisions, so I have removed them from my substitute amendment at the \ndesk.\n  Section 2 of S. 627 as reported and further modified by the Brown \namendment requires the Secretary to retain reprimands and/or \nadmonishments in the personnel records of affected employees for a \nminimum of 5 years. While this is a significant improvement over the \noriginal provision, which was to retain such actions permanently, it is \nstill problematic.\n  First, as I mentioned previously, this provision was added after the \nVeterans Affairs Committee conducted its hearing and, consequently, \nhasn't been sufficiently considered.\n  Furthermore, Active-Duty personnel can request that reprimands be \nremoved from their military personnel records jackets, MPRJs, at any \ntime, and reprimands can only remain in the MPRJ for a maximum of 3 \nyears.\n  One in three VA employees is a veteran. Should someone have fewer \nrights to clear his or her personnel record as a civilian than he or \nshe had while serving on Active Duty?\n  Section 2 of the bill is unlikely to increase accountability at the \nVA. However well intentioned the provision may be, it is much more \nlikely to cause significant increases in taxpayer-funded litigation \ncosts because the VA will no longer be able to resolve routine \npersonnel disputes through Clear Record Settlement Agreements, CRAs. \nThe Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB, reported in 2013 that 95 \npercent of agency representatives resolved disputes using Negotiated \nSettlement Agreements, NSAs, and 89 percent of these agreements \ninvolved CRAs.\n  Quoting again from the Minority Views I referred to previously:\n\n       In testimony before the House Committee of Veterans' \n     Affairs, VA noted that it is the standard practice across the \n     Federal government, including the Department of Defense, for \n     letters of reprimand and/or admonishment to be retained on a \n     time-limited basis. According to VA, making letters of \n     reprimand or admonishment permanent would prevent VA managers \n     from ``settling workplace grievances with employees with \n     terms that would limit the amount of time these documents \n     remain in the employee's permanent record,'' and it would \n     restrict VA managers from removing these documents as a \n     ``term of settlement.'' Both of these tools are frequently \n     used by VA managers to ``resolve complaints before they go \n     into costly and high-risk'' litigation. These tools also \n     allow VA managers to promote good performance of employees \n     ``because they are usually conditioned upon no further \n     misconduct of the type that initially led to the reprimand \n     or admonishment.''\n\n  Given all of these problems with section 2, even as it has been \nsignificantly improved by the amendment offered by the senior Senator \nfrom Ohio, I come back to the basic proposition that the Secretary must \nhave sufficient discretion when it comes to managing the VA workforce. \nMy amendment gives the Secretary that discretion by allowing, not \nmandating, that reprimands and/or admonishments may be retained for 5 \nyears. Note that this still represents a significant departure from \ncurrent practices government-wide. And, as I mentioned a moment ago, I \noriginally proposed sunsetting section 2 after 3 years, but I removed \nthat provision from the current version of the substitute amendment.\n  I sincerely believe these changes are reasonable and improve S. 627, \nand I hope the junior Senator from New Hampshire will ultimately agree.\n  To reiterate, no one condones what happened at the VA. But it is \nimportant to acknowledge that accountability is being restored and the \nmiscreants are being punished.\n  As Secretary McDonald and Deputy Secretary Gibson wrote in the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       You can't fire your way to excellence. You have to inspire \n     the people you keep to do better, and you have to recruit and \n     inspire new talent. You can't do either by capriciously \n     punishing people on the basis of unsubstantiated rumors, \n     complaints or media reports . . . Neither we nor anyone else \n     can accomplish the VA's mission of caring for veterans by \n     depriving VA employees of basic fairness. To do right by \n     veterans, we must do right by VA employees. We will do right \n     by both, whatever the consequences.\n\n  I am privileged to represent 130,000 civilian federal workers, \nincluding members of the Senior Executive Service, SES; other senior \nmanagers; and rank-and-file employees who work in Maryland. Tens of \nthousands more live in Maryland or live and work in Maryland. Nearly 20 \npercent of these individuals have already served our Nation in uniform. \nOverwhelmingly, these individuals are hard-working, dedicated, and \npatriotic Americans who perform critical missions under difficult \ncircumstances. In the last 5 years, civilian Federal workers have \n``contributed'' $182 billion to deficit reduction. They have endured a \n3-year pay freeze. They lost $1 billion in pay due to furloughs related \nto sequestration. They have been forced during government shutdowns to \nstay home against their will or to work without being paid on time. And \nthey have been victimized by data breaches that have compromised their \nmost sensitive personal information--some of which the Washington Post \nreported on January 31, 2016, has literally been provided to the \nIslamic State terrorist group.\n  While we can and will disagree on the proper size and scope of the \nFederal Government, I would hope we can all agree that we want the \n``best and brightest'' to perform critical missions such as providing \nour veterans with the care they have earned so valiantly. This is \nespecially true with regard to the senior executives entrusted with \nmanaging large workforces and multibillion dollar budgets.\n  Depriving or diminishing due process rights at the VA already has \ncaused the number of applicants over the past 3 years for both title 5 \nSES positions and title 38 equivalent positions to decline \nsignificantly.\n  With respect to VA title 5 SES positions, in fiscal year 2013, there \nwere 8,721 applicants. In fiscal year 2014, that number dropped to \n6,908. In fiscal year 2015, it dropped even further to 6,317.\n  With respect to VA title 38 SES equivalent employees, in fiscal year \n2013, there were 1,020 applicants. In fiscal year 2014, that number \ndropped to 432. In fiscal year 2015, it dropped even further to 228.\n  One might argue that these declines represent the ``winnowing out'' \nof unqualified or underqualified applicants.\n  I would argue it is just as likely, if not more so, that these \ndeclines represent the winnowing out of highly qualified applicants who \ncould have helped to restore greater accountability and better service \nat the VA, but were discouraged from applying because the deck is being \nstacked against them.\n  We all want our veterans to receive the best care possible. So I \nreiterate my sincere desire to work with the junior Senator from New \nHampshire. As I said at the outset of my remarks, I appreciate the hard \nwork Senator Ayotte has put into her bill and her willingness to work \nacross the aisle with the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Brown.\n  Rather than simply leaving the matter here, I would note that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has identified several Senate bills that \nprovide the agency with the authority and tools it needs to address \nwhat the VA calls ``breakthrough priorities'' such as: improving the \nveterans' experience; improving access to health care; improving \ncommunity care; developing a simplified appeals process; and reducing \nhomelessness among veterans.\n  As I understand it, there is an effort underway in the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee to develop comprehensive legislation that helps the \nVA to meet these priorities while also addressing accountability and \ninternal staffing issues. I think it makes sense to work on a \ncomprehensive reform and accountability package bill rather than trying \nto pass individual bills in a piecemeal fashion, and I look forward to \nworking with the junior Senator\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nfrom New Hampshire and every other Senator concerned about our veterans \nto accomplish this objective in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just a little while ago there was an \noverwhelming vote to proceed with the FAA bill, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration bill, a very important bill. I know how hard the \nmanagers have worked on it--the chairman, the ranking member--and I \nhave a tremendous amount of respect for them. I voted no. Only four of \nus voted no. It is rare that I do that, and I felt it was important to \nexplain why.\n  We have in our Nation an amazing system of transportation, and we \nalways have to stay on top of it to make it safer and safer. There is \none thing we know without a doubt. We know it intuitively, but we also \nknow it because the National Transportation Safety Board has told us \nthat the No. 1 problem they face in terms of safety is fatigue.\n  We all know how it is. All of us, regardless of what we do for a \nliving, know how it feels when we are utterly exhausted. We are not \nmaking the same decisions we would make. We can't carry them out the \nway we otherwise would. It is not rocket science. It is sleep science. \nWe know about it because the experts have told us, and the NTSB has \ntold us.\n  I will show a picture of two planes. They look exactly alike. As our \nkids say, one of these things is not like the other. Here is a cargo \nplane and passenger jet. They are the same size. They fly over the same \nskies. They have pilots whom we trust, whom we count on.\n  Today, because of special interest pressure, there is a different set \nof rest rules. The passenger plane pilot can only fly up to 9 hours a \nday because--rightly so, with all of that responsibility--that pilot \nhas to get rest. The cargo plane pilot flies the same exact plane. That \npilot can be on duty up to 16 hours a day before he or she is \nguaranteed adequate rest.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has worked very hard in recent months, \nand I know the energy it took to go out and do what he did. I know what \nit was like when I was running for the Senate so many times--thank you, \nCalifornia--with almost 40 million people in the State, how hard it \nwas, how much rest was needed to be sharp so we could think. In our \nwork if we make a mistake, it only hurts us, but when a pilot makes a \nmistake, it can hurt a much larger community because the cargo plane is \nflying over the same homes as the passenger jet. How does it make sense \nto say one can be on duty up to 16 hours and the other cannot, \nespecially when the National Transportation Safety Board has said pilot \nfatigue is one of the biggest problems we are facing today.\n  Now one might ask: Can you prove that it is a problem? Yes, I am \ngoing to prove it to you. I am going to show a graphic of a \nconversation that took place between two cargo pilots, the pilot and \ncopilot. This was 2013, and they were over Alabama. These are excerpts \nfrom the grave. This is dramatic. It isn't me trying to persuade the \nPresiding Officer. These are the pilots.\n\n       Pilot 1: I mean I don't get that. You know it should be one \n     level of safety for everybody.\n       Pilot 2: It makes no sense at all.\n       Pilot 1: No it doesn't at all.\n       Pilot 2: And to be honest, it should be across the board. \n     To be honest in my opinion whether you are flying passengers \n     or cargo . . . if you're flying this time of day . . . the \n     you know fatigue is definitely. . . .\n       Pilot 1: Yeah . . . yeah . . . yeah. . . .\n       Pilot 2: When my alarm went off I mean I'm thinkin', I'm so \n     tired.\n       Pilot 2: I know.\n\n  Look what happened to that plane within hours of that conversation. \nLook what happened to that plane. This shows what happened, and the \npilots are dead.\n  After the flight recorder was released and this conversation was out, \nI thought for sure this administration would do the right thing. They \ndid the wrong thing, and the Senate did the wrong thing. This isn't \npartisan.\n  We have the Obama administration, which I agree with, and today I \nheard some amazing news on jobs. I am just saying on this they haven't \nbeen right. There ought to be no disparity between a pilot who is \nflying a passenger jet and a pilot who is flying a cargo jet. The \npilots are telling us this. The pilots who are telling us this are not \nselfish. In fact, many of them are the pilots of passenger jets such as \nSouthwest Airlines--8,000 of them. There are 8,000 of them supporting \nthe Boxer-Klobuchar amendment.\n  I can't get a vote. That is why I voted no along with three other \ncolleagues who had their reasons. This was my reason. How do we do a \nbill like this and not address the No. 1 safety issue facing us? I \ndon't get it.\n  If you don't believe me, fair enough, because I am not a pilot. I \nadmit it. I just trust pilots. What is your choice? You walk on a \nplane, the pilot is in charge of the aircraft, and you know that pilot \nwants to land safely. You know that pilot wants to go home to his or \nher family. You know that pilot has your best interests at heart. \nSometimes I am in a rush, and I get on a plane and the pilot says: You \nknow what. We are not going to take off right now because I know there \nis something wrong in one of the monitors here. It could be nothing, \nbut I put safety first.\n  Everyone in the plane says: Oh, no. We are going to be late. They get \nout their cell phones and they call their loved ones, but we know the \npilots know what they are talking about. We trust them. I trust them so \nmuch I wrote with then-Senator Smith the guns-in-the-cockpit law for \npilots. The NRA thinks I am the worst of the worst, but I said I trust \npilots. They should have a chance if there is a terrorist on board. I \ntrust them. Why doesn't this administration trust them? Because of \nspecial interests that make billions a year--billions.\n  It is going to cost us a tiny bit more, and it is a tiny bit more. \nWhat price would we put on our kids? There is none, for goodness' sake. \nIf it cost a few cents more to ship a package so a pilot doesn't have \nto fly 16 hours, isn't that the right thing to do?\n  I will close with a quote from Sully Sullenberger. I think we all \nremember Sully. Before we show that, let's remind people who he is. We \nhave another chart that shows him. Sully Sullenberger was the ``Hero of \nthe Hudson.'' We remember how he landed his plane in the Hudson River, \nhow he saved all the passengers on that plane and his crew. He is so \nfamous now, he goes all over the world.\n  He came to the press conference I had with Senator Klobuchar, because \nshe and I are working on this amendment as well as Senator Cantwell. \nHis words were inspiring because he did not kid around. He said: \n``Fatigue is a killer.'' Fatigue is a killer.\n  You don't have to say any more. If you know fatigue is a killer, then \ndon't say passenger pilots can fly 9 hours but cargo pilots can fly 16. \nHere is what Sullenberger said when we first introduced our \nlegislation, the Safe Skies Act: ``You wouldn't want your surgeon \noperating on you after only five hours sleep, or your passenger pilot \nflying the airplane after only five hours sleep, and you certainly \nwouldn't want a cargo pilot flying a large plane over your house at 3 \na.m. on five hours sleep trying to find the airport and land.''\n  Sully said at the press conference that had he been suffering from \nfatigue on that fateful day that he safely landed that plane in the \nwaters of the Hudson River, if he was suffering from fatigue, he said \nhe never could have done it.\n  So I can't get a vote on my amendment. It is so simple, even a 6-\nyear-old can understand it. You don't have disparity when you have the \nsame responsibility. You are traveling in the same skies, and a cargo \nplane can crash into a house or another plane carrying passengers.\n  I am so disappointed in this administration that they have not done \nthe right thing on this. I am so disappointed in the U.S. Senate that \nthey blocked a vote on this because the special interests don't want to \ncharge 2 or 3 or 4 cents more on their packages. If it is to save lives \nof our people, this is what I call a classic no-brainer.\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  So I am here today to explain my vote to my constituents--why I voted \nno for an FAA bill that otherwise is a good bill. But I want just to \nmake a statement that it is ridiculous not to give me an up-or-down \nvote. They tied it to other issues that are poison pills: immigration \nissues, gun issues. Come on. This is the biggest problem--fatigue.\n  Can't we just get an up-or-down vote on it? I am going to try to do \nthat at every chance I get. Now I am working on a modified amendment to \nsee if we can get it into a package. I don't know whether we can or \nnot. But I want to say to the pilots out there who may be listening to \nthis debate: A lot of us here have your backs.\n  We are not going to forget about this issue just because the FAA bill \nis moving forward. We are not going to forget about you. We are not \ngoing to forget about what it means when you are fatigued. We are not \ngoing to forget about the two pilots who, through the recorder, told us \nbefore they crashed that they were exhausted. They addressed the issue \nof the disparity. We are going to be fighting on this.\n  If we can't get it done here, maybe some brave soul in the House will \ndo it, and it will wind up in the bill. If we can't get it done \nlegislatively, we are going to try to get it done through the FAA \nregular order of their rules. Where is the FAA on this? I want to say: \nFAA, you turned your back on too many safety measures that the NTSB, \nwhich is in charge of our safety, has recommended.\n  It took years to get some simple things done. So while we are working \nto get a modified amendment--which is not going to be the be-all and \nthe end-all; it just moves us a little bit forward--I just want to send \na message that it is rare that I vote no--one of four. It does not \nhappen often.\n  I view this as a moral issue. I view this as a moral issue for those \npilots that are on duty up to 16 hours straight in the middle of the \nnight, where, as Sully Sullenberger said, their circadian rhythms are \noff, and they are not at the top of their game. They are flying over \nthe airspace of the American people.\n  I thank the presiding officer so much for his attention. I live to \nfight another day, another hour, another minute on this.\n  I want the pilots to know and the flying public to know and everyone \nto know they should engage in this issue. There is no disparity between \npeople who do the same work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Federal \nAviation Administration Reauthorization Act, to talk about the \nimportance of passing this legislation for Colorado and, indeed, the \nNation. I commend Chairman Thune, our colleague from South Dakota, \nRanking Member Nelson, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Cantwell for their \nwork in crafting this very important piece of legislation.\n  It is an economic driver, certainly a national security issue, and a \nnumber of issues that we are able to address in this legislation of \ngreat importance to Colorado and the country. Our Nation's airspace is \nclearly one of the most important economic drivers that we have. It is \nimportant in the movement of passengers and cargo, along with the many \nother users of airspace, whether it be for agriculture or unmanned \naerial systems.\n  The economic importance of aviation in Colorado cannot be stated \nenough when it comes to tourism. In 2014 alone, 71.3 million visitors \ncame to Colorado, with $18.6 billion in economic impact for the State, \naccording to the Colorado Tourism Office. That tourism results in well \nover 100,000 jobs throughout the State of Colorado.\n  Many of those 71 million tourists came through Denver International \nAirport, the nation's fifth busiest and largest commercial airport. In \n2014 alone, more than 50 million people passed through Denver \nInternational Airport, a State with a population of about 5.5 million--\n50 million people passing through the fifth busiest airport, with some \nof these passengers continuing on to one of Colorado's additional 13 \ncommercial airports or 60 general aviation airports.\n  The economic impact that airports and aviation have throughout the \nState is absolutely incredible. When you take in the multiplier effect, \nnearly 300,000 jobs are a result of aviation in Colorado--a payroll of \nabout $12.6 billion in Colorado, with the multiplier effect, for an \neconomic output of about $36.7 billion.\n  In fact, there is one airport, which is the premier business airport \nof the United States, Centennial Airport in Colorado, surrounded by 23 \ndifferent business parks, with about 6,000 different businesses \nsurrounding this airport in those 23 different business parks. This \nairport, those 6,000 businesses, and the 23 business parks around the \nairport account for nearly 27 percent of Colorado's total gross \ndomestic product.\n  Think about that. One airport, one business airport, and the \nbusinesses that surround it account for nearly 27 percent of Colorado's \neconomy. So whether it is skiing or snowboarding or visiting one of our \ngreat national parks, enjoying the outdoors, hiking, camping, fishing, \nor visiting one of our world-class cities, it is not easily achievable \nwithout well-run, maintained, and secured airspace.\n  These airports connect cities like Denver, CO, to Durango, Colorado \nSprings, Pueblo, and smaller cities; rural communities like the city I \nlive in, Lamar and Yuma; and to the rest of the country. They help \nbusinesses reach beyond the borders of our State. Maintaining our \nairport infrastructure then becomes one of the most critical functions \nwe can perform.\n  Communities in Colorado and across the country continue to push their \nairport infrastructure improvements, betterments, to help realize the \nfull potential, the economic potential, to access that airspace and the \naccess that airspace indeed brings. That is why I am glad to talk about \nthis legislation and the many achievements we were able to accomplish \nand the provisions I was able to secure and include in the bill to help \nimprove that airport infrastructure, including improvements to the \nAirport Improvement Program, or AIP, and a study with recommendations \non upgrading and improving the Nation's airport infrastructure.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that this bill includes language that I \npushed to help allow improvements to Pena Boulevard, the prime access \nroad to connecting Denver International Airport with the rest of \nColorado. If you have been to Denver International Airport and you have \ndriven to downtown Denver, you have driven on Pena Boulevard.\n  This bill will address the needs, the infrastructure, and the \nimprovements that are needed to make sure that Pena Boulevard remains \nan efficient, safe roadway to the Nation's fifth busiest airport. It \nwill allow DIA the flexibility it needs and the clarity to ensure the \nprimary access road that Pena Boulevard represents is capable of \nhandling the traffic that comes with increased use of the airport.\n  The bill also includes language that builds on a successful pilot \nprogram for virtual towers and ensures that those towers will be \neligible for AIP funding, Airport Improvement Program funding, once \ncertified by the FAA.\n  It is important because these virtual towers, such as the one at the \nFort Collins-Loveland airport area, will allow small- and medium-sized \nairports to offer commercial service in an economically viable and \nsustainable way. Northern Colorado really is the gateway to Colorado's \nenergy hub, the gateway to Colorado's biotech, bioscience, and \nengineering research university hub. By allowing this virtual tower in \nnorthern Colorado at the Fort Collins-Loveland airport, we can help \nexpand the opportunity to reach that area for businesses that wish to \nlocate there, for customers who wish to fly into the area, and also for \nthose businesses that are already there to expand, to have further \nreach around the country and the world.\n  Another central responsibility of the FAA is to ensure that the \nairspace is being safely managed while allowing the industries that are \ndependent on\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\naviation to thrive. I think this legislation, after months and months \nof work, really does strike that appropriate balance. I was proud to \nsupport amendments during consideration of the bill that I believe will \nhelp ensure that the Transportation Security Administration, law \nenforcement agencies, and security personnel have the resources they \nneed to provide for the safety of the traveling public.\n  I believe more could and should be done, however. That is why I filed \non the floor an amendment to the bill which will improve TSA's \noperations at our airports by creating a testing location to help TSA \nand airports to work hand in hand to develop future screening \ntechnologies and passenger screening methods to ensure we are able to \nkeep passengers and airports safe.\n  If you look at the needs that we have at airports, there is the \ncombination of coming into an airport and checking in at an airport \ngate or kiosk. Most people use their iPhone or their smartphone to have \ntheir digital printout of a ticket. They don't even go to a kiosk \nanymore; they just go straight to the security line. But as we have \nseen, we need to have an increase in security from curb to gate.\n  It is not just a security concern where people may be gathering \naround the screening or people may be getting in and out of cars or \nlining up at the desk; it is an overall curb-to-gate security approach \nthat we need. That is what my amendment will accomplish. So I look \nforward to continuing to work with Senator Thune and the Commerce \nCommittee on a path forward for this amendment because it is critically \nimportant that we address additional security measures to prevent \nviolence like the recent terrorist attack in Brussels from happening \nand occurring at our airports.\n  To remind people, the attack in Brussels did not happen on an \nairplane; it happened outside where passengers were gathering. So if we \ncan address this curb-to-gate security, alleviate the slowdowns and the \nspots that make it more difficult for efficiency at the airport to get \nthrough security--this amendment can help do that--we can avoid danger \nto the public from those who wish to do our people harm.\n  The bill includes important certification reforms that will improve \nthe processing of new aircraft designs and modifications at the FAA. \nThis is important because we had an agricultural aviator, a crop \nduster, in Colorado who was trying to get his plane certified. This is \na spray plane. He was trying to get this plane certified, but what he \nfound out was that, first, the FAA was taking a very, very long time to \ncertify his crop duster, to give him the permission to use this plane \nto spray crops.\n\n  After they said they found his application, he ended up in a queue, a \nline behind United Airlines, behind Frontier Airlines. So, basically, \nthis crop duster in southeastern Colorado had a very small plane, not a \npassenger plane by any means. He was put in line with a 747, a 757, and \na 767. That is nonsense. It doesn't make any sense, and we were able to \naddress those certification challenges in this bill.\n  A couple of years ago I requested the inspector general at the FAA to \nlook at what was happening in the Rocky Mountain regional facility in \nDenver. They pointed to a number of challenges that region had in terms \nof its management, in terms of its process, and in certification in \nother areas. We were able to include the suggestions and the changes \nthat the inspector general's report identified in this legislation in \nthe FAA today.\n  Finally, the legislation, of course, makes key strides in the future \nof our aviation industry by addressing unmanned aerial systems. We have \na number of great areas in Colorado where we can test and where we can \ncertify, and, of course, the need is great--from agriculture to our ski \nresorts to wildfires. Think about what we can accomplish in the future \nwith unmanned aerial assistance.\n  I thank the leadership. I thank Senator Thune, our colleague from \nSouth Dakota for the leadership he provided. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer for the work the Presiding Officer has done to make this \nlegislation a success.\n  With that, I urge support for the legislation. I conclude my remarks \non the FAA bill asking Members to support the bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Colorado \nfor his active participation in shaping this bill. Obviously, he is a \nvery active member of our Commerce Committee and cares deeply and \npassionately about these issues. He was very involved in the issues \nthat he addressed in his remarks and that were incorporated into this. \nThey were simply and purely a credit to his persistence and hard work. \nThey do make this bill much stronger. I appreciate his good work making \nthat possible.\n  I wish to say again what I had mentioned earlier today, and that is, \nas Senator Nelson and I put this bill together, it was done in regular \norder. We had on the order of seven hearings--either subcommittee or \nfull committee--where we took testimony and tried to assemble the best \nideas. We worked together with members of the committee, including the \nPresiding Officer, in shaping a bill that we brought to a markup--\ngetting it to the markup and through the markup. We adopted 57 \namendments--34 Democratic amendments and 23 Republican amendments--\nbefore it came to the floor. After coming to the floor last week, we \nhave had 19 amendments that have been added. We have another 30 or \nthereabouts that have been cleared, if we could get objections \nwithdrawn so that those amendments could get cleared. But we have some \nother amendments of Members who would like to get votes.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be called up and reported by number: Sessions No. 3591; Paul \nNo. 3693, as modified; and Rubio No. 3722; further, that there be 45 \nminutes of debate concurrently on the amendments, equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, and that following the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments \nin the order listed with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold required for \nadoption of the amendments, and that no second-degree amendments be in \norder prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I so admire the managers of this bill. I \nreally do. As a former chairman and ranking member now, I know how hard \nthis is, but this is not a balanced request.\n  I would just say that I have spoken on the safety of pilot fatigue so \nmany times. I won't reiterate that here. I feel strongly that I want a \nvote. I know others on our side do as well. I don't think this is \nbalanced. So, sadly, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, in the same spirit of the chairman of \nthe committee, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be \ncalled up and reported by number: Boxer No. 3489 and Markey No. 3467; \nfurther, that there be 45 minutes of debate to run concurrently on the \namendments, equally divided in the usual form; and that following the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation to the \namendments in the order listed, with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold \nrequired for adoption of the amendments; and that no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would simply say that we have worked to try to get the \namendment from the Senator from California a vote. We have tried to get \nthe other amendment referenced by the Senator from Florida, Senator \nMarkey's amendment, a vote. But we have Members on our side who also \nwant votes, and the other side is objecting to those votes. So I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as you may have heard a moment ago, one \nof\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nthe amendments that is being objected to from our end is an amendment \nthat I have filed, and I will describe it briefly.\n  I wish to first describe the issue I am trying to address.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article entitled ``U.S. welfare flows to Cuba'' from October \n1, 2015.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sun Sentinel, Oct. 1, 2015]\n\n                       U.S. Welfare Flows to Cuba\n\n  (By Sally Kestin, Megan O'Matz and John Maines with Tracey Eaton in \n                                 Cuba)\n\n\n They're taking benefits from the American taxpayer to subsidize their \n                        life in another country\n\n       Cuban immigrants are cashing in on U.S. welfare and \n     returning to the island, making a mockery of the decades-old \n     premise that they are refugees fleeing persecution at home.\n       Some stay for months at a time--and the U.S. government \n     keeps paying.\n       Cubans' unique access to food stamps, disability money and \n     other welfare is meant to help them build new lives in \n     America. Yet these days, it's helping some finance their \n     lives on the communist island.\n       America's open-ended generosity has grown into an \n     entitlement that exceeds $680 million a year and is exploited \n     with ease. No agency tracks the scope of the abuse, but a Sun \n     Sentinel investigation found evidence suggesting it is \n     widespread.\n       Fed-up Floridians are reporting their neighbors and \n     relatives for accepting government aid while shuttling back \n     and forth to the island, selling goods in Cuba, and leaving \n     their benefit cards in the U.S. for others to use while they \n     are away.\n       Some don't come back at all. The U.S. has continued to \n     deposit welfare checks for as long as two years after the \n     recipients moved back to Cuba for good, federal officials \n     confirmed.\n       Regulations prohibit welfare recipients from collecting or \n     using U.S. benefits in another country. But on the streets of \n     Hialeah, the first stop for many new arrivals, shopkeepers \n     like Miguel Veloso hear about it all the time.\n       Veloso, a barber who has been in the U.S. three years, said \n     recent immigrants on welfare talk of spending considerable \n     time in Cuba--six months there, two months here. ``You come \n     and go before benefits expire,'' he said.\n       State Rep. Manny Diaz Jr. of Hialeah hears it too, from \n     constituents in his heavily Cuban-American district, who tell \n     of flaunting their aid money on visits to the island. The \n     money, he said ``is definitely not to be used . . . to go \n     have a great old time back in the country that was supposed \n     to be oppressing you.''\n       The sense of entitlement is so ingrained that Cubans \n     routinely complained to their local congressman about the \n     challenge of accessing U.S. aid--from Cuba.\n       ``A family member would come into our office and say \n     another family member isn't receiving his benefits,'' said \n     Javier Correoso, aide to former Miami Rep. David Rivera. \n     ``We'd say, `Where is he?' They'd say, `He's in Cuba and \n     isn't coming back for six months.' ''\n       ``They're taking benefits from the American taxpayer to \n     subsidize their life in another country.\n       One woman told Miami immigration attorney Grisel Ybarra \n     that her grandmother and two great aunts came to Florida, got \n     approved for benefits, opened bank accounts and returned to \n     Cuba. Month after month, the woman cashed their government \n     checks--about $2,400 each time--sending half to the women in \n     Cuba and keeping the rest.\n       When a welfare agency questioned the elderly ladies \n     whereabouts this summer, the woman turned to Ybarra, a Cuban \n     American. She told Ybarra her grandmother refused to come \n     back, saying: ``With the money you sent me, I bought a home \n     and am really happy in Cuba.''\n       Cubans on the island, Ybarra said, have a name for U.S. \n     aid.\n       They call it ``la ayuda.'' The help.\n\n\n                         Special status abused\n\n       Increasing openness and travel between the two countries \n     have made the welfare entitlement harder to justify and \n     easier to abuse. But few charges have been brought, and \n     Congress and the Obama Administration have failed to address \n     the problem even as the United States moves toward detente \n     with Cuba.\n       Cubans' extraordinary access to U.S. welfare rests on two \n     pillars of special treatment: the ease with which they are \n     admitted to the country, and America's generosity in granting \n     them public support.\n       Cubans are allowed into the U.S. even if they arrive \n     without permission and are quickly granted permanent \n     residency under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. They're \n     assumed to be refugees without having to prove persecution.\n       They're immediately eligible for welfare, food stamps, \n     Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income or SSI, cash \n     assistance for impoverished seniors and disabled younger \n     people.\n       Most other immigrants are barred from collecting aid for \n     their first five years. Those here illegally are not eligible \n     at all.\n       The Sun Sentinel analyzed state and federal data to \n     determine the annual cost of taxpayer support for Cuban \n     immigrants: at least $680 million. In Florida alone, costs \n     for welfare, food stamps and refugee cash have increased 23 \n     percent from 2011 through 2014.\n       Not all Cubans receive government help. Those arriving on \n     visas are ineligible, and some rely on family support. And \n     many who receive aid do so for just a short time until they \n     settle in, as the U.S. intended. Cubans over time have become \n     one of the most successful immigrant groups in America.\n       ``They come to the U.S. to work and make a living for their \n     family,'' said Jose Alvarez, a Cuba native and city \n     commissioner in Kissimmee. ``I don't believe that they come \n     thinking the government will support them.''\n       But some take advantage of the easy money--and then go back \n     and forth to Cuba.\n       A public housing tenant in Hialeah, who was receiving food \n     stamps and SSI payments for a disabled son, frequently \n     traveled to Cuba to sell food there, records show. She \n     admitted to a city housing investigator in 2012 that she \n     ``makes $700 in two months just in the sales to Cuba.''\n       Another man receiving food stamps admitted to state \n     officials ``that he was living in Cuba much of 2015.''\n       A recent arrival with a chronic illness got Medicaid \n     coverage and turned to attorney David Batchelder of Miami to \n     help him get SSI as well. But the man was ``going back and \n     forth to Cuba'' so much that Batchelder eventually dropped \n     the case. ``It was just another benefit he was applying \n     for.''\n       Concerns about Cubans exploiting the aid are especially \n     troubling to exiles who came to this country decades ago and \n     built new lives and careers here.\n       Dr. Noel Fernandez recalls the assistance his family \n     received from friends and the U.S. government when they \n     immigrated 20 years ago, help that enabled him to find work \n     as a landscaper, learn English and complete his medical \n     studies. Now medical director of Citrus Health Network in \n     Hialeah, Fernandez sees Cuban immigrants collecting benefits \n     and going back, including three elderly patients who recently \n     left the U.S. for good.\n       ``They got Medicaid, they got everything, and they returned \n     to Cuba,'' he said. ``I see people that said they were \n     refugees [from] Cuba and they return the next year.''\n       State officials have received complaints about Cubans \n     collecting aid while repeatedly going to Cuba or working as \n     mules ferrying cash and goods, a common way of financing \n     travel to the island.\n       Another way of paying for the trips: cheating. Like other \n     welfare recipients, some Cubans work under the table or put \n     assets in others' names to appear poor enough to meet the \n     programs' income limits, according to records and interviews. \n     Some married couples qualify for more money as single people \n     by concealing marriages performed in Cuba, where the U.S. \n     can't access records.\n       ``Stop the fraud please!'' one person urged in a complaint \n     to the state. Another pleaded with authorities to check \n     airport departure records for a woman suspected of hiding \n     income. ``It would show how many times she has traveled to \n     Cuba.''\n       Florida officials typically dismissed the complaints for \n     lack of information, because names didn't match their records \n     or because the allegations didn't involve violations of \n     eligibility rules. Travel abroad is not expressly prohibited, \n     but benefits are supposed to be used for basic necessities \n     within the U.S.\n       ``Our congressional folks should be looking at this,'' said \n     Miami-Dade County Commissioner Esteban Bovo Jr., a Cuban \n     American. ``There could be millions and millions of dollars \n     in fraud going on here.''\n\n\n                             Money to Cuba\n\n       Accessing benefits from Cuba typically requires a U.S. bank \n     account and a willing relative or friend stateside. Food \n     stamps and welfare are issued monthly through a debit-type \n     card, and SSI payments are deposited into a bank account or \n     onto a MasterCard.\n       A joint account holder with a PIN number can withdraw the \n     money and wire it to Cuba. Another option: entrust the money \n     to a friend traveling to Cuba.\n       Roberto Pizano of Tampa, a political prisoner in Cuba for \n     18 years, said he worked two jobs when he arrived in the U.S. \n     in 1979 and never accepted government help. He now sees \n     immigrants ``abusing the system.''\n       ``I know people who come to the U.S., apply for SSI and \n     never worked in the USA,'' he said. They ``move back to Cuba \n     and are living off of the hard-earned taxpayer dollars.''\n       He said family friend Gilberto Reyno got disability money \n     from the U.S. and renovated a house in Cuba. The Sun Sentinel \n     found Reyna living in that house in Camaguey, Cuba. He said \n     he was no longer receiving disability, but Pizano and another \n     person familiar with the situation said the payments continue \n     to be deposited into a U.S. bank account. The Social Security \n     Administration would not comment, citing privacy concerns, \n     but is investigating.\n       Federal investigators have found the same scenario in other \n     cases.\n       A 2012 complaint alleged a 75-year-old woman had moved to \n     Camaguey two years earlier and a relative was withdrawing her \n     SSI money from a bank account and sending it to her. Social \n     Security stopped payments, but not before nearly $16,000 had \n     been deposited into her account.\n       Another recipient went to Cuba on vacation and stayed, \n     leaving his debit card with\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\n     a relative. Social Security continued his SSI payments for \n     another six months--$4,000 total--before an anonymous caller \n     reported he had gone back to Cuba.\n       One woman reportedly moved to Cuba in 2010 and died three \n     years later, while still receiving SSI and food stamps, \n     according to a 2014 tip to Florida welfare fraud \n     investigators. A state official couldn't find her at her \n     Hialeah home, cut off the food stamps and alerted the federal \n     government.\n       Former congressman Rivera tried to curb abuses with a bill \n     that would have revoked the legal status of Cubans who \n     returned to the island before they became citizens.\n       ``Public assistance is meant to help Cuban refugees settle \n     in the U.S.,'' Mauricio Claver-Carone of Cuba Democracy \n     Advocates testified in a 2012 hearing on the bill. ``However, \n     many non-refugee Cubans currently use these benefits, which \n     can average more than $1,000 per month, to immediately travel \n     back to the island, where the average income is $20 per \n     month, and comfortably reside there for months at a time on \n     the taxpayer's dime.''\n       Rivera recently told the Sun Sentinel that he interviewed \n     welfare workers, Cubans in Miami and passengers waiting for \n     charter flights to Havana. He said he found overwhelming \n     evidence of benefits money going back, especially after the \n     U.S. eased travel restrictions in 2009.\n       The back and forth undermines the rationale that Cubans are \n     refugees fleeing an oppressive government, Rivera said. And \n     when they return for visits, they boast of the money that's \n     available in the U.S., he said. ``They all say, `It's great. \n     I got free housing. I got free food. I get my medicine.' ''\n       Five Cubans interviewed by the Sun Sentinel in Havana said \n     they were aware of the assistance and knew of Cubans who had \n     gone to America and quickly began sending money back. Two \n     said they believed it was U.S. government aid.\n       ``I don't think it's correct, but everyone does it for the \n     well-being of their family,'' said one woman, Susana, who \n     declined to give her last name.\n       Outside welfare offices in Hialeah, the Sun Sentinel found \n     Cuban immigrants who had arrived as recently as three days \n     earlier, applying for benefits. They said family and friends \n     told them about the aid before they left Cuba.\n       ``Back in the '60s, when you came in, they told you the \n     factory that was hiring,'' said Nidia Diaz of Miami, a former \n     bail bondswoman who was born in Cuba. ``Now, they tell you \n     the closest Department of Children and Families [office] so \n     you can go and apply.''\n\n\n                         Crooks collect in Cuba\n\n       Miami bail bondswoman Barbara Pozo said many of her Cuban \n     clients talk openly about living in Cuba and collecting \n     monthly disability checks, courtesy of U.S. taxpayers.\n       ``They just come here to pick up the money,'' Pozo said. \n     ``They pretend they're disabled. They just pretend they're \n     crazy.''\n       SSI payments, for those who cannot work due to mental or \n     physical disabilities, go up to $733 a month for an \n     individual. Most other new immigrants are ineligible until \n     they become U.S. citizens.\n       Some Cubans try to build a case for SSI by claiming trauma \n     from their life under an oppressive government or the 90-mile \n     crossing to Florida.\n       Diaz, the former bondswoman, said she has heard Cuban \n     clients talk about qualifying: `` `Tell them that you have \n     emotional problems. How did you get these problems? Well, \n     trying to get here from Cuba.' ''\n       Antonio Comin collected disability while organizing \n     missions to smuggle Cubans to Florida, including one launched \n     from a house in the Keys, federal prosecutors said. Comin \n     claimed he rented the home to celebrate his birthday--after \n     receiving his government check.\n       Casimiro Martinez was receiving a monthly check for a \n     mental disability--but his mind was sound enough to launder \n     more than $1 million stolen from Medicare. Martinez was \n     arrested at Miami International Airport after returning from \n     a trip to Cuba.\n       Government disability programs are vulnerable to fraud, \n     particularly SSI, with applicants faking or exaggerating \n     symptoms. Some view SSI as ``money waiting to be taken,'' \n     said John Webb, a federal prosecutor in Tennessee who has \n     handled fraud cases.\n       While benefits are supposed to be suspended for recipients \n     who leave the United States for more than 30 days, the \n     government relies on people to self-report those absences, \n     and federal audits have found widespread violations.\n       The government could significantly reduce abuses by \n     matching international travel records to SSI payments, \n     auditors have recommended since 2003. The Social Security \n     Administration and Department of Homeland Security are still \n     trying to work out a data sharing agreement--12 years later,\n       Jose Caragol, a Hialeah city councilman and Havana native, \n     said aid for Cubans ``was meant to assist those who were \n     persecuted and want a new life. The bleeding has to stop.''\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I will not read the whole article. But I am going to \nparaphrase from it.\n  By the way, as to the Democratic amendments that have been proposed \nand on which the Senator from California has just made a presentation \nregarding travel issues and pilot hours--she referred to the fact I \nhave traveled extensively over the last year--they are issues I am \nactually very sympathetic toward. Perhaps we can work together to get \nher a vote on that amendment, because I think that is a legitimate \nissue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Let me now talk about the one I want to talk about. This \nis how the article begins. I talked about yesterday.\n  Let me back up and explain what people are facing. Today, if an \nimmigrant enters the United States from another country legally and \ncomes here on a green card, with 5-year residency, they cannot receive \nFederal benefits. If you immigrate to the United States from any \ncountry in the world with an immigrant visa legally--not illegal \nimmigration, as illegal immigrants do not qualify for Federal \nbenefits--a legal immigrant to the United States does not qualify for \nany Federal benefits. There is an exception in the law, however, and \nthat is if you happen to be someone who comes from Cuba without a visa.\n  There is a law called the Cuban Adjustment Act. When the Cuban \nAdjustment Act was passed during the Cold War, it was passed so that \nCubans who came to the United States fleeing communist oppression were \nimmediately admitted to the United States. In essence, that is why \nthere is really no such thing as an illegal immigrant from Cuba. If a \nCuban makes it to the shores of the United States, they become legal in \nthis country, and a year and a day after they have arrived, they are \nallowed to apply for a green card. But unlike any immigrant from any \npart of the world, they are allowed to receive Federal benefits because \nthey are automatically presumed to be refugees. That is a status that I \nam not trying to change in terms of the Cuban Adjustment Act. I have \nsaid that I am open to that being examined, but I am not trying to \nchange that law in my amendment.\n  I do want to discuss why we should automatically assume at this point \nthat anyone who comes from Cuba is a political refugee. The reason why \nthat now is in doubt is because many of the people who are coming from \nCuba, supposedly as refugees seeking to flee oppression, are traveling \nback to Cuba 15, 20, 30 times a year.\n  There are people being oppressed politically in Cuba, absolutely. It \nis one of the reasons why I think the President's policies toward Cuba \nhave been misguided, because they refuse to see that even after this \nopening to Cuba, the political situation on the island has \ndeteriorated. It has gotten worse, not better. There are absolutely \npeople from Cuba who are coming here as refugees. But we also cannot \nignore the fact that many of the people coming from Cuba no longer are \ncoming here for political reasons. The evidence is that shortly after \nthey arrive, they are going back to Cuba 15, 20, 30 times a year. You \ndo not normally travel back to a place where you are fleeing from \noppression, much less repeatedly over an extended period of time.\n  So as a result, we now have a law that basically says that if you \ncome from Cuba, you are automatically entitled to a full platform of \nFederal benefits.\n  This is how the article begins:\n\n       Cuban immigrants are cashing in on U.S. welfare and \n     returning to the island, making a mockery of the decades-old \n     premise that they are refugees fleeing persecution at home. . \n     . .\n       Cubans' unique access to food stamps, disability money, and \n     other welfare is meant to help them build new lives in \n     America. Yet these days, it's helping some finance their \n     lives on the communist island.\n       America's open-ended generosity has grown into an \n     entitlement that exceeds $680 million a year and is exploited \n     with ease. No agency tracks the scope of this abuse, but a \n     Sun Sentinel investigation found evidence suggesting it is \n     widespread.\n       Fed-up Floridians--\n\n  Where a lot of these Cubans are moving to--\n\n     are reporting their neighbors and their relatives for \n     accepting government aid while shuttling back and forth to \n     the island, selling goods in Cuba and leaving their benefit \n     cards in the U.S. for others to use while they are away.\n       Some do not even come back at all. The U.S. has continued \n     to deposit welfare checks for as long as two years after the \n     recipients moved back to Cuba for good.\n\n  It goes on to talk about several people. For example there is a \nshopkeeper\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nin Hialeah, FL, where a lot of these folks are coming and moving. He \nsays he hears about it all the time. He is a barber. He has been in the \nUnited States for 3 years, and he said:\n\n       Recent immigrants on welfare talk of spending considerable \n     time in Cuba--six months there, two months here. ``You come \n     and go before benefits expire.''\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The sense of entitlement is so ingrained that Cubans are \n     now routinely complaining to the local Congressman about the \n     challenge of accessing U.S. aid--from Cuba.\n\n  What they are complaining about is that they are coming into the \noffice. This is what a former aide to a former Congressman from Miami \nsaid: A family member would come into our office and say a family \nmember isn't receiving his benefits. They would ask: Where is he? And \nthey would say: He is in Cuba, and he isn't coming back for 6 months.\n  This is unreal. There are people coming into congressional offices \ncomplaining: We are having trouble getting access to our benefits. You \nask them why, and they say it is because the person who gets the \nbenefits is not in America; he is in Cuba and he can't get access to \nhis benefits from Cuba.\n\n       One woman told Miami immigration attorney Grisel Ybarra \n     that her grandmother and two great aunts came to Florida, got \n     approved for benefits, opened bank accounts and returned to \n     Cuba. Month after month, the woman cashed their government \n     checks--about $2,400 each time--sending half to the women in \n     Cuba and keeping the rest.\n\n  They kept for themselves a 50 percent commission.\n\n       When a welfare agency questioned the elderly ladies' \n     whereabouts this summer, the woman turned to Ybarra, a Cuban \n     American. She told Ybarra her grandmother refused to come \n     back, saying: ``With the money you sent me, I bought a home \n     and I am really happy in Cuba.''\n\n  That means your money--the American taxpayers' money.\n  Ybarra went on to say that the Cubans on the island have a name for \nthis U.S. aid. It is called ``la ayuda,'' which means the help.\n\n       Cubans are allowed into the U.S. even if they arrive \n     without permission and are quickly granted permanent \n     residency. . . .\n\n  As I said earlier, under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, they are \nautomatically assumed to be refugees without having to prove it.\n  They are immediately eligible for welfare, for food stamps, for \nMedicaid, and for supplemental social security, or SSI, and also cash \nassistance for impoverished seniors and for disabled young people.\n  But let's be frank, not all Cubans receive government aid. For \nexample, if you come to the United States from Cuba on a visa--because \nthere is a visa lottery and every year the government awards visas to \npeople living in Cuba--you do not qualify for these benefits.\n  If, however, you arrive in the United States on a raft or if you fly \non an airplane to Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, or Mexico and cross \nthe U.S. border--as is now increasingly happening--then you do qualify \nfor these benefits I have just outlined. So let's be frank, not \neveryone who is coming from Cuba is doing this. There are people coming \nfrom Cuba who are fleeing persecution, but many are taking advantage of \nthe easy money, and then they are going back and forth to Cuba.\n  I will give you some examples cited in this article:\n\n       A public housing tenant in Hialeah, who was receiving food \n     stamps and SSI payments for a disabled son, frequently \n     traveled to Cuba to sell food there, records showed. She \n     admitted to a city housing investigator in 2012 that she \n     ``makes $700 in two months just in the sales to Cuba.''\n\n  And $700 a month is a lot of money in Cuba.\n  How does this work? They take the food stamp card. They go to the \ngrocery store. They load up a van with canned goods. They travel back \nto Cuba. They just got that food with your taxpayer money. They travel \nback to Cuba with duffel bags full of canned goods, and they sell it in \nCuba for a profit--$700 over a 2-month period.\n\n       Another man receiving food stamps admitted to State \n     officials ``that he was living in Cuba for much of 2015.''\n       A recent arrival with a chronic illness got Medicaid \n     coverage and turned to [his] attorney . . . of Miami to help \n     him get SSI as well. But the man was ``going back and forth \n     to Cuba'' so much that Batchelder eventually dropped the \n     case. ``It was just another benefit he was applying for.''\n\n  This, of course, concerns people who came to the United States as \nexiles and are now watching this happen. There is a doctor whose name \nis Noel Fernandez, and he recalls when his family arrived here from \nCuba that the U.S. Government helped them a little. When they \nimmigrated here 20 years ago, he was helped to find work as a \nlandscaper, he was helped to learn English, and he was helped to \ncomplete his medical studies. Today he is the medical director of \nCitrus Health Network in Hialeah.\n\n       Fernandez sees Cuban immigrants collecting benefits and \n     then going back, including three elderly patients who \n     recently left the United States for good.\n       ``They got Medicaid, they got everything, and they returned \n     to Cuba,'' he said. ``I see people that said they were \n     refugees [from] Cuba and they return the next year.''\n\n  That is his quote.\n\n       State officials--\n\n  In my home State of Florida--\n\n     have received complaints about Cubans collecting aid while \n     repeatedly going to Cuba or working as mules ferrying cash \n     and goods, which is a common way of financing travel to the \n     island.\n\n  How that works is, people know you are traveling to Cuba, and they \nhave relatives they want to get money to or clothes to or whatever, and \nso they pay you. They actually pay you. They give you money and they \nsay: Will you take this with you on your trip to Cuba and deliver it to \nthe people we are trying to get it to? That is why they call them a \nmule. Well, from the money you get paid to take these things back to \nCuba, that is how you pay for your plane ticket.\n  Another way of paying for these trips, by the way, is cheating. \nAccording to the Sentinel article:\n\n       Like other welfare recipients, some Cubans work under the \n     table or put their assets in others' names to appear poor \n     enough to meet the programs' income limits, according to \n     records and interviews. Some married couples qualify for more \n     money as single people.\n\n  Many of our welfare programs actually give you more money if you are \nnot married because you don't have to combine your incomes. So because \nthey were married in Cuba, they simply conceal the fact that they are \nmarried because the United States can't access those records. That is \nanother way of cheating.\n  Now look, ``accessing benefits from [someone who is in] Cuba \ntypically requires a U.S. bank account and a willing relative or friend \nstateside.'' By the way, that is just for now because as part of this \nopening to Cuba, the Obama administration is going to make it easier \nfor there to be banking transactions with Cuba. So what we are facing \nhere, my friends, is that in a very short period of time--once banking \nbecomes regularized with American banks--they will not even need to \nrely on their relatives in order to get this stuff. All they are going \nto need is an ATM or debit card or a credit card secured to that \naccount, and you--the American taxpayer--will deposit the welfare \ncheck, the SSI, into their bank account, and they will then be \nconducting transactions or withdrawing the cash from Cuba directly.\n  So they will not even need a relative to do it, but right now they \nstill need that. ``Food stamps and welfare are issued monthly to a \ndebit-type card and SSI payments are deposited into a bank account or \nonto a MasterCard.'' And soon they will be able to use that in Cuba. \nThen what you need is ``a joint account holder with a PIN number who \ncan withdraw the money and wire it to you in Cuba.''\n  Another option is just to entrust the money to a friend who is \ntraveling to Cuba.\n\n       Roberto Pizano of Tampa, a political prisoner in Cuba for \n     18 years, said he worked two jobs when he arrived in the U.S. \n     in 1979 and never accepted government help. He now sees \n     immigrants ``abusing the system.''\n\n  He says he has a ``family friend,'' and this family friend got \n``disability money from the U.S.'' and with the disability money he \n``renovated a house in Cuba.'' The Sun Sentinel found this man. His \nname is Gilberto Reyno. You know where they found him? They found him \nliving in Camaguey, Cuba. Quoting from the article:\n\n       The Sun Sentinel found Reyno living in that house in \n     Camaguey, Cuba. He said he was no longer receiving \n     disability, but Pizano and another person familiar with the \n     situation said the payments continue to be deposited into a \n     U.S. bank account.\n\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n\n  Here is another example that Federal investigators found, according \nto the article:\n\n       A 2012 complaint alleged a 75-year-old woman had moved to \n     Camaguey two years earlier and a relative was withdrawing her \n     SSI money from a bank account and sending it to her. Social \n     Security stopped payments, but not before nearly $16,000 had \n     been deposited into her account.\n       Another recipient went to Cuba on vacation and then stayed, \n     leaving his debit card with a relative. Social Security \n     continued his SSI payments for another six months--$4,000 \n     total--before an anonymous caller reported he had gone back \n     to Cuba.\n       One woman reportedly moved to Cuba in 2010 and died three \n     years later, while still receiving SSI and food stamps, \n     according to a 2014 tip to Florida welfare fraud \n     investigators.\n       Five Cubans interviewed by the Sun Sentinel in Havana said \n     they were aware of the assistance and knew of Cubans who had \n     gone to America and quickly began sending money back. Two \n     said they believed it was U.S. government aid.\n\n  That means this is now spreading through word-of-mouth. So you live \nin Cuba, you know someone who left for the United States, they \nqualified for these benefits, and they start coming back and bringing \nthe money with them or sending it back to their relatives, and word \ngets around. That is why it is not a surprise to read in this article:\n\n       Outside welfare offices in Hialeah, the Sun Sentinel found \n     Cuban immigrants who had arrived as recently as three days \n     earlier, applying for benefits. They said family and friends \n     told them about the aid before they left Cuba.\n       ``Back in the '60s, when you came in, they told you the \n     factory that was hiring,'' said Nidia Diaz of Miami, a former \n     bail bondswoman who was born in Cuba. ``Now they tell you the \n     closest Department of Children and Families [office] so you \n     can go and apply.''\n\n  This is a quote from another bail bondswoman:\n\n       Miami bail bondswoman Barbara Pozo said many of her Cuban \n     clients talk openly about living in Cuba and collecting \n     monthly disability checks, courtesy of U.S. taxpayers.\n       ``They just come here to pick up the money,'' Pozo said. \n     ``They pretend they're disabled. They just pretend they're \n     crazy.''\n       SSI payments, for those who cannot work due to mental or \n     physical disabilities, go up to $733 a month for an \n     individual. Most other new immigrants are ineligible until \n     they become U.S. citizens.\n       Some Cubans try to build a case for SSI by claiming trauma \n     from their life under an oppressive government or the 90-mile \n     crossing to Florida.\n       Diaz, the former bondswoman, said she has heard Cuban \n     clients talk about qualifying: ``Tell them that you have \n     emotional problems. How did you get these problems? Well, \n     trying to get here from Cuba.''\n\n  Here is one that should really gall everybody, though these are all \nbad stories.\n\n       Antonio Comin collected disability while organizing \n     missions to smuggle Cubans to Florida, including one he \n     launched from a house in the Keys, Federal prosecutors said. \n     Comin claimed he rented the home to celebrate his birthday--\n     after receiving his government check.\n       Casimiro Martinez was receiving a monthly check for a \n     mental disability--but his mind was sound enough to launder \n     more than $1 million stolen from Medicare. Martinez was \n     arrested at Miami International Airport after returning from \n     a trip to Cuba.\n       While benefits are supposed to be suspended for recipients \n     who leave the United States for more than 30 days, the \n     government relies on people to self-report those absences, \n     and Federal audits have found widespread violations.\n\n  So the only way you can find that someone is actually doing this is \nthey have to call and say: Hey, by the way, I am now living in Cuba, \nand I am still collecting my checks. Well, that ain't gonna happen. \nThis is an outrage.\n  Listen, my parents came from Cuba. I live in a community where Cuban \nexiles are a plurality of the people who live there. So no one can say \nthis is an anti-immigrant thing or a mean-spirited thing. We have the \nsupport of every elected Cuban American Member of the House for this \nidea.\n  I myself come from a Cuban American family. This is an outrage. It is \nhappening right underneath our noses. Who can be for this? Let me \nrephrase it. Who can be against doing something about this? We are \ntalking about close to $700 million a year of American taxpayer money \nthat could be spent right now to deal with the Zika virus issue that we \nare facing, for example. Instead, this money is being abused. It is \nbeing stolen.\n  So one would think: Wow, that is a commonsense thing; right? People \nhere in the gallery, people at home--if anyone is actually watching C-\nspan--would say: That is common sense. They will do something about it. \nYet I can't get a vote on this amendment. I cannot get the Senate to \nvote on an amendment to stop this practice.\n  Here is the only thing I am asking. I am asking that if you come from \nCuba, you have to prove you are a refugee. Prove that to us. I am not \neven saying we are not going to let you in. I am just saying that if \nyou come from Cuba using the Cuban Adjustment Act, prove that you have \nbeen persecuted in Cuba. That is not hard to do. You were in jail; you \nwere beaten. We know who the people are who are being persecuted. All I \nam saying is prove that you are a refugee, and then you will qualify \nfor the benefits because we help refugees. But, apparently, that is too \nmuch to ask.\n  Here is the thing. Everybody here comes up to me and says: I am for \nyour amendment. I support what you are trying to do. Great. Why can't \nwe vote on it? We can't vote on it because if we give you your \namendment, then we have to give the other side their amendments. And \nlet me just tell you guys that this is why people are so sick of \npolitics.\n  I don't want to get too much into the weeds on this, but suffice it \nto say I have spent from April 13 of 2015 through very recently \ntraveling all over this country on another endeavor, and one of the \nthings you hear from people is that they are just angry. They are just \nfed up. They think: Nobody whom we elect, whom we vote for, whom we \nsend to Washington--nothing ever changes or happens. It doesn't matter. \nYou can vote Republican, you can vote Democrat, or you can vote for a \nvegetarian. It doesn't matter whom you vote for. Nothing happens. These \npeople don't do anything.\n  They are right. I have just come here today and laid this out. No one \ncan argue against what I have just said--no one. I challenge any Member \nof this Senate to come here now--I will give the rest of the time I \nhave apportioned to me--and tell me why changing this is a bad idea. \nBut I can't even vote get a vote on an amendment to change this.\n  The excuses are long: Oh, we can't do it because we don't want to \nopen the tax portion of the bill because then other people will want \ntheir amendments. This is crazy. This is nuts. We can't solve problems. \nWe can't solve something as clear and simple as that. We can't even get \na vote. If you want to vote against what I am proposing, vote against \nit. We can't even get a vote on an amendment like this. It makes no \nsense.\n  This is not a small issue. We are talking $700 million. This is not \nan issue of national coverage. It is not in the news every day. This is \nnot controversial. This is bipartisan. The chairwoman of the Democratic \nNational Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Congresswoman from \nFlorida, is a cosponsor of this bill in the House. So this is not \npartisan. It is not about getting anyone elected to anything. I am not \nrunning for anything. This is about doing what is right.\n  This is about being able to go back to my home community and say to \npeople: This abuse has been addressed. But if I go home tonight or \ntomorrow to Florida and I run into somebody at the grocery store, I \ncan't explain to them with a straight face why the Senate will not give \nme a vote on this because it makes no sense. If I came to you and said: \nThey are stealing $700 million a year from you, and here is a very \nsimple way to stop it, you would say: Let's do it. We have to do it. \nBut here they are saying: We can't do it. And no one will tell you why \nwe can't do it, except for some procedural internal Senate thing.\n  This is ridiculous. This is why people are angry. This is why people \nare so upset. This is why people have taken on this attitude to get rid \nof everyone. And I have to tell you, it is hard to blame them after \nseeing what is happening here now. This is total and complete outrage.\n  There is another amendment being debated, by the way, by Senator \nSessions. It is another one of the amendments that was denied a vote. \nIt has to do with the entry-exit tracking system, which basically means \nthat when you come into the United States with a visa--you get a visa \nto visit the United States for 90 days as a tourist. You want to go to \nWashington, you want to\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\ngo to Disney World, you want to go to New York City, and you have 60 to \n90 days to visit the United States. When you arrive, we check you in. \nBut we never check you out. So we never know when or if someone has \nleft.\n  As a result, today, of the 12 or 13 or 14 million people who are here \nillegally, about 40 percent or so of them are people who have \noverstayed their visas. They didn't cross the border illegally. They \ncame on an airplane, and they overstayed their visa.\n  Everyone says they are in favor of a system that tracks entries and \nexits so we can crack down on these overstayed visas. Everyone says \nthey are in favor of it. In 2013, the Senate passed a controversial \nimmigration reform bill that I was a part of and we helped craft, and \nan entry-exit tracking system was part of that bill.\n  Everyone--Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative--says they are \nin favor of doing that. But you can't get a vote on an amendment \ndealing with it. Again, it makes no sense. This place can't solve \nanything, and this is ridiculous.\n  So what happens when you don't solve things for a long time? The \nproblems stack up. The problems stack up and people lose confidence. \nPeople lose faith.\n  Look, I understand this process. I know everyone is not always going \nto get everything. You are not going to achieve everything you want \nwhen you get involved in these issues, but these are commonsense \nissues. An entry-exit tracking system--of course that makes sense.\n  By the way, you have to do that on the FAA bill. You have to because \nthat has to do with airports where most of the entry-exits are \nhappening. This issue is drafted to this bill because this bill has a \npiece of it that deals with the Tax Code and finance. A moment ago, the \nchairman said we had a lot of debate. They had an open amendment \nprocess on the FAA bill, but there is a finance component to this bill \nthat was not offered until it got here. That is what my amendment is \ndrafted on, so I couldn't have offered this in a committee.\n  I think people come to Washington and watch this process; they hear \nme explain this thing. They are wondering, there has to be a catch, \nright? What is the other side of the argument? There is no other side \nof the argument. There is none. There is none.\n  Why should you, the people watching, the people here, why should \nanybody, why should the American taxpayer be giving money to people who \ndon't live here to build houses in another country? That is what is \nhappening right underneath our noses. Forget about passing it. You \ncan't even get a vote on it, for reasons no one can explain.\n  Do you want to know why people are upset and frustrated with the \npolitical process? This is a small but important example of why people \nare so frustrated. I hope this will change. I hope it will change. I \nhope it will change on this bill because I don't think you can explain \nwith a straight face why something like this can't pass or why \nsomething like this can't even get a vote on it. This makes absolutely \nno sense, but this is what is happening here every single day on a \nroutine basis. When I say ``here,'' I mean in Washington. The result \nis, people start to scratch their heads and say: You know what. It \ndoesn't matter whom we elect, nothing changes. That explains a lot \nabout the frustrations that are going on in this country. I hope that \nwill change.\n\n\n                     Honoring Assault Brigade 2506\n\n  Madam President, I want to talk about another topic briefly. It is \nalso related to Cuba but on a much different note. It has to do with \nthe Bay of Pigs, which is something that happened a while back. April \n17 will mark the anniversary of a significant event in history. It is \nan event that many in our government over the years have been eager to \nforget and is often cited as a blemish on our history, but I beg to \ndiffer in some ways. The result wasn't what we wanted, but we have a \nlot to be proud of. I think it has become increasingly important to \nremember.\n  Fifty-five years ago this Sunday, on April 17, 1961, there were 1,500 \nbrave volunteers who embarked upon a mission to liberate Cuba from \nFidel Castro's oppressive grip. This force was primarily made up of \nCuban exiles, but they were a diverse group from all backgrounds within \nCuban society.\n  They knew they would be badly outnumbered and they would face \nextraordinary odds. Yet these men stormed the beaches of Playa Giron at \nthe Bay of Pigs. They did it for what at the time was their country, \nCuba. They did it for their families. They did it for freedom itself. \nOver the next 4 days, nearly 100 members of the Brigada de Asalto--\nAssault Brigade 2506--lost their lives--nearly 100 members. Included in \nthat number were four American pilots and five others who were \nexecuted. The majority were captured and imprisoned for many months and \nyears and in inhumane conditions.\n  Though the Bay of Pigs invasion failed, it was a triumph of courage \nfor the brave Cuban exiles at the mission's helm, and it serves as a \nreminder of an era when the U.S. Government actually embraced America's \nrole as the watchman on the walls of freedom.\n  Since taking power those many years ago, the anti-American Castro \nregime has never relented in its attempts to undermine our security and \nsuppress its own people. More than 1 million Cubans have voted with \ntheir feet, fleeing the island in search of political freedom or better \neconomic conditions--we just discussed that a moment ago--often coming \nto the United States.\n  Many of these refugees are my neighbors, my friends, and \nconstituents. My own parents left Cuba several years before Castro took \nover, but their lives were nonetheless marred by his rule as well. The \nrelationships with family and friends and access to their homeland were \nabruptly severed.\n  For the nearly 1,500 Cuban exiles who made up the Assault Brigade \n2506, Fidel Castro was not the leader of their country. He was what he \nhas always been--a thief and an imposter. They knew liberty was a God-\ngiven right, and they needed to do all in their power to reclaim it.\n  Their story says as much about their own resilience as it does about \nAmerica. The very building I stand in, and the proud body I am a Member \nof, would not exist were it not for men like them over 150 years \nbefore.\n  America's Declaration of Independence says of mankind's inalienable \nrights that ``whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of \nthese ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, \nand to institute new Government.''\n  Those who undertook the Bay of Pigs invasion fought for their \ncountry, not against it. Their cause was a humanitarian cause, a noble \ncause, in many ways, an American cause. Many of those who were captured \nand eventually released and exiled to the United States came with \nnothing--not a penny--and in many cases no English skills. They went to \nwork and embraced America's blessings, but they never forgot their \nhomeland.\n  Some made it their life's work to promote the cause of a free Cuba. \nOthers went to work on a different endeavor to provide for their \nfamilies but dedicated countless hours as faithful volunteers of the \ncause. Many of the former members of the Brigade 2506 would take up \narms for the United States, serving in our Armed Forces with the same \nbravery and distinction they showed at the Bay of Pigs. In doing so, \nthey served as teachers to an entire community.\n  For example, today in Miami a Brigade 2506 monument and museum now \nexists as much to commemorate these heroes as they do to educate \nothers. Far from being forgotten, the example of these brave men has \ninspired others to carry on their work. Their legacy lives, and it \nlives on among those of us who follow in their footsteps by making \ntheir cause of a free Cuba our cause.\n  Today the spirit of those who paid the ultimate price is alive and \nwell in the brigade's Veterans Association and continues to stand \nfirmly against the Castro brothers' dictatorship. Their spirit is also \nalive inside Cuba, represented by all those who stand up to the \nrepressive regime and its beatings, detentions, and suppressions of \nspeech. A strong dissident movement within the island refuses to be \nsilenced, demanding change and the right of every human being to be \nfree.\n  Sadly, this administration has betrayed that spirit of dissension by \ntreating the Castro government as if it were democratically elected. \nThe President's actions have only motivated the dictatorship to \nincrease in\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nits very nature, but as long as the spirit of the brigade lives on, the \ndream of a free Cuba will never die.\n  Following the Bay of Pigs invasion, in December of 1962, President \nKennedy delivered a speech in Miami honoring those who fought. \nAccepting an honor from them in return, he accepted the flag of their \nbrigade. President Kennedy said: ``I can assure you that this flag will \nbe returned to this brigade in a free Havana.''\n  That assurance was not made by a man but by a nation. It came with no \nexpiration date. I believe we as Americans owe it to the fearless men \nwho fought at the Bay of Pigs to ensure that their flag, which last \ntouched the shores of Cuba 55 years ago this week, is one day returned \nto a free Havana and that everything that flag represents--freedom, \nsacrifice, the dreams of the Cuban people--remains the cause of the \nUnited States.\n  To the veterans of Assault Brigade 2506, thank you for your service \nand God bless you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Rubio for his comments \nand his heartfelt expressions. It is important, and his amendment is \nvery commonsensical. It deals with a very real abuse that I know he and \nmany Cuban Americans understand to be an abuse and want to see ended. \nThis would be a good opportunity for us to pass it, and I understand \nSenator Rubio's frustrations that we seem to be unable to fix problems \naround this body.\n  That is my feeling this afternoon, too--this frustration that we are \nnot able to finally take action on things like the entry-exit visa \nsystem and complete it, as we promised to do for years. We get very \nclose, but we don't get there. I thank Senator Rubio for his excellent \nleadership on this issue and support for the amendment that I have \nworked on. I think it is very reasonable and an appropriate amendment. \nIt gives plenty of opportunity for us to carry out the necessary \nprogram in a reasonable way.\n  The amendment I submitted will ensure the implementation of the \nstatutorily required biometric exit system. It has been in law for a \nlong time. It was first set in law in 1996--20 years ago. There were at \nleast eight or more times where we mandated this legislation. The first \none was in 1996. These requirements were basically ignored. They were \neventually modified and then the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001, occurred.\n  Congress responded to that by demanding the government implement this \nentry-exit system when we passed the PATRIOT Act to provide greater \nsecurity for America. It stated that an entry-exit data system should \nbe fully implemented for airports, seaports, land border ports of entry \n``with all deliberate speed and as expeditiously as practical.'' That \nwas in 2001.\n  If you remember what happened after 9/11, we had a 9/11 Commission--\nand it was a bipartisan Commission--and that Commission was charged \nwith a serious responsibility of analyzing our immigration system, \nanalyzing our public safety system, our intelligence system, and all \nkinds of problems that made us more vulnerable than we need to be. One \nof their recommendations was that we have a system when you come into \nAmerica on a visa, you clock yourself in--like many workplaces have--\nand you clock yourself out when you leave the country and your time on \nyour visa expires. Then the United States would know who would come and \nwho had exited.\n  Of course, we also know, if you recall back to that day, a number of \nthe 9/11 attackers who killed 3,000 Americans came on visas lawfully. \nSeveral of them overstayed with the visas they had. So this was the \nresponse.\n  We have the capability of doing this. We have had the capability for \nmany years, and it has not happened. Ten years after 2001, the 9/11 \nattack, the \n9/11 Commissioners met again. The purpose of their meeting was to \nascertain how much of what they had recommended had actually been \naccomplished by the U.S. Government. One of the very first things they \nnoted was the failure to complete the exit system. This is why it has \nbecome such a big issue.\n  In 2002 we passed a law that further moved forward with the system. \nIt required the government to install biometric readers and scanners at \nall ports of entry of the United States. In fact, we have a system to \ncollect biometric information from individuals who wish to enter the \ncountry, but oddly we don't have the exit system. Why is it so much \nharder to have a system to allow you to document your exit than it is \nto document your entry? This is a serious problem.\n  Subsequently, and consistent with the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, which mandated the entry-exit system be \ncomplete and be biometrically based. That is different from biographic. \nIn a biographically-based system, you give your Social Security number \nand name and they check to see if somebody has a warrant out for your \narrest or if you should be on a no-fly list or if you are connected \nwith terrorism or organized crime or drug-dealing gangs or whatever is \nin our systems. You can just give a false name. That is not a very \nsecure system at all.\n  What the 9/11 Commission correctly concluded was, if you used a \nbiometric system where they read your fingerprints, somebody couldn't \ncome in and say they are John Jones and they are really Ralph Smith, \nwho has a warrant out for his arrest for terrorism somewhere. That is \nthe kind of thing this system was designed to do and can be done.\n  Despite the relatively successful implementation of a biometric entry \nsystem, the Department has largely failed to implement the \nrequirements. To date, the Department of Homeland Security has only \nimplemented a handful of pilot programs. It is not hard to do. Yet they \nhave been dragging their feet for years now. However, there are some \npromising developments on this system. The Consolidated Appropriations \nAct of 2016 created a dedicated source of money for implementation of \nthe biometric exit. It has been estimated that this will result in \napproximately $1 billion in funds that will be used solely for the \nimplementation of the biometric exit system. That is already in law and \nrequired to be a part of our legal and immigration system.\n\n  Yet, even with this source of funding, hurdles remain to the \nimplementation this system. My amendment will remove one of the biggest \nremaining hurdles to the implementation of the system. It simply states \nthat no funds from this Federal aviation bill, which funds airports, \nrunways, safety systems, and all of those different systems, can be \nexpended ``for the physical modification of any existing air navigation \nfacility that is a port of entry or construction of a new air \nnavigation facility intended to be a port of entry, unless the \nSecretary of Homeland Security certifies that the owner or sponsor of \nthe facility has agreed to a plan that guarantees the installation and \nimplementation of the [biometric exit system] at such facility not \nlater than 2 years after the date of the enactment of the Act.'' In \nother words, it gives them 2 years. They have to reach an agreement to \nactually take steps to fix this problem.\n  I modified my amendment in an attempt to address some concerns that \nwere raised by the airlines by explicitly referring to the $1 billion \nappropriated for this system. We received positive feedback from U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection, which has to deal with this every day. \nMy amendment also has been endorsed by the Border Patrol Union. They \nknow this is a loophole in our system, a gaping hole in our security. \nThey want to see it completed, and it is long overdue.\n  The amendment allows the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers \nand each airport that serves as a port of entry to create a solution \nthat works specifically for the needs of the CBP and the limitations of \neach individual airport. It does require, however, that the parties \nagree to a plan that guarantees the system will be installed and \nimplemented.\n  The suggestions we have had in response as to the kind of language \ncritics and objectors would like to see--it never has an end date. They \nsay, well, you can begin a pilot project or you can do this, that, and \nthe other, but they never give a date as to when it should actually be \ncompleted.\n  Colleagues, this system can be made to work. In my opinion, it can be \nimplemented in every airport in 6\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\nmonths. We have companies that have this kind of system that is used \nall over the place, and even Disney World and Disneyland use a \nfingerprint system. It is on our cell phones. This is the kind of thing \nthat is really no problem to make happen, but we lack the will and \ndetermination to see it through, and we let people who don't like it--\nspecial interest groups--push back, and as a result, it somehow never \ngets completed.\n  In fact, Homeland Security, airports, and airlines have already had a \ngenerous amount of time in which to get this completed. It could be \ndone quickly.\n  One manufacturer said: We should host a special products day. You \nshould just have a day out here. People think it can't be done. Have a \nday and ask all the manufacturers around the country to bring forth \ntheir equipment that is being used in businesses and places all over \nthe country, such as nuclear plants, and set them up and let us show \nyou what we can do with it.\n  Another company said: You don't even have to touch a screen. You can \nwave your hand in front of the screen, and it will read your \nfingerprints.\n  These are proven products, and the prices are low and falling and at \nthe most basic level. If Apple and Samsung can put it on their phones, \nwe can certainly do it at the airports.\n  The special interests also say it will take up a lot of space. It \nwill not take up a lot of space. Police officers have these kinds of \nfingerprint-reading systems in their automobiles. When they arrest \nsomebody for a crime and want to know if there is a warrant for that \nperson's arrest somewhere around the country, they ask that person to \nput their hand on the screen. The computer reads it and runs the \nfingerprint against the National Crime Information Center records. If \nit says bingo, there is a warrant for his arrest for murder, robbery, \nor drug dealing, they can detain that person.\n  CBP can work with larger airports with international terminals and \ninstall physical equipment at their international departure gates. It \nis only the international departure gates. CBP--Customs and Border \nPatrol--can work with smaller airports and even deploy handheld systems \nsimilar to the ones that are in cars at the gates that handle \ninternational flights. Ultimately, all passengers exiting the United \nStates need to do is place their hands on a simple screen--or with some \ndevices, just wave their hands at it--and it will biometrically \nidentify the passenger as truly the one shown on the flight documents \nas exiting the United States.\n  You can come here with a false document. Terrorists work on these \nthings all the time. Terrorists use false identification. We know there \nare systems out there making them by the thousands and tens of \nthousands. But if your fingerprint doesn't match the fingerprint of the \nperson whose name you are using and it turns out to match somebody who \nis on a terrorist watch list, then you can stop it and create safety. \nIf a person puts out their hand and there is a hit because the person \nboarding the plane is on a no-fly list, the passenger can be denied \nboarding or removed from the plane before it takes off, and their \nbaggage can be removed from the plane before it takes off.\n  Importantly, the United States will have a unified, automatically \nproduced list of people who departed when their visa said they should \ndepart and a list of people who did not depart when their visa expired.\n\n  By the way, colleagues, several years ago the Congressional Budget \nOffice found that 40-plus percent of people illegally in America came \nby visa. They came legally; they just did not leave. They said that \nnumber is increasing. I believe it is increasing rather rapidly, and we \nare going to see more of it in the future. If you don't have a system \nto identify people who overstay their lawful entry, then you do not \nhave a lawful system of immigration. It is just that simple.\n  For a host of reasons, this system should be based on fingerprints.\n  The former Secretary of Homeland Security and former Governor of \nPennsylvania, Secretary Ridge, set up this system some time ago. When I \ntalked to him about it, I told him as a former prosecutor that it \nneeded to be based on the fingerprint system. Some people had other \nideas about it, such as eye or facial recognition. These things can \ntechnically be done, but they can't run a check on somebody who \ncommitted murder somewhere and has a warrant out for their arrest and \nis fleeing the United States, because our basic law enforcement system \nonly has certain data of people who are wanted for criminal activity. \nYou need to use the fingerprint. It has been proven, it works, and it \nis used in every criminal justice system in the United States.\n  When he left office after going round and round about this subject, \nSecretary Ridge said: I have one bit of advice for my successors, and \nthat is, use the fingerprint. I believe he was totally correct, and it \nstill remains the only real system that will work.\n  Let's also be aware that numerous countries across the world--\nincluding New Zealand, Singapore, and Hong Kong--have been using \nbiometric systems for years. This is nothing new. Others do it, and we \ncan do it too.\n  Ending this failure has bipartisan support. My subcommittee, the \nSubcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, held a hearing \non January 20 of this year entitled--I thought it was a pretty good \ntitle--``Why is the biometric exit tracking system still not in \nplace?'' That is a pretty good question. Well, during the hearing, we \ngot promises from government officials, but there was no commitment \nthat they would actually complete the system. They said: Oh, we are \ndoing pilot projects. We are considering this and working on it. Well, \nthey have been working on it for 20 years. We had our members who were \nthere--all three Democratic members who were at that subcommittee \nhearing said they favor this. There is no real opposition to it.\n  Just a few weeks after the hearing, Secretary Johnson of Homeland \nSecurity made public statements directing DHS to begin implementation \nof the system at our airports by 2018. To begin implementation when? In \n2018. There was no promise that it would be completed, and there was no \nassurance that they were going to make the system a reality. This is at \nleast an acknowledgement that it is needed, but we need a completion \ndate.\n  It is these kinds of lulling comments that we have heard for years \nthat have resulted in no action. If people in the Senate would like to \nknow why the American people are not happy with the performance of \nCongress, this is a very good example. Congress promises to fix the \nproblem, even claims we voted for and passed laws to fix a problem, and \nthen it stands by while two decades go by and nothing happens. Why? \nWell, their special interests speak up. We have lobbyists sending out \nletters telling Members to oppose the Sessions amendment.\n  It is time for us to represent the national interest. The time for \nthe special interests is over on this subject. Congress has spoken \nrepeatedly. The American people are getting tired of this. I am getting \ntired of this. Who runs this place? Elected representatives or some \nhigh-paid lobbyist somewhere? They have been dragging this out and \nfighting it tenaciously with every effort they have had for years, and \nit has not happened and America is at risk because of it. Airports and \nairlines are happy to get Federal assistance whenever they can. They \nbetter be trying to cooperate and make their airlines even safer than \nthey are today.\n  It is time to fulfill the promise and commitment we made to the \nAmerican people. How much longer can this go on? We promised the \nAmerican people a system that will demonstrably improve our national \nsecurity. We voted for it time and again. We have bipartisan support \nfor it. If we can get a vote on this amendment, we will see a huge \nbipartisan majority vote for it. I don't know who would vote against \nit. But we don't get to vote, and as a result nothing happens for \nyears.\n  This was noted by the former Commissioners on the 9/11 Commission in \na report issued in 2014:\n\n       Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a \n     foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary \n     basis has overstayed his or her admission. Had this system \n     been in place on 9/11, we would have had a better chance of \n     detecting the plotters before they struck.\n\n  That is why it is important. We have long known that visa overstays \npose a serious national security risk. A number of the hijackers on \nSeptember 11\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\noverstayed their visas. The number of visa overstays implicated in \nterrorism since that date is certainly a significant number.\n  A new poll came out earlier this year that indicates that three out \nof four Americans not only want the Obama administration to find those \naliens who overstay their visas but to also deport them.\n  Why not? They came here for a limited period of time. We have a law \nthat says they can stay for a certain amount of time. It is not that \nhard to get a visa to the United States, but shouldn't they leave when \ntheir visa is up? Do they just get to stay here and take a job, perhaps \nfrom an unemployed American citizen?\n  The same poll indicates that 68 percent of Americans consider visa \noverstays as a ``serious national security risk'' and 31 percent \nconsider visa overstays as a ``very serious'' national security \nrisk. There is no doubt as to why.\n\n  The risk to our national security is too high for us to maintain the \nstatus quo. We must fulfill this promise. We must do everything we can \nto implement the system. I hope that some way, somehow, before this \nbill goes to final passage--dealing with airports and public safety \nissues--we fix this problem. Why not? I don't know a single person who \nopposes it, but we couldn't get the amendment up; we couldn't make it \npending. The Democrats objected to it. Now we have an objection to \nhaving a vote on it before final passage of the legislation.\n  So I am frustrated. I have been pushing this for years. Even the Gang \nof 8 bill had it in there. So this is not something that I think is in \nany way unreasonable. It is time to bring it to a conclusion. I urge my \ncolleagues: Let's figure out a way to make this happen.\n  I appreciate Senator Thune, who is managing the bill. He is \ndefinitely for it and wants to see it happen. But right now we have \nobjections from the Democratic side, and we don't seem to be able to \nget it through.\n  I urge my colleagues to reevaluate and approve passage of this \namendment that should have virtually unanimous support in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the opening on the \nSupreme Court. Today I am going to focus my remarks on how important \nfilling the current vacancy on the Supreme Court is for our system of \ngovernance.\n  When our Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution, they envisioned a \nsystem of governance upheld by three branches of government. The \nFederalist Papers outline this balance of power in detail. In \nFederalist Paper No. 51, James Madison spoke about the importance of \nchecks and balances among three branches of government. As Madison \nstated: ``It is . . . evident that the members of each department \nshould be as little dependent as possible on those of the others.'' I \ndon't think we always refer to ourselves as members of a department, \nbut what he meant by this is that there are three departments in our \ngovernment--the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the \njudicial branch. In Federalist Papers 78 and 80, Alexander Hamilton \nwrote about the important role of the Federal judiciary in particular. \nThe writings of the Founders make clear that our democracy only works \nwhen all three branches are functioning.\n  In recent years, gridlock has hobbled the ability of the legislative \nbranch to function. Although we have made some progress in starting to \nturn that around with the passage of the recent Transportation bill, \nthe Education bill, and the budget, we also have had some very \ndifficult times--fiscal cliff, the government shutdown. We cannot take \nthat dysfunction to the third--as was called by James Madison--\ndepartment of government, which is the judiciary. We cannot have a \nSupreme Court that doesn't function, which is exactly what is happening \nas some continue to obstruct the process, when all we want is a \nhearing.\n  We have already witnessed the Court split evenly without a ninth \nJustice to break the tie this year. These types of decisions can \nprevent the Court from responding to pressing issues in a timely \nfashion. In some decisions where there has been a 4-to-4 split, the \nresult is effectively the same as if the Supreme Court never heard the \ncase to begin with.\n  What if there was an emergency case like we had with Bush v. Gore? \nAgain, do we want a 4-to-4 split in a case like that? Justice Kagan has \nsaid the current Justices on the Court are doing everything they can to \navoid a 4-to-4 split, but that is not how it should work. Often these \ntypes of decisions provide less guidance to States, offering them less \nlegal certainty.\n  Last week I held a meeting of the Steering and Outreach Committee, \nwhere I heard firsthand about what a serious issue this is for State \nand local governments. You have patchwork decisions across the country \nwith perhaps 2 years that will go by before you have a High Court of \nthe land that can decide which case and which decision rules when there \nis a split in the circuit. You can't continue to have a split on the \nCourt.\n  As the former chief prosecutor from Minnesota's largest county, I \nknow from my own experience how important it is to have an ultimate \narbiter to settle the law of the land. Cases challenging critical laws \nare now before the Supreme Court. We want those laws to rise or fall \nbecause the Supreme Court has decided the issue--not because of a 4-to-\n4 split, not because they were unable to do their job.\n  More split decisions are not the only risks we are facing. The \ncurrent vacancy on the Supreme Court also has implications for the \nnumber of cases the Court is able to take in the first place.\n  In March of last year, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari--\nthat means they took the case--in eight cases. This year, it only did \nso for two cases. The current situation is compromising the integrity \nof our judiciary. If we allow the Supreme Court to become a casualty of \nthe polarization in our politics, if we let politics impede the Court \nfrom having another Justice and from doing its job, people will lose \nconfidence in the Court.\n  That is what sets our country apart. When you talk to companies \nacross the world that want to invest in different countries, they look \nat the fact that we have a functioning judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday, April 18, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Thune \namendment No. 3680 be agreed to; the substitute amendment, as amended, \nNo. 3679, be agreed to; and the Senate vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on H.R. 636.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, again I say to my colleagues that we made a \nlot of good headway on the FAA reauthorization bill. Throughout the day \ntoday--as we did quite late last night--we have attempted to negotiate \na path forward to adopt more amendments. We have a package of \namendments that have been cleared. A number of our colleagues wanted \nvotes on their amendments, but there have been objections on both sides \nof the aisle which prevented us from getting to a final resolution.\n  This morning we adopted cloture on the substitute with a very big \nvote, but we still have to have a cloture vote on Monday on the \nunderlying bill, which will occur at 5:30 p.m. So I am here to inform \nmy colleagues that there will be no further rollcall votes during \ntoday's\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\nsession of the Senate and we will proceed with the cloture vote on the \nunderlying bill at 5:30 p.m. on Monday. Shortly after that vote, I hope \nto get to final passage on the FAA reauthorization so we can move on to \nother business in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2085-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I also want to address a second issue while \nI have the floor, and that is a conversation I had yesterday with Judge \nMerrick Garland. We had an opportunity to talk in my office for about \n45 minutes to an hour. We talked about a wide range of topics: the \nlimits on the President's Executive authority, how the Court should \nprovide oversight to regulatory agencies, the Second Amendment, the \nrole of stare decisis respect for precedence, general judicial \nphilosophy. We talked about a number of issues, and I wanted to share \nwith the Senate some observations from that meeting.\n  No. 1, the first thing I thought of last night after reflecting upon \nthis conversation is that I used to be in the judge-appointing \nbusiness. As Governor of Maine, I probably appointed 10 or 15 judges \nover my 8-year term, maybe more. I don't have a specific number, but I \ndo recall the process which brought prospective judges in by a judicial \nselection committee, and then I would consider their qualifications and \ninterview them in much the same way I did yesterday.\n  I always look for the same qualities: first, high intellect; \nknowledge of the law; nonpomposity--as a young lawyer, I didn't like \npompous judges, and I don't like people who uphold themselves, \nparticularly when they are in positions of authority, so a kind of \nmodest demeanor; finally, a temperament whereby they can apply the law \nand make decisions without any discernible political or ideological \nbent. Indeed, as I thought back on the conversation I had with Judge \nGarland yesterday, I realized that he exactly fit that criteria. Were \nhe an applicant or a candidate for the supreme court in the State of \nMaine and if I were the Governor, he would be the kind of guy I was \nlooking for.\n  The other thing I reflected on as I was thinking about the \nconversation is that I wish the people of America had been looking over \nmy shoulder and had heard the conversation, the questions, heard his \nanswers, studied his body language and how he approached these \nquestions, how his mind works, how he thinks.\n  I thought about the fact that many of us are having these meetings \nwith the judge over these weeks, Members from both parties, and what we \nare doing is kind of a slow-motion hearing without the public being \nable to watch what is going on. I think that is where we are missing \nthe boat on this nomination.\n  I fully understand the discretion every Senator has to make their own \ndecision on whether this is a nomination that should go forward, but we \nare denying the American people the opportunity to participate in this \nprocess by not having a hearing and allowing them to see and hear and \nmeet Judge Garland. I don't understand that.\n  Well, I guess I do understand the politics, and I will talk about \nthat in a minute, but I don't understand why we are shutting the people \nout of this process, because if there was a hearing, it would probably \ngo on for hours, there would be dozens of questions, the Senators could \nask all the questions they wanted, and the public and the Senators \nwould be able to observe this man and get a feel for who he is, what he \nwould bring to this job, and the kind of person he is.\n  I have not made a final decision. If and when he is brought to the \nfloor for a vote, I haven't yet decided how I will vote, although based \nupon my meeting yesterday and my knowledge of his prior judicial \nexperience and his reputation, I am inclined to say yes. But I want to \nhave a hearing. I want to see how he does in that hot seat where he is \nasked difficult questions by our colleagues. I want to see the reaction \nnot only of the Senators but of the people of America as they have a \nchance to meet Judge Garland.\n  One of the things that concerns me about this process--and ironically \nChief Justice Roberts commented on this just a few months ago, before \nthe death of Justice Scalia--is the politicization of the Supreme \nCourt. I am not naive, and I realize the Supreme Court makes important \nfundamental decisions. It is an important part of our governmental \nstructure and makes far-reaching decisions that have effects on many \npeople across the country. But I am afraid that today we have gotten to \nthe point where the Supreme Court is treated as almost like a third \nbranch of Congress. It is another political body. Instead of being \nelected by the people, it is being elected by the Senators, and we are \narguing about who gets to elect this so-called swing vote and which way \nthe Court is going to be.\n  The Supreme Court should not be a political body, period. It should \nbe a body made up of people--my impression of Judge Garland--who are \nservants of the law, who are students of the law, who are moderate and \ntemperate.\n  I walked out of our meeting and I thought, this guy is a conservative \nwith a small ``c.'' He is a modest man with a deep knowledge of the law \nand a razor-sharp intellect but no political or ideological agenda that \nI could discern. I suspect that if and when--I believe it will \nultimately be when--he is confirmed, he will turn into a Justice who \nwill vote on one side of issues sometimes and make certain people happy \nand others unhappy at other times. I think he is going to be a \nstraight-down-the-middle judge who calls it as he sees it, and I think \nthat is exactly what we need on the Supreme Court today.\n  The other quality he has demonstrated as chief judge of the circuit \ncourt is the ability to bring consensus. By all reports of people who \nhave worked with him--judges, people who have known him--he is a \nconsensus builder. He is not a flamboyant, strong, charismatic kind of \nguy, but he brings people together. He marshals the court. He works \ntoward unanimity. He is not a dissenter. He is not a firebrand. He is \nprincipled, but he is a consensus builder, and we definitely need that.\n  Five-to-four decisions, whichever way they go, in the long run are \nnot good for the country, in my view, because they divide us and \nillegitimize the Court as a judicial arbiter of the Constitution as \nopposed to another political branch of our government.\n  So I believe what we should be doing is fulfilling our constitutional \nresponsibility--not to vote yes, necessarily. The Constitution does not \nsay the President shall nominate and we shall approve--but to consider \nand to advise and consent. That involves the simple matter of a hearing \nand would include the American people in the process.\n  There is a lot of discussion here of ``let's hear from the American \npeople.'' The way to hear from the American people is to have hearings, \nlet them watch, let them take the measure of this person, and let us \nknow how they think we should carry forth our constitutional \nresponsibility in this case.\n  He appears to be--from what I know so far--an extraordinary \ncandidate, not ideological, not partisan. I have no idea of his \npartisan background. I did not even ask him. It occurred to me \nafterward that perhaps I should have, but I didn't. I know he has \nworked in the Justice Department. He has been a prosecutor. He has been \na private attorney, and he has been a very well respected judge.\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\n  I think he is a judge's judge, a lawyer's lawyer. That is the kind of \nperson I think we need on the Court in this day and age. So I hope we \ncan find a way to move to hearings, to allow the American people to \nparticipate in this process, to watch the process unfold, to get to \nknow the judge. Let's get to know him better and then make our decision \nso we can carry out our constitutional responsibility to advise and \nconsent.\n  That, I believe, is what we owe the Constitution and what we owe the \npeople of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss briefly the fight \nagainst ISIS and the sources of its financial support. As the \nadministration accelerates the coalition military campaign against \nISIS, I believe the administration must continue to intensify efforts \nto dismantle the financial networks that support this vicious terrorist \norganization.\n  We know that ISIS operates like a criminal syndicate and profits from \nthe illicit sale of oil, antiquities, and other items through the black \nmarket, all while extorting civilians it has under its control. ISIS \nuses this funding to conduct terror attacks and control territory in \nboth Iraq and Syria. They use it to buy more weapons, ammunition, and \ncomponents for improvised explosive devices, which we know by the \nacronym IEDs.\n  They also use this funding to pay for salaries for fighters and to \ndevelop propaganda materials to spread their hateful ideology. Already, \nwe have seen evidence that both U.S. and coalition efforts against \ntheir financial networks, including airstrikes on oil trucks and cash \nstorage sites, have had a meaningful impact on their finances--the \nfinances of ISIS.\n  There is evidence that ISIS has had to reduce the salaries they pay \ntheir fighters in recent months. That is good news. I believe that if \nwe can cut off their money, we can significantly diminish their ability \nto operate. Members of Congress should support this effort in any way \nwe can.\n  Recently, during the month of February, I traveled to four countries \nto focus on part of this effort. I visited Israel, Saudi Arabia, \nTurkey, and Qatar to press the foreign leaders in those countries, \nespecially the last three, to accelerate the fight against terrorist \nfinanciers and facilitators.\n  Much more remains to be done to cut off the financing that ISIS \nreceives. A recent report by the Culture Under Threat Task Force \ndescribes ISIS as ``industrial, methodical, and strictly controlled \nfrom the highest levels of the organization's leadership.'' This report \nfurther indicates the analysts' warning that ISIS may try to increase \nits antiquities trafficking activity as other revenue streams such as \noil sales are, in fact, cut off.\n  So we have to be on guard for this and take action against it. I \nsponsored the Senate version of the Protect and Preserve International \nCultural Property Act of 2015. This is a bill that would restrict the \nimportation into the United States of antiquities smuggled out of Syria \nsince the beginning of the conflict. It also expresses the sense of \nCongress that the administration should better coordinate among the \nmany agencies with expertise in counterterrorism finance and cultural \nheritage protection so there is better coordination within the \nadministration. That is the aim of the legislation.\n  This bill also sends a strong signal that the United States will not \nbe a market for this illicit activity that only benefits terrorists and \nespecially ISIS. It also will not be a market that funds any terrorist \ngroup that leads to the destruction of cultural heritage. So I want to \nthank Senators Perdue, Grassley, Coons, and Peters for their \ncosponsorship of this important legislation.\n  I am pleased that the Senate passed the Protect and Preserve \nInternational Cultural Property Act. It passed just last night. It is \nurgent that we send this bill to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to urge swift passage of the \nbipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016 \ncurrently pending on the Senate floor.\n  This legislation supports U.S. jobs and promotes competition while \nincreasing safety in the national aerospace system. In the wake of the \ntragic attacks in Brussels, the bill includes a number of important \nairport security reforms.\n  We are proposing to invest in our Nation's airports by authorizing a \n$400 million increase for the Airport Improvement Program, which \nairports across the Nation rely on to modernize their infrastructure. \nWe are also seeking to preserve the Federal Contract Tower Program, \nwhich supports general aviation safety, commercial airports, law \nenforcement, and emergency medical operations.\n  Michigan is a large State, and our rural airports keep smaller \ncommunities across the Upper Peninsula and Northern Michigan \ncompetitive and connected. Maintaining the Essential Air Service \nProgram supports airports that Michiganders rely on, such as the Alpena \nCounty Regional Airport, Muskegon County Airport, and Delta County \nAirport.\n  This bill also advances responsible usage of unmanned aircraft \nsystems--known more commonly as UAS or drones--by addressing safety and \nprivacy issues, enhancing enforcement against irresponsible usage, and \ncreating new opportunities for research, development, and the testing \nof these innovative technologies.\n  I thank my colleagues--Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune and \nRanking Member Bill Nelson--for working with me during the committee \nmarkup process to include a provision that grew out of bipartisan \nlegislation I authored with Senator Moran of Kansas--the Higher \nEducation UAS Modernization Act. This important legislation will clear \nthe way for our Nation's students and educators to use UAS technology \nfor research, education, and job training. This will keep our research \nuniversities, workforce, and manufacturers on the cutting edge of \nglobal competitiveness as they develop the UAS of the future that will \ndrive our economy forward. Our brightest minds will have the ability to \ndesign, to refine, and to fly UAS so they can advance these \ntechnologies to help prepare our country for safe, widespread \nintegration of UAS into the National Airspace System. This will support \njob creation across the income spectrum as our Nation's workforce will \nbe able to get the training they need to operate these systems both \nsafely and efficiently.\n  This legislation has the support of the Association of Public and \nLand-grant Universities, the Association of American Universities, and \ndozens of other colleges and universities across this country.\n  In addition to advancing the next generation of civilian drone \ndevelopment, the reauthorization being considered also supports and \nprotects the ability of our Air National Guard to safely and \neffectively operate remotely piloted aircraft, or RPAs.\n  I worked to include legislation that helps Air National Guard units \nacross this country maintain their operations, including the Michigan \nAir National Guard's 110th Attack Wing in Battle Creek, MI, which I had \nthe privilege of visiting earlier this month. The 110th has two \ncritical missions: operating MQ-9 Reaper RPAs and a Cyber Operations \nSquadron.\n  Michigan is proud to host these cutting-edge, high-tech military \noperations that securely and effectively operate aircraft located \nthousands of miles away supporting our troops that are deployed \noverseas. Our troops have\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\na high demand for remotely piloted aircraft, which conduct \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations as well as \noffensive strike operations.\n  The Air Force is working hard to meet the demand for RPAs from \ncommanders in theater and has already increased incentive pay for RPA \npilots and doubled pilot class sizes to keep up with the demand.\n  Air National Guard units based in the United States but flying \naircraft which could be anywhere else in the world add additional \ncapacity to meet our global security needs. These are sensitive \noperations requiring very specific infrastructure that the Air National \nGuard has invested in at bases all across the country.\n  As certain Air National Guard units operating at civilian airports, \nlike Battle Creek, transition from manned missions to remotely piloted \naircraft missions, they are concerned the airport where they lease \ntheir base could be forced to either raise their rent or risk losing \neligibility for much needed FAA grants. I worked with my colleagues--\nSenators Cotton and Ernst--on legislation to prevent this unfair and \nunnecessary choice for Battle Creek and other airports across the \ncountry. I am proud this provision has been included in the legislation \nwe are considering today, which will prevent the FAA from denying grant \nfunding on the basis that an airport renews a low-cost lease with a \nmilitary unit, regardless of whether that unit operates aircraft \nphysically stationed at the airport.\n  While I understand the FAA's interest in ensuring that airports \nreceive a fair rate for the space they lease, I am glad this \nlegislation will clarify that military units, including the National \nGuard, can continue to receive nominal leases. If an airport and a \nmilitary unit agree to renew a low-cost lease, they should be able to \nproceed without concern the FAA will revoke the airport's grant \nauthority.\n  The communities that host our military bases are proud of their role \nin national defense.\n  These airports shouldn't have to choose between continuing to host a \nmilitary tenant and maintaining eligibility for grants that can improve \nthe safety and efficiency of local airport operations.\n  Again, I want to applaud Leader McConnell, Leader Reid, Chairman \nThune, and Ranking Member Nelson for their work on this important \nbipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage \nearly next week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it may not look like it now, but we are \nactually making great progress in moving forward with a critical piece \nof legislation that would reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and, in the process, make flying safer and more \nefficient for all of our citizens. Members across the aisle have worked \ntogether on this legislation, and I know we will have an important vote \nat 5:30 p.m. on Monday and hopefully be able to process some of the \namendments that have been agreed upon by the managers of the bill, \nwhich are a part of the managers' package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2087-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2087-S2088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CALLING FOR APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to turn to a topic that has \nconcerned me a lot over the last year and troubles me more each day, \nand that is the use by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of an \nunsecured private email server while serving as our Nation's top \ndiplomat. We have known about her private email server for a while now \nand the great lengths she has gone to avoid compliance with some pretty \nimportant laws that Congress has passed and that have been signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States.\n  I believe transparency in government is very important in terms of \nbuilding public confidence for what we are actually doing. That is why \neven when I was at the State level as Texas Attorney General, I was an \navid supporter of open records and open meetings legislation so the \npublic had access and saw their right to know honored.\n  Here in Congress, since I have gotten here, I have been working \nclosely with my ideological opposite, Senator Pat Leahy from Vermont, \nwith him on the left end of the spectrum and me on the right end of the \nspectrum, but both agreeing that the public's right to know is so \nimportant when it comes to self-government and what the public doesn't \nknow can hurt them. That is why when Lyndon Johnson signed the Freedom \nof Information Act into law, it passed with such broad support, and it \ncontinues to enjoy that kind of broad support today. It applies the \nprinciple of transparency and accountability, and in the process, it \nhelps build confidence for what Congress is doing on the people's \nbehalf.\n  It is pretty clear that Secretary Clinton sought to evade those \nimportant laws by setting up this private email server.\n  I know most people are familiar with the dot-com domains that we use \nperhaps at your home or my home, and we have the dot-gov domain, which \nis used by government agencies and the like. But then there is a dot-\nmil, which is used by the Department of Defense and is a classified \nsystem. There is actually another system that operates independently \nwhich carries the most sensitive classified information circulated by \nour intelligence community around the world.\n  Those are important distinctions because those don't necessarily talk \nto each other. In fact, they are not connected to the Internet. The \nclassified intelligence system server is not connected to the military \nclassified system or to the dot-gov system and certainly not to the \ndot-com or the private email server.\n  I have not heard another example of anybody who has been quite so \ncareless--to use the President's term--or reckless--to use my term--\nwith how private email servers are used to conduct official business. \nThere is a lot of risk associated with that.\n  We know the former Secretary of State did delete tens of thousands of \nemails that were once on the server. In other words, she hadn't turned \nthose over to the State Department to vet and determine whether they \ncomplied with court orders requiring the State Department to produce \nemails that were producible under the Freedom of Information Act. She \njust deleted them.\n  We know that her emails contained classified information, some at \nvery high levels of government classification. As many of our Nation's \ntop security experts will tell you, it is likely that our adversaries \nhad easy access to and monitored Secretary Clinton's unsecured server, \nas well as the sensitive communications that were contained on it.\n  As Secretary of State, you are a member of the President's Cabinet. \nYou are operating at the highest levels of classification with very \nsensitive information, and it is simply irresponsible to subject that \ninformation to the efforts by our Nation's adversaries to capture and \nread it and use it to their advantage.\n  All of this should concern all of us. I am not just talking about the \npolitical ramifications. This is not primarily about politics. But \nSecretary Clinton's actions were such an extreme breach of the Nation's \nconfidence, and they potentially gave away extremely sensitive \ninformation that put our national security in jeopardy, not to mention \nthe lives of those who serve our country in the intelligence community \nand whose very identity may have been revealed by this very sensitive \nclassified information.\n  This is not a trivial matter. We need to treat this seriously, and \nthe facts must be pursued in a thorough, impartial investigation. I \nknow most people don't really believe there is such a thing as an \nimpartial investigation here in Washington, DC, but there is a category \nof counsel that has been created by Congress to provide some measure of \nindependence from the Department of Justice. That is called a special \ncounsel. It is up to the Attorney General herself whether to appoint \nthe special counsel when she recognizes\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nthat there is an apparent conflict of interest or at least an \nappearance of partiality that ought to be dealt with by the appointment \nof a special counsel.\n  Given the unprecedented nature of this case and the unavoidable \nconflicts of interest, I strongly believe there is no other appropriate \naction for Attorney General Loretta Lynch to take than to appoint a \nspecial counsel in this case to get to the bottom of it, to follow the \nfacts to wherever they may lead, and to make sure the law is applied \nimpartially and fairly wherever those may fall.\n  The American people were reminded of the need for a special counsel \nlast weekend when, once again, President Obama opined publicly about \nthe investigation. In an interview on Sunday, President Obama dismissed \nthe email scandal by splitting hairs about how the government \nclassifies information. According to the President--get this--``there's \nclassified, and then there's classified'' information.\n  He was attempting to draw meaningless distinctions between levels of \nclassification, suggesting that release or exposure of some classified \ninformation was OK as long as it wasn't the ``classified'' information, \nwhich supposedly he would say should be kept from our Nation's \nadversaries and kept confidential.\n  President Obama, in other words, was trying to indicate that even \nthough classified information was on Secretary Clinton's private \nserver, he somehow divined that it was not so sensitive that it would \nput our country in jeopardy.\n  First of all, we know that some of Secretary Clinton's emails were \nclassified even beyond confidential, to the secret and top secret \nspecial access program levels--some of the highest levels of \nclassification. Second, the President's comments have to be confusing \nto many public servants around the country, who, as part of their daily \nwork, handle classified information and the way they do it when they \nare issued a national security clearance or sign a nondisclosure \nagreement. According to the President, it must be OK to expose some \nclassified information to public view but not others. I can guess that \npeople who work in that world must be somewhat confused and perplexed \nby the President's statement.\n  To dismissively talk about the different levels of classification is \nnot only wrong but, frankly, it is insulting to Americans who work \ntirelessly on a daily basis to protect our national security and, in \nparticular, to those who go to great lengths to properly and carefully \nhandle classified information, even when it isn't particularly \nconvenient.\n  But perhaps worse, the President was opining publicly on the results \nof an ongoing criminal investigation over which it turns out he knows \nabsolutely nothing--at least if you believe the key players in that \ninvestigation. Although he claims to adhere to a strict line between \nhimself and the investigation, President Obama repeatedly suggests his \ndesired outcome and acts as if he is Secretary Clinton's front line of \ndefense.\n  Here is President Obama in the same interview. He said that he \n``continues to believe that [Secretary Clinton] has not jeopardized \nAmerica's national security.''\n  How in the world could the President possibly know that if, in fact, \nthere is a strict line between himself and the investigation?\n  Attorney General Lynch has testified and stated in front of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee--and FBI Director Comey has likewise \ntestified--that there has been no reporting to the White House about \nthe results of the ongoing investigation. Everybody understands that \nwould be improper, but somehow the President suggests it is all OK and \nthat he knows, when, in fact, he doesn't know.\n  How could the President possibly know that, especially when--as the \nPresident made clear last Sunday--he has not been ``sorting through \neach and every aspect'' of the issue? By the President's own admission, \nhe doesn't talk to the Attorney General or the FBI Director about \nongoing investigations, and he certainly isn't conducting it, so he \nwouldn't have personal knowledge. Under no circumstance is this kind of \ncommentary by the President OK. There is simply no way to read this \nwithout running a serious risk of trying to influence the outcome of \nthe investigation, which everybody should recognize would be completely \nimproper. The President has done this before and so has his spokesman, \nthe White House Press Secretary. Time and again the White House has \nprojected its desired outcome in this investigation to the public and, \nworse, to those people conducting it. As I said, it is completely \ninappropriate, but don't just take it from me.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, last month the Judiciary Committee heard \ntestimony from Attorney General Loretta Lynch. I conveyed to her at the \ntime the need for a special counsel to investigate the case. At the \nhearing, Attorney General Lynch testified that it was her hope that \neveryone, including the White House, would stay silent when it comes to \ncommenting on an ongoing investigation by the FBI.\n  I couldn't agree with her more. The responsible thing for the \nPresident to do would be to say nothing, particularly if he knows \nnothing about the content of an ongoing criminal investigation. I wish \nthe President would take the advice of his lawyer, the Attorney General \nof the United States, and respect her prerogative as the Nation's chief \nlaw enforcement officer and the reputation of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. Director Comey made it clear that the FBI does not care \nfor politics. It doesn't play politics. In fact, the credibility and \nintegrity of the FBI depends upon their not playing politics. So why is \nthe President playing politics with law enforcement?\n  Well, the threat of a President influencing an ongoing investigation \nintentionally or otherwise is not something we must just accept. What \nwe need is an investigation that is as independent as possible.\n  I hope the Attorney General, in light of the President's comments and \nhis attempt to influence the investigation--I can think of no other \nreason he would say what he did--reconsiders her refusal to appoint a \nspecial counsel in this case. At the very least, I hope the President \nquits talking about a subject he knows nothing about, which is what the \ninvestigation is revealing, and let the Justice Department do its job \nwithout feeling the pressure that apparently the White House is \nattempting to impose on the FBI and the Department of Justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2088-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2088-S2090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I am here today to talk about the Zika \nvirus, which we have been hearing a lot about in the news lately. It is \na virus that first began to appear--well, obviously it has been around \nfor a long time, but we began to see it in the news lately with regard \nto its implications in Brazil and Latin America. But it has now found \nits way here to the United States, and there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about it.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the President has requested $1.9 \nbillion to deal with it. There are a lot of different things we need to \ndo to address it. There has been a little bit of a squabble in the \nCongress about whether we should be spending that much money on it.\n  So one of the things I argued for--and it has happened--is that we \nshould take some of the money that was set aside for Ebola when the \nEbola crisis was going on--it was about $500 million of that that had \nbeen unspent. I argued that before we go to the $1.9 billion, there was \n$500 million immediately available. Let's assign that to be used. The \nPresident has agreed to do that. But there is still a shortfall on this \nissue. It does need to be addressed. I hope we can find a way to \naddress it.\n  Obviously my political differences with the policies of the White \nHouse are well known and established, but this is an issue where I \nbelieve and I hope they will be supportive of this request.\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\n  To be abundantly clear, it is not just about throwing money at it. We \nhave to make sure the money is being spent on the right things. This is \nnot just saying ``Here is $1.9 billion'' and throwing the money at \nZika; you want to make sure, No. 1, it is all being spent on dealing \nwith the virus. Oftentimes in this place, when money is assigned for a \ncatastrophe or a disaster or anything like this, a breakout of a \ndisease, suddenly you see all kinds of other ideas and programs \nattached to it that have nothing to do with the primary reason the \nmoney is being spent. So we want to make sure, No. 1, that if there is \n$1.9 billion that is going to be spent on this, that all of it is spent \non this and not on some other thing.\n  The second is, we want to make sure the money is being spent on the \nright things. What are the right things? Well, we have discussed those \nover the last few days. One of the most important things that need to \nhappen long term is the money necessary for basic research to \nincentivize the vaccine. There is a belief that they can pretty quickly \nget to a vaccine that will protect people from this. That is important.\n  I think there needs to be thought put into the testing. Today, \ntesting for the Zika virus is less than reliable. There is not a \ncommercially available test. For example, in Florida, if you want to be \ntested for Zika, it has to be through the State department of health. \nYou cannot go down to Quest Laboratory or one of the providers of lab \ntests and get it. There is not a commercially available test. So that \nhas to be improved as well.\n  Those are the sorts of things I hope the money will be geared \ntowards. This is why it is so important. I don't want us to take our \neyes off of this because if this issue really takes off on us here in \nthe United States, we don't want to say that we knew it was happening \nbut we ignored it and did nothing about it.\n  On Monday of this week, there was a Reuter's report in which U.S. \nofficials warned that the Zika virus is ``scarier'' than they initially \nthought. The Zika virus is now present in about 30 States. And by the \nway, there are hundreds of thousands of infections that could appear in \nthe territory of Puerto Rico.\n  Here is a quote from the Deputy Director of the U.S. Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention:\n\n       Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit \n     scarier than we initially thought. And so while we absolutely \n     hope we don't see widespread local transmission in the \n     Continental United States, we need the States to be ready for \n     that.\n\n  As of now, from my understanding, there has only been one case of \ntransmission in the continental United States. That happens to be in \nPolk County, FL. But there are dozens in the territory of Puerto Rico. \nSo this is deeply concerning.\n  The other thing they found is that the mosquito species that \nprimarily transmits the virus is present in about 30 States rather than \n12, as previously thought. So that, too, indicates that this could be a \nvery serious issue that could find itself in places outside of the \ntropical climates to which we once thought it was limited.\n  On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control--this was last \nWednesday--the CDC said that it is now clear that Zika definitely \ncauses severe birth defects. Confirming the worst fears of many \npregnant women in the United States and Latin America, U.S. health \nofficials said Wednesday that there is no longer any doubt that the \nZika virus causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and \nother severe brain defects.\n  This is something that now--looking at what has happened in Brazil \nand other parts of the country, there is now real concern about what \nthis can mean for pregnant women and the ability to transmit that to \ntheir unborn child. The effects of it are devastating.\n  Initially it was thought that the Zika virus is very dangerous if you \ncontract it in the first trimester but that after that the risk is no \nlonger as grave. But on Thursday of this week, we got the news--this \nwas reported in USA TODAY--that the Zika virus may, in fact, affect \nbabies even in the later stages of pregnancy. The Zika virus may pose a \nthreat to women and their fetuses even in the later stages of \npregnancy, according to a study published online Wednesday in the BMG, \nwhich was formerly known as the British Medical Journal.\n  Doctors initially suspected that Zika infections, which are largely \nspread by mosquitoes, would be most harmful to fetuses in the first \ntrimester or the first 3 months of a 9-month pregnancy. In this study, \nhowever, 23 percent of the mothers of babies with microcephaly were \ninfected with Zika in the second trimester. Two mothers were infected \nin the sixth month of pregnancy. None were infected in the third \ntrimester.\n  The babies in the study had problems that went far beyond simply \nsmall heads. The brain damage seen in the study was ``extremely severe, \nindicating a poor prognosis,'' according to the study.\n  The authors of the report have now expanded the study to a total of \n130 babies with microcephaly. Several infants have had epileptic \nseizures within 3 to 5 months after birth. The extent of the brain \ndamage seen in the babies in the study, which was captured in MRI \nimages, was ``stunning,'' according to James Bale, Jr., a professor of \npediatric neurology at the University of Utah School of Medicine. This \nis the quote: ``This is a really remarkable degree of damage.'' Babies \nwith this condition have severe microcephaly, extra scalp skin, \nintellectual disabilities, and prominent occipital bone, which is \nlocated at the back of the head, according to the CDC.\n  By the way, these fetal brain disruptions we have talked about are \nnormally extremely rare. A 2001 review in a medical journal identified \nonly 20 cases, according to the CDC. So this is something we are \nlooking at that does not normally happen as a normal risk, but it is \nclearly being exacerbated by the Zika virus. In fact, in MRI images \npublished by the BMG study, one baby appears to have a very small, even \nnonexistent brain. Judging by the damage on the MRI, the baby in that \nimage is likely to have severe cognitive impairment and may be unable \nto learn to walk or talk.\n  So that is why the same day I sent a letter to the Centers for \nDisease Control. I sent a letter to them regarding the Zika testing \nbacklog.\n  On April 8, I hosted a briefing in Miami--a week ago tomorrow. Some \nState health departments, local health departments, and county \ngovernment officials were represented. I included health officers from \nPuerto Rico. I publicly, as I said at the time, offered my support for \nthe President's emergency supplemental funding request.\n  While I heard there were many obstacles that we face in fighting \nZika, one aspect I heard about repeatedly was the distressing length of \ntime it takes for diagnostic tests to be completed. I have subsequently \nseen media reports of pregnant women who have waited up to a month for \nthe CDC to complete their diagnostic tests for the Zika virus while \nfearful mothers anxiously waited to know their child's fate.\n\n  Of course, we are still waiting for the supplemental request to be \npassed, and I hope we can do that quickly. There really is no reason to \nwait on this.\n  But until Congress approves the request, I urge the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to use whatever steps are necessary to \ndedicate currently available resources to clearing its current backlog \nof Zika diagnostic tests and to prioritize these tests for women who \nare pregnant.\n  I believe these essential steps will help us not only to ease \nmothers' minds who test negative for the virus but also to provide \ncritical care for a child whose mother tests positive for the Zika \nvirus. We know that screening for microcephaly should happen early and \noften, and receiving the results of a diagnostic test is the first step \nin that process. The CDC should have the capability to provide those \nservices immediately to those who are waiting.\n  Ultimately, it is my hope that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \nwill approve a commercial Zika diagnostic test in the near future so \nthat these tests are more broadly available.\n  One more thing that was reported on Wednesday was that the House GOP \nis readying a Zika funding plan. House leaders are working on approving \nmore funding by the end of this year. Once again, I encourage them to \ndo so in light of the circumstances we now face.\n  I am not saying this is going to be an outbreak of crisis \nproportions, but I am saying that for a family that is potentially \nimpacted by this, it will be a crisis. I am saying that it is important \nfor\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nthese testing kits to be available--not only for the expectant mothers \nor potentially pregnant but also for men because, as we know, the Zika \nvirus can also be transmitted sexually, as it was in the transmission \nthat occurred in Polk County, FL.\n  Beyond it, I hope that in this funding request we don't wait until \nthe end of the year. The summer months are coming, and these are the \nmonths where the spread of these mosquitoes--the two strains of the two \ntypes of species of mosquitoes that carry the virus--are going to be \nprevalent in many parts of the country. It is the time of year when \nmany people find themselves outdoors exposed to these mosquitoes.\n  I hope the funding request can be in place and that we don't wait \nuntil the end of the year to deal with this. It shouldn't take this \nlong. Look, I believe in limited government, but I do believe one of \nthe obligations of a limited Federal Government is to protect our \npeople from dangers, whether they be foreign enemies or the risk of \ndisease outbreak.\n  I hope we will move forward on this endeavor because it is important. \nIt is a proper function of government. We shouldn't be sitting here 6 \nmonths from now regretting that we didn't act sooner. I hope we will \nmove promptly and quickly both in the House and then in the Senate to \naddress this issue.\n  I also wish to say that I don't want to forget about Puerto Rico. \nOftentimes people forget that Puerto Rico is the United States. The \npeople who live there are U.S. citizens.\n  There is already a severe outbreak when it comes to Puerto Rico. They \nare already facing this crisis. So it is important. If this were one of \nthe 50 States, they would have a Senator on the floor right now, maybe \ntwo, arguing on behalf of them. Obviously, Puerto Rico doesn't have a \nSenator elected from the island.\n  I stand here today on their behalf to argue that this is an important \nissue that needs to be addressed for the sake of our country, but most \nimmediately for the sake of the territory of Puerto Rico. I hope we \nwill move quickly to confront this issue and to solve it.\n  I close by saying one more thing. While government has an important \nrole to play, ultimately we have a responsibility. If you are traveling \nto parts of this world where you might be exposed to the virus, you \nhave an obligation to get tested to ensure that you are not going to be \ntransmitting this to your partner.\n  As I argued last week at my press conference, if you are going to be \noutdoors, you have an obligation to use mosquito repellant to protect \nyourself and your family from being exposed to this, just the same way \nyou would wear sunscreen. It is important for us more this summer than \nany other.\n  It is not only Zika that mosquitoes transmit. They transmit all kinds \nof other very serious illnesses. There is a level of personal \nresponsibility here. We talked about people not allowing bodies of \nwater, whether it is undrained pools or puddles of water in your \nbackyard. These mosquitoes can grow in water containers as small as the \ncap of a bottle of water. They don't need a lot of water in order to \nreproduce and grow. So there are things we need to do in our own lives \nto take personal responsibility for dealing with the Zika virus.\n  But there is a proper role for government, and I hope we will play \nit. We have an obligation to hold the government responsible to ensure \nthat the money that is appropriated is just being spent on Zika and is \nbeing spent appropriately on things that work. We should be working \nwith our local and State partners to ensure that we are funding the \nprograms that work and need to be funded. But I think we need to get it \ndone. I hope we can get it done here rather quickly because the summer \nis upon us. I don't think we want to be halfway through the summer and \nwake up to the news that hundreds and hundreds of Americans in multiple \nStates have been infected and we did nothing. We will have to explain \nthat to our constituents, and I am not sure we are going to have a good \nexplanation if we don't have it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2090-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2090-S2091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REFORMING THE H-1B VISA PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak about H-1B visas, often \ncalled the high-skilled immigration visa. Every year, the U.S. \nGovernment issues 85,000 new H-1B visas, including 20,000 for workers \nwith advanced degrees. This is in addition to hundreds of thousands of \nforeign workers already in the United States on H-1B visas.\n  Beginning on April 1, employers can submit petitions for new H-1B \nvisas. Every year, within a few days, the government announces that it \nhas received many more petitions for visas than the number of visas \navailable.\n  The government then conducts a random lottery to decide which \nemployers will receive the visas. Every year this leads to a hue and \ncry from our business community about the need to increase the annual \ncap for H-1B visas.\n  Like clockwork, this process played out last week, just as it does \nevery year. Let's take a look at what happened.\n  When most people think of H-1B visas, they think of big tech \ncompanies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple hiring top-notch computer \nengineers, paying them top dollar to come in from overseas.\n  But here is the reality. In fact, the top recipients of H-1B visas \nare foreign companies that use loopholes in the law to displace \nqualified American workers and send American jobs offshore.\n  In 2013, outsourcing firms received more than 50 percent of the \nannual H-1B visa cap. Think about that. Over half of these H-1B visas, \ndesigned to bring skilled foreign workers into the United States, are \nbeing given to foreign outsourcing companies.\n  It sounds wrong; doesn't it?\n  In 2014, 15 of the top 20 H-1B employers used the H-1B visa primarily \nto offshore American jobs; that is, to take Americans, put them out of \nwork, and have foreign workers take their jobs. These 15 firms gobbled \nup over 190,000 new H-1B visas over 10 years.\n  This is how it works. Foreign outsourcing companies import thousands \nof foreign guest workers using H-1B visas. These companies then cut \ndeals with American companies to outsource American jobs and to move \nthem offshore. The United States keeps them in the United States but \nwith these foreign workers. The U.S. company gives their American \nworkers notice that they will be fired. But before the American workers \nare laid off--listen to this--the American workers are forced to train \nthe foreign guest workers who are going to take over their jobs.\n  After they are trained, the outsourcing company returns the foreign \nworkers to their home country where--guess what--they compete with the \nUnited States.\n  Most of these foreign outsourcing companies are from India: Infosys, \nTata, and Wipro. You may not recognize those names, but they are making \nbillions of dollars using the H-1B visa to outsource American jobs and \ndisplace American workers.\n  A high-ranking Indian Government official even called the H-1B visa \n``the outsourcing visa.'' The International Herald Tribune investigated \nthese Indian companies, and this is what they concluded: ``Rather than \nbuilding a thriving community of experts and innovators in the United \nStates, the Indian firms seek to funnel work--and expertise--away from \nthe country.''\n  Congress intended the H-1B program to allow an employer to hire a \nskilled foreign worker in a specialized occupation when the American \nemployer couldn't find an American worker with those skills and \nabilities.\n  We didn't create this program for foreign outsourcing firms to \nexploit the program and to bring foreign workers to our country to be \ntrained by talented American workers in order to see their jobs shipped \naway.\n  So let's take an example. In the last year alone, media reports have \ndocumented the replacement of hundreds of American workers by these \nforeign outsourcing companies. Let me give an example close to home. \nAbbott Labs of\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\nIllinois, headquartered near Chicago, signed a contract for information \ntechnology services with Wipro, one of the largest foreign outsourcing \ncompanies based in India and one of the top users of the H-1B visa \nprogram.\n  Here is how it worked: Approximately 150 U.S. employees at Abbott \nLabs in Illinois are going to lose their jobs. The workers being laid \noff have stellar experience--many of them have been at Abbott for \nyears. They have the credentials, the performance reviews, and some \nhave amazing work records spanning decades at Abbott Labs. I know from \nrecent conversations with Abbott Labs employees that this layoff is \ntaking its toll on the morale of their remaining workforce.\n  When I heard about these plans, I wrote to Miles White, the CEO of \nAbbott Labs. I urged him to reconsider this plan and to keep his \nAmerican workers who have worked so hard for Abbott Labs for years. \nWell, I am sorry to report he responded to my letter and confirmed his \ncompany's plans to terminate these American workers.\n  I am very concerned about Abbott Labs because they have required the \nemployees who are losing their jobs and being laid off to sign away \ntheir right to sue or even disparage the company if they want to \nreceive any severance pay. As a result of this agreement, Congress and \nthe American people are unable to hear directly from the employees who \nare affected by this decision at Abbott Labs--employees who are losing \ntheir jobs to Wipro, an Indian company that specializes in outsourcing \nAmerican jobs. Abbot employees have told my staff they were concerned \nthat even if they spoke with our office about what was happening at \nAbbott Labs, they could be placed in jeopardy.\n  Other companies that have signed contracts with foreign outsourcing \ncompanies to replace American workers have also forced their employees \nto sign these nondisparagement agreements. So we are in the dark about \nthe human impact of these outsourcing arrangements on the Americans \nlosing their jobs. What we do know is this: 150 skilled and experienced \nAmerican workers will lose their jobs and have had to sign an agreement \nthat they will not say anything negative about their current employer. \nIf they do not comply with that, they do not get their severance pay.\n  I sent a followup letter to Mr. White today about the gag order he \nhas forced on his employees. We should be able to hear firsthand from \nworkers who are losing their jobs because of outsourcing as to just \nexactly what is happening to them.\n  Senator Chuck Grassley and I first introduced bipartisan legislation \nto reform the H-1B visa program in 2007--almost a decade ago. Our bill \nwould end these abuses and protect American and foreign workers from \nexploitation. The outsourcing companies are worried about our \nlegislation. For a long time, Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin were on \nthe front page of a lot of Indian newspapers. Listen to the corporate \njargon Wipro uses to talk about our bill:\n\n       With the growth of offshore outsourcing receiving \n     increasing political and media attention, there have been \n     concerted efforts to enact new legislation to restrict \n     offshore outsourcing. This may adversely impact our ability \n     to do business in these jurisdictions and could adversely \n     affect our revenues and operating profitability.\n\n  Let me be clear. My first obligation as a U.S. Senator is to protect \nAmerican workers. If that adversely affects the profits of a foreign \ncompany that specializes in outsourcing American jobs, so be it.\n  In 2013 I joined the Gang of 8--Democrats and Republicans--and we put \ntogether a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Corporate interests \nfought hard to protect these H-1B visas, but we successfully included \nseveral important changes to the program in the bill. Let me give an \nexample. Under current law, employers are permitted to pay H-1B visa \nholders substandard wages, which creates an incentive to fire Americans \nand hire foreign workers.\n  The vice president of Tata, out of India, one of the leading foreign \noutsourcing firms, candidly acknowledged they use H-1B visas to \nundercut American workers. Here is what he said:\n\n       Our wage per employee is 20-25 percent lesser than U.S. \n     wage for a similar employee. . . . The issue is that of \n     getting workers in the U.S. on wages far lower than local \n     wage.\n\n  He was pretty candid about it. The object is to put Americans out of \nwork and to charge less than what the Americans are being paid. So I \nwrote a provision in the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill \nthat discouraged employers from hiring foreign workers as a source of \ncheap labor by doubling the minimum wage of H-1B employees, and \nemployers of large numbers of H-1B visa holders would be required to \npay, at a minimum, the average wage paid to an American. That is why \nthe chief executive of Tata in India said our bill would have been \n``very tough'' on outsourcing companies. So be it.\n  The Senate passed that bill on this floor 68 to 32. Unfortunately, \nthe Republican leadership in the House of Representatives refused to \neven call the bill. They wouldn't debate it or call it for a vote.\n  Now, the two leading Republican Presidential candidates, Donald Trump \nand the junior Senator from Texas, have jumped on the bandwagon. They \nwant to reform the H-1B program. Unfortunately, their track records \ncall into question their real commitment. Mr. Trump owns companies that \nhave sought to import at least 1,000 temporary guest workers while \nturning away hundreds of American workers. In 2013, when the Judiciary \nCommittee considered the comprehensive immigration reform bill, Senator \nCruz of Texas offered an amendment to increase--increase--the annual \ncap for H-1B visas to 325,000 per year--almost four times the current \nnumber.\n  Nonetheless, if they have changed their mind out on the campaign \ntrail, we welcome that change of heart and welcome them to this debate. \nWe must reform the H-1B visa program and fix other parts of our broken \nimmigration system to protect American and immigrant workers. The \nsolution is still comprehensive immigration reform. The time for action \nis now. Congress has avoided its responsibility for far too long.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2091-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2091-S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout our allies across the globe, and I am doing so because they are \nimportant to our national security. That seems to be an obvious \nstatement, but our allies seem to be getting a bit of a bipartisan \nshort shrift of late. I come to the floor of the Senate to talk about \nhow important they are to our Nation, to our citizens. It is \nbipartisan, as I mentioned.\n  As many of us have read, on the campaign trail Presidential candidate \nDonald Trump has been critical of NATO, has been critical of our Asia-\nPacific allies. Meanwhile--and in many ways it hasn't gotten the news \nit deserves because it is a sitting President--in a recent article in \nThe Atlantic by Jeffrey Goldberg entitled ``The Obama Doctrine,'' \nPresident Obama himself is dismissive of many U.S. allies around the \nworld.\n  I thought it was important to talk a little bit about our allies and \nhow important they are to U.S. security and to expanding American \ninfluence globally.\n  Let's start with Mr. Trump. He has called NATO--which, by the way, \nhappens to be one of the most successful alliances in the history of \nthe world--an alliance that is ``obsolete'' and ``too expensive.'' \nAbout the members of the 28-nation alliance, he said: ``Either they pay \nup, including for past deficiencies, or they have to get out. And if it \nbreaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO.'' Oh, well. So much for the world's \nmost successful alliance.\n  However, contrary to public perception, the United States does not \npay for a majority of NATO's spending. We pay about 22 percent of \nNATO's common-funded budgets and programs for all of NATO--about 22 \npercent.\n  The Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, was here last week, \nand he\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\ninformed me and many of my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that most NATO countries have stopped their decline in \ndefense spending and have recommitted to NATO's goal of 2 percent of \ntheir GDP toward defense spending. That is important--working on the \nfinances, reversing this trend. But here is the key point: It is not \njust about finances. Over 1,000 non-U.S. NATO troops have been killed \nin action in Afghanistan coming to our defense after 9/11, going after \nthe terrorists who killed over 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Over 1,000 of \nour NATO allies have paid the ultimate price. You can't put a price tag \non that. Thousands more have been wounded. Some sacrifices can't be \nmeasured in just dollars.\n  Based on his comments, Mr. Trump also does not seem to fully \ncomprehend how the presence of American troops in the Asia-Pacific has \nbeen the linchpin of security and prosperity in the region for more \nthan 70 years. Today our allies in the Asia-Pacific are substantially \nincreasing their financial and military commitments in that region. Let \nme give a few examples.\n  Under Prime Minister Abe's leadership, Japan has amended its \nConstitution to do much more militarily in terms of being able to work \nwith us and even defend U.S. forces in the region. As we are looking to \nrebalance and reposition U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific over the next \nseveral years, the estimates from Pacific Command are that is going to \ncost about $37 billion, repositioning U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific. \nIt is a very important part of our strategy. It is a strategy, by the \nway, that--the President talks about the rebalance, which I think is \nsmart, in the Asia-Pacific. Of that $37 billion for our forces and the \nmilitary construction that is going to take place with this rebalance, \nabout $30 billion will be paid by Japan and Korea. That is certainly \npaying their way.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. Camp Humphreys--that is an Army \nbase in Korea--we are moving a lot of forces there, doing a lot of \nmilitary construction there, and it is going to cost about $11 billion. \nNinety-one percent of that is going to be paid by Korea--for U.S. \nmilitary forces.\n  In Guam--U.S. territory where we are repositioning marines and other \ncritical military assets in the Asia-Pacific--Japan is paying $3 \nbillion for that repositioning on U.S. territory. It is the first time \never. A foreign country is paying for military construction on our \nterritory.\n  The bottom line is that there is no doubt that our allies around the \nworld, particularly in Europe, need to do more in terms of defense \nspending. Many people have spoken on this. Former Secretary Gates--very \nwell respected--raises this in his recent bio. But it is simply \nerroneous to suggest that America would be better off without NATO or \nwithout our Asia-Pacific allies and alliances. Yes, they need to spend \nmore, but there is a big difference saying we don't need our allies.\n  Let me say that we should all understand that Mr. Trump, Donald \nTrump--he is a candidate. He is certainly not an expert on national \nsecurity affairs. And his views certainly reflect the frustrations that \nmany Americans and many Members of Congress have about allies who are \nnot spending as much on defense. Of course we know this often happens \nduring elections. We have seen that. It is an outgrowth of \nfrustrations.\n  But what is unprecedented is for a sitting President to be dismissive \nand even disdainful of our most important allies in a publication read \nby millions. To do so is not only unpresidential, it threatens to \nundermine ongoing U.S. national security interests.\n  I want to talk a little bit about The Atlantic article that I \nmentioned earlier, written by Jeffrey Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, who had \nenormous access to the President for I think well over a year--traveled \nwith him all over on Air Force One, had numerous interviews--in his \narticle, he takes us on a trip across the globe through the eyes of \nPresident Obama. I would encourage all of my colleagues in this body to \nread that article.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. Goldberg has significant access to the President, \nbut the tour across the world leaves us no doubt that the President not \nonly views himself as the smartest man in the room, he is the smartest \nman in the world. In Mr. Goldberg's words, President Obama ``has found \nworld leadership wanting: global partners who often lack the vision and \nthe will to spend political capital in pursuit of broad, progressive \ngoals, and adversaries who are not, in his mind, as rational as he \nis.''\n  The President assesses the very strengths and weaknesses of our \nallies. In his view, only German Chancellor Angela Merkel measures up. \nThere is a whole list of leaders from countries that are allies of the \nUnited States and are mentioned in this article. The President calls \nthe President of a critical NATO country a ``failure,'' and he is \nopenly disapproving of the leadership role of Britain and France and \nopenly complaining that neither did their part with regard to Libya, \nwhere the Obama administration famously, or infamously, announced it \nwas leading from behind.\n  The jabs and the stories in the Goldberg piece at other leaders, such \nas the leaders of Jordan, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, are gratuitous. \nThese might be appropriate for later in the President's memoirs, as he \nis writing his memoirs talking about world leaders and where they \nmeasure up and where they are weak, but not while he is still the \nPresident. He still has work to do for our country.\n\n  The President even trains his fire on American leaders, members of \nthe foreign policy establishment, and even GEN Lloyd Austin, the well-\nrespected and recently retired commander of U.S. Central Command. There \nis a big section in there about how the President viewed Ronald \nReagan's leadership and shortcomings in foreign affairs. Everybody \nseems to be lacking in the President's eyes.\n  It is not just individuals, it is the way we, as a Nation, supposedly \nconduct our foreign policy. By the President's own account, he has been \na bulwark against American hubris, self-righteousness--his words--in \nforeign affairs. Let me repeat that. His view is that he has been a \nbulwark against our hubris and our self-righteousness in foreign \naffairs.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, whether it is Alaska or West \nVirginia, most Americans understand another more historically accurate \nnarrative of our role in foreign affairs throughout the world. It is \nnot one of hubris, but one of sacrifice, commitment, and courage in \ndefending freedom for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. \nThat has been the role of the United States, and for decades, \nespecially since World War II, there has been a bipartisan, long-term \neffort by truly some of the smartest people in American foreign policy \nwho were ``present at the creation,'' and beyond--as Dean Acheson said \nin his autobiography--into deepening our relationship with other \ncountries and, as part of doing that, establishing the forward presence \nof U.S. military power around the world. These were some of America's \nbest minds--Marshall, Acheson, George Schultz.\n  Why did they do this? Because forging these alliances ultimately not \nonly advances the goal of freedom and a more peaceful and prosperous \nworld, but it also helps ensure that American influence and power \nremain preeminent and, most importantly, that our citizens remain safe.\n  In assessing our significant international challenges right now, one \ncentral truth stands out: Many of our enemies and potential adversaries \nand rivals are ally poor while the United States is ally rich. Think of \ncountries like Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist groups \nlike ISIS. They have very few allies. Very few other countries are \nrunning to them right now. Then think about our allies throughout the \nworld. It is time to recognize and double down on this uniquely \nAmerican comparative advantage in foreign affairs. We are ally rich. \nOur rivals are ally poor. We need to take advantage of it. Yet the \nObama administration seems to have ignored it.\n  Indeed, Secretary of State John Kerry has spent more time wooing \nadversaries like Iran and Russia than doing the hard work of deepening \nthe bonds of trust with our allies. Coupled with the President's \nremarks in the Atlantic, his missives directed at friends make it seem \nas if they are actually repelling allies, not working with them and \nbuilding up trust. This, of course, is a mistake.\n  Like many in this body, I have had the opportunity to serve my \ncountry in\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\ndifferent capacities, trying to work to advance the national security \nof our Nation. I have had the opportunity to see the positive results \nof the carefully woven fabric of decades of bipartisan American \ndiplomacy, military engagement, and leadership throughout the world. \nWithout American leaders who understand history and the important role \nour allies play in America's security and prosperity, the fabric of our \nalliances put together over decades threatens to unravel. If that \nhappens, the world is going to become a much more dangerous place.\n  Our Founding Fathers provided the Senate with significant \nresponsibility in terms of foreign affairs, and I am hopeful that every \nMember of this body will redouble their efforts to reach out and to \nwork with our allies so we don't continue this trend where leaders \ncurrently in the White House, or perhaps potential occupants of the \nWhite House, view our allies as a burden when in reality they are a key \ncomponent of our security and prosperity, and we need to continue to \nwork with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2093-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of \nthe formal establishment of the Reserve Officer Training Corps, ROTC, \nat its birthplace, Norwich University in Vermont. Thanks to the vision \nof Alden Partridge and Norwich University, we now enjoy the benefits of \nthis century-old program that has commissioned more than half a million \nensigns and second lieutenants since its inception.\n  Years before many of his peers, Alden Partridge saw the potential of \nthe citizen soldier. He created Norwich University as a place to \neducate future generations in a variety of academic fields separate \nfrom, but also essential to, the military and to the civic \nparticipation synonymous with today's Norwich University. Over the \nyears, the value of the ideals promoted at Norwich University have \nremained clear to me. Today these proven ideals can be found at \ninstitutions of higher education through ROTC programs in all 50 \nStates, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.\n  Without question, the country benefits from this diversity of \nexperience. The U.S. service academies create high-quality, \nprofessional officers, and I am proud to nominate Vermonters to them \nevery year. Our military, however, cannot rely on leadership that comes \nsolely from a handful of institutions, however excellent they are. For \n100 years, ROTC has guaranteed an officer corps that better reflects \nthe diversity of America.\n  Few schools can boast a history as long, rich, and relevant as \nNorwich University. Always forward thinking, in 1974, Norwich became \none of the first military colleges in the Nation to admit women, \nbeginning yet another proud chapter in its history. Today the school \nranks among the top institutions for education in the realm of cyber \nsecurity, an essential professional discipline nurtured early on \nlargely because of the forethought of Norwich University personnel. I \nam confident this trend of success will continue.\n  The faculty and staff at Norwich help produce highly motivated, well-\ntrained graduates who are simply eager to serve. Their role as \neducators and mentors creates connections that last throughout the \nmilitary and civilian careers of graduates and, in turn, fosters a \npowerful alumni connection that brings even more experience and wisdom \nto the next generation of students.\n  Vermonters take great pride in their educational institutions, and \nNorwich University is no exception. Students arrive from around the \nNation to study in both corps of cadets and traditional capacities. \nThey develop essential academic and professional skills often while \nsimultaneously fulfilling ROTC obligations that prepare them for future \nmilitary service. Norwich, like the 274 other institutions supporting \nROTC programs, demands and develops excellence in its commissioning-\ntrack student body.\n  I would like to recognize Norwich University, the birthplace of the \nROTC, for its role in initiating a program that has enjoyed a century \nof success. I am confident that Alden Partridge's dream will continue \nto be realized at colleges and universities throughout the Nation as \nfuture generations of ROTC officers are produced and charged with the \ntask of ensuring our Nation's success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2093-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2093-S2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE EXECUTIVE SESSION ON INNOVATION AGENDA\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof my remarks at the Senate Health Committee's third executive session \non its biomedical innovation agenda be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Senate Health Committee Executive Session on Innovation Agenda\n\n       This is our third and final markup of legislation that is \n     part of our innovation, or ``cures,'' agenda--that is, our \n     effort to take advantage of this exciting time in science and \n     enable safe treatments, drugs, and devices to reach patients \n     more quickly.\n       Today's markup completes action on about 50 bipartisan \n     proposals this committee has been working on for more than a \n     year--with 10 hearings, five staff working groups that have \n     held more than 100 meetings. When we are finished today, \n     these proposals will together form a companion to 21st \n     Century Cures Act, which passed the House 344-77 last year, \n     and a vehicle for the president's Precision Medicine \n     Initiative and Cancer Moonshot.\n       If we succeed, this will be the most important bill signed \n     into law this year.\n       Why do I say that?\n       Here's one reason: 6-year-old Californian Rylie Rahall, \n     diagnosed with a genetic disorder called Ataxia-\n     Telangiectasia or A-T, so rare--according to NIH--that it \n     affects between 1 out of 40,000 and 1 out of 100,000.\n       A bill we're voting on today will support the president's \n     Precision Medicine Initiative to map 1 million genomes to \n     help researchers tailor treatments to genetic variations and \n     find cures for diseases, including rare diseases like A-T, \n     and help children like Rylie.\n       Rylie's mom, Erica, says:\n       ``At the time Rylie was diagnosed, I felt more helpless \n     than hopeful. . . . There are no drugs. There is no cure. \n     There is nothing to stop this disease and nothing you can do \n     to save your child. . . . Five years later all of that is \n     changing. There is more research than ever happening. We are \n     closer than ever to clinical trials . . . Hopeful.''\n       Here's another reason:\n       In a floor speech in 2013, Senator Isakson talked about \n     battling a superbug, an infection that runs out of control \n     and resists treatment by common antibiotics. We are voting \n     today on a bill by senators Hatch and Bennet to shorten the \n     development of treatments for superbugs.\n       And another reason: A 2012 bill sponsored by Senators Burr, \n     Bennet, and Hatch to expedite the FDA review process for \n     breakthrough drugs has been very successful, leading to 118 \n     drugs designated as breakthrough, including 39 approvals, \n     including the first drug ever to actually cure some forms of \n     Cystic Fibrosis. This committee passed similar legislation in \n     March for breakthrough devices.\n       One more reason: we've heard from doctors that they spend \n     half their time on paperwork, and from patients who lug boxes \n     of medical records from appointment to appointment. This \n     committee unanimously passed legislation to reduce the \n     documentation burden and improve the flow of information so \n     doctors can spend more time with patients, and patients can \n     have easier access to their health information.\n       This committee has passed--by voice vote or with \n     overwhelming support--14 bills made up of 30 bipartisan \n     proposals; bills that will mean better pacemakers for \n     Americans with heart conditions, better rehabilitation for \n     stroke victims, more young researchers entering the medical \n     field, and better access for doctors to their patients' \n     medical records.\n       By the time we finish today, 16 of this committee's 22 \n     members will have sponsored one of these bills. Some have \n     sponsored several.\n       Today we are voting on five bills:\n       A bill by Senator Murray and myself to help the FDA and the \n     NIH attract and retain top talent, which Dr. Collins and Dr. \n     Califf say is their top priority.\n       The bill by Sens. Hatch and Bennet to shorten the \n     development time for superbug treatments.\n       The bill by Senator Murray and myself to support the \n     president's Precision Medicine Initiative, to map 1 million \n     genomes and make the information available to researchers who \n     will share their research.\n       A bill by Senator Collins, Kirk, Baldwin, Murray, and \n     myself that requires NIH to submit a strategic plan to \n     Congress; and ensures that scientists are including women and \n     minorities in their research.\n       A bill by Senator Murray and myself to allow NIH \n     researchers to spend more time finding lifesaving treatments \n     and cures and less time on paperwork.\n       I look forward to moving these bills to the floor.\n       Senator Murray and I are making progress on an ``NIH \n     Innovation Fund'' to provide a\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\n     one-time funding surge for NIH priorities including: \n     Precision Medicine, Cancer Moonshot, the Brain Initiative, \n     Young Investigator Corps, and Big Biothink Awards.\n       With its 21st Century Cures Act, the House voted 344 to 77 \n     to provide $8.8 billion in paid-for mandatory funding to \n     support such NIH priorities. We continue working on finding \n     an amount that the House will agree to and the president will \n     sign that we can responsibly pay for in a bipartisan way.

For the over 20 million people in the \nUnited States who become crime victims each year, this week offers an \nopportunity for Congress, the Department of Justice, as well as State \nand local law enforcement, communities, and service providers across \nthe country to publicly proclaim our support for crime victims and \nsurvivors.\n  The physical, emotional, and psychological impact that crime causes \nfor the victims and their loved ones can prove devastating. Crime \nwreaks havoc on our communities. Given these hardships, we must do all \nwe can to support and protect survivors by holding their perpetrators \naccountable and ensuring that all victims are treated with dignity, \nfairness, and respect. We can accomplish this aim, at least in part, by \nrecognizing the critical position that victims hold within the criminal \njustice process.\n  The theme for this year's National Crime Victims' Rights Week is \n``Serving Victims; Building Trust; Restoring Hope.'' In keeping with \nthat spirit, I want to recognize and thank the countless professional \nand volunteer victim advocates and service providers. Your dedication \nand commitment to our moms and dads, brothers and sisters, and \ndaughters and sons, often during their time of greatest need, is truly \nprofound. Thank you, thank you, for being that solid ground and strong \nshoulder supporting our fellow Americans as they fight for justice and \nto once again become whole.\n  To the millions of victims and survivors, you are not alone, and you \nhave not been silenced. We hear you and pledge to do all we can to \nsupport you through your recovery. As the Senate Judiciary Committee \ncontinues to combat the scourge of crime through legislation and \noversight, we will continue to both acknowledge and honor the needs and \nrights of victims and survivors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2094-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2094-S2096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOW TRADE MADE AMERICA GREAT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, it was while a Yale undergraduate \nthat Fred Smith received a C-plus for his paper outlining a plan to buy \nlarge airplanes that would carry packages overnight. This plan a few \nyears later became Federal Express, now FedEx, a global courier \ndelivery services company with nearly $50 billion in revenues and more \nthan 340,000 employees. FedEx has become a leading worldwide economic \nindicator all by itself and one of our country's great success stories. \nMr. Smith not only founded the company, but today still is CEO and \nChairman.\n  Fred Smith's address should be required reading on all college \ncampuses, as well as for all others who may have forgotten the \nremarkable contribution trade has made to prosperity not only for our \ncountry, but for hundreds of millions worldwide. There is no doubt that \nglobalization and technology have improved living conditions in our \ncountry, but they have also bred uncertainty and sometimes fear. For \nmany Americans, the cheaper goods we buy from overseas and the salaries \nwe make from selling goods overseas come with dislocations that make it \nharder for Americans to find jobs and provide for their families.\n  Added to that are actions by some of our trading partners--Japan in \nthe 1980s and China more recently--that abuse the trade relationship \nand turn free trade into unfair trade. Nevertheless, before we turn our \nbacks on or significantly change our national policy of encouraging \nfreer trade with other countries, we would be wise to read Mr. Smith's \naccount of the benefits of trade to the average American family during \nthe last 50 years--and also to be reminded of the devastation that \nrestrictions on trade caused during the 1930s when those restrictions \nhelped lead to the Great Depression.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by \nFred Smith from the Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 25, 2016]\n\n                      How Trade Made America Great\n\n                        (By Frederick W. Smith)\n\n       During our years at Yale, the world was a different place. \n     Foreign travel was exotic, expensive and rare among the \n     population as a whole. While some young Americans had been \n     abroad, by far most Americans had not--and those who did go \n     abroad most likely traveled by sea rather than air. In the \n     early 1960s, flying over the oceans was mainly for the \n     affluent.\n       Long-distance telephone calls were expensive, international \n     calls prohibitively so. From furniture to TVs and appliances, \n     and especially automobiles, American brands dominated \n     consumer spending in this country. We had just a glimpse of \n     the world to come with the proliferating iconic Volkswagen \n     Beetles and the amazingly small Sony portable transistor \n     radios.\n       These imported products in the U.S. represented a global \n     political vision that pre-dated World War II. In the early \n     1930s, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell \n     Hull believed in liberalized trade as a path to world peace \n     and cooperation. With strong administration support, Congress \n     in 1934 passed the Trade Agreement Act, which allowed Hull to \n     negotiate reciprocal trade treaties with numerous countries, \n     lowering tariffs and stimulating trade.\n       This liberalization reversed the epitome of U.S. \n     protectionism, the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of \n     1930, which contributed to a staggering 66% decline in world \n     trade between 1929 and 1934. Integral to Hull's vision was \n     the 1947 General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), which \n     was signed by 23 countries and committed the U.S. to steadily \n     liberalizing world trade. A central pillar of American \n     postwar policy was enticing producers from around the world \n     with access to the giant U.S. market.\n       The devastation of Europe and Japan and the emergence of \n     Cold War adversaries provided even greater impetus to the \n     opening of American markets, under the protection of the U.S. \n     Navy and the umbrella of various global alliances like NATO. \n     In April 1966 Malcolm McLean launched his first international \n     Sea-Land container operation between New York and Rotterdam. \n     McLean's shipping-container revolution cut the cost of \n     seaborne trade by a factor of 50 versus loose-cargo \n     stevedoring.\n       That same month, Juan Trippe (Yale '21) at Pan Am ordered \n     25 revolutionary jumbo 747 widebody Boeing airplanes equipped \n     with equally leading-edge Pratt & Whitney high-bypass \n     fanjets. When the passenger version of the 747 entered \n     service in 1969, it was two-and-a-half times bigger than the \n     Boeing 707 that had pioneered jet travel. The jumbo jet cut \n     overseas travel costs by 70%.\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\n       The 747's hump allowed a freighter version to load cargo \n     through a nose door under the cockpit and into the cavernous \n     fuselage. Because of the cargo-carrying 747F, costs for \n     trans-Pacific airfreight were dramatically reduced, a major \n     factor in the extraordinary GDP growth of the Asian ``tiger'' \n     economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan beginning \n     in the 1970s. Electronics and other high-tech/high-value-\n     added goods from these emerging markets could be distributed \n     and sold in the U.S. and Europe in a few days--an amazing \n     development.\n       During the 1970s and 1980s, while container ships and \n     planes became increasingly efficient with each successive \n     model, newly developed fiber-optic cables (patented in 1966) \n     began running underseas, connecting the world at the speed of \n     light, lowering voice and data-communication costs by orders \n     of magnitude. Financial markets became globally integrated \n     and transactions multiplied at an astounding rate.\n       The U.S. opened its markets to former World War II foes, \n     and Germany and Japan as a result became economic titans. \n     Successive administrations mostly ignored Japan's overt \n     mercantilism and growing trade surplus, given the need for \n     American military bases throughout the country. Eventually \n     exchange rates and domestic political pressure pushed \n     Japanese car makers to set up production plants in the U.S., \n     mostly in the South. Electronics manufacturers such as \n     Panasonic, Sony and Hitachi became world-wide giants on the \n     back of exports from Japan to America and then almost \n     everywhere as global trade steadily expanded.\n       Parallel to the technological progress of transportation \n     and telecommunications was a remarkable series of \n     congressional actions and GATT agreements that substantially \n     liberalized transport and trade regulations. During the \n     Carter administration, inspired by extensive academic \n     research and the example of ultra-low-fare intrastate \n     airlines in Texas and California compared with high-cost \n     national carriers, many Republican and Democratic lawmakers \n     alike pushed for federal economic deregulation of \n     transportation. The Republican mantra was ``free market''; \n     Democrats sought ``consumer benefit'' by lowering the price \n     of travel and goods for the masses.\n       As a result, legislation was enacted for air cargo (1977), \n     passenger air services (1978), interstate truck and rail \n     transportation (1980), and the federal pre-emption of \n     intrastate trucking in 1994. Both the Civil Aeronautics Board \n     (CAB) and the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the air \n     and surface economic regulators, were abolished, in 1985 and \n     1995 respectively.\n       In the 10 years following the Staggers Act of 1980 that \n     substantially deregulated railroads, the perennially loss-\n     making rail industry was able to halve the rates charged to \n     customers while restoring financial stability. Surface-\n     transport deregulation also spawned an entire new industry of \n     flexible truckload common carriers to meet the needs of \n     emerging ``big box'' distribution and retailing models such \n     as Wal-Mart and Target. Revolutionary production systems, \n     based on just-in-time supply and fast-cycle manufacturing, \n     were made possible only because of the deregulation of \n     trucking.\n       From 1977 to 1994, a century's worth of heavy regulation of \n     transportation rates, routes and services that had begun with \n     the railroads was cast aside, with profound effects on the \n     U.S. economy. By the beginning of the 21st century, overall \n     logistics costs were reduced from 16% of GDP during the 1970s \n     to under 9%, thereby making possible substantial increases in \n     government social spending resulting from the Medicare and \n     Medicaid legislation in the 1960s.\n       On the global-trade front, the GATT framework of 1947 had \n     been ``temporary,'' as Congress refused to approve the \n     International Trade Organization envisioned by the \n     participants at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference that \n     established the World Bank and the International Monetary \n     Fund. Even so, under GATT there were seven successive \n     negotiating ``rounds'' and agreements until the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO), a modernized International Trade \n     Organization, was finally established in Geneva in 1994.\n       The GATT/WTO did not cover sea trade, given the \n     traditionally liberal rules regarding shipping except within \n     national regulated waters. Thus unimpeded, containership \n     lines of many registrations proliferated, facilitating the \n     astonishing growth in maritime business and the development \n     of megaports in Asia, Europe and the U.S.\n       International aviation was likewise a separate regime, but \n     as agreed by 54 nations at the Chicago convention of 1944, \n     international flying was for decades tightly controlled by \n     governments through a labyrinth of bilateral treaties (4,000 \n     at present) that limited competition and regulated rates and \n     services.\n       Beginning in 1992, however, the U.S. and the Netherlands \n     enacted the first of many Open Skies agreements, which have \n     grown now to 117, including a multilateral treaty with 28 \n     European countries. Passenger airlines opened scores of new \n     routes. New air-cargo and door-to-door express services were \n     also initiated.\n       Together, these regulatory changes and transport \n     innovations made possible the fantastic growth of travel and \n     trade, which grew two-and-a-half times the rate of world GDP \n     for a quarter-century.\n       From less than $50 billion in total trade in 1966, the U.S. \n     now imports and exports over $4 trillion annually in goods \n     and services. Container ships have grown from carrying a few \n     hundred boxes on each trip to the new Triple-E behemoths that \n     transport over 18,000 containers called TEUs, or 20-foot-\n     equivalent units. The cost is 1/500th of the shipping rates \n     per pound of the early 1960s. The profusion of agricultural \n     products from the ``Green Revolution'' pioneered by Norman \n     Borlaug, combined with ever more efficient shipping, has \n     resulted in massive amounts of grain traded around the world, \n     something unimaginable to farmers 50 years ago. American \n     railroads were integral to the growth in the nation's \n     maritime trade by moving containers from Pacific ports to the \n     mega markets in the East.\n       All of these factors have created a global trade market \n     that exceeds $15 trillion annually. Now, the Panama Canal is \n     being widened, which will permit, beginning later this year, \n     massive container ships to cross the Pacific and unload \n     directly into improved Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Coast \n     ports, further reducing the cost of Asia-U.S. trade.\n       Handling the enormous increase in financial transactions \n     was made possible by a fantastic increase in computer-\n     processing power. The emergence of the Internet in 1994 has \n     allowed the ubiquitous offering of millions of products for \n     fast delivery from anywhere in the world to anyone with a \n     desktop computer . . . then a PC . . . then a tablet . . . \n     and now a smartphone. Languages are translated; products can \n     be instantly, visually displayed; and orders effortlessly \n     entered. The capabilities are unprecedented in the history of \n     commerce.\n       Three other factors central to the development of these \n     enormous global commercial systems have occurred since 1966: \n     The evolution of a vast world-wide oil market; the \n     integration of the economies of the U.S., Mexico and Canada \n     with the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) of 1994; \n     and the emergence of China as a great commercial power.\n       The oil cartel known as the Organization of the Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries overplayed its hand in the 1970s when, \n     for economic and political reasons, OPEC embargoed shipments \n     to the U.S. Market forces finally sorted out oil supply and \n     demand in America after President Reagan in 1981 dismantled \n     the vestiges of government regulation in the industry. Oil \n     has hardly been immune to the vagaries of any commodities \n     market, but the U.S.--thanks to the technological \n     breakthrough of hydraulic fracturing--is the world's largest \n     producer of natural gas and is on track this decade to \n     surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's largest oil \n     producer.\n       True to the central tenet of FDR and Secretary of State \n     Hull that liberalizing trade is inherently beneficial, the \n     U.S. led the effort for China to join the WTO in 2000. \n     Beginning with the Nixon-to-China rapprochement, the \n     industrialization of America's Cold War enemy has lifted more \n     people--hundreds of millions--out of poverty, faster, than \n     ever in history. From the late 1980s and accelerating after \n     the WTO accession, efficient Chinese manufacturing, \n     especially technology-based goods, has rewarded Western \n     consumers with low-cost products that have substantially \n     improved standards of living. Americans and Europeans don't \n     need to be affluent to afford cellphones, digital TVs, \n     furniture and appliances.\n       China, however, has followed Japan's mercantilistic \n     practices, which have led to a $300 billion trade surplus \n     with the U.S., thanks to state support of Chinese industry \n     and restrictions on foreign competitors. These policies have \n     created a strong political backlash in the U.S., which made \n     the recent congressional renewal of Trade Promotion \n     Authority--which allows the president to negotiate trade \n     treaties and was for years a routine process--extremely \n     difficult.\n       Today, given low growth in most of the world, rising wages \n     in China and petroleum costs declining because of U.S. \n     fracking technology, the trajectory of the world's commerce \n     is somewhat uncertain.\n       Trade and global GDP are now growing roughly at parity. \n     Following the 2008 financial crisis, protectionism has shown \n     a troubling popularity in many countries, including the U.S. \n     Stringent new security regulations have also slowed goods \n     crossing many borders.\n       The Nafta pact has clearly been an economic success. Over \n     the past 20 years, U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada has \n     risen to $1.2 trillion in 2014, from $737 billion. While the \n     immigration issue often gets erroneously conflated with \n     Nafta, the economic numbers tell a clear story. Moreover, \n     some production is now moving back to North America from \n     Asia, given lower transport costs, faster delivery, the \n     increase in Chinese production expenses, easier customs \n     clearance, and the more balanced nature of Nafta trade \n     compared with the massive U.S. deficit with Asia--\n     particularly China and Japan.\n       Once again, in its own messy, unpredictable political \n     fashion, the U.S.--after a hiatus during the first Obama \n     administration--is pushing for further trade liberalization, \n     with initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the \n     Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and the \n     Trade in Services Agreement. The WTO likewise continues to \n     push for a new Trade Facilitation Agreement dealing with \n     security and customs issues; the WTO Information Technology \n     Agreement; and a new overall world-wide trade agreement--the \n     so-called Doha Round negotiations. These efforts by many \n     nations under the WTO show continued commitment to further \n     global integration despite the well-publicized difficulties \n     in doing so.\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\n       More than three billion people are now connected to the \n     Internet. Billions more have aspirations for a better life \n     and are likely to come online as global consumers. The odds \n     are good, therefore, that today's remarkable transport \n     systems and technologies will continue to improve and \n     facilitate an even larger global economy as individual trade \n     is becoming almost ``frictionless.''\n       History shows that trade made easy, affordable and fast--\n     political obstacles notwithstanding--always begets more \n     trade, more jobs, more prosperity. From clipper ships to the \n     computer age, despite economic cycles, conflict and shifting \n     demographics, humans have demonstrated an innate desire to \n     travel and trade. Given this, the future is unlikely to \n     diverge from the arc of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2096-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 74TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DOOLITTLE RAID\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I would like to recognize the 74th \nanniversary of the Doolittle Raid.\n  Following Japan's deliberate attack on Naval Station Pearl Harbor on \nDecember 7, 1941, the United States was looking for a way to retaliate \nand boost morale. General Henry Arnold, the chief of the Army Air \nCorps, and U.S. Navy ADM Ernest King, the Navy Chief of Operations, \nwere tasked with organizing a raid on mainland Japan that would act as \nthe United States' return salvo. They needed an extraordinary airman \nand leader to execute the raid, and they found one in Army Air Corps \nLieutenant Colonel James ``Jimmy'' Doolittle, a well-respected pilot \nwho they believed could inspire his fellow airmen as they carried out \nthis dangerous mission.\n  Doolittle immediately began selecting crew members for the mission, \neventually recruiting 80 flyers who would later be nicknamed the \nDoolittle Raiders. The Raiders volunteered without knowing any \nspecifics of the mission, but they trusted Doolittle enough that they \nwere willing to follow him anyway.\n  The geographic isolation of the Japanese mainland posed numerous \nlogistical challenges while planning the raid. Doolittle decided to use \nB-25 bombers launched from the U.S.S. Hornet, which would be positioned \nabout 500 miles away from Japan. The B-25 bombers were an inspired \nchoice, as they were mid-range bombers that were not normally launched \nfrom the decks of aircraft carriers and had limited fuel reserves. \nDespite these risks and the unprecedented nature of the raid, the \nRaiders began their mission.\n  On April 18, 1942, the task force was spotted by the Japanese, nearly \n200 miles from the planned launch point. All 16 B-25 bombers were able \nto launch from the deck of the U.S.S. Hornet, but they lacked the time \nor fuel necessary to enter into formation, necessitating individual \nstrikes that caused only minor military and industrial damage to Japan. \nAll but one of the B-25 bombers made crash landings or had their crews \nbail out. The remaining plane made an emergency landing in Russia, and \nthe crew was interned. Eight soldiers were captured by the Japanese in \nChina, three of whom were executed. Still, the Doolittle Raid was the \nfirst successful attack on the Japanese mainland in over 700 years, and \nit shook the confidence of their military.\n  The Doolittle Raid changed the course of the war, and the courage and \nbravery of the Doolittle Raiders is inspiring, even after 74 years. \nThree of the squadrons that participated in the Doolittle Raid, the \n34th, 37th, and 432nd squadrons, are now stationed in Ellsworth Air \nForce Base near Rapid City, SD. I am proud to have squadrons with such \na historic legacy stationed in my State, and I know that the example of \nthe Doolittle Raiders will continue to inspire airmen everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2096-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PACIFIC TSUNAMI MUSEUM COMMEMORATION OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                         1946 TSUNAMI IN HAWAII\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, this year marks the 70th anniversary of \nthe 1946 tsunami disaster in Hawaii. Early on the morning of April 1, \n1946, an undersea 8.1-magnitude earthquake off the Alaskan coast \ntriggered a tragic event 5 hours and 2,400 miles away. Travelling at \nnearly 500 miles per hour, a succession of tsunami waves hit the \nHawaiian Islands around breakfast time, devastating downtown Hilo on \nHawaii Island and killing 96 people. Across the Hawaiian island chain, \n159 people lost their lives to the tsunami.\n  In response to this disaster, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration established the Tsunami Warning System in 1948. Despite \nthe system's proven effectiveness during two subsequent but minor \ntsunami events, another massive tsunami wave on May 23, 1960, took the \nlives of 61 Hilo residents. Many of the victims failed to take the \nwarnings seriously or returned to their homes before the danger had \npassed. Another contributing factor was uninformed city planning that \nallowed residents to rebuild homes and businesses in tsunami risk \nzones. Shinmachi, a district in downtown Hilo rebuilt after the 1946 \ntsunami, was destroyed again by the 1960 tsunami.\n  While sobering, these tragedies are critical teaching opportunities. \nDecades after the disasters at Hilo, Dr. Walter Dudley and Jeanne \nBranch Johnston, a tsunami researcher and a tsunami survivor, \nrespectively, envisioned a place where the public could remember and \nlearn from these tragedies. Without sustained collective memory of the \nrisk posed by tsunamis and complementary public outreach, they believed \nthe tremendous progress in tsunami research and warning systems in the \nlast half century would not prevent future disasters. After all, an \nunheeded warning is no warning at all.\n  Since opening its doors in 1994, the Pacific Tsunami Museum, PTM, in \nHilo has demonstrated its ability to catalyze public engagement with \ntsunami risk. Museum exhibits include the history of tsunamis in Hawaii \nand how past events have shaped the community and impacted long-range \nplanning. The museum places strong emphasis on the human component of \nthe tsunami story, the resiliency of a community that survived the \ndisasters and also pays tribute to the victims. PTM also features \nexhibits on major tsunami events around the globe and frequently \ncollaborates with sister institutions as far away as Sri Lanka. As part \nof its public outreach efforts, the museum has developed tsunami \ncurricula and evacuation plans for schools, created publications on \ntsunami safety, and presented workshops and lectures on the issue both \nin Hawaii and abroad.\n  April is Tsunami Awareness Month in Hawaii. On April 16, PTM will \nhost a special open house commemorating the 70th anniversary of the \n1946 tsunami. This event seeks to promote awareness of tsunami risk, \neducate the public on appropriate responses to a tsunami warning, and \nhonor the victims of Hilo's tsunami disasters.\n  The need to continually cultivate community resilience to tsunami \nevents inspired me to push for stronger Federal support for essential \ndetection, forecast, warning, research, and preparedness programs. My \ncolleagues, Senators Maria Cantwell of Washington and Dan Sullivan of \nAlaska, and I introduced the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research \nAct of 2015. If signed into law, this bill would reinforce and amplify \nthe great work being done by PTM.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the tragic loss of life \nat Hilo in 1946 and 1960 and commending the Pacific Tsunami Museum for \nits tireless work to keep the public safe from tsunamis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2096-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2096-S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CLIFF YOUNG\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to remember a former Nevada \nSupreme Court justice, Congressman, and State senator, C. Clifton \n``Cliff'' Young, a true Nevada statesman and dedicated public servant. \nI send my condolences and prayers to his wife, four children, nine \ngrandchildren, and two great-grandchildren during this difficult time. \nAlthough he will be sorely missed, his legendary influence throughout \nthe Silver State will continue on.\n  Justice Young was born in 1922 in Lovelock and earned his degree from \nthe University of Nevada, Reno in 1943. He later served in the U.S. \nArmy in Europe during World War II, earning the rank of major. As one \nof our Nation's servicemembers, he made exceptional sacrifices for our \ncountry and deserves our deepest gratitude. His service to his country, \nas well as his bravery and dedication to his family and community, earn \nhim a place in history among the many outstanding men and women who \nhave contributed to our Nation and the Silver State.\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n  Following his time in the U.S. Army, Justice Young earned his law \ndegree from Harvard Law School. In 1952, he was elected to represent \nthe State of Nevada in the U.S. Congress, where he served two terms. \nFrom 1966 to 1980, Justice Young continued his public service as a \nState Senator in the Nevada State Senate. He then served for 18 years \non the Nevada Supreme Court, where he served as chief justice twice, \nand retired in 2002. Throughout his tenure, Justice Young was inducted \ninto the Nevada Legislature's Hall of Fame and was honored with the \nFederal courthouse in Reno being named after him. With his passing, \nNevada lost a great man who is immortalized for his service to our \nNation and the Nevada community. I extend my deepest gratitude for all \nof his work on behalf of our State. His years of service will be \nremembered for generations to come.\n  For over half a century, Justice Young demonstrated only the highest \nlevel of excellence and dedication while serving in the U.S. Congress, \nNevada State Senate, and on the Nevada Supreme Court. Our State is \nfortunate to have had a public servant of such commitment and \nunwavering devotion, and I am deeply appreciative of his hard work and \ninvaluable contributions to our State. Today, I join citizens across \nthe Silver State in celebrating the life of an upstanding Nevadan, \nJustice Cliff Young.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2097-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GREG THAYER\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Shirley \nBeck and Dale Siegford have own and operated the Sweet Palace located \nin Philipsburg, MT, since 1998, contributing to many Montanans' sweet \ntooth.\n  Shirley, a wife of a rancher, mother of three, and a former special \neducation teacher, started selling Montana jewelry at the Gem Mountain \nShop in 1988. Shirley had a great aptitude for assisting the customers \nin their search for the perfect piece of sapphire jewelry.\n  Dale, a Missoula, MT, native, began digging for Montana sapphires on \nGem Mountain in 1987. Dale became an expert in the art of heat \ntreatment, enhancing the colors of the Montana sapphires, especially \npink and yellow.\n  Together at Gem Mountain, they became a great team and moved on to \nopening their own shop, the Sapphire Gallery, in 1992. The Sapphire \nGallery became a flourishing business and inspired the duo to open the \nSweet Palace right next door, the start of a great business \npartnership, prompting Shirley and Dale to open another store.\n  It is impressive that two people can go from making jewelry to making \ncandy in our great State. Philipsburg is a beautiful town near the \nSapphire Mountains, and through their businesses, they make it even \ngreater.\n  Thank you, Shirley and Dale, for helping keep Montana alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2097-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STACIE MATHEWSON\n\n Mr. HELLER.

The on-\ncampus program has implemented various recovery groups, in addition to \nproviding supportive gathering places for students who choose sobriety. \nMrs. Mathewson also spearheaded the creation of a national sobriety \nprogram for college campuses, which has been successful at 150 colleges \nand universities across the country.\n  Mrs. Mathewson's work has also more narrowly focused on helping the \nyouth in our great State. In May of 2015, the Youth Offender Drug Court \nwas established, working to provide an alternative treatment for those \nin need. With help from Transforming Youth Recovery, the Josh Montoya \nHouse was created and serves as a facility for the Washoe County Youth \nOffender Drug Court in order to provide young men who are combating \ndrug addiction with comprehensive residential and outpatient treatment \ncare.\n  Mrs. Mathewson has focused on growing early prevention within the \nlocal community as well. On February 1, 2016, Mrs. Mathewson announced \nTransforming Youth Recovery's commitment to launching an innovative \nresearch program, Doors to Recovery, for students from kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade in the Washoe County School District. The program \naims to create a comprehensive prevention and intervention program, as \nwell as recovery support services for students and families. Mrs. \nMathewson stands as a role model, demonstrating genuine concern and \nunderstanding of others who are in need. I am thankful to have her \nworking as an ally to address this national epidemic.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMrs. Mathewson for all of her hard work in bringing greater awareness \nto drug addiction and in transforming youth recovery in the State of \nNevada and across the Nation.

Madam President, today I wish to highlight the \n100-year history of the Triangle Cooperative Service Company of Enid, \nOK. This year, 2016, is their 100th year in business in Oklahoma, and I \nam pleased to highlight them on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Triangle Cooperative Service Company was founded in 1916 by 20 local \nOklahoma cooperatives to ensure rural Oklahomans could get their grain \nproducts to market at a fair price via rail. Soon, they grew their \nbusiness to support Oklahomans in other ways, including helping conduct \ngrain audits and by providing accounting services.\n  In 1929, it was decided that Triangle Cooperative Service Company \nwould continue to offer member services to the local cooperatives, \nwhile a separate entity would be the official Grain Sales Agency for \nboth Oklahoma and Texas. During the 1930s and the 1940s, a large number \nof grain facilities and cotton gins were built throughout Oklahoma. \nThese new facilities created an increased demand for insurance to \nprotect Oklahoma's farming communities from drought, natural disasters, \nand other severe weather events. In 1932, TCSC Insurance Agency was \nformed and molded the future of the Triangle\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\norganization. The Triangle Insurance Company was chartered on January \n3, 1992, officially becoming a licensed property and casualty insurance \ncompany within the State of Oklahoma.\n  In 1996, the memberships of Triangle Cooperative Service Company and \nProducers Exchange Cooperative voted to merge the two cooperatives. \nThis decision to merge marked the beginning of Triangle's expansion. \nToday, Triangle Cooperative Service Company has grown to 125 employees \nand over 300 members throughout 20 Midwestern States, continuing to \nspread its proud tradition of quality service.\n  In addition to the insurance agency and insurance company, Triangle \nCooperative Service Company offers its member cooperatives employee \ngroup benefits, HR solutions and safety, and compliance management. \nToday, the Triangle Cooperative Service Company is cooperatively owned \nand governed by a board of directors and Mr. John Berg serves as \npresident and CEO.\n  I am pleased to highlight the history and journey of the Triangle \nCooperative Service Company as part of their 100-year history \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2098-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2098-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2098-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:37 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3586.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nHigher Education Act of 1965 to provide an exclusion from income for \nstudent loan forgiveness for students who have died or become disabled; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  \n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill that I am \nintroducing today, along with Senator Coons and Senator Portman, called \nthe Stop Taxing Death and Disability Act. It is a bill that responds to \na tragic and unintended and frankly unsupportable policy--an \ninadvertent policy, I believe--of our government. Senator Coons has \nbeen a great leader on this, and I also wish to express my appreciation \nto Senator Portman for joining.\n  Not long after I was elected, I was contacted by Donald and Nora \nBrennen, a couple from Topsham, ME, which is just across the river from \nmy hometown of Brunswick. They are both retired Navy veterans, and they \nexperienced a tragedy in their lives that has inadvertently entangled \nthem with the Internal Revenue Service in a way that I think makes no \nsense.\n  \n\n  Their son Keegan had graduated cum laude from the New Hampshire \nInstitute of Art. He had taken on Federal and private loans in order to \nenable himself to get his education. He had a bright future. \nUnfortunately, barely 6 months after he graduated, he passed away \nsuddenly from a non-traumatic brain aneurysm--a tragic loss which I \nthink any of us as parents can only dimly appreciate or understand or \nempathize with. It is so unthinkable to lose a child in this way that \nit is just hard to conceive of.\n  \n\n  The Federal Government has recognized this kind of situation and \nforgives the student loan indebtedness of students who pass away in \nthis situation. The Federal Government gets that part right. Congress \nhas already directed the Department of Education to forgive outstanding \nbalances for borrowers who pass away, as well as those funds borrowed \nby parents on behalf of a child who passes away. The same forgiveness \nprovision, by the way, is also permitted for borrowers who suffer total \nand permanent disabilities that are certified by the Social Security \nAdministration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. So far, so good.\n  \n\n  While the Federal Government solved that part of the problem, it \ninadvertently created another by recognizing that the Tax Code \ngenerally treats forgiven student debt as income in the year it is \ndischarged. Because of this, this family in Maine who lost their son \nwas suddenly--overnight--faced with a $24,000 tax bill and a $6,000 tax \nbill from the State of Maine because of its conformance with the \nFederal law.\n  In other words, you lose a child. The loans are forgiven, but the \nforgiveness is treated as taxable income, and suddenly, in the midst of \nyour grief, you are faced with paying an enormous--one big tax bill on \nthe entire amount of the loan being forgiven.\n  \n\n  In this case, the Brennens couldn't possibly pay this in one \ninstance, and it makes no sense from the point of view of policy. It is \nthe opposite of compassion. It is literally adding insult to tragic \ninjury.\n  Since 2012 when they lost their son, the Brennens have struggled to \nmake ends meet. They had to go into their 401(k). They had to make some \nkind of arrangement with the IRS, and now they are in the process of \npaying this enormous tax off.\n  \n\n  This family in Maine is not alone in facing this burden. My office \nhas heard from other constituents in our State,\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nand our research indicates that there are at least several thousand \nacross the country who are facing a tax bill in the midst of the most \ntragic and difficult circumstances. This just isn't right. It is \nsomething we should fix.\n  As I said, the Department of Education does have it right, and they \nare working on this, but until this unresolved tax issue is resolved, \nthey can't move forward with an efficient way to provide these \ndischarges.\n  \n\n  The bill we are introducing today with Senator Coons and Senator \nPortman, the Stop Taxing Death and Disability Act, is a commonsense, \ncompassionate, and sensible response to this tragic event. If we are \ngoing to forgive the student loan debt, which makes total sense and has \nbeen the law for some time, to then turn around and say that loan \nforgiveness is itself taxable--so in the midst of your grief, you are \npresented with a massive tax bill--just isn't right.

Res. 425\n\n       Whereas the week of April 4, 2016, through April 10, 2016, \n     was National Public Health Week;\n       Whereas the theme for National Public Health Week in 2016 \n     was ``Healthiest Nation 2030'', with the goal of making the \n     United States the healthiest nation in one generation;\n       Whereas public health organizations use National Public \n     Health Week to educate the public, policymakers, and public \n     health professionals on issues that are important to \n     improving the health of the people of the United States;\n       Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in \n     the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and \n     the places in which we all live, learn, work, and play;\n       Whereas there is a significant difference in the health \n     status of people living in the healthiest States compared to \n     people living in the least healthy States, such as rates of \n     obesity, poor mental health, and infectious disease;\n       Whereas public health professionals help communities \n     prevent, prepare for, withstand, and recover from the impact \n     of a full range of health threats, including disease \n     outbreaks such as the Zika virus, natural disasters, and \n     disasters caused by human activity;\n       Whereas public health professionals collaborate with \n     partners that are not in the health sector, such as city \n     planners, transportation officials, education officials, and \n     private sector businesses, recognizing that other sectors \n     have an important influence on health;\n       Whereas according to the National Academy of Medicine, \n     despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the \n     United States ranks below many other economically prosperous \n     and developing countries with respect to measures of health, \n     including life expectancy, infant mortality rates, low birth \n     weight rates, and the rate of drug-related deaths, which for \n     overdose deaths involving opioids has increased by 200 \n     percent since 2000;\n       Whereas studies show that small strategic investments in \n     prevention can result in significant savings in health care \n     costs;\n       Whereas each 10-percent increase in local public health \n     spending contributes to a 6.9-percent decrease in infant \n     deaths, a 3.2-percent decrease in deaths related to \n     cardiovascular disease, a 1.4-percent decrease in deaths due \n     to diabetes, and a 1.1-percent decrease in cancer-related \n     deaths;\n       Whereas in communities across the country, more people are \n     changing the way they care for their health by avoiding \n     tobacco use, eating more healthfully, becoming more \n     physically active, and preventing unintentional injuries at \n     home and in the workplace;\n       Whereas despite having a high infant mortality rate as \n     compared to other economically prosperous and developing \n     countries and a death rate that varies greatly among States, \n     overall the United States is making steady progress, with the \n     infant mortality rate reaching a historic low in 2014, with \n     5.8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births;\n       Whereas the percentage of adults in the United States who \n     smoke cigarettes, the leading cause of preventable disease \n     and death in the United States, decreased from 20.9 percent \n     in 2005 to 16.8 percent in 2014; and\n       Whereas efforts to adequately support public health and \n     prevention can continue to transform a health system focused \n     on treating illness to a health system focused on preventing \n     disease and promoting wellness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Health \n     Week;\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, \n     the Federal Government, States, Indian tribes, \n     municipalities, local communities, and individuals in \n     preventing disease and injury;\n       (3) recognizes the role of public health in improving the \n     health of individuals in the United States;\n       (4) encourages increased efforts and resources to improve \n     the health of people in the United States to create the \n     healthiest nation in one generation through--\n       (A) greater opportunities to improve community health and \n     prevent disease and injury; and\n       (B) strengthening the public health system in the United \n     States; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to learn \n     about the role of the public health system in the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/14/senate-section/article/S2101-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2101-S2102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 426--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES SHOULD SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE RIGHT OF WOMEN WORKING IN \n    DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO SAFE WORKPLACES, FREE FROM GENDER-BASED \n                 VIOLENCE, REPRISALS, AND INTIMIDATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Brown) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 426\n\n       Whereas women in developing countries who join the \n     industrial workforce suffer from, or become increasingly \n     vulnerable to, economic violence, including forced overtime, \n     wage theft, abusive short term contracts, discrimination, \n     sexual harassment, and violence at work;\n       Whereas women typically make up the majority of the \n     workforce in industries in which the rights of workers have \n     been restricted, including--\n       (1) export manufacturing (including the global apparel \n     industry); and\n       (2) other export sectors (including the cut flowers and \n     fresh produce industries);\n       Whereas sexual violence is often used by a male manager as \n     a means of intimidation or punishment when a female worker \n     makes a mistake, fails to meet a production target, asks for \n     leave, or arrives late to work;\n       Whereas women are particularly vulnerable to violence and \n     intimidation at work due to--\n       (1) the frequently disproportionate number of male \n     managers;\n       (2) the lack of policing and reporting of sexual \n     harassment; and\n       (3) common cultural norms that assert male dominance and \n     place disproportionate pressure on women to maintain their \n     income and support their children and elders;\n       Whereas a survey of female garment industry workers in \n     Bangladesh revealed that--\n       (1) nearly \\1/3\\ of respondents had been a recipient of an \n     unwelcome sexual overture, inappropriate touching, or a \n     threat of being forced to undress; and\n       (2) nearly \\1/2\\ of respondents had been beaten or struck \n     in the face by a supervisor;\n       Whereas some of the most deadly accidents in industrial \n     history have occurred in export processing industries in \n     which female workers predominate, including--\n       (1) the fire at Ali Enterprises in Pakistan in 2012, the \n     deadliest apparel factory fire in history, in which the lives \n     of 259 workers were lost; and\n       (2) the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in 2013, in \n     which the lives of 1,134 Bangladeshi workers were lost and \n     2,500 more workers were injured, the majority of whom were \n     women;\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\n       Whereas these and other industrial accidents have occurred \n     in facilities that were monitored and certified as safe and \n     decent workplaces by private, voluntary corporate social \n     responsibility initiatives invested in by global brands from \n     the United States and Europe;\n       Whereas female workers are often knowingly exposed to \n     dangerous and life-threatening machinery or toxic substances \n     that are no longer used in developed nations due to their \n     reproductive or general health effects, without even simple \n     safety measures like gloves or face masks; and\n       Whereas research shows that--\n       (1) workers who are well-informed about health and safety \n     facilitate safer workplaces; and\n       (2) legal protections that allow elected labor union \n     representatives of workers to raise safety and other concerns \n     without fear of reprisals are essential for worker safety: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should--\n       (1) support policies that create safe and decent jobs in \n     developing countries, which are critical to ensuring peaceful \n     and sustainable economic growth and development in a \n     globalized world;\n       (2) support policies that reduce gender-based violence, and \n     other forms of discrimination, at work, and that improve the \n     ability of women workers to speak out in defense of their \n     rights without fear of reprisals;\n       (3) encourage the development of an International Labour \n     Conference Convention to address gender-based violence at \n     work;\n       (4) promote labor rights in trade agreements and enforce \n     the right of women and other workers to join a labor union to \n     defend their other rights and safety;\n       (5) use diplomatic means and international aid--\n       (A) to end violence against women in the workplace; and\n       (B) to empower women and other workers to participate fully \n     in their economies and to protect their safety; and\n       (6) encourage United States companies with international \n     supply chains, and Federal agencies involved in procurement, \n     to increase transparency and accountability in order to \n     ensure that products are produced in workplaces that--\n       (A) work aggressively to end gender-based workplace \n     violence;

which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 427\n\n       Whereas according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (referred to in this preamble as the ``FDIC''), \n     at least 27.7 percent of households in the United States, or \n     nearly 34,400,000 households with approximately 67,600,000 \n     adults, are unbanked or underbanked and therefore have not \n     had an opportunity to access savings, lending, and other \n     basic financial services;\n       Whereas according to the FDIC, approximately 30 percent of \n     banks reported in 2011 that consumers lacked an understanding \n     of the financial products and services banks offered;\n       Whereas according to the 2015 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey final report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling--\n       (1) approximately 41 percent of adults in the United States \n     gave themselves a grade of ``C'', ``D'', or ``F'' on their \n     knowledge of personal finance;\n       (2) 75 percent of adults in the United States acknowledged \n     that they could benefit from additional advice and answers to \n     everyday financial questions from a professional;\n       (3) 24 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     approximately 56,300,000 individuals, admitted to not paying \n     bills on time;\n       (4) 1 in 3 households reported carrying credit card debt \n     from month to month;\n       (5) only 39 percent of adults in the United States reported \n     keeping close track of their spending, a percentage that held \n     steady since 2007; and\n       (6) 13 percent of adults in the United States identified \n     not having enough ``rainy day'' savings for an emergency, and \n     15 percent of adults in the United States identified not \n     having enough money set aside for retirement, as the most \n     worrisome area of personal finance;\n       Whereas the 2015 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that 24 percent \n     of workers were ``not at all confident'' that they had enough \n     money to retire;\n       Whereas according to the statistical release of the Board \n     of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the fourth \n     quarter of 2015 entitled ``Financial Accounts of the United \n     States: Flow of Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated \n     Macroeconomic Accounts'', outstanding household debt in the \n     United States was $14,200,000,000,000 at the end of the \n     fourth quarter of 2015;\n       Whereas according to the 2016 Survey of the States: \n     Economic and Personal Finance Education in Our Nation's \n     Schools, a biennial report by the Council for Economic \n     Education--\n       (1) only 20 States require students to take an economics \n     course as a high school graduation requirement; and\n       (2) only 17 States require students to take a personal \n     finance course as a high school graduation requirement, \n     either independently or as part of an economics course;\n       Whereas according to the Gallup-HOPE Index, only 52 percent \n     of students in the United States have money in a bank or \n     credit union account;\n       Whereas expanding access to the safe, mainstream financial \n     system will provide individuals with less expensive and more \n     secure options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared--\n       (1) to manage money, credit, and debt; and\n       (2) to become responsible workers, heads of household, \n     investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth; and\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress--\n       (1) determined that coordinating Federal financial literacy \n     efforts and formulating a national strategy is important; and\n       (2) in light of that determination, passed the Financial \n     Literacy and Education Improvement Act (20 U.S.C. 9701 et \n     seq.), establishing the Financial Literacy and Education \n     Commission: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2016 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about--\n       (A) the importance of personal financial education in the \n     United States;
