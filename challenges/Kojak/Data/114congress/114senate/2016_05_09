Mr. President, we will return to the consideration of \nthe energy security and water infrastructure funding bill today. As we \ndo so, I wish to remind colleagues of the importance of returning to \nregular order and working through the appropriations process.\n  A return to regular order means empowering Senators from both sides \nto make more responsible judgments as to how taxpayer dollars are \nspent. It means allowing Senators to better represent the voices of \ntheir constituents throughout the legislative process. Beginning the \nprocess early means giving Senators from both sides more opportunity to \ndebate and offer ideas they think might make these bills even better.\n  This is the way the appropriations process is supposed to work, and \nwith a little cooperation, we can keep it moving forward this week.\n  The bill before us will support energy innovation and waterway \ninfrastructure. It will promote commerce and public safety. It will \nhelp maintain our nuclear deterrence posture.\n  These are priorities that should be important to all of us. So let's \ncontinue to work today and move this bill forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2605-8", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2605-S2606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tomorrow the Democratic leader and I \nwill have the honor of celebrating Senator Bennett's life at a memorial \nservice, but I also wish to say a few words about this dear friend and \ncolleague now.\n  Bob Bennett said there are two kinds of Senators in Washington--\nworkhorses and show horses. It is clear to anyone who knew him which \npath Senator Bennett followed. This former chaplain, entrepreneur, and \nCEO came to the Senate with a long resume and a formidable work effort. \nOver his 18 years of service, Bob typified the constructive player with \nthe steady hand, the kind of Senator who preferred the low-key work of \nlegislating to the bright lights of the media.\n  Bob worked hard to develop relationships in both parties, and he \napproached everything he did with creativity, with substance, and with \nhonor.\n  Senator Bennett served as a member of our conference leadership team, \nsat on important committees, and pressed forward on a range of \ndifferent issues.\n  He also shared my interest in the First Amendment. Bob would be the \nfirst to tell you that he viewed his most important job as being a \nhusband. I think his wife Joyce felt the same way. In more than 50 \nyears of marriage, the Bennetts worked together to raise six children. \nThey were blessed with 20 grandchildren as well.\n  Many of us remember the active role Joyce played in the life of the \nSenate family over the years, and so we are\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nthinking of her today. We are thinking of the entire Bennett family \ntoo.\n  The Senate honors the memory of Senator Bob Bennett. We will miss him \ngreatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2606-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso).

Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate lost one of its \nMembers, our friend and colleague Bob Bennett. He passed away at his \nhome in Arlington, VA.\n  There is a whole lot I can say about Bob Bennett. He was my friend. \nLandra and I were close to him and his lovely wife Joyce. As Senator \nMcConnell said, he was a three-term Senator. He was a scholar, author, \nand celebrated businessman. He took over this company, Franklin Quest--\nthose little books that were so popular a number of years ago. It had \nfour employees. Within 7 years, that company had 1,000 employees, and \nits income was $100 million a year. Some of you will remember the \nlittle Franklin day planner we all had because of Senator Bennett.\n  When I think of Senator Bennett, courage comes to mind. He was one of \nthe most courageous Senators with whom I served. He was a conservative \nRepublican from a conservative State, Utah. A majority of the time he \nvoted that way.\n  But Bob also firmly believed neither political party nor their \ndiffering ideologies had a monopoly on good governance, and he spoke \nabout this openly. This is what he said during his farewell speech on \nthe Senate floor:\n\n       The Democrats are the party of government. Going back to \n     their roots with Franklin Roosevelt, they come to the \n     conclusion that if there is a problem, government should \n     solve that problem. The Republicans are the party of free \n     markets, and they come to the conclusion that if there is a \n     problem, it should be left to the markets to solve it. And \n     they are both right. That is the thing I have come to \n     understand here. There are some problems where government is \n     the solution--but not always. There are some problems where \n     free markets do provide the solution--but not always.\n\n  Bob Bennett practiced what he preached. In the fall of 2008, the \nglobal markets were in a free fall. The American economy was reeling. \nSomething needed to be done.\n  President George W. Bush turned to Congress for help. Where else \ncould he turn? We, the Congress, passed the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, or TARP, which prevented the collapse of our Nation's largest \nfinancial institutions. Despite the pressure from his own party, \nSenator Bennett voted for TARP. He voted to save our country and our \neconomy. It was perhaps the most courageous vote ever cast in the \nSenate.\n  It didn't sit well with the tea party, which was very strong in Utah. \nThey used the State's Republican primary to remove Senator Bennett from \noffice. It is a very unusual procedure there. If it had been any other \nState in the Union, Bob Bennett would still be in the Senate.\n  But in spite of all of that, Bob was blessed with an unshakeable \nmoral compass. He knew what he did was right, and he had no regrets. \nTime and a resurgent American economy had vindicated Senator Bennett's \nvote on TARP and other things.\n  I count myself very fortunate to have served with this good man. I \nwill forever be grateful for him--this honorable, decent person who was \nmy friend.\n  Today my thoughts are with his family, his wife Joyce, who is an \naccomplished flutist. She is a professional flute player.\n  On codels I took with Senator Bennett--I remember one where we left \nhere and went to Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador--over the great lands that \nwe passed and over the waters that we passed, often she would come and \nentertain us with her flute. She is a marvelous woman. I want her to \nknow that Senator Bennett will be missed by the Senate, the people of \nUtah, our country, and me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2606-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MAYORAL ELECTION IN LONDON, ENGLAND\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a notable thing happened this weekend across \nthe Atlantic. The people of London, England, elected Sadiq Khan as the \nfirst Muslim mayor of their city. The mayor of the city of London is a \nMuslim, a proud Muslim. That election speaks to the openness and \ntolerance exhibited by England.\n  Let us not forget that England is a Protestant nation. According to \nthe Nation's most recent census, the people of London are predominantly \nChristian. When London voters went to the polls, they refused to allow \nMr. Khan's religion to be the deciding factor. They refused to give in \nto the bigotry and Islamic rhetoric that is plaguing American politics. \nInstead, Londoners voted for the candidate whom they thought would best \nrepresent their interests and who happened to be a Muslim.\n  The election of Sadiq Khan is an example of how a democracy should \noperate--independent of fear and prejudice. This is what he said \nyesterday:\n\n       I have spent my entire life encouraging minority \n     communities to get involved in civil society, in mainstream \n     politics. I've been fighting extremism and radicalization all \n     my life. You should conduct politics in a positive way to \n     enthuse people to get involved.\n\n  Many of us in the United States would do well to learn from Mayor \nKhan's example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2606-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2606-S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Donald Trump is the Republican Presidential \nnominee. Let's think about that--the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore \nRoosevelt, and many other Republicans, such as Ronald Reagan and Dwight \nEisenhower. The party of these great people nominated a misogynistic, \nanti-Latino, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant xenophobe. The party of \nTeddy Roosevelt nominated a billionaire con man who scams working \npeople.\n  Donald Trump represents everything that Americans detest about a \nsystem that is rigged for the super-rich. Here is a person who was born \ninto immense wealth, but he uses his father's fortune to rip people off \nand intimidate those who speak out against his shady business \npractices.\n  Here is a person who was gifted with the resources to make a \ndifference in the world. He could be doing many things to improve the \nlives of working Americans. Instead, he has only worked to build his \nown celebrity, his own brand. He uses that fame as a bully pulpit to \nsow hatred and intolerance.\n  Yet, in spite of all of this, Donald Trump is now the Republican \nParty's Presidential nominee. He is no accident. His nomination is not \nsome mistake. Donald Trump is the natural evolution of a party that \nspent 8 years honing a platform that is anti-immigrant, anti-woman, \nanti-Obama, and anti-working people.\n  It wasn't all that long ago that Republicans used to engage Democrats \non policy. There was a time when we could work together on substantive \nlegislation. I saw it. I felt it. It was wonderful.\n  But all that ended when President Obama was elected. Senator \nMcConnell ordered a total blockade of any policy proposed by President \nObama and any Democrats. Led by Senator McConnell, Republicans have \nabandoned the marketplace of ideas. They abandoned thoughtful policy \nfor fear and resentment politics.\n  It didn't matter where these ideas came from. It didn't matter if \nthey came from Republicans. Republican leaders repeated their one big \nline over and over: ``Whatever President Obama proposes, even if it's a \nRepublican idea, it cannot help you and will hurt you.''\n  These are not my ideas. They have been written about and confirmed \nfor years.\n  For Republicans, it wasn't about helping the American people anymore. \nIt was all about embarrassing and humiliating President Obama and \nfrustrating his agenda no matter the cost.\n  All the while, Donald Trump was watching as the Republican Party lost \nits identity and its moral compass. Trump watched as Republican leaders \nembraced the darkest elements of their party.\n  Now Trump is doing what he learned from Senator McConnell and every \nother Republican leader for the past 8 years. Trump watched how \nRepublicans in Congress treat American women. He saw Republicans block \nequal pay for\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nwomen and undermine women's health care. ``Planned Parenthood'' became \na swear word. Donald Trump has treated women with disdain. He has \ncalled women dogs, pigs, and he defends rape.\n\n  Trump watched as congressional Republicans walked away from \ncomprehensive immigration reform. He listened as House Republicans \nlikened DREAMers to drug mules. Is it any surprise that Donald Trump--\nnow the Republican nominee--uses Latinos and immigrants to generate \nfear, to be a fearmonger? He has called undocumented immigrants \ncriminals and rapists.\n  Donald Trump has watched Republicans deny the existence of climate \nchange, and he is following in their footsteps. He would rather believe \nin crackpot conspiracy theories than accept climate change. It is real, \nbut this is what he said about climate change: ``The concept of global \nwarming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make United \nStates manufacturing noncompetitive.'' Try that one on. That is a \ndirect quote. That kind of harebrained thinking has no place in the \nWhite House, but sadly it is not far from the anti-science climate \nchange denial that is now Republican Party doctrine.\n  On nearly every issue, Donald Trump has simply adopted the positions \nof the modern Republican Party. Through their obstruction and anti-\nObama politics, Senator McConnell and Republican leaders constructed \nDonald Trump's Presidential campaign and his platform piece by piece. \nHe is the nominee of the Republican Party, and he is the nominee the \nRepublican leaders deserve. Now the Republican Party is his.\n  Republicans want Trump to be their standard bearer. They are \nscrambling to get behind this hate-spewing nominee. There is no better \nexample of Republicans marching lockstep with Trump than the Supreme \nCourt vacancy. The Republican National Committee is trying to bring \ntheir party together by promising this dangerous man will appoint \nJustices to the Supreme Court. Republicans say they want their \nmisogynistic, anti-women, anti-Latino, anti-middle class billionaire to \ndetermine the balance of the Supreme Court for the next generation. \nRepublican Senators say they trust the judgment of a man who mocks our \nveterans, belittles John McCain as not being a war hero, and mocks \nAmericans with disabilities. They want him to fill the Supreme Court. \nIt is a sad day for this country when the Republican Party trusts the \njudgment of a vile, swindling billionaire. But anyone who has been \npaying attention to what Republicans have been doing the past 8 years \nshould not be shocked.\n  Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic nominee. I support \nHillary Clinton. I am not hiding from that. Republican Senators need to \nstop waffling about Donald Trump. Not going to the convention doesn't \ntake away the fact that he is the Republican nominee. I have heard a \nnumber of Republican Senators say: I am not going to the convention. \nWell, that solves the problem, doesn't it? Republican Senators need to \nsay whether they are going to vote for this guy. The Republican Party's \nchickens have come home to roost in the form of Donald J. Trump.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer to announce--I see Senator \nAlexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, on the floor--the \nbusiness of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2607-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the memory of a \nhumble statesman and an adored colleague and a dear friend, Senator Bob \nBennett. Bob passed away peacefully in his house last week with his \nwife and children gathered around him by his bedside. In the wake of \nhis passing, the Bennett family has witnessed an outpouring of love as \nthousands of individuals from across the country have reached out to \npay their respects to a man who served selflessly to the very end of \nhis service here. To the many expressions of love and admiration that \nhave already been offered in Bob's honor, I wish to add a few words of \nmy own.\n  I had the distinct privilege of serving alongside Bob Bennett for \nnearly two decades as we jointly represented our beloved State of Utah \nhere in the United States Senate. During the many years of our service \ntogether, Bob became more than a respected partner; he was a trusted \nconfidante and a cherished friend.\n  In this Chamber, Senator Bennett was widely revered as a wise and \nthoughtful leader committed to finding innovative solutions to the most \ndifficult challenges of the day. But above all else, he was a \npassionate fighter for the people of Utah, who were always foremost in \nhis mind. I have never met someone so committed to his constituency as \nSenator Bennett was to the people of Utah.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that every Utahn has benefited from \nBob's public service. You cannot ride the train, take public \ntransportation, or drive on the freeway in our State without seeing the \nfruits of Bob's labor in the Senate. As Utah faced unprecedented \nexpansion and economic growth, Senator Bennett worked tirelessly to \nensure that our State's infrastructure kept pace with the demands of a \nbooming population. Were it not for Bob and the indispensable role he \nplayed in securing much needed funding for these transportation \nprojects in Utah, our State would not be the prime destination for \nbusiness, entrepreneurship, and innovation that it is today.\n  I need not rehearse all of Senator Bennett's accomplishments in the \nSenate because his public legacy speaks for itself. The TRAX and \nFrontRunner public transportation systems in Utah are perhaps the most \ntangible symbols of that legacy, but there are plenty more. I join all \nUtahns in thanking Senator Bennett for his many years of loyal service \nto the Beehive State. We love him, and we will miss him dearly.\n  In addition to fighting tirelessly for the people of Utah, Senator \nBennett exercised remarkable prudence as an appropriator and provided \nprincipal leadership on the Banking Committee and as chairman of the \nJoint Economic Committee. He was a talented lawmaker, skilled at \nforging consensus and reaching compromise without sacrificing his core \nconservative values.\n  Over the 18 years that Senator Bennett served in this Chamber, he \nconsistently demonstrated sound judgment and strong leadership. In a \nshort time, he gained the trust of his Republican colleagues, who \nconsidered him a trusted resource on matters of strategy and policy. \nAfter seeing Bob's rapport with other legislators, then-Senate majority \nleader Bill Frist asked him to serve on the leadership team. Senator \nBennett also served in leadership positions alongside Majority Leader \nMcConnell, with whom he shared a deep and meaningful friendship.\n  While Senator Bennett was well known for his quiet, contemplative \ndemeanor, he was also regarded as an orator--a good one. He came \nfrequently to the floor to engage his colleagues on the most complex \nissues of the day. He was exceptionally articulate, speaking with an \neloquence and ease that reflected the brilliance of a well-cultivated \nmind. Whether he was giving a public address or holding a private \nconversation, Bob could explain even the most complicated policies in \nsimple, understandable terms. He was a preeminent communicator whose \ntalents will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. President, up to this point, I have spoken at length about how \nSenator Bennett will be remembered as a public figure, but I also wish \nto speak about how I will remember him as a personal friend.\n  Bob Bennett was one of the most humble men I have ever met. In a \nChamber teaming with outsized egos and rampant self-importance, Bob \nstood apart. He always eschewed the spotlight and never esteemed \nhimself above anyone else. On some days, you could even find him riding \nthe Metro in to work. When a staffer asked him why\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\nwe opted for public transportation instead of a personal driver, Bob \nsimply said: ``Because the Metro is more convenient.'' This anecdote is \nindicative of Bob's character. He resisted the trappings of public \noffice and truly saw himself as a servant of the people.\n  Perhaps more importantly, he never let the office of Senator define \nhim. Maybe that is because he came to Congress with such a rich and \nvaried background. Prior to his work here, Bob had already served as a \nMormon military chaplain, a congressional liaison with the Nixon \nadministration, a public relations director for billionaire Howard \nHughes, and as the chief executive officer of FranklinCovey. For Bob, \nbeing a Senator was never something that was central to his personal \nidentity; it was merely a job title that allowed him to serve others in \na greater capacity.\n  Allow me to share a simple story that illustrates Bob's humility and \nwillingness to serve. Many years ago, Bob befriended a blind couple in \nhis local Mormon congregation. Every single Sunday, Bob would pay the \ncouple a personal visit, drive them to church, and stay by their side \nfor the duration of meetings--always ready and always eager to help. \nFor Bob, faithfully serving this elderly couple was just as important \nas fulfilling his duties in the Senate. That, Mr. President, is \nheartfelt humility and love unfeigned.\n  I often wondered what it was that enabled Bob to serve so selflessly. \nI believe the answer is simple: It was his faith in and love for Jesus \nChrist, whom he looked to as a model of servant leadership. Bob \nbelieved in the Christian teaching that when you are in the service of \nyour fellow men and women, you are only in the service of your God. \nThis belief animated his service until the very end.\n  For as long as Bob was physically able, he was an active volunteer in \nhis church congregation. In fact, just 3 weeks ago he hosted a \ndoctrinal discussion with dozens of Latter-day Saints seeking to build \ntheir faith. In this meeting, Bob bore testimony of Jesus Christ and \nhis perfect example of love and sacrifice. The next day, Bob suffered a \nstroke and was admitted to the hospital for the last time.\n  Both in public office and in private life, Bob Bennett was a model of \nselfless service. We were blessed by his work in the Senate and will \ncontinue to benefit from his example of humble leadership. I pray that \nwe might always remember Bob's humility and kindness and seek to \nemulate these qualities ourselves as we work together to overcome the \nchallenges facing our country.\n  Mr. President, having said all of that, Bob was very fortunate to \nhave Joyce as his companion. She is a terrific human being, very \ntalented--a flute instructor, a tremendous flutist. He has wonderful \nchildren, each one of whom has made contributions in our society that \nare exemplary. His friends will always remember Bob as somebody who \nreally accomplished a lot in his life as well as the lives of many \nthousands of people around him.\n  I personally am deeply grateful for the kindness he showed to me, the \nfriendship we had together, and the privilege I had of serving with \nhim. I will miss Bob very much, and I think all of us who knew him well \nwill miss him. He was truly a great example.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about \nSenator Bennett; and then I will yield the floor to Senator Nelson, who \nhas another schedule; and then, for the information of Senators and \nstaff, I will make some comments on how we are going to proceed on the \nEnergy and Water bill, which I hope we can wrap up pretty quickly, but \nI will wait until Senator Nelson finishes.\n  Mr. President, I am glad I had a chance to hear the majority leader, \nSenator McConnell, as well as Senator Reid and Senator Hatch, all of \nwhom were great friends of Bob Bennett, as was I.\n  Bob Bennett came to Washington with his father Wallace Bennett, who \nwas a U.S. Senator. He was in the Senate when I first came here as a \nSenate aide. I first met Bob nearly 50 years ago, when we, in effect, \nboth worked for Bryce Harlow, who was President Nixon's Chief of \nCongressional Relations. Mr. Harlow, who is revered in Washington \nstill, would have Saturday morning meetings with all of those of us who \nhad the job of being congressional liaisons with Members of Congress. \nBob Bennett was in the Transportation Department, and I was Mr. \nHarlow's assistant and telephone answerer in the White House at the \ntime. We got to know each other then. We have known each other ever \nsince. He and his wife Joyce visited with us in our home in Tennessee \nand we traveled with them and worked together on a variety of issues. \nThey became very special friends.\n  He was chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, to which \nSenator Hatch referred, which had so much to do with his home State of \nUtah. He handled that with great diligence and great effectiveness for \na number of years. That is the bill we are working on today in the \nSenate.\n  I will be at his service tomorrow, as will other Senators. I simply \nwanted to add my voice to those of the majority leader, the Democratic \nleader, and his colleague Senator Hatch in saying we all greatly \nadmired Bob. He served our Nation brilliantly and well and eloquently.\n  I heard his farewell address. It was one of the best I have ever \nheard. I remember one of the things he said: The great value as a \nSenator is that you not only have a say, you have a vote.\n  Bob Bennett had a lot to say, he cast a lot of votes, and a lot of us \nlistened very carefully to what he had to say and greatly respected his \nvotes. We have lost a great friend, and Utah and our country lost a \ngreat public servant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will talk about the Zika virus, but I \nwant to first add a comment about Senator Bob Bennett.\n  A gentleman's gentleman, a legislator's legislator, a Senator who \nwould reach across the aisle in order to get the workable consensus in \norder to get something done.\n  Doesn't that sound like the type of person we need in the Congress \ntoday in order to confront the issues we are facing? I was saddened to \nhear the news he had passed on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2608-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2608-S2609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to give an update. The Zika virus \nis raging. It is certainly raging in Puerto Rico. It is expanding \ngreatly in this country, and the State with the most infected cases is \nmy State of Florida.\n  I have been on this floor many times asking for the President's \nrequest of $1.9 billion to attack the Zika virus. About $800 million of \nthat is, No. 1, to replace the Ebola emergency fund, which they have \nraided since the Congress has not given them the funding in order to \ntry to get at the problem to begin with, which is somewhere around $500 \nmillion to $550 million. They need another $225 million to increase \nMedicaid in Puerto Rico, where it is now estimated that by the end of \nthe year, 25 percent of the population of Puerto Rico--25 percent--will \nbe infected because that is where this mosquito--called the aegypti \nmosquito--that transmits the virus is raging, but beware, especially as \nwe are going into the warm summer months, this aegypti mosquito is all \nover the Southern United States. Anyplace that is hot, humid, and where \nthere is rain--because rainwater will not all dissipate. It may be in a \nbottle cap. It may be in a dishpan. It may be in a birdbath. Where \nthere is stagnant water, that mosquito will lay its larva, and that is \nthe breeding ground to hatch the aegypti.\n  About 1\\1/2\\ weeks ago, when we were here before the recess, there \nwere approximately 1,000 cases reported in the United States, which \nincluded 570 in Puerto Rico and 94 in Florida. Now, just a little over \na week later, it is already up to 1,133 cases across the country--up to \n629 in Puerto Rico and 107 in my State. Just today, two more cases were \nreported by the Department of Health in the State of Florida.\n  The bottom line is, the virus is spreading, and it is spreading \nquickly. Not only is it spreading, but the CDC confirmed the first \nZika-related death of a 70-year-old man who died of complications in \nPuerto Rico.\n  Over the break, I met with a group of Puerto Rican leaders in \nFlorida. Basically, Puerto Rico does not have the\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nresources it needs to provide protection from the virus.\n  I was just talking to Senator Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, about getting the financial crisis addressed in Puerto Rico. \nWe can see how that is spilling over into not being able to attack the \nZika crisis where it is raging out of control because of the \ntransmission in Puerto Rico by these mosquitos. Out of the 3.5 million \npopulation of Puerto Ricans on the island, it is estimated by the CDC \nthat 800,000 of them could be infected by the end of this year.\n  So that U.S. territory--remember, they are American citizens. These \nare fellow Americans who are in trouble--is struggling under the weight \nof crippling debt in the financial crisis, and we haven't helped them \nyet. They have a Medicaid Program that is capped and it is running out \nof cash. The physician shortage is getting worse. What is happening is \nthat because of the financial problems, the professionals--the doctors \nand lawyers and nurses, especially those in health care--because they \ncannot get compensated, they are leaving the island and going to the \nmainland. As a matter of fact, it is estimated that something between \n85,000 and 100,000 may be leaving the island this year, coming to the \nmainland United States. The benefit is that a lot of those \nprofessionals are coming to Florida, but look at the gaping hole in \nhealth care that is leaving for the island.\n  It seems to me that as Senators, it is our duty to protect our fellow \nAmericans and curb the spread of this virus now. So I have introduced \nwhat the administration requested. I have had Senators say we have not \ngiven a plan for the $1.9 billion. I have given the plan over and over \nuntil this Senator is blue in the face. There is a specific breakout \nthat I have entered into the Record several times, the last of which \nwas when we were last in session 1\\1/2\\ weeks ago. The bill has 35 \ncosponsors, but unfortunately there is not one Republican Senator who \nis a cosponsor. It doesn't make sense. The spread of the Zika virus is \nnot a partisan issue, and yet it seems to have been characterized that \nway.\n  I urge our colleagues to come together on this for the good of the \nAmerican people. For their health and safety, let's approve this $1.9 \nbillion emergency request. This is the same kind of emergency funding \nrequest that would be in the aftermath of an earthquake, a hurricane, \nor some other natural disaster. It has now affected the American \npeople. It is an awful virus, and we need to get at it and stop it \nbefore it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2609-S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, for the information of Senators and \nstaff members, I would like to make a few comments about the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill that we will be moving to at 4 this \nafternoon. Senator Feinstein is in an intelligence briefing and will be \nhere about 4 as we will. We will have more to say at that time, but \nhere is my view of where we are: At 5:30 today, the Senate, for the \nthird time, will vote on whether it is time to cut off debate and \nfinish the bill. The first two votes failed, and they failed for one \nreason. They failed because of differences of opinion about the \namendment by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Cotton, which said that in \nthe year 2017, the United States could not use tax dollars to buy heavy \nwater from Iran as we are doing in 2016. So we will vote for the third \ntime today on whether to cut off debate and finish the bill.\n  Here is what I would suggest our goal should be. This is just my \nopinion, but I have talked with the majority leader, the Democratic, \nand I have talked with Senator Feinstein and a number of other \nSenators. No. 1, we should dispose of the Cotton amendment the way we \nnormally dispose of issues about which we disagree. We should vote on \nthem. That is what we do in the Senate--we vote. If you are in the \nGrand Ole Opry, you sing.\n  So we have a difference of opinion about the Cotton amendment. Let's \nvote on it. It is relevant to the bill. It is properly filed. It is \ngermane. Senator Cotton has been very flexible. He has offered to \ndecide it in many different ways. He has offered to modify his \namendment. He has offered to allow it to be considered separately. He \nhas offered for us to vote at a 60-vote level, and then he would \nwithdraw it if he should lose. He has offered to vote it at 60 votes on \ncloture on his amendment.\n  So he has offered us an opportunity to vote on his amendment in many \ndifferent ways. He just wants a vote. In my view, a Senator who has a \nrelevant and germane amendment is entitled to a vote, and I am \nsupporting his right to a vote. Then, once we vote on the amendment and \ndispose of it, we should finish the bill.\n  So I am optimistic. I see no reason why today or tomorrow--certainly \nno later than Wednesday--we cannot vote on and dispose of the Cotton \namendment and vote on and finish the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill.\n  So I say to Senators and staff members, if I were planning my week, I \nwould plan on there being a vote on the Cotton amendment. Now, they may \nask how I know that. Well, I know this: that any majority leader has \nthe right to file cloture on an amendment like the Cotton amendment, \nand by Wednesday we will vote on it at 60 votes. My own view is, since \nwe are basically finished with the bill, except for the Cotton \namendment, why would we not agree to wrap up things and do it tomorrow \nor even today? We could finish the bill today, with a vote on the \nCotton amendment at 60 votes, with a vote on cloture, and a vote on \nfinal passage.\n  As much as I defend the right of the Senator from Arkansas to have a \nvote, I am going to oppose his amendment on the merits, which I will \ndescribe in just a minute, but it is time to bring this bill to a \nconclusion. I think most Senators agree with that, and that is what we \nneed to do.\n  Let me discuss for a moment, remind Senators and those listening, why \nthis bill is so important. As the majority leader says, it covers a lot \nof essential services in this country. For example, every time there is \na flood in the Midwest, 15 or 20 Senators show up wanting more money \nfor flood control. Our inland waterways are in need of reconstruction. \nThe harbors on the west coast and in Charleston, Mobile, and many other \nplaces need deepening. We need to stay No. 1 in supercomputing in the \nworld. About half of this legislation has to do with our nuclear \nweapons program--modernizing it and keeping us safe. All 17 of our \nNational Laboratories are in the Office of Science under this \nlegislation. Despite staying within strict budget limits, we have \nagreed to the highest level of appropriations for our Office of \nScience, out of which comes so much of our economic growth, of any \nappropriations bill in history.\n  In addition to that, we have gone through a very careful process. \nAbout 80 different Members of the Senate have come to Senator Feinstein \nand me with policy changes that they would like to see in the bill that \nare in the bill. Eighty means about half Republicans and half \nDemocrats. I know that it is important to them because I have already \nheard reports of many Senators being home last weekend taking credit \nfor all of these provisions they have gotten in the bill, which we \nhaven't passed yet.\n  I don't blame them for that. There are a lot of provisions in this \nbill that are important to the country and important to my State of \nTennessee. I am reminding Senators that this is an important bill in \nwhich they have had a lot of say. In addition, on the floor, we have \nalready processed 17 different amendments--about as many Democratic \namendments as Republican amendments. We did all of that in a matter of \n3 or 4 days before we reached an impasse on the Cotton amendment.\n  We are basically done with step one of our most basic constitutional \nwork, which is oversight and appropriations of about $1 trillion in \nspending. This is the first of 12 bills. This Energy and Water \nappropriations bill has not gone across the floor in regular order \nsince 2009. It is time we do that. We are very close to doing that.\n  Let me say a word about the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas. \nAs I said, I have, for the last week, defended his right to have a \nvote, and he will have a vote. Make no mistake about it, he will have a \nvote, but I intend to oppose it on the merits for\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\nthree reasons. The first is this, and let me say this very carefully: \nIf the United States is not allowed to buy heavy water from Iran next \nyear as it is this year, it creates the possibility that Iran will be \nable to sell that heavy water to other countries, including North \nKorea, which might use it to make nuclear weapons. Let me say that \nagain. If we are not allowed to buy it by this amendment, someone else \nwill buy it. Heavy water is a distilled form of water. By itself, it is \nnot hazardous. It is not radioactive. It can be used for many peaceful \npurposes. The United States uses about 70 tons of it every year. For \nexample, this year the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is buying 32 tons \nfrom Iran--6 tons of which we will be used for its big neutron \nmicroscope. The rest will be sold over time to universities, to \nhospitals, to manufacturers for medical research, for fiber optics--all \nfor peaceful purposes.\n  This heavy water--this distilled form of water--can also be used to \nmake plutonium to make nuclear weapons, which is why we do not want \nIran to have it. We want it out of Iran. We want it somewhere else. If \nwe don't want them to have it, and if we need it and we in the United \nStates don't produce it and we don't buy it, what does Iran do with its \nheavy water? It sells it to somebody else, perhaps. We don't know who, \nbut it could be any one of a number of countries, including North \nKorea. In a big meeting over there now--the biggest they have had in \nthree decades--they are talking about nuclear weapons.\n  Respectfully, in my view, this is bad policy. I oppose it. I support \nthe Senator's right to have a vote, and he will have a vote, but when \nwe have that vote, I will vote no.\n  The second reason I oppose the amendment is it doesn't belong on the \nappropriations bill. The Senator has a right to have it on there, but I \nhear a lot of lectures of us appropriators in our Republican lunches \nfrom distinguished members of our so-called authorizing committees--\ncommittees such as Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence--\nsaying: You Senators on the Appropriations Committee are making a lot \nof decisions you shouldn't be making. We should be making the policy \ndecisions.\n  What is more of a policy decision than what to do with Iran's heavy \nwater? This isn't a debate about whether you support the Iran nuclear \nagreement. I voted against that. I am opposed to that. This is a \nquestion about what do you do about the 200 tons of heavy water that \ncan be used either for peaceful purposes or to make nuclear weapons \nover the next few years.\n  I would think there would be no issue that would be more suitable for \ndiscussion by the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services \nCommittee or the Intelligence Committee, nor can I think of many issues \nless suitable just to pop up as an amendment on an appropriations bill. \nIf we can't decide issues like this that are filled with national \nsecurity implications, why do we have a Foreign Relations Committee? \nWhy do we have an Armed Services Committee? Why do we have an \nIntelligence Committee?\n  It is not just the possibility that it might go to Iran, the issue \ncuts the other way as well. Senator Cotton or someone else who favors \nthe amendment might say: Well, if we buy more heavy water from Iran, \nperhaps that creates a market for Iran. Maybe that incentivizes them to \nmake more heavy water and keeps them in production for a long period of \ntime. Then, later on, they misuse it. Maybe that is possible.\n  Then there is the question of what effect a decision by the United \nStates to not allow our tax dollars to buy heavy water for our peaceful \npurposes have on other countries that produce heavy waters, such as \nIndia, such as Argentina or Canada, which doesn't now produce it but \nuses it. What are the implications? At this time, when there has never \nbeen a more dangerous recent time in the world, what are the national \nsecurity implications of what to do about Iran's disposal of heavy \nwater--water we don't want it to have, water we don't produce but which \nwe need, and water we do not want to get into the hands of other \ncountries, such as perhaps North Korea, which could use it to make \nnuclear weapons. I cannot think of a more appropriate issue to be \nconsidered by the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  There is a third reason we should take into account when voting on \nthis. The President says he will veto it. I will say more about \nPresidential vetoes in a minute. I don't think we should pull the cord \nand stop the train just because the President says he will veto \nsomething. The White House has said they will veto something 85 times \nin the last year and a half. If we stopped our work every time they did \nthat, we would only be meeting on Monday afternoons or Tuesday \nmornings. But we ought to take into account the fact that the President \nmight veto it, and placing this amendment on this bill would be a \nsincere but in my opinion a futile gesture because we would end up with \nno amendment after the Presidential veto. We might end up with no \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill for yet another year.\n  I have some differences with some of my friends on the other side. \nSome of them think that whenever the President says veto, we should \nstop. I don't agree with that. I think we should go ahead. If he wants \nto veto, he vetoes, but I think we should take that into account. Some \nof them say that whenever a controversial amendment comes up, we should \nnot move forward with the bill.\n  Here is what we agreed to this year. After last year, I agreed, \nanyway, to make sure we did not in the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee--and I see the Senator from California is here, which we \nworked on together. We kept controversial amendments off the bill in \nour subcommittee. There were a number that tried to come on. We said, \nif they are controversial, bring them to the floor. Last year on that \nbill went the waters of the United States amendment, and it killed the \nbill. The Democrats wouldn't move forward with it. I thought they \nshould have, but they did not. It was not on the bill this year. \nSenator Hoeven held it until we got to the floor. He offered the \namendment at 60 votes and it didn't pass.\n  We honored our word. We kept the controversial amendments off the \nbill in committee, but amendments that are relevant and germane when \nthey come to the floor are entitled to be heard. We should dispose of \nthe Cotton amendment the way we dispose of our other differences. We \nshould just vote on it.\n  Especially since the Senator from California is here, let me talk \nabout another aspect of our work on the bill that is important in the \nSenate; that is, the word ``restraint.'' For example, Senator Feinstein \nis very concerned about the cruise missile. She could have offered an \namendment in the subcommittee or she could have today that would have \nmade a major change in our policy toward the cruise missile, but she \nchose not to do that. She chose instead to have a hearing. We will do \nthat, and then we will take the next step, whatever that turns out to \nbe. She knows, if she had moved ahead with that, that would have been a \nvery provocative thing to do, made it harder to pass the bill. She \nchose not to do it.\n  The Senators from South Carolina, Mr. Graham and Mr. Scott, are very \nconcerned about the plutonium MOX facility in South Carolina. The \nadministration has recommended that we close it and move to a different \nway of disposing of that plutonium. Senator Feinstein and I agree with \nthat.\n  We could have tried to make that policy decision in this bill or the \nSouth Carolina Senators could have tried that, too, but we thought it \nwas a policy decision that should first be considered by the \nauthorizing committee--in this case, the Armed Services Committee. We \nmet with the representatives of Senator McCain and Senator Reed, and \nthey have agreed to have a hearing. This is how we are dealing with \nthat.\n  Senator Shelby, from Alabama, is highly stirred up about what we call \nthe Georgia-Florida-Alabama water wars. He would like to have his \namendment to resolve that problem on this bill, but he has stepped back \nfrom that on this bill and allowed us to move ahead with it.\n  None of those Senators had to do that, but they did that knowing that \nit is the basic constitutional duty of this body to do its \nappropriations work, and they made it possible. I would have preferred \nSenator Cotton not offer this amendment on this bill, but he did.\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nSince it is relevant and since it is germane and since we did not deal \nwith it in committee, I think the right way to approach it is to say: \nLet's dispose of it the way we dispose of other differences of opinion. \nLet's vote on it and let's move on.\n  If I may say through the Chair, before Senator Feinstein came, I \nsaid, in my view, I wanted the Senators and staff to know we would be \nvoting today for the third time on whether to cut off debate, and my \nhope was that we could dispose of the Cotton amendment at 60 votes and \nwe could then finish the bill.\n  I also said that while I defended Senator Cotton's right to offer the \namendment and that he will get a vote--because the majority leader has \nthe parliamentary tools to file cloture and make sure there is a vote \non the Cotton amendment by Wednesday--I intend to vote against the \nCotton amendment because I think it risks the possibility that Iran's \nheavy water might be sold to a country, such as North Korea, that could \nuse it to make nuclear weapons. I think first it should be considered \nby the Foreign Relations Committee or the Armed Services Committee or \nthe Intelligence Committee. For those reasons, I intend to vote against \nit.\n  I am hopeful that when we get to 5:30, maybe conversations would \ncontinue, and the possibility could even exist that we could agree \ntoday to vote on the Cotton amendment at 60 votes, dispose of it, vote \non cloture to move ahead with the bill, and have final passage of the \nbill. If we can't do that, I see no reason we can't do it over the next \ncouple of days.\n  I thank the Senator from California for the way she has worked with \nme on this issue. We have gotten almost to the finish line. She and I \nwould like to set a good example for the other 11 appropriations bills \nthat are coming up. There are other bills beyond that which we need to \ndeal with, such as the 21st-century cures legislation on biomedical \nresearch, and there is the Zika legislation that many Senators are \ninterested in. My hope is that we will find a way to resolve the only \nmajor issue that remains so we can pass a bill that virtually every \nSenator in this body has some interest in and will probably vote for.\n\n  I am optimistic and hopeful that we can move quickly on disposing of \nthe Cotton amendment so we can finish the bill. Ideally we would do it \ntoday, but we can certainly get it done by tomorrow or Wednesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2611-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nduring quorum calls until 5:30 p.m. today be charged equally between \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to address the distinguished \nchairman of this subcommittee. Working with Senator Alexander on this \nbill has been a very good experience for me, and I think my friend \nknows that. We take great pride in getting things done.\n  I very much appreciate his mentioning the standoff on the nuclear \ncruise missile legislation in some form of analogy, but I will say \nthis: I have been in this body a long time, as has the Senator from \nTennessee, and we both know that not everybody gets their vote. It just \ndoesn't work that way. I can remember having an amendment on a bill \nyear after year after year, and I never got a vote for it. That is not \nan unusual thing to happen. What has been unusual is to have one person \ntake down a bill--particularly an appropriations bill.\n  We were hoping we could demonstrate that we worked out our \ndifficulties with this legislation. The Senator from Tennessee gave on \nsome points, and I gave on some points. As my friend was good enough to \nmention, one of the points I gave on is something that I consider to be \na very big issue which has not yet been settled, and that is a standoff \nnuclear cruise missile--and it has not yet been satisfactorily \ndemonstrated to me that it is necessary--and that we do not have a \nsatisfactory conventional weapon that can go through air defense \nsystems. I believe we do. In any event, there is a strong constituency \nthat feels as I do. Senator Alexander has been good enough to give me a \nhearing and some report language which contains some questions which \nthe Defense Department will hopefully answer forthwith. I appreciate \nthat, and that was enough for me. The standoff nuclear cruise missile \nis something we need to look more deeply into.\n  The amendment that our side is so strongly opposed to, accompanied by \nthe White House, is where one Senator is essentially hitting at the \nIran nuclear agreement. The Iran nuclear agreement is not something \nthat all of us don't know a lot about. A great deal of time was spent \non it. There was a great deal of discussion both in subcommittees and \non the floor, and there was a vote on it. So to a great extent, in my \nmind, it is very much a settled issue. The President has the right to \ngo ahead with it, and I think that is very important. More importantly, \nIran has kept the agreement and Iran has lived up to the terms of this \nnuclear-related agreement. If one thinks Iran doesn't know what is \ngoing on, one is wrong. Some of us went to meet with the Iranian \nForeign Minister, and there was a question as to what is happening now, \nand of course there was concern.\n  Having said that, the chairman gave me a hearing and some report \nlanguage. I certainly would have no objection to giving the Senator \nfrom Arkansas a hearing, and yet I would not stand here and say that we \nshould not protect the sanctity of that agreement, because I believe we \nshould.\n  I think the administration has done the right thing with the sale of \nthis heavy water because we know if that heavy water is used in the \nUnited States of America, it will be used for peaceful purposes. A lot \nof it will go to a distinguished lab in the State of the Senator from \nTennessee as well as other places. It can be sold to licensed \nbusinesses that do medical research and other kinds of manufacturing, \nsuch as carbon fiber, et cetera, where the nuclear component of heavy \nwater is helpful. We know that if it goes on the open market, North \nKorea--if they were to be a buyer--would not use it for peaceful \npurposes; they would use it to help enrich plutonium for a bomb. So it \nmakes imminent sense to me.\n  The reason I oppose what is happening so strongly is because it is a \nstrike at the Iran nuclear agreement, and it is seen that way by the \nadministration. The administration has said they will veto the bill if \nthis is in it. I don't want to lose the bill because of this--because \nof one Senator who wants to strike out with that agreement. I think \nthat is the wrong thing to do.\n  The Senator from Tennessee has been good enough to discuss this with \nme, and I really do appreciate that. We have discussed it in our \ncaucus. There are very strong feelings about not moving to cloture \nuntil this issue is settled. I would certainly be happy to help settle \nit. From the conversation Senator Alexander and I had yesterday, it is \nmy understanding that he is willing to oppose it. I trust that is still \nthe case.\n  I wish to ask a question to the chairman of our subcommittee through \nthe Chair.\n  Is it correct that the Senator from Tennessee would stand in \nopposition to this amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the answer to that question is yes, \nand\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nI wish to continue my answer to the question. While I defend Senator \nCotton's right to have a vote, I see it a little differently than \nSenator Feinstein. Senator Feinstein supports the Iran agreement; I \noppose it. In my opinion, this is not a vote about the Iran agreement; \nthis is a question about what we should do with Iran's heavy water.\n  I will oppose the Cotton amendment, No. 1, because if it were \nadopted, it would create the possibility that Iran's heavy water might \nbe purchased not by the United States for peaceful purposes but will be \npurchased by countries like North Korea that might use it to make \nnuclear weapons; and No. 2, I think it would be more appropriate to \nhave the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, or \nthe Intelligence Committee consider it. For those reasons, I intend to \nvote against the Cotton amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \nSenator. I think that is a very wise response, and I think it is a \ncorrect response. I think it does belong in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  We have worked so hard to get a bill that could set a standard for \nthis body so we could go back to regular order and begin to get \nappropriations bills passed in this house. Candidly, I don't want to \nlose that opportunity, and I think we still have it. Hope still reigns \neternal, in my view, and I hope Senator Cotton will see that this is \nnot worth taking down this bill, because I believe that would happen. I \nbelieve there are enough votes to deny cloture, and that is too bad. I \ndon't want to see it because that means it is going to happen with \nother bills. It means that we are going to have what some term as \npoison pill amendments. The administration views this as a poison pill \namendment. We know at Interior there are poison pill amendments. Both \nSenator Alexander and I have chaired that committee, and we know what \nhappens. We are trying to set an example on this floor by working \nthings out.\n  It would seem to me that a reasonable Senator might say: All right. I \nam not going to hold up this bill. I made my point. I realize what is \nhappening. I know this heavy water is going to be put to good use in \nthis country. I know that Iran has to limit its supply at 130 metric \ntons, so we know this heavy water is out of Iran. As a matter of fact, \nit is in a storehouse in Oman. It is on the market, and the United \nStates has said we would buy it. That is the right thing to do to set \nan example so that nuclear proliferation does not take place, and this \nis part of that. It is my hope that we will be able to resolve that.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is imminently reasonable, and I like to \nbelieve that I am reasonable, I say to my colleague. I am hopeful that \nmaybe before the hour of 5 p.m., we might be able to come to some \nagreement; otherwise, I think the cloture motion will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California. \nShe and I will talk some more. I think we have stated the similarity in \nour positions, which is our opposition to the Cotton amendment, and the \ndifference in our positions. She sees it as intricately related to the \nIran nuclear agreement, which she passionately supports, and I see it \nas a separate issue because I oppose the Iran agreement. I don't think \nwe will work that out in public here over the next hour and a half, so \nI suggest we continue our conversations between us, the majority, and \nthe Democratic leader, and see where we get by 5:30 p.m. My hope is \nthat we can dispose of the Cotton amendment, finish the bill, and get \non with the other important business of the Senate sooner rather than \nlater.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                        Remembering Bob Bennett\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to make some remarks about our \nwonderful colleague who passed away last week, Senator Bob Bennett. Two \nof Senator Bennett's favorite Senators are here on the floor this \nafternoon--Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander. What Senator \nBennett liked so much about Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein is \nwhat we have seen this afternoon. The two of them have a difference of \nopinion with respect, I gather, to the Iran deal. I happen to share \nSenator Feinstein's view, but the two of them are trying to find common \nground here in the Senate. That is the Senate at its best, and that is \nexactly what Bob Bennett liked so much about both my colleague from \nCalifornia and my colleague from Tennessee. So I think it is very \nfitting that I open my remarks about Senator Bennett after having \nlistened once again to the Chair and ranking member talk about how the \nSenate is supposed to do business.\n  There are so many wonderful things to say about Bob Bennett, but I \nthought I would begin by talking about Senator Bennett's favorite \nsubject because of something he created. He saw it is a great \nopportunity for the Senate, and he called it the grand bargain. \nWhenever I had a chance to sit down and talk with him--I had joined the \nFinance Committee--he would talk about the opportunities that were \nrelated to taxes. He often talked with Senator Alexander and me, as my \ncolleague remembers.\n  He talked to us about health care and taxes. He was very interested \nin innovation. By the way, I think he was one of the first Senators who \npurchased a hybrid vehicle close to 20 years ago, and he used that \ndiscussion to branch into the kinds of building connections that you \nhave to do when you are talking about how you are going to increase the \nstandard of living for Americans in a constantly changing world where \nyou are really dealing with global economics. We don't just sell stuff \nto people down the street; we are competing against economic forces \nfrom all over the world.\n  When Senator Bennett talked about his idea of a grand bargain--and \nyou could be sitting with him in the Senate dining room, for example, \nand he probably took out a napkin if he couldn't find a piece of \npaper--what he was interested in was what I call principled \nbipartisanship. In other words, nobody gets everything they want, but \nwhat you try to do is find principles that you feel strongly about and \nprinciples that the other side feels strongly about--and that is what \nSenator Alexander and Senator Feinstein were talking about this \nafternoon--and you find some common ground.\n  It was very fortunate, as I look at my career in public service, that \nI had a chance to work with Bob Bennett. I will tell you, the way I see \nit, there was no better grand bargain in life than a friendship with \nBob Bennett. We differed on plenty of stuff, just as I am sure Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Alexander differ on matters. Bob would always \nsay: Ron is pro-choice, I am pro-life; Ron was against the Iraq war, I \nwas for the Iraq war. But we didn't spend our time arguing about those \nkinds of things. What we were interested in was finding ways to solve \nproblems.\n  I remember one example that I think my colleagues on the floor \nremember as well. Back at the time of Y2K, the turn of the century--oh, \nmy goodness, one would have thought that western civilization was going \nto end. We were going to have this technology meltdown. It was going to \nbe chaos around the world. Well, there were two bills at the time, two \npieces of legislation. There was a bill from our former colleague, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Bennett. I was a young upstart member of the \nCommerce Committee. Senator McCain, knowing my interest in technology \npolicy, basically gave me a great honor by saying ``Why don't you be my \nrunning mate?'' because he was the chairman of the committee. So there \nwere two bills; one was Senator McCain and I as the junior running \nmate, and the other was Bob Bennett and Chris Dodd. Everybody said \nthere was going to be all kinds of fighting among the four of us. \nNobody is going to agree. Nobody will pass a piece of legislation, and \nthe country, as a result, will not be prepared.\n  Well, because of Bob--I basically was the newcomer to the Senate. \nThis was a big, important piece of legislation. Bob and Chris Dodd and \nSenator McCain basically said: We are not going to have any part of \nsome bickerfest here in the U.S. Senate; we are going to solve a \nproblem. And they did. You bet, it picked up opposition. There were \nsome folks on the progressive side who had reservations about some \nprovisions, and there were some folks on the conservative side who had \nreservations about the legislation. We\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\npassed a bill. I remember going down to the Y2K center that night and \nstaying up all night. I can't claim that our legislation was \nresponsible for such a smooth-running transition, but we like to think \nthat the fact that the Senate decided to set aside partisanship and \nactually get something done was constructive.\n  The reality is that Bob Bennett firmly believed that he was elected \nto do more than just get reelected. I think that was right in the core \nof how he worked in the U.S. Senate.\n  I have been in public life awhile. I was the director of the Gray \nPanthers for a number of years when I was a young man with a full head \nof hair and rugged good looks. I was always dreaming about being a \nmajor part of health reform, so I put together a bill. I said: I think \nmy party is right that we are never going to get health care fixed \nunless we have universal coverage; otherwise, it will be cost shifting, \nand there won't be prevention. But the Republicans had a valid point, \ntoo, that there ought to be a role for the private sector.\n  So I was talking to Republicans, and Senator Alexander remembers \nthese visits. I went in to see Senator Bennett, whom I watched on the \nfloor talking about health care, and he sounded like someone who might \nbe interested, but I still thought it was a long shot. I said: My God, \nhe is a really conservative fellow from Utah. He and a progressive \nfellow from Oregon probably don't have much in common, except for the \nfact that they are both tall. I talked to him in his office. He later \nsaid to a newspaper person: I gave the closest thing that you do in the \nSenate to convey that I really wasn't interested because you never say \nno, especially to somebody sincere. He said that a number of times. So \nhe thought about it, and he spent time talking to people.\n  I remember this as if it were yesterday because his seat was across \nthe aisle, just a few seats away. He and Senator Rockefeller were the \ntallest Senators at the time; Senator Kerry and I kind of came in--I \ndon't know--third or fourth or something like that. He came bounding \nover and he said: I want to do this with you. And I did a kind of \ndouble take because I thought, I don't think I am hearing this right. \nHe said: Yes, you are talking about how the Democrats are right about \nuniversal coverage, and I am going to have to get my side kind of \nacclimated to that, but you acknowledge that there ought to be a role \nsomehow, some way for the private sector. I said: You bet, that was the \npoint. He said: I am in.\n  So one of his newspapers--in looking at all the kind things that have \nbeen said--said that Bob Bennett did so much good work. We hope what \nhis career stood for was that you could find common ground and that the \nSenate would remember going forward that bipartisanship is not a death \nsentence. Bipartisanship is a chance to find a way to solve problems, \nwhether it was Y2K, which was exciting, or something else.\n  I think it is worth mentioning, because I did a stint as chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that Bob Bennett put \ntogether a truly impressive public lands bill. It involved one of his \nfast-growing counties--Washington County--and several hundred thousand \nacres of wilderness, of land management, by the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the National Park Service alike. Suffice it to say that \nwhen I heard about it for the first time, Senator Bennett asked for my \nhelp, and I thought, man, there is no way he is going to be able to \nmove something like this because you had all the progressive \nenvironmental organizations, you had lots of people from the counties \nwho of course resisted these sorts of things, and you had lots of \nchallenges in the West putting together public lands policies. We saw \nit again here recently in eastern Oregon. But Bob Bennett pulled it \noff. He pulled it off because he pretty much just smothered both sides \nwith attention. Each side would have a point. He would respond. He \nwould send his staff down to talk to people. And those who wouldn't \nnormally possibly agree came together and found common ground on public \nlands policy.\n  I remember because the President signed it in 2009, Senator Bennett \nand I were in the back--I guess largely because we were the tallest--\nand we talked about how unlikely it was that we would be there and that \nwe would have all of these opportunities to serve together.\n  As we remember Bob Bennett, my hope is we will understand, as did \nSenator Bennett, that, much like today, neither side had enough votes \nto get everything it wanted. That was the case then, and it continues \nto be the case today. He understood that no single party had a lock on \nall the good ideas, but rather than just shrug his shoulders or go out \nand race for a microphone in order to score some sort of quick \npolitical advantage, Bob Bennett, in his career in the Senate, stood \nfor what we call principled bipartisanship.\n  I imagine there are going to be a number of farewells this week to a \nwonderful friend, a terrific Senator, in my view, and an even better \nperson. I just hope that apropos of what we have seen with Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Alexander, as they approach another big vote, \nlet's put as much of our time and effort into finding common ground as \npossible. Sometimes it can't be done. I get that, and Bob Bennett did \ntoo. But certainly we can put vastly more time and effort into finding \ncommon ground, pursuing what Bob Bennett was all about because he was a \nU.S. Senator who gave public service a good name.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I want to thank the \nSenator from Oregon for those remarks.\n  My colleagues might be interested to know that I was chairman of \nRules, and Bob was the ranking member, and this was during the period \nbefore the first inauguration of Barack Obama. As we all know, the \nRules Committee is in charge of making the arrangements for the \noccasion.\n  Bob was really just a wonderful person to work with. In the first \nplace, we worked really well together. We sat down, we went over the \nproblems, and we talked about solutions. Then came the subject of the \nSenate lunch following the inaugural. Well, I didn't pay much attention \nto it. Then I realized that this was a huge thing. It was in National \nStatuary Hall. There were decorations. We had to get a fine painting. \nIn this case, I arranged for it to be a great California landscape by \nThomas Hill, which came from the museum in New York. To plan for it, \nthere is something that has been traditional, which is the meal \ntasting, and Senator Bennett and his wonderful wife Joyce and my \nhusband and I went up to the fourth floor, and the table was set as it \nwould be set at this lunch. We did a tasting from every culinary \ncaterer who was bidding to do the lunch, believe it or not, and I think \nthere were four of them. So there were four entrees and four salads and \nfour desserts. And Joyce and Bob and Dick and I sat there, and we went \nthrough the motions and did it. But it was with great humor. And the \ntwo of them together really were a very special couple.\n  The Senator from Oregon knew him in a different way than I knew him. \nBob Bennett truly was a man among men. He had a humility about him, but \nhe also had a real can-do sense, and he really cared about his Senate \nterm. I know Senator Alexander knew him well. It was really wonderful \nfor me on the Rules Committee because it was much the way the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is on Energy and Water appropriations.\n  I had a chance to meet Joyce and get to know her, and it was very \nspecial. I think we put on a very good inaugural--a bipartisan \ninaugural, if you will--and I just want to say thank you, Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because this really was a man who didn't participate \nin any obstruction or any difficulty. He was always positive and always \nwilling to do his part and to help. That is really very special.\n  I would like to give my best to his family and his friends. The State \nof Utah had a wonderful Senator in Bob Bennett, and he will be missed.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of legislation reforming the MTB, or the miscellaneous tariff \nbenefit process. I am pleased to help this legislation advance. It is \nmy hope that this bill will soon be on the President's desk. As many \nwill remember, a dark cloud hung over the Congress with regard to the \npractice of earmarking in early 2009.\n  The feeding at the earmark trough had long since expanded to the \npoint of ridiculousness. Earmarks exploded to their annual record of \n$29 billion in 2006. They were long a problem before that, but it had \nbecome much, much worse at that time.\n  Congress had become accustomed to powerful Members getting a large \nchunk of the earmark pie, and rank-and-file Members would fight over \nthe scraps.\n  We saw less and less true oversight as more and more spending was \ndoled out in congressional back rooms. It wasn't just spending on \nearmarks that we didn't have good oversight on. It was the entire \nFederal budget. It was largely a problem because so much of our time in \nCongress was spent doling out earmarks and making sure that every \nMember got a few and that they were scattered around. We really gave up \non the oversight that we should have been conducting.\n  At the same time, earmarks opponents had ample opportunity to shame \nthe process by highlighting bridges to nowhere, teapot museums, and the \nNational Cowgirl Hall of Fame, for example, receiving these earmarks.\n  But attention on the issue focused sharply in early February of 2009, \nwhen reports surfaced that a lobbying firm specializing in defense \nappropriations had been raided by the FBI. The New York Times noted \nthat the firm ``set up shop at the busy intersection between political \nfund-raising and taxpayer spending, directing tens of millions of \ndollars in contributions to lawmakers, while steering hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in earmarks contracts back to his clients.''\n  The cloud over Congress darkened even further with suggestions of \npay-to-play straw-man contributions, the reimbursing of employees for \npolitical contributions, and pressuring others for political giving. In \nquick succession, both the House and the Senate rightly put in place a \nmoratorium over all earmarks, a ban that has remained intact ever \nsince.\n  While we gladly said goodbye to the bad old days of congressional \nporkbarrel spending, we soon found out that there were several things \nthat Congress only knew how to do through earmarking. This included the \nso-called miscellaneous tariff benefits, or MTBs.\n  MTBs are provisions that, when signed into law, provide tariff and \nduty relief for imports that are not domestically produced. The \nhistoric MTB process benefited from a consensus-driven process \nadministered by the International Trade Commission that, for the most \npart, set it apart from the much ridiculed Federal largesse doled out \nby earmarking. Unfortunately, the original process also required that \nan original bill be introduced by a Member of Congress--a specific bill \nfor a specific tariff reduction, often to benefit a particular for-\nprofit company.\n  I have long held that doing away with these individual bills and \nestablishing an MTB process that relies on the ITC to accept and review \nproposals over which Congress has final say would be preferable. Such \nan approach would both comply with the earmark moratorium while \nproviding taxpayers a measure of confidence that undue influence was \nnot being inappropriately exerted.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with both House and \nSenate leadership and with members of the Senate Finance Committee and \nthe House Committee on Ways and Means on moving such a proposal \nforward.\n  To be clear, my goals of being an original cosponsor of the American \nManufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 and vocally supporting moving \nforward with legislation reforming the MTB process is twofold. First \nand foremost, cutting tariffs is the right thing to do. In fact, I \nwould support permanent tariff reductions as a means of furthering the \nbenefits of free trade and lightening the burden on U.S. producers. In \naddition, the longer we go without being able to move forward with MTB \nbills, the more threatened the earmark moratorium is.\n  I wish I could say that all Members of Congress are willing to \npermanently walk away from this wayward process of congressional \nearmarking, but that is not the case. Those wishing to go back to the \nbad old days will use any excuse to support ending the earmark \nmoratorium.\n  Reforming the MTB process not only provides a path for much needed \ntariff relief and a modicum of confidence for taxpayers, but it is also \ngood for the long-term survival of the earmark moratorium.\n  I am pleased to be a part of this effort moving forward. The House \ncompanion legislation passed with overwhelming support. I believe there \nwere only two dissenting votes in the House. It is my hope that the \nSenate will soon follow suit.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 3801 to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, an act making \n     appropriations for energy and water development and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Tim Scott, Marco Rubio, Michael B.

JAMES RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the career of Dr. \nJames ``Jim'' Richardson, who is retiring from the University of \nNevada, Reno, UNR, this year.\n  Dr. Richardson is stepping down from his positions as director of \njudicial studies and foundation professor of sociology and judicial \nstudies after 48 years of service to UNR. His commitment and dedication \nto the judicial studies and justice management programs have been \ninvaluable in preparing students for careers in the justice system. Dr. \nRichardson has enriched the lives of hundreds of students, including \nthe many undergraduate students he introduced to the field of sociology \nand the doctoral candidates he mentored as they completed their \ndissertations.\n  In addition to his teaching activities, Dr. Richardson has been a \nprolific researcher and writer. He was among the first researchers to \nfocus on new religious movements. He has been praised for his \ninterdisciplinary approach to sociology, particularly for his \nincorporation of subjects such as law, psychology, and economics into \nthe study of religion. Dr. Richardson has authored or coauthored 9 \nbooks, more than 150 articles, and 85 book chapters. In addition, he \nhas held nearly 350 presentations in almost 30 countries. Through his \nwork, Dr. Richardson has made important contributions to the \nscholarship of sociology and has enriched academia as a whole.\n  Dr. Richardson has had an impact on the practice of law and the \njustice system in more direct settings as well. For instance, he has \nserved as an expert witness on a variety of legal cases. He has also \nbeen a consultant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and has \nworked to help law enforcement officials better understand the \ninteraction between the justice system and religious groups. In \naddition, Dr. Richardson has researched several issues for the Nevada \nSupreme Court.\n  I congratulate Dr. Richardson on his many successes and decades of \ndedicated service to UNR and to the Silver State. Both the justice \nsystem and academia have benefitted from his work, and I wish him the \nbest in his retirement and future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2615-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2615-S2616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this \nevening's vote on cloture on the substitute amendment No. 3801 to the \nEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, \nH.R. 2028, which was not agreed to.\n  On rollcall vote No. 66, had I been present, I would have voted to \noppose cloture. The junior Senator from Arkansas has proposed an \namendment which would grind the Senate's appropriations process to a \nhalt while undermining U.S. national security. This amendment is simply \nanother attempt to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \nJCPOA, that has verifiably eliminated the threat of Iran's nuclear \nprogram to the United States, Israel, and the international community. \nIn fact, the junior Senator from Arkansas attempted to undermine this \nnational security agreement before it was even negotiated by leading a \npartisan letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, implying that Congress would \nnot honor any potential diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The \nunprecedented attempt failed.\n  Now that this agreement has been implemented, he is trying to \nundermine it again by attempting to prohibit the Department of Energy \nfrom taking actions which support the deal and remove nuclear-related \nmaterials\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nfrom Iran--actions which, if needed, are important to U.S. national \nsecurity. As such, I strongly oppose this effort and continue to \nsupport the forceful implementation of the JCPOA in order to continue \nto prevent Iran from ever possessing a nuclear weapon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2616-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2616-S2619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

The MDE value of \n     these items was $20 million; the total implemented value of \n     the initial case and amendments was $42 million.\n       Of the items listed above, France has already received (via \n     a below Congressional threshold-level FMS case, FR-B-WAA) \n     one-hundred and twelve (112) AGM-114K1A Hellfire Missiles, \n     one hundred two (102) AGM-114N1A Hellfire Missiles, fifty \n     (50) ATM-114Q1A Hellfire Training Missiles, Hellfire Missile \n     conversion kits, blast fragmentation sleeves and installation \n     kits, containers, and transportation.\n       France has requested that this existing FMS case, FR-B-WAA, \n     be amended with the possible sale of two-hundred (200) AGM-\n     114K1A Hellfire Missiles, Hellfire Missile conversion, blast \n     fragmentation sleeves and installation kits, containers, and \n     transportation. The estimated MDE cost in this amendment is \n     $25 million. The total estimated cost is $30 million.\n       As the amendment requested by France will raise the value \n     of FR-B-WAA over the Congressional notification threshold, \n     this transmittal notifies what will be the total quantities \n     and value of the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) with \n     this proposed amendment. The estimated cost of MDE is $45 \n     million. The total estimated cost is $72 million.\n       This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy \n     and national security of the United States by improving the \n     capability of a NATO ally. France is a major political and \n     economic power in Europe and a key democratic partner of the \n     United States in ensuring peace and stability around the \n     world. It is vital to the U.S. national interest to assist \n     France to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-\n     defense capability.\n       The additional missiles will meet France's operational \n     requirements for a precision-guided tactical missile for its \n     Tigre Attack Helicopter. The purchase will directly support \n     French forces actively engaged in operations in Mali and \n     Northern Africa, providing them the capability to \n     successfully engage targets with minimal collateral damage. \n     France will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into \n     its armed forces.\n       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not \n     alter the basic military balance in the region.\n       There is no principal contractor for this sale as the \n     missiles are coming from U.S. Army stock. There are no known \n     offset agreements in connection with this potential sale.\n       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require any \n     additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives in \n     France.\n       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness \n     as a result of this proposed sale.\n\n\n                         Transmittal No. 16-34\n\n     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to \n         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n       1.

Purchaser: Government of Singapore\n       ii. Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 14-18; Date: 07 \n     July 2014; Military Department: Air Force.\n       iii. Description: On 07 July 2014, Congress was notified by \n     Congressional certification transmittal number 14-18, of the \n     possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (AECA) of nine-hundred and thirteen (913) KMU-556 \n     B/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits for Mk-84 2000 \n     lb bombs, one-hundred (100) FMU-152A/B Live Fuzes, and three-\n     hundred (300) DSU-40 Laser Precision Guidance Set. Also \n     included were containers, munition trailers, support \n     equipment, spare and repair parts, support and test \n     equipment, publications and technical documentation, \n     personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government \n     and contractor engineering and technical support, and other \n     related elements of logistical and program support. The total \n     estimated major defense equipment (MDE) cost is $43 million. \n     The total estimated program cost is $63 million.\n       This transmittal reports the enhancement of the KMU-556 F/B \n     JDAM kits to include SAASM/AJ (Selective Availability Anti-\n     Spoofing Module with Anti-Jam) GPS receivers. There is no \n     increase in the total estimated MDE cost or total estimated \n     program cost.\n       iv. Significance: This report is being provided because at \n     the time of the original notification, Singapore was not \n     approved for anti-jam capability. Singapore received DoD \n     approval for anti-jam capability on 22 October 2015.\n       v. Justification: This proposed sale will contribute to the \n     foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the \n     United States by helping to improve the security of a major \n     Southeast Asian partner in counterterrorism and an important \n     force for political stability and economic progress in South \n     East Asia.\n       vi. Date Report Delivered to Congress: MAY 02, 2016.\n\n\n                         Transmittal No. 0H-16\n\n     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to \n         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as \n         amended\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology\n       1. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is not a stand-\n     alone weapon. It is a ``bolt-on'' guidance package that \n     converts unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions \n     (PGMs). Weapon accuracy is dependent on target coordinates \n     and present position coordinates entered into the guidance \n     control unit. The Inertial Navigation System (INS), using \n     updates from the Global Positioning System (GPS), helps guide \n     the bomb to the target via the use of movable tails fins. \n     With the addition of a laser guidance nose kit, the JDAM is \n     able to engage moving targets. The JDAM all-up-round (AUR) \n     (JDAM kit, unguided bomb body, and tail fuze) is \n     UNCLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is classified up to \n     SECRET.\n       2. This transmittal reports the enhancement of the KMU-556 \n     F/B JDAM kits to include anti-jam Global Positioning System \n     (GPS) capability. The KMU-556 F/B Tail Kit with Global \n     Positioning System Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing \n     Module with Anti-jam (GPS/SAASM/AJ) is the tail kit for the \n     GBU-31F(V) 1/B and GBU-56 F (V)/B. Information revealing \n     SAASM implementation details are classified SECRET.\n       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain \n     knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the \n     information could be used to develop countermeasures which \n     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the \n     development of a system with similar or advanced \n     capabilities.\n       4. A determination has been made that the recipient country \n     can provide substantially the same degree of protection for \n     the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. \n     Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. \n     foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in \n     the Policy Justification.\n       5. All defense articles and services listed in this \n     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to \n     Singapore.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Defense Security\n\n\n                                           Cooperation Agency,\n\n                                                    Arlington, Va.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize CWO2 \nJohn S. Heffernan, Retired, for his leadership and dedication to our \nState and Nation as a soldier, a veteran, and a volunteer. He is truly \na public servant.\n  Mr. Heffernan enlisted in the Army in 1962 and began his military \ncareer with basic training at Fort Chaffee, AR. He completed \ntelecommunications training at Fort Gordon, GA, and then served as a \ncryptographer in the 33rd Signal Battalion at Fort Richardson, AK.\n  Mr. Heffernan was discharged from the Army on March 19, 1965, and \nbriefly assigned to the U.S. Army Reserve Control Group, Reinforcement, \nbefore joining the Arkansas National Guard less than a week later. He \nserved as a personnel staff noncommissioned officer, ultimately \nreaching the enlisted rank of sergeant first class, E-7. In 1980, Mr. \nHeffernan was appointed as a warrant officer and served as a military \npersonnel technician and later promoted to the rank of chief warrant \nofficer 2.\n  After completing more than 27 years of military service and \napproximately 25 years as a fulltime, dual status military technician \nfor the Arkansas Army National Guard, Mr. Heffernan retired as a \nservicemember and as a civil service employee and was transferred to \nthe U.S. Army Reserve Control Group, Retired Reserves, in 1990.\n  Shortly after his retirement, Mr. Heffernan went back to work as a \nfamily assistance officer at Fisher Armory in North Little Rock in \nsupport of the 148th Evacuation Hospital and the 25th Rear Operations \nCenter, during their deployment to Desert Shield/Desert Storm.\n  Following Desert Storm, Mr. Heffernan saw the need to assist military \nretirees and their families, so for the next 5 years, he provided his \nvoluntary services at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock. After his \ntime at Camp Robinson, Mr. Heffernan spent the next 18 years, providing \nvoluntary retirement services at the Little Rock Air Force Base, \nbecoming the director of retiree activities in 2000. Mr. Heffernan has \nbeen a tireless advocate and the go-to person in central Arkansas for \nall matters related to military retirees and their families.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join Senator \nFeinstein and me in recognizing the centennial of the San Diego Zoo \nGlobal, a world-class facility dedicated to providing expert animal \ncare and promoting wildlife conservation.\n  Founded in 1916, the San Diego Zoo Global began as a sanctuary for \nabandoned animals left behind after the Panama-California Exposition \nheld in San Diego. The zoo expanded quickly, opening its doors to rare \nand exotic animals donated by private owners, purchased from circuses \nand other zoos, and rescued from the wild. In the 1950s, zoo director \nDr. Charles Schroeder had the idea of exhibiting animals in a large, \nfree-range habitat that provided space for breeding and conservation \nresearch. His dream became a reality in 1972 with the opening of the \nSan Diego Zoo Safari Park, a one-of-a-kind 1,800-acre habitat that is \nnow home to more than 3,200 animals. Over half of the park has been set \naside as protected native species habitat.\n  Throughout the years, the San Diego Zoo Global has played a critical \nrole in preserving rare wildlife and habitats through its Institute for \nConservation Research, housed in the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center \nfor Conservation Research. Founded in 1975, the institute is one of the \nlargest zoo-based research centers in the world and has led several \nsuccessful efforts to protect some of the world's most endangered \nspecies, including the magnificent California condor. The zoo led the \neffort to save the condor by designing and implementing a successful \n25-year captive-breeding process that reintroduced the species to its \nnative habitat. At the start of the program, the California condor was \nnear extinction; today the current condor population is more than 420, \nwith approximately 200 living in the wild in California, Arizona, Utah, \nand Mexico.\n  The San Diego Zoo Global is also making an immediate and lasting \nimpact in our Nation's classrooms. Each year, the San Diego Zoo and the \nInstitute for Conservation Research hosts a workshop for middle and \nhigh school teachers from across the United States. This hands-on \nexperience allows educators to develop innovative lessons in \nconservation to bring back to their students.\n  Over the past 100 years, the San Diego Zoo Global has opened its \ndoors to millions of visitors from around the\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nglobe, setting a new standard for zoological institutions worldwide. \nSenator Feinstein and I want to congratulate the staff, volunteers, and \nsupporters of this extraordinary organization for the important role \nthey play in the care and preservation of our earth's most beautiful \ncreatures and habitats. We know their work will continue to make a \nprofound difference for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2620-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SAMUEL STATEN, SENIOR\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I remember the distinguished \nlife and career of Mr. Samuel Staten, Sr., who passed away at the age \nof 80 on Tuesday, April 26, 2016. Sam was not only a trusted adviser \nand dedicated father, but a pillar of strength for thousands in the \nlabor movement and Philadelphia. I would like to take this time to not \nonly send my condolences to his family, but to reflect upon his \nremarkable life. He spent 50 years in the labor industry and dedicated \nhis career to strengthening the rights of workers and the bonds of \nfriendship between the communities of Philadelphia. He worked his \nentire life for the betterment of his fellow workers and experienced \nfirsthand the hardships that inadequate wages and benefits can have on \nhard-working Americans.\n  Sam's presence was felt in the labor movement long before his time as \none of Philadelphia's most prominent civic leaders. He spent 10 years \nas a construction laborer in Philadelphia in the 1960s and remembered \nworking for $2.60 an hour, without health care, without a pension plan, \nwithout any of the support many of our Nation's workers have come to \nenjoy today. His experience in the transformative decade of the sixties \nshowed him not only the importance of the labor movement, but the power \nthat collective action can have for the well-being of the community and \nthe Nation.\n  Following 10 years as a construction worker, Sam's capacity for \nleadership and his ability to unite people were recognized when he \nbecame a field representative for Laborers' Local 332 in 1970. His \nskills and leadership helped him to quickly rise through the ranks, and \nin 1973, he was appointed assistant business manager for Local 332. The \nhigh esteem in which he was held by his colleagues continued to be \nevident in 1978 when he was elected business manager for Local 332 and \nheld that position until 2008. He also served as the secretary-\ntreasurer of the Laborers' District Council of the Metropolitan Area of \nPhiladelphia & Vicinity. He officially retired from Laborers Local 332 \nand the Laborers' District Council in 2010.\n  Never one to narrow his focus to just one area, he brought his \nleadership and insight to countless other organizations. Over the \nyears, he served as a trustee of the Laborers' District Council \nBuilding & Construction Health & Welfare Fund, delegate to the \nPhiladelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, board member of \nthe Philadelphia Housing Authority, member of the African-American \nChamber of Commerce, trustee of the Laborers' District Council Building \n& Construction Pension Fund, board member of the Pennsylvania \nConvention Center Authority, and member of the Pennsylvania Prevailing \nWage Appeals Board. These represent only a few of the many \norganizations to which Sam lent his support, but show the extensive \ninfluence and support he has given to the Philadelphia area.\n  Given the breadth of his dedication to the workers and people of \nPhiladelphia, it is unsurprising that his leadership extended even \nfurther through charitable work. He helped to found the Laborers' \nDistrict Council Charity Fund through an act that, though remarkable, \nwas typical of Sam. At a 1987 Friends of Labor Committee dinner held in \nhis honor, Sam was presented with $25,000 for his service over the \nyears. However, he saw the gift not as a chance to help himself, but an \nopportunity to improve the lives of others. He chose to donate the \nmoney to charity, which in turn inspired his colleagues and gave birth \nto the Laborers' District Council Charity Fund. Renamed the Samuel \nStaten, Sr., Charitable Trust in 2011, the organization continues to \nprovide thousands of dollars in services and scholarships to Local 332 \nmembers in need.\n  Throughout his life he fought for the dignity and well-being of hard-\nworking Americans and, regardless of his success, never forgot his \nroots in the labor movement. He experienced both great success and \nhardship, but regardless of the hand he was dealt, he always saw an \nopportunity to extend that hand to others in need. As he rose through \nthe ranks of Local 332, he brought together diverse communities and \nlabor interests for the benefit of the community. Even when confronted \nwith the tragic death of his son, Qaid Staten, Sam's dedication to the \ncommunity could not be diminished. His son was killed just months \nbefore he was to attend Howard University, but Sam chose to honor his \nson not through grief, but through the creation of the Qaid Staten \nMemorial Scholarship Fund, which continues to provide support to other \nyoung students preparing to enter college. Sam's life was a story of \nuncommon acts of kindness in service of the common good.\n  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a grateful nation, \nI would like to once again extend my deepest condolences to the family \nof Samuel Staten, Sr. Philadelphia and the Nation may have lost a \ndistinguished leader, dedicated public servant, and devoted father and \ngrandfather, but we will never lose the positive change he brought to \nthe city of Philadelphia, the impact he had on the lives of thousands, \nnor the legacy of idealism, compassion, and community service that he \nhas left so others may continue to fight for the causes of dignity and \nequality to which he dedicated his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2620-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAUL COOKE\n\n Mr. GARDNER.

Most notably are the updates to the State's fire \nprotection services, organization of the State-level fire and life \nsafety programs, as well as the statewide first responder training \nprograms.\n  I thank Director Paul Cooke for his dedicated hard work throughout \nhis entire career and congratulate him on a well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2620-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2620-S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE TWIN CITIES DIVISION OF THE COAST GUARD AUXILIARY\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Established in 1941, this \nflotilla is the oldest in Minnesota.\n  The volunteers of the Coast Guard Auxiliary dedicate their time to \nmaking sure our community's lakes and rivers are safe. As the Land of \n10,000 Lakes, flotillas in Minnesota have a fulltime job. From \nperforming search and rescue operations, to teaching boating safety \ncourses, for 75 years, the Afton flotilla has helped to ensure that \nMinnesota waterways are safe and accessible.\n  Over the years, when our State has faced natural disasters such as \nflooding of the Mississippi River and the Red River, the Afton flotilla \nhas worked side-by-side with local, State, and Federal authorities to \naid in search and rescue operations, evacuations, and emergency \ncommunications. When the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in \nMinneapolis tragically collapsed in\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\n2007, the volunteers of the Afton flotilla were ready to work with \nemergency response teams and helped catalog the countless amount of \ndebris examined during the investigation. Even after the disaster was \nover, the flotilla monitored boater safety once the river was finally \nreopened.\n  Even more than responding to disasters, the Afton flotilla works to \nprevent disasters on the water, making sure that river navigation tools \nare in working order and patrolling during regattas and other events. \nThere is no way for us to know just how many lives were saved over the \npast 75 years through the hard work of the Afton flotilla volunteers.\n  I join all of my fellow Minnesotans in applauding the Afton \nflotilla's momentous anniversary and the dedication of its volunteer \nmembers over the past 75 years. I would also like to thank all of the \nauxiliary volunteers in Minnesota and across the country who keep our \ncommunities and waterways safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2621-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT F.

LAURANT\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ms. Margaret \nN. Laurant, of Slidell, LA.\n  Ms. Laurant was born in Bonfouca, LA, in 1926 to Jean and Elmonia \nNarcisse, both of whom were direct descendants of original French \nsettlers of Bofouca. Ms. Laurant is the last remaining of her nine \nsiblings and currently serves as the matriarch of the Narcisse family. \nAs a young child, Ms. Laurant dealt with racism firsthand. She recalls \nattending a small segregated one-room school called the Golden Key. \nLater she attended middle school at the St. Tammany Parish Training \nSchool for Negros, where each day she walked to school as she was \nunable to ride a school bus with her\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\nWhite schoolmates. Soon after completing her middle-school education, \nMs. Laurant selflessly began working full time in an effort to ease her \nfamily's financial hardships.\n  In 1946, Ms. Laurant met her future husband, Norvell Laurant, in her \nhometown of Bonfouca. After marrying, the couple left Louisiana for \nColumbus, OH, where Mr. Laurant was stationed in the U.S. Army and Air \nForce. After receiving an honorable discharge from the military in \n1948, the two moved back to Bonfouca. There, they built their home and \nraised seven children, to whom they stressed the importance of strong \nChristian values and a well-rounded education. Leading by example, Ms. \nLaurant attended adult evening classes at St. Tammany High School. \nDuring this time she also worked as a housekeeper to provide for her \nfamily. Using her past experiences, Ms. Laurant advocated for racial \nintegration in schools throughout Salmen and Slidell, LA, to ensure \nthat African-American students were treated fairly and received a \nquality education. Ms. Laurant still resides in Bofouca, now an \nincorporated part of Slidell, where after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, \nshe rebuilt the home in which she raised all seven of her children.\n  As she approaches her 90th birthday, I would like to honor Ms. \nLaurant's life, her accomplishments, and her commitment to her \ncommunity and advancing the rights of African Americans during a \ntumultuous time in our Nation's history. I wish her the happiest of \nbirthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2622-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 29, 2016, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1890.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Delegates of the State of West Virginia urging the United \n     States Congress to provide funding for the West Virginia \n     National Guard to sustain and enhance its capabilities in its \n     role in a regional catastrophe and to modernize the \n     antiquated avionics of its fleet of C130s and other aircraft \n     to meet global airspace requirements for 2020; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, In the event of a regional catastrophe, West \n     Virginia's east-west highways, including I-68 and I-64 are \n     links to the major exit corridors from the FEMA National \n     Capital Region (NCR) westward and, assuming that a regional \n     catastrophe will likely include Baltimore to the north of the \n     NCR and Richmond to the south of the NCR, westward evacuation \n     utilizing these highways is highly likely and is, in fact \n     anticipated; and\n       Whereas, The routes through West Virginia will traverse \n     rural areas that do not have infrastructure adequate for what \n     could be a mass of evacuees in the worst-case scenario; \n     experience in regional emergencies, such as Superstorm Sandy \n     in 2012, illustrates some shortcomings in planning that is \n     less focused on regions and more on states; and\n       Whereas, West Virginia is perfectly (and geographically) \n     postured to support any emergency or disaster response to the \n     NCR, including mass evacuation westward; and\n       Whereas, FEMA regions do not necessarily represent grouping \n     of states likely to be involved in some scenarios; FEMA \n     region III contains the NCR and West Virginia as its western-\n     most edge and in a major catastrophe, Regions V, with Ohio, \n     Indiana, and Illinois, VII with Missouri, and IV with \n     Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina are likely to be \n     involved in some combinations; and\n       Whereas, The National Guard, through the use of Emergency \n     Management Assistance Compacts, can operate across state \n     lines to provide vital response capability in security, \n     transportation, medical, housing, communications, command and \n     control, and others based on its dual role in military \n     preparedness and state civil support; and\n       Whereas, Military Force Structure assigned to the National \n     Guard must be considered by Federal Military planners for the \n     dual use they can encounter; National Guard Organizations \n     require personnel, equipment, organization, training, \n     leadership and funding to maintain federal military standards \n     and to be prepared to respond to a domestic emergency or \n     disaster; and\n       Whereas, Regional catastrophic planning is dependent on \n     National Guard assets, capabilities and responsiveness; \n     consequently, it is also critical that federal military \n     planners assess the impact of their force structure changes \n     on regional capability needs as well as those that are state \n     specific; and\n       Whereas, The C-130 H3 ``Hercules'' aircraft assigned to the \n     130th Airlift Wing of the West Virginia National Guard at \n     Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia will eventually \n     become obsolete without system modernization to the \n     communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) components; \n     National Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies and the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are \n     moddernizing airspace faster than the U.S. Air Force is \n     updating C-130 avionics capabilities; and\n       Whereas, Aircraft component acquisition becomes \n     increasingly difficult as fewer C-130 H aircraft remain in \n     the Air Force inventory and the unique components of the C-\n     130, including its self contained navigational system (SCNS), \n     face short term supply chain shortages that could be remedied \n     with aircraft avionics modernization; and\n       Whereas, The contract to perform maintenance on aircraft \n     flight computers is renewed annually and this perpetual \n     reliance on short term contracts increases sustainment cost \n     and challenges mission effectiveness and operational \n     planning; and\n       Whereas, Reliance on short term contracts and antiquated \n     avionics will increase Air Force expense in the long run as \n     it translates to more expensive mission-essential\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n     contracts and increased fuel expenditures due to inefficient \n     routing: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia; That the \n     Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to \n     provide funding for the West Virginia National Guard to \n     sustain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a \n     regional catastrophe and to modernize the antiquated avionics \n     of its fleet of C-130s and other aircraft to meet global \n     airspace requirements for 2020; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates is \n     hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the \n     President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the House of Representatives and to the \n     members of West Virginia congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-162. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Delegates of the State of West Virginia urging the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency not to prohibit \n     conversion of vehicles to race cars; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     has proposed a regulation to prohibit conversion of vehicles \n     originally designed for on-road use into racecars; and\n       Whereas, The regulation would also make the sale of certain \n     products for use on such vehicles illegal. The proposed \n     regulation was contained within a nonrelated proposed \n     regulation entitled ``Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel \n     Efficiency Standards for Medium-and Heavy-Duty Engines and \n     Vehicles--Phase 2''; and\n       Whereas, The regulation would impact all vehicle types, \n     including the sports cars, sedans and hatch-backs commonly \n     converted strictly for use at the track. While the Clean Air \n     Act prohibits certain modifications to motor vehicles, it is \n     clear that vehicles built or modified for racing, and not \n     used on the streets, are not the ``motor vehicles'' that \n     Congress intended to regulate; and\n       Whereas, ``This proposed regulation represents overreaching \n     by the agency, runs contrary to the law and defies decades of \n     racing activity where EPA has acknowledged and allowed \n     conversion of vehicles,'' said Specialty Equipment Market \n     Association (SEMA) President and CEO Chris Kersting. \n     ``Congress did not intend the original Clean Air Act to \n     extend to vehicles modified for racing and has reenforced \n     that intent on more than one occasion''; and\n       Whereas, SEMA submitted comments in opposition to the \n     regulation and met with the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency to confirm the agency's intentions. The \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency indicated that \n     the regulation would prohibit conversion of vehicles into \n     racecars and make the sale of certain emissions-related parts \n     for use on converted vehicles illegal. This would certainly \n     be detrimental to the economy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia; That the \n     State of West Virginia hereby respectfully urges the \n     Environmental Protection Agency not to prohibit conversion of \n     vehicles to race cars; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of West Virginia respectfully \n     urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to issue its \n     final regulations until the legislatures of the states have \n     submitted comments; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of West Virginia forward official \n     copies of the resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and \n     West Virginia's representatives in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-163. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Nebraska relative to their ratification of the \n     Twenty-Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Legislative Resolution 381\n\n       Whereas, The first Congress of the United States, at its \n     first session, held in New York, New York, on the twenty-\n     fifth day of September, in the year one thousand seven \n     hundred and eighty-nine, passed the following resolution to \n     amend the Constitution of the United States of America, in \n     the following words and figures in part, to wit:\n       The Conventions of a number of the States having at the \n     time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, \n     in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, \n     that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be \n     added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in \n     the Government will best ensure the beneficent ends of its \n     institution;\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, two thirds of \n     both Houses concurring, That the following Articles be \n     proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as \n     Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all or \n     any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the \n     said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, \n     as part of the said Constitution, viz.:\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of Representatives shall have intervened: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Members of the One Hundred Fourth \n     Legislature of Nebraska, Second Session:\n       1. That such proposed amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States be ratified.\n       2. That the Clerk of the Legislature send copies of this \n     resolution to the Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-164.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Max Cleland Congressional \n     Gold Medal Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Joseph Maxwell ``Max'' Cleland has demonstrated the \n     highest degree of professionalism and has served as an \n     inspiration to friends, family, veterans, and many others \n     while dedicating his life to the public service of the United \n     States.\n       (2) Max Cleland began his career in public service when he \n     joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps as a young \n     college student, went on active duty in the United States \n     Army (in this section referred to as the ``Army'') in 1965 as \n     a Second Lieutenant, and volunteered for service in Vietnam, \n     rising to the rank of Captain.\n       (3) The Army recognized Max Cleland with a Silver Star for \n     his gallantry in action during the Battle of Khe Sanh in \n     April of 1968. According to the letter of commendation from \n     the Army, ``The President of the United States of America, \n     authorized by Act of Congress, July 8, 1918 (amended by act \n     of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver \n     Star to Captain (Signal Corps) Joseph Maxwell Cleland, United \n     States Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in \n     military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile \n     force in the Republic of Vietnam.''.\n       (4) Max Cleland, a Battalion Signal Officer dispatched to \n     set up a radio relay antenna, was severely wounded on the \n     battlefield and, as a result, lost both of his legs and his \n     right arm. Cleland would endure 18 months of extremely \n     difficult rehabilitation and recovery at Walter Reed Army \n     Medical Center and hospitals of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (in this section referred to as ``VA hospitals'') in \n     Washington, DC. In 1969, Cleland testified before the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate on the hardships \n     faced by veterans returning home from war.\n       (5) Upon returning to Georgia, Max Cleland was determined \n     to continue his public service and, in 1970, at the age of \n     28, was elected as the youngest Georgia State senator and \n     helped pass legislation to make public facilities accessible \n     for veterans, older people, and individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (6) Max Cleland later came to Washington, DC and joined the \n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs as a professional staff \n     member, investigating VA hospitals across the country and the \n     treatment of service members returning from Vietnam.\n       (7) In 1977, President Jimmy Carter named Max Cleland, then \n     just 34 years old, the youngest ever individual, and first \n     Vietnam veteran, to serve as Administrator of the Veterans \n     Administration. As Administrator, Cleland helped create the \n     ``Vet Center'' counseling program, which later expanded to \n     300 facilities nationwide helping veterans and their families \n     receive psychological care for post-traumatic stress \n     disorders and other problems associated with warfare.\n       (8) Following his term as Administrator of the Veterans \n     Administration, Max Cleland returned to elective office in \n     1982 when he was elected as Secretary of State of the State \n     of Georgia. As Secretary of State, Cleland implemented the \n     National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et \n     seq.) in Georgia and added almost 1,000,000 new voters to the \n     rolls.\n       (9) Max Cleland was elected to the United States Senate in \n     1996 and would go on to chair the Subcommittee on Personnel \n     of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate. In the \n     Senate, Cleland was known for his work in expanding benefits \n     for service members and in improving veterans' health care, \n     education, and the environment.\n       (10) After his service in the Senate, Max Cleland continued \n     his distinguished career in public service by becoming a \n     commissioner on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks \n     Upon the United States (commonly referred to as the ``9/11 \n     Commission'') and later as a member of the Board of Directors \n     of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.\n       (11) In 2009, President Barack Obama named Max Cleland \n     Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission. As \n     Secretary of the Commission, Cleland is charged with \n     commemorating both the permanent cemeteries of the United \n     States located in foreign countries and the military \n     memorials, monuments, and markers demonstrating where members \n     of the United States Armed Forces have served overseas since \n     World War I.\n       (12) In 2010, President Obama again called on Max Cleland \n     to serve his country and Cleland again accepted. This time, \n     Cleland agreed to serve as co-chair, and eventually\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\n     the inaugural chair, of the Advisory Committee on Arlington \n     National Cemetery, which was established to help fix the \n     problems facing the final resting place for many of the \n     heroes of the United States. After his tenure as chair, \n     Cleland was awarded the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian \n     Service of the Army, the highest honorary award that the \n     Secretary of the Army can confer on a civilian.\n       (13) After overcoming some of the most difficult challenges \n     imaginable, Max Cleland has spent almost five decades of his \n     life in service to the United States and the country is \n     forever indebted to his service.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf \n     of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Joseph \n     Maxwell ``Max'' Cleland.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     described in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike \n     the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Duplicate Medals.--\n       (1) In general.--Under such regulations as the Secretary \n     may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell duplicates \n     in bronze of the gold medal struck under this Act at a price \n     sufficient to cover the costs of the medals, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n       (2) Sale of duplicate medals.--The amounts received from \n     the sale of duplicate medals under paragraph (1) shall be \n     deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       Medals struck under this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2907.

Res. 459\n\n       Whereas, in 2016, cancer remains one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2016, more than 1,600,000 individuals in the \n     United States are expected to be diagnosed with cancer and \n     more than 595,000 individuals in the United States are \n     expected to die from the disease;\n       Whereas 1 in 2 men in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with cancer during his lifetime, and 1 in 3 women in the \n     United States will diagnosed with cancer during her lifetime;\n       Whereas approximately 77 percent of individuals diagnosed \n     with cancer are over 55 years of age;\n       Whereas cancer accounts for approximately 1 in every 4 \n     deaths, is the second most common cause of disease-related \n     death in the United States, and is projected to become the \n     number 1 disease-related killer of individuals in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the incidence of cancer is expected to grow \n     significantly, reaching 2,300,000 cases per year by 2030;\n       Whereas racial and ethnic minorities, as well as low-\n     income, rural, and elderly populations, continue to suffer \n     disproportionately in cancer incidence, prevalence, and \n     mortality;\n       Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 \n     diseases that collectively represent--\n       (1) the leading cause of death for individuals in the \n     United States under 85 years of age;\n       (2) the second leading cause of death for all individuals \n     in the United States; and\n       (3) the leading cause of disease-related death among \n     children in the United States;\n\n       Whereas the most recent estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health indicated that the overall economic \n     costs of cancer to the United States were $216,600,000,000 \n     and the economic burden of cancer is expected to rise as the \n     number of cancer deaths increases;\n       Whereas the investment in cancer research by the United \n     States has yielded substantial advances in cancer research \n     and has saved and improved millions of lives;\n       Whereas scholars estimate that every 1 percent decline in \n     cancer mortality saves the economy of the United States \n     $500,000,000,000;\n       Whereas advancements in understanding the causes, \n     mechanisms, diagnoses, treatments, and prevention of cancer \n     have led to cures for many types of cancers and have \n     converted other types of cancers into manageable chronic \n     conditions;\n       Whereas, in 2011, the 5-year survival rate for all types of \n     cancer was greater than 65 percent and, in 2015, more than \n     14,500,000 cancer survivors lived in the United States;\n       Whereas therapies and effective screening tools for some \n     types of cancer remain elusive and some cancers, including \n     pancreatic, liver, lung, ovarian, and brain cancers, continue \n     to have extraordinarily high mortality rates and 5-year \n     survival rates that are typically less than 50 percent;\n       Whereas partnerships among research scientists, the general \n     public, cancer survivors, patient advocates, philanthropic \n     organizations, industry, the Federal Government, and State \n     and local governments have led to advanced breakthroughs, \n     early detection tools that have increased survival rates, and \n     a better quality of life for cancer survivors;\n       Whereas precision medicine holds great promise in treating \n     many forms of cancer;\n       Whereas almost all of what is known about cancer diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention comes from the 3 to 5 percent of \n     patients who enroll in clinical trials, but these trials \n     enroll relatively homogeneous patient populations, leaving a \n     lack of evidence to guide treatments for a large proportion \n     of the other 95 to 97 percent of patients who do not \n     participate in or do not qualify for studies;\n       Whereas the explosion of new science, treatments, and \n     diagnostic tests make broad reaching data initiatives and \n     breaking down organizational barriers to share information \n     more important than ever so it can be determined how best to \n     apply breakthrough treatments to the diverse population of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas advances in cancer research have had significant \n     implications for the treatment of other costly diseases, such \n     as diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, \n     and macular degeneration: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of cancer research and the \n     invaluable contributions of researchers in the United States \n     and around the world who are dedicated to reversing the \n     cancer epidemic;\n       (2) designates May 2016, as ``National Cancer Research \n     Month''; and\n       (3) supports efforts to--\n       (A) establish cancer research as a national and \n     international priority; and\n       (B) eliminate the more than 200 diseases that collectively \n     represent cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2630-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3887.

Mr. President, I would like to make brief comments \nconcerning the status of the Energy and Water appropriations bill, \nfollowing the actions of the majority leader. I said most of what I had \nto say earlier.\n  Here is my view of it. Tonight, and for the third time, the Senate \nvoted not to end debate on the Energy and Water appropriations bill, \neven though we have virtually finished all of our work on it. We have \none difference of opinion, and it is a big one. It is provocative. It \nis the Cotton amendment that would prohibit U.S. tax dollars being used \nnext year to purchase heavy water from Iran.\n  The majority leader has filed cloture on the Cotton amendment, which \nmeans that after tomorrow--the intervening day--we will have a vote on \nthe Cotton amendment on Wednesday. We will dispense with it the way we \nusually dispense with issues about which we have large differences of \nopinion: We vote on them. Sometimes we can work them out, sometimes we \ncan withdraw them, and sometimes we can't. So we are going to vote on \nit. Senator Cotton has said that if he should not win the amendment, he \nwill withdraw it. That will dispose of the Cotton amendment, and then \nwe can move on and finish the Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  I said earlier today, and I will reiterate, that while I have \ndefended Senator Cotton's right to offer his amendment--it is germane \nand it is relevant--I will vote no on his amendment for two reasons. \nOne reason is I believe it raises the possibility that if the United \nStates is not allowed to buy heavy water from Iran, then it puts it on \nthe international market and it could be purchased by other countries, \nsuch as North Korea, for use in making nuclear weapons.\n  This is not a vote for or against the Iran nuclear agreement. I am \nopposed to that agreement. This is a question about what to do about \nthe heavy water that Iran has, which it has to get rid of, which can be \nused either for peaceful purposes, which we use it for in the United \nStates when we have it--we use it for the neutron microscope at the Oak \nRidge Laboratory, we use it for fiber optics, we use it for MRI \nimaging, we use it in a variety of ways--or it can be used to make \nplutonium and nuclear weapons. Now is not the time to be increasing the \npossibility that heavy water from Iran could be put on the \ninternational market and sold to a country such as North Korea, which \nmight use it to make nuclear weapons. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, while the amendment is relevant and germane, this is an \namendment that ought to be considered first in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee or the Armed Services Committee. I get a lot of lectures \nsometimes in our Republican lunches about appropriators making \ndecisions that ought to be in the authorizing committee. Well, this is \none of them. If there were an issue that raises more such complex \nnational security issues, it would be hard to think of one. Might this \nheavy water be used by a country to make nuclear weapons or, on the \nother hand, if we purchase it, does it create a market or an incentive \nfor Iran to produce more heavy water? What happens to India, which \nproduces heavy water? What happens to Argentina? What happens to the \nneed of the United States for heavy water, since we don't produce it at \nall, yet we need it? Iran produces it. We don't want them to have it. \nWe don't produce it. We need it. We don't want North Korea to have it. \nThese are complex national security issues that ought not to be decided \non an amendment to this bill.\n  I will be voting no on the Cotton amendment because of the fear that \nit might create the possibility that putting it on the international \nmarket would put this distilled water, which could be used peacefully, \nin the hands of those who might make a bomb with it, and because I \nthink an appropriate way to handle it is to first allow the Foreign \nRelations Committee or the Armed Services Committee to deal with it.\n  This is a sincere amendment. I have defended the right of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas to offer his amendment. My friends on the other side \ndon't like the amendment. They see it as provocative. They see it as a \npoison pill. That is a difference we will just have to work out over \ntime.\n  This is the U.S. Senate. The right way to work out differences we \ncan't otherwise work out is simply to vote. The majority leader has \nmade sure we will have a vote on the Cotton amendment by Wednesday.\n  My hope is that as important as this Energy and Water appropriations \nbill is, that Senator Feinstein and I could work with the Democratic \nleader and\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\nthe Republican leader and others to see if we might not agree tomorrow \non a way to vote on the Cotton amendment and finish the bill.\n  As I have said earlier, 80 different Senators have important \nprovisions in the bill. I know that. I know they are important because \nmany of my colleagues went home over the last week and took credit for \npassing them, even though we have a little more work to do.\n  So while we have one difference of opinion left--and it is a big \none--I think the majority leader has put us on a path to come to \nresolution by Wednesday, and I hope by tomorrow.\n  Let me conclude by thanking Senator Feinstein. She feels as \npassionately about this as Senator Cotton does. Maybe she feels more \npassionately about it. I respect and understand that, but I also \nrespect the fact that she and I are bringing the first appropriations \nbill to the floor, and it is our basic constitutional duty to do so. We \nhaven't had an Energy and Water appropriations bill make it all the way \nacross the floor under regular order since 2009. That is not the way \nthe railroad is supposed to run around here. We need to show the \nAmerican people that we can resolve our differences and come to a \nresult, so we will do that. We will have a vote, and then we will \nfinish the bill. I hope we can do it tomorrow.\n  I look forward to continuing my discussions with the Senator from \nCalifornia and other interested Senators to get it resolved.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee for his views and for his very instructive \nactions to move this bill to fruition. I know we both think it is an \nimportant bill. We know the subject that Senator Cotton has raised is \nalso important.\n  I think there has been a good discussion on it and understanding of \nthe pros and cons, so I think now we can wait until Wednesday, an hour \nafter we come in, for the vote, and we will see what the will of the \nSenate is.\n  I want the chairman to know I am very grateful for the actions he has \ntaken because this is enabling us to pass the bill and see it enacted \ninto law, we hope.\n  So thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2646-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2646-S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, during our break, last Thursday the \nNew York Times ran a story that was as heartrending and gut-wrenching \nas I have read in a long time. The headline was: ``One Week in April, \nFour Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 5, 2016]\n\n      One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot and Killed Themselves\n\n    (By Jack Healy, Julie Bosman, Alan Blinder, and Julie Turkewitz)\n\n       Kansas City, Mo.--Sha'Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was \n     buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a \n     tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot \n     wound to her forehead.\n       She had been napping in bed with her father, Courtenay \n     Block, late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter \n     handgun he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, \n     Mo., home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up \n     like the red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Mr. Block told \n     the police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and \n     crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull.\n       In a country with more than 30,000 annual gun deaths, the \n     smallest fingers on the trigger belong to children like \n     Sha'Quille.\n       During a single week in April, four toddlers--Holston, \n     Kiyan, Za'veon and Sha'Quille--shot and killed themselves, \n     and a mother driving through Milwaukee was killed after her \n     2-year-old apparently picked up a gun that had slid out from \n     under the driver's seat. It was a brutal stretch, even by the \n     standards of researchers who track these shootings.\n       These are shooters who need help tying their shoelaces, too \n     young sometimes to even say the word ``gun,'' killed by their \n     own curiosity.\n       They accidentally fire a parent's pistol while playing cops \n     and robbers, while riding in a shopping cart, after finding \n     it in the pocket of the coat their father forgot to wear to \n     work. The gun that killed Sha'Quille last Thursday was \n     pointing up, as if being inspected, when it fired.\n       They are the most maddening gun deaths in America. Last \n     year, at least 30 people were killed in accidental shootings \n     in which the shooter was 5 or younger, according to Everytown \n     For Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group that tracks \n     these shootings, largely through news reports.\n       With shootings by preschoolers happening at a pace of about \n     two per week, some of the victims were the youngsters' \n     parents or siblings, but in many cases the children ended up \n     taking their own lives.\n       ``You can't call this a tragic accident,'' said Jean Peters \n     Baker, the prosecutor of Jackson County, Mo., who is \n     overseeing the criminal case in Sha'Quille's death. Her \n     office charged Mr. Block, 24, with second-degree murder and \n     child endangerment. ``These are really preventable, and we're \n     not willing to prevent them.''\n       Gun control advocates say these deaths illustrate lethal \n     gaps in gun safety laws. Some states require locked storage \n     of guns or trigger locks to be sold with handguns. Others \n     leave safety decisions largely to gun owners.\n       Twenty-seven states have laws that hold adults responsible \n     for letting children have unsupervised access to guns, \n     according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, though \n     experts say such measures have, at best, a small effect on \n     reducing gun deaths. Massachusetts is the only state that \n     requires gun owners to store their guns in a locked place, \n     though it has not stopped youngsters there from accidentally \n     killing themselves or other children.\n       Gun rights groups have long opposed these kinds of laws. \n     They argue that trigger locks can fail, that mandatory \n     storage can put a gun out of reach in an emergency, and that \n     such measures infringe on Second Amendment rights.\n       ``It's clearly a tragedy, but it's not something that's \n     widespread,'' said Larry Pratt, a spokesman and former \n     executive director of Gun Owners of America. ``To base public \n     policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.''\n       In Kansas City, Sha'Quille's family is trying to come to \n     grips with her death and the murder charge facing Mr. Block. \n     In interviews, several relatives said they did not believe he \n     deserved to be convicted of felony murder, but some \n     questioned his judgment in leaving a loaded gun out while he \n     slept as well as his actions after he discovered that his \n     daughter was grievously wounded.\n       According to court records, Mr. Block told the police that \n     immediately after the shooting, he went to the bathroom, \n     wrapped the gun in a shirt and put it into a vent in the \n     floor. He then ran outside carrying his dying daughter and \n     yelled for a neighbor to call for help. He was also charged \n     with evidence tampering.\n       Sha'Quille's mother, Montorre Kornegay, said that she had \n     recently separated from Mr. Block after more than five years \n     together, but that they remained close. She said he loved the \n     girl, whose first word was ``Daddy.'' When he called Ms. \n     Kornegay from jail, he told her he was sorry and talked about \n     how much he missed Sha'Quille.\n       The girl was just 2, but wanted to be older, telling people \n     she was already 5. She would run through the house, playing \n     her own private game of peekaboo, relatives said. In a \n     cacophony of squeaky children at home, relatives could always \n     distinguish Sha'Quille's low, raspier voice. One day, she'll \n     be a singer, they told one another.\n       ``What happened was wrong,'' Ms. Kornegay said. She said \n     that she did not think Mr. Block deserved to face a murder \n     charge, but that he had behaved irresponsibly. ``Why didn't \n     you stay up and watch her?''\n       Parents, police officers and neighbors from Georgia to \n     California are asking similar painful questions this week. \n     Here are some of their stories.\n\n\n                             `Stay With Me'\n\n       In 2015, there were at least 278 unintentional shootings at \n     the hands of young children and teenagers, according to \n     Everytown's database. During the week in April when \n     Sha'Quille and the other children died, there were at least \n     five other accidental shootings by children and teenagers. \n     Alysee Defee, 13, was shot in the armpit with a 20-gauge \n     shotgun she had used for turkey hunting in Floyd County, Ind. \n     Zai Deshields, 4, pulled a handgun out of a backpack at her \n     grandmother's home in Arlington, Tex., and shot her uncle in \n     the leg.\n       A child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely \n     to be 3 years old, the statistics show.\n       Holston Cole was 3, a boy crackling with energy who would \n     wake before dawn, his pastor said. He loved singing ``Jesus \n     Loves Me'' and bouncing inside the inflatable castle in his \n     family's front yard in Dallas, Ga.\n       About 7 a.m. on April 26, he found a .380-caliber \n     semiautomatic pistol in his father's backpack, according to \n     investigators. The gun fired, and Holston's panicked father, \n     David, called 911. Even before a dispatcher could speak, Mr. \n     Cole wailed ``No, no!'' into the phone, according to a \n     redacted recording.\n       Mr. Cole pleaded for his 3-year-old son to hold on until \n     the ambulance could arrive: ``Stay with me, Holston,'' he can \n     be heard saying on a 911 tape, his voice full of desperation. \n     ``Can you hear me? Daddy loves you. Holston. Holston, please. \n     Please.''\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\n       Holston was pronounced dead that morning.\n       The local authorities have been weighing what can be a \n     difficult decision for prosecutors and the police after these \n     shootings: Whether to charge a stricken parent or family \n     member with a crime. While laws vary among states, experts \n     said decisions about prosecution hinge on the specific \n     details and circumstances of each shooting. What may be \n     criminal neglect in one child's death may be legally seen as \n     a tragic mistake in another.\n       Officials with the Paulding County Sheriff's Office have \n     suggested that they expect Mr. Cole to face, at most, a \n     charge of reckless conduct.\n       ``Anything that we do, criminally speaking, is not going to \n     hold a candle to the pain that this family feels,'' said Sgt. \n     Ashley Henson, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. Sergeant \n     Henson said investigators had sensed early on that the \n     shooting was accidental. ``You want to be able to protect \n     your family and take care of your family, but on the same \n     hand, you've got to be safe with your weapons,'' he said.\n       Some gun control groups have urged states and district \n     attorneys to prosecute such cases more aggressively, saying \n     that, grief aside, people need to be held responsible for \n     what are easily preventable deaths.\n       Brent Moxey, the pastor who officiated at Holston's \n     funeral, said the boy's father was already haunted. ``I think \n     he runs the scenario over and over and over in his mind.'' \n     Mr. Moxey said the family--which did not respond to a message \n     left at their home seeking comment--was still asking for \n     privacy.\n       About 1,000 mourners attended Holston's funeral on April \n     30, remembering a boy who loved superheroes and would \n     sometimes wrestle cardboard boxes. The day he died, he spent \n     time alongside his mother, Haley, as she read the Bible, \n     playing with the highlighter pen she used to note passages, \n     Mr. Moxey said.\n       ``This little boy loved to tinker and to play, and he loved \n     to get into things,'' Mr. Moxey said, describing the very \n     impulse that probably led to Holston's death. ``He loved to \n     figure out how stuff works.''\n\n\n                            A Ringing Purse\n\n       In Indianapolis, Kanisha Shelton would stay protectively \n     near her 2-year-old son, Kiyan, watchful of the stray dogs \n     known to roam through the neighborhood.\n       But on the night of April 20, Ms. Shelton stepped away from \n     the boy, leaving him in the kitchen while she was upstairs. \n     She had placed her purse out of his reach on the kitchen \n     counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy \n     apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto \n     it and reached for the purse, according to an account from a \n     cousin, John Pearson. There was also a .380-caliber Bersa \n     pistol in it.\n       Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a loud bang and rushed \n     downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she found Kiyan lying on \n     the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the chest. He was \n     rushed to a local children's hospital, where he was \n     pronounced dead.\n       Ms. Shelton's mother, who answered her daughter's \n     cellphone, said the family did not want to speak about the \n     death. No criminal charges have been filed.\n       The police in Indianapolis said such scenes were becoming \n     more common. ``The mother was obviously very shaken up,'' \n     Capt. Richard Riddle said. Indeed, on Sunday night, another \n     child, 10 years old, died in what the police say appears to \n     have been another accidental shooting.\n       A 2013 investigation by The New York Times of children \n     killed with firearms found that accidental shootings like \n     these were being vastly undercounted by official tabulations, \n     and were occurring about twice as often as records said.\n       Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency physician and a \n     researcher at the University of California, Davis, who \n     studies the public health effects of gun violence, said that \n     nearly everyone--from toddlers to adults--can fail to \n     accurately distinguish toy guns from real guns, loaded guns \n     from unloaded ones.\n       ``That doesn't stop them from playing with it,'' he said.\n       Mr. Pearson said he sympathized with Ms. Shelton and \n     thought of Kiyan's death as a tragic accident. ``It was up on \n     the counter, so I do think she thought she put the gun away, \n     out of the baby's reach,'' Mr. Pearson said. ``She's going to \n     be in a living hell.''\n       Essie Jones, who lives across the street, said Ms. Shelton \n     had recently taught Kiyan to ride a small bicycle with \n     training wheels, guiding him on the bike in the driveway. \n     ``They'd be up in the yard playing,'' she said. ``He was very \n     happy.''\n       In a condolence book online, Dianna Mitchell-Wright, who \n     identified herself as ``Auntie,'' wrote of her anguish over \n     losing the boy she had nicknamed ``My Main Man.''\n       ``All I have are memories,'' she said, ``and your pictures \n     in my cellphone.''\n\n\n                           Anguished Goodbyes\n\n       The coffin that held Za'veon was no bigger than a piece of \n     carry-on luggage, and it was so light that two pallbearers \n     easily carried it through the packed St. Paul Missionary \n     Baptist Church in Bermuda, La.\n       His full name was Za'veon Amari Williams, but to his family \n     in Natchitoches, the 3-year-old was known as Baby Zee. On \n     April 22, he found a pistol and shot himself in the head, \n     according to Detective John Greely of the Natchitoches Police \n     Department. When paramedics arrived, they found the mother \n     cradling the boy and crying that he was not breathing, \n     according to KSLA News 12.\n       The police arrested a companion of the mother, Alverious \n     Demars, 22, on charges of negligent homicide and obstruction \n     of justice. Detective Greely said that the police believed \n     that the pistol belonged to Mr. Demars, and that he hid it \n     after the toddler shot himself. The police have not found the \n     weapon.\n       ``As a responsible adult it's his obligation to secure \n     that--to make sure a child does not get ahold of it,'' \n     Detective Greely said, explaining why Mr. Demars had been \n     arrested.\n       The family declined to speak, but in a Facebook post, the \n     boy's mother, Destiny Williams, wrote that she had not been \n     able to sleep and was a ``useless sad waste.'' ``I can't take \n     life,'' she wrote. ``Why is it so cruel and unrelenting and \n     unforgiving.''\n       The funerals for these children were filled with a similar \n     anguish.\n       At the funeral for Baby Zee, the wails and screams grew so \n     loud during a final moment of goodbye that ushers closed the \n     church doors to give the family privacy. In Georgia, \n     Holston's father tearfully read a letter that reflected on \n     how the family used to sing ``Jesus Loves Me.'' At the Kansas \n     City funeral for Sha'Quille, family members crumpled as they \n     looked into the coffin, shaking with tears or kissing her.\n       The day after Sha'Quille was buried, her maternal \n     grandmother, Pamala Kornegay, reflected on the girl who was \n     missing from the cluster of grandchildren who sat coloring on \n     her living room floor. Ms. Kornegay said she was not angry \n     with Sha'Quille's father.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the article included harrowing stories \nlike this one:\n\n       Sha'Quille Kornegay, 2 years old, was buried in a pink \n     coffin, her favorite doll by her side and a tiara \n     strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted gunshot wound \n     to her forehead. She had been napping in bed with her father \n     late last month when she discovered the 9-millimeter handgun \n     he often kept under his pillow in his Kansas City, Missouri \n     home. It was equipped with a laser sight that lit up like the \n     red lights on her cousins' sneakers. Her father told the \n     police he woke to see Sha'Quille by his bed, bleeding and \n     crying, the gun at her feet. A bullet had pierced her skull.\n       On the night of April 20th, Kanisha Shelton had placed her \n     purse out of her 2-year-old son Kiyan's reach on the kitchen \n     counter, but when her phone started ringing, the boy \n     apparently pushed a chair close to the counter, climbed onto \n     it and reached for the purse. There was also a .380-caliber \n     Beretta pistol in it. Just after 9 p.m., Ms. Shelton heard a \n     loud bang and rushed downstairs. There, in the kitchen, she \n     found Kiyan lying on the floor, bleeding from a gunshot wound \n     to the chest. The police in Indianapolis said such scenes \n     were becoming more common.\n\n  As someone who has advocated for commonsense protections against gun \nviolence for decades and now as a Senator from Connecticut, where we \nknow all too well the horrors of gun violence and the deep wounds and \ndeath they can wreak on innocent children, and especially as a parent \nof four children who have been those ages, these stories, for me, are \ntruly heartrending and gut-wrenching. My heart goes out to the families \nof these children and the families of countless other children who were \nlost as a result of these gun deaths--too many such families too often \nand so many of them preventable.\n  Last year, there were 278 unintentional shootings by young children \nor teenagers, most of them having no idea what they were doing. In the \nweek at the end of this April when four toddlers shot themselves, at \nleast five other children and teenagers accidentally shot themselves or \nother people.\n  Indepth investigations have strongly suggested that these shootings \nare significantly undercounted because of differing rules across the \ncountry and jurisdictions about how such deaths are to be reported. \nSome areas designate any death in which one person shoots another as a \nhomicide, even if the shooter is 2 years old and has no intent to kill.\n  The gun lobby relies on these misleading statistics to oppose laws \nthat could reduce and prevent these kinds of heart-wrenching stories \nand deaths, such as safe storage laws or technology such as trigger \nlocks. How could they be opposed? The gun lobby argues that these \ndeaths are vanishingly rare, outpaced by other causes of child \nmortality. Of course, they perpetuate the misinformation by continuing \nto oppose any research, any fact-finding into gun violence by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, continuing to even block \nour ability to better understand the problem, let alone address it.\n  I continue to have great difficulty understanding the anti-safety \nadvocacy of these groups. Time and again in American history we have \nrecognized that products posing a risk to consumers--particularly to \nchildren--require regulation to make them as safe\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\nas possible, no matter what the product, no matter what the industry. \nThat has been the American way. We put seatbelts in cars and require \ndrivers to learn what they are doing in obtaining a license. We put \nchildproof caps on medicine bottles and dangerous household products, \neven if they have domestic uses. If we have taken concrete steps to \nensure that children can't open a bottle of aspirin, I am baffled that \nwe can't do more to prevent these violent deaths. Why aren't we doing \neverything we can to make sure that children can't kill themselves or \nothers or injure themselves or others with firearms?\n\n  There is no lack of ideas for how to remedy this situation. President \nObama recently announced that as part of the White House's anti-gun \nviolence initiative, he will move forward to promote the development of \nsmart gun technology which is designed to ensure that no one except the \nowner can fire it. Even if the gun makes it into the hands of someone \nwho should not have it, whether a child or a criminal, the gun will not \nbe accessible. Like other steps the President has outlined in the \nabsence of congressional action which remains sorely needed, this smart \ngun initiative utilizes existing laws and resources to challenge \nresearch, innovation, and enforcement toward more effectively cutting \ndown on gun violence. Surely, we have a consensus among the American \npeople, among gun owners, and among anybody belonging to groups that \nseemingly oppose these commonsense measures that we need to do more and \ndo it better to prevent these child deaths.\n  On smart guns in particular, the White House will provide guidance \nfor enhancing safety technology and help to manufacture and test smart \nfirearms and to facilitate their purchase by State and local \ngovernments. Working in partnership with private sector innovators and \nlocal jurisdictions, this initiative holds tremendous promise.\n  Even while smart guns that depend on advanced technology are being \ndeveloped, existing mechanisms provide remedies as well--low-tech \nremedies. Trigger locks and indicators of whether a gun is loaded are \nin widespread use today. Studies have suggested that a third of \naccidental deaths could be prevented by the use of childproof safety \nlocks and loading indicators. Our laws should encourage and even \nrequire their adoption. States around the country have also developed a \nvariety of safe storage bills that prohibit storing firearms in places \nthat are accessible to children. Tragic experience has shown us that, \nas important as it is for families to discuss guns with their children, \nsimply admonishing them to avoid going near guns won't work, \nparticularly when the children are too young to understand what guns \nare and what they can do, and, most especially, when they are playing \nwith other children in other families' homes, where those guns may be \naccessible and loaded.\n  The answer is to insist that adults take responsibility. They need to \nbe held responsible for keeping firearms off limits, which is really \nthe only realistic option to cut down these tragic deaths of children.\n  Laws requiring that kind of responsibility and accountability are \nsupported by two-thirds of Americans. Unfortunately, the gun lobby has \ncontinually, constantly, insistently, and consistently opposed progress \nin these areas. Their steadfast opposition has also prevented the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission--which has a praiseworthy track \nrecord of success keeping children safe from hazards and ranging from \nlead in toys to dangerous cribs--from regulating firearms or even \nissuing guidance about how they could be designed more safely for \nchildren.\n  I have been coming to the floor of the Senate for a number of years \nto speak about the need for legislation to address the gun violence \nepidemic in this country, clearly a public health crisis. If there were \na flu epidemic or another kind of contagious disease causing 30,000 \ndeaths a year, we would have urgent, drastic action. We need to do the \nright thing. There are stories reported such as those last week of the \nunspeakable horror of a child too young to understand what is happening \nwho encounters a gun and uses it, such as Sha'Quille, Kiyan, and \nHolston Cole, a 3-year-old boy with crackling energy, who would wake \nright before dawn. His pastor said: He loved singing ``Jesus Loves \nMe.'' He put a gun to his head and, unknowingly, pulled the trigger. We \ncan avoid that type of tragedy. We can do better, and we must act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the world and the Burns family \nlost Senator Conrad Burns. There are thousands of reasons to celebrate \nthe life of Senator Conrad Burns, but I will only mention a few, while \nI hope others write down their memories to help fill the void.\n  He made friends instantly and could quickly find a way to relate to \nanyone. He had a story for every situation. That is the most effective \nway to make a point. I particularly enjoyed his marital advice, which \nhe learned in Hudson, WY. His stories always had a location and a \nperson. He said Hudson is where he spent a week one day--but it is \nwhere he bet a friend $100 that his wife Phyllis could beat his \nfriend's wife in a foot race. He wasn't able to talk Phyllis into \nracing, but fortunately, the friend must not have had any luck with his \nwife, either, as he didn't show up.\n  While Conrad was a consummate, effective Senator, his love for his \nfaith, his family, and friends made him special. He was a man who lived \nby example. He was willing to share about his life to help with our \nlives. He mentored me and many others with his plain speaking, and \ntimely, sort of abrupt suggestions. He didn't waste time or words, but \nhe always had time to help.\n  He also probably never realized the difference he made. I know he \nnever realized the difference he made daily while he worked on \nlegislation, much of which he never got credit for but was effective at \ngetting finished.\n  He had a special talent for speaking and presenting that always got \npeople's attention. For example, he was able to take difficult issues \ninvolving telecommunications and make them understandable to his \ncolleagues and hold their interest. That is an unmatched talent. He had \na unique ability to sell ideas that came from his vast, real-life \nexperience in agriculture, radio, and especially in auctioneering. He \ncould get you to buy into his idea, and you didn't even realize that \nyou had bid. His experience in small business gave him the ability to \nmake people understand the kinds of decisions small businesses have to \nmake--how many decisions, how far in advance they had to be made, and \nhow critical that was to how well the United States does. His staff \nwould occasionally suggest other words or phrases he might use after \nthe fact. He recognized and made a case for the importance of small \nbusiness as the engine of our economy.\n  Golf gave him an outlet for his frustration and provided relaxation \nand an opportunity for less stressful conversations. I am not a golfer, \nbut Conrad always made the experience enjoyable and memorable.\n  His ability to sell is best noted when he auctioned a special Kenai \nhandmade quilt and got $15,000 when the best ever previous price was \n$3,000. Incidentally, he made the $3,000 quilt sale too.\n  By now, Conrad has had a chance to have a heart-to-heart talk--that \nis the only kind of talk you could have with Conrad, and especially in \nHeaven--with his daughter Kate, who passed away several years ago. I \npicture him playing golf in Heaven, where he is learning firsthand that \nsome of those stories about clergy playing golf are true. I bet he even \nhas a use for a saddle again and is still keeping up on the ag futures.\n  Conrad, you have been missed and will be missed as your memory \nreminds and inspires us. Your family is in our prayers as we grieve and \ncelebrate your life along with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2648-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2648-S2649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

There are 1,000 \nreasons to celebrate the life of Senator Bob Bennett, but I will only \nmention a few.\n  While he was the consummate effective Senator, his love for his \nfaith, his family, and his friends really made him special.

He mentored me \nand many others by giving gentle, timely suggestions.\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\n  His presentations at the Prayer Breakfasts helped us to know him and \nhis faith better. He demonstrated what he learned at church and, \nparticularly, on his mission, and he was willing to share that with us \nto help our lives. But his life was a living example of his faith.\n  He also probably never realized the difference he made in people's \nlives with his involvement with the Franklin Planner alone. I know he \nnever realized the difference he made daily as he worked with people on \nlegislation, much of which he never got credit for, but he was \neffective in making sure it got done in a reasonable way.\n  He had a special talent for speaking and presenting. He could take \nnumbers from the Joint Economic Committee, which he chaired, and make \nthem understandable to his colleagues. That is an unmatched talent. \nPeople go to sleep with numbers. His experience in small business gave \nhim the ability to make people understand how small businesses operate, \nhow they get their employees, the difficulties of buying things in \nadvance that they don't know they are going to sell, and how critical \nthat is to the U.S. economy. He recognized and made a case like no \nother person for how important small business was as the engine of our \neconomy.\n  Yes, Bob, you have been missed, and you are missed.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 451, S. Res. 436.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 436) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of World Malaria Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, without amendment and with an amendment to the preamble, as \nfollows:\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n                              S. Res. 436\n\n       Whereas April 25 of each year is recognized internationally \n     as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being preventable and \n     treatable;\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the \n     United States, as reducing the risk of malaria protects \n     members of the Armed Forces and other people of the United \n     States serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and \n     reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability \n     in less developed countries;\n       Whereas the elimination of malaria remains a bipartisan \n     priority of the United States Government;\n       Whereas, on December 14, 2006, President George W. Bush \n     stated at the White House Malaria Summit, ``So we are acting, \n     and we're leading. And with partners across the world, we are \n     helping the people of Africa turn the tide against malaria. \n     The goal of defeating malaria is a challenging goal, yet it \n     can be done. It's not going to require a miracle, it just \n     requires a smart, sustained, focused effort.'';\n       Whereas, on September 27, 2015, President Barack Obama \n     stated at the United Nations General Assembly, ``Billions of \n     our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from diseases \n     that we know how to prevent. Many children are just one \n     mosquito bite away from death. And that is a moral outrage. \n     It is a profound injustice. It is literally a matter of life \n     and death, and now the world must act.'';\n       Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the \n     diplomatic and moral interest of the United States, as that \n     support generates goodwill toward the United States and \n     highlights the values of the people of the United States \n     through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith-\n     based organizations of the United States;\n       Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term \n     economic interest of the United States because those efforts \n     help developing countries--\n       (1) identify at-risk populations;\n       (2) provide a framework for critical emergency disease \n     treatment;\n       (3) provide better health services;\n       (4) increase local governance needed to address substandard \n     and counterfeit medicines that exacerbate malaria resistance;\n       (5) produce healthier and more productive workforces;\n       (6) advance economic development; and\n       (7) promote stronger trading partners;\n       Whereas, in 2015, malaria transmission occurred in 95 \n     countries and territories;\n       Whereas an estimated 3,200,000,000 people are at risk for \n     malaria, with 214,000,000 active cases, the vast majority of \n     whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 90 percent \n     of malaria deaths in the world;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects the health of children, as \n     children under the age of 5 account for an estimated 70 \n     percent of malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal \n     health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and \n     low birth weights;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have \n     made significant progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 by the World Health \n     Organization states that, in 2014, approximately 55 percent \n     of people in sub-Saharan Africa slept under an insecticide-\n     treated mosquito net, and household surveys indicated that 90 \n     percent of people used an insecticide-treated mosquito net if \n     such a net was available in the household;\n       Whereas, in 2014, approximately 116,000,000 people were \n     protected by indoor residual spraying;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, \n     between 2000 and 2015--\n       (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 60 percent around \n     the world;\n       (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, \n     malaria mortality rates decreased by 66 percent; and\n       (3) an estimated 6,200,000 malaria deaths were averted \n     globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, \n     out of 95 countries and territories with ongoing transmission \n     of malaria in 2015--\n       (1) 10 countries are classified as being in the pre-\n     elimination phase;\n       (2) 10 countries are classified as being in the elimination \n     phase; and\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n       (3) 9 countries are classified as being in the prevention \n     of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and \n     advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to--\n       (1) continue to reduce malaria deaths;\n       (2) prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been \n     made; and\n       (3) equip the United States and the global community with \n     the tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health \n     threats;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global \n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       Whereas, in 2011, an independent, external evaluation, \n     prepared by Boston University, examining 6 objectives of the \n     PMI, found the PMI to be a successful, well-led program that \n     has ``earned and deserves the task of sustaining and \n     expanding the United States Government's response to global \n     malaria control efforts'';\n       Whereas the PMI Strategy 2015-2020 articulates the malaria \n     goal of the United States Government of working with \n     countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and \n     substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long-\n     term goal of elimination;\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the \n     PMI, which is led by the United States Agency for \n     International Development and implemented with assistance \n     from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \n     Department of State, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department \n     of Defense, and private sector entities;\n       Whereas the PMI focuses on helping partner countries \n     achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through \n     improved access to, and quality of, healthcare services in \n     locations with limited resources; and\n       Whereas the PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many \n     partner countries, has set a target by 2020 of reducing \n     malaria mortality by \\1/3\\ from 2015 levels in PMI-supported \n     countries, achieving a greater than 80 percent reduction from \n     original 2000 baseline levels set by the PMI, reducing \n     malaria morbidity in PMI-supported countries by 40 percent \n     from 2015 levels, and assisting not fewer than 5 PMI-\n     supported countries to meet the criteria of the World Health \n     Organization for national or sub-national pre-elimination: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, \n     particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to \n     combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde \n     United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public \n     Law 110-293; 122 Stat. 2918);\n       (6) supports continued leadership by the United States in \n     bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to combat \n     malaria and to work with developing countries to create long-\n     term strategies to increase ownership over malaria programs; \n     and\n       (7) encourages other members of the international community \n     to sustain and increase their support for and financial \n     contributions to efforts to combat malaria worldwide.\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to read into the Record \na portion of the New York Times Magazine profile yesterday of Ben \nRhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama.\n  Before reading the article, though, titled ``The Story-Teller and the \nPresident,'' I wish to explain briefly why I think this piece is so \nimportant for us to consider in this Chamber.\n  We live in a time of precipitous change, both in American Government \nand in communications more broadly. We don't admit it enough in this \nbody, but the Congress in the last decade-plus is extraordinarily weak \nby historical standards. At the same time, the media is rapidly \nfragmenting. These two vacuums are being filled by the executive branch \nin ways that are badly damaging, both to the separation of powers and \nto the idea of a meaningfully engaged citizenry. There can be little \ndoubt that our Founders would be troubled by what is occurring in our \ntime.\n  Washington is in the process of replacing self-evident truths with \nself-serving spin, and this is dangerous, for no one is entitled to his \nor her own facts. I sit intentionally at the desk of Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan in this body precisely because he was committed to the idea of \na shared set of facts before our debates began. Yet this story makes \nclear that the executive branch feels empowered to proclaim its own \nnarratives.\n  This is bigger than Republicans and Democrats. This is about the \nlegislature's check on the Executive, and it is about all of our \naccountability in this city to the people. To my Democratic colleagues \nwho supported the Iran deal, does it trouble you at all that the White \nHouse displays obvious contempt for you? For your voters and for my \nvoters, will you stand for this kind of fundamentally dishonest spin \nfrom future Republican administrations--because I pledge to you that I \nwill not from any administration of either party.\n  Some will say this is just one story of one staffer who wanted to \nbrag and got carried away--someone who wanted to boast about if the \nwhole world could be his canvas, but we should be clear that it is \nultimately elected officials who bear responsibility for the ongoing \nevaporation of public trust in our time.\n  I want to underscore this point. These, my comments tonight, are not \nabout whether you share the President's view that the Iranian nuclear \ndeal was a prudent move or whether you share my view that it was a \ndisaster. That is not the point at issue today. Obviously, foreign \npolicy is critically important, but this story tonight is about whether \nwe take truth seriously. It is about whether we care about the public \ntrust.\n  There is a widespread view around here that our chief job is ``to \npass legislation.'' That is incorrect. Our main job, and indeed the \noath we took, is to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, \nwhich is about limited government and about the separation of powers.\n  Our job is to ensure that the Nation is well governed and that the \npublic can believe that the public can have trust and confidence that \nthe Nation is well governed. This necessarily means that oversight is \nat least as important as passing or repealing particular pieces of \nlegislation. This horrific story should be a screaming siren to all of \nus of both parties.\n  Newsrooms are obviously still struggling to understand what vigorous \nand independent reporting will look like in the digital age, but it \nremains true that freedom that ordered liberty will remain dependent on \nan informed citizenry, and that requires a serious and a free press. \nGood journalism, serious journalism, that takes actual facts seriously \nand then grapples with those facts honestly, is an important and a high \ncalling.\n  I plan to read about one-fourth of this New York Times piece into the \nRecord, but please note that I will skip over many proper names for \nease of audible understanding. Picking up then about 40 percent of the \nway into the profile, the story continues:\n\n       The job he [Ben Rhodes] was hired to do, [was] namely to \n     help the President of the United States communicate with the \n     public, [and this job] was changing in equally significant \n     ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that \n     people in Washington\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n     were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard \n     for many of us to absorb the true magnitude of the changes in \n     the news business--40 percent of newspaper industry \n     professionals have lost their jobs [inside] the last decade--\n     in part because readers can absorb all [forms of new] news \n     they want from social media platforms like Facebook, which \n     are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars \n     and pay nothing for the [so-called] ``content'' they provide \n     to their readers. You have to have skin in the game--[that \n     is] to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death \n     way on its products--to understand the radical \n     and qualitative ways in which words appear in familiar \n     typefaces [but have yet] been changed. Rhodes [was \n     singling] out a key example to me one day, laced with the \n     brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private \n     utterances. ``All these newspapers used to have foreign \n     bureaus,'' he said. ``[But] now they don't. They call us \n     to explain to them what's happening in Moscow [or in] \n     Cairo. [And] most of the outlets are reporting on world \n     events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is \n     [just] 27 years old, and their only reporting experience \n     consists of being around [a few] political campaigns. \n     That's a sea change. They literally know nothing.''\n       In this environment, Rhodes has become adept at \n     ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes's \n     assistant, gave me a primer on the way it's done. The easiest \n     way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is \n     [just] from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own \n     dedicated press corps. ``But then there are [all of these \n     force] multipliers,'' he said, adding, ``We have our \n     compadres, [and I] reach out to a couple [of] people, and you \n     know I wouldn't wanted to name them--''\n       [I interrupt him and I say] ``I can name them,'' [and I \n     tick] off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and \n     columnists who often tweet in sync with [the] White House['s] \n     messaging [operation].\n       Price [laughs]. ``I'll say, `Hey, look, some people are \n     spinning this narrative that this is a sign of . . . \n     weakness,' '' he [continues].\n       [And I interrupt again] ``but--''\n       ``In fact, it's a sign of strength!'' I [say, chuckling \n     with him].\n       ``And I'll give them some color,'' Price [continues] ``and \n     the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com \n     publishing space, and [they] have [their] huge Twitter \n     followings, and [then] they'll be putting this message [as \n     their own].''\n       This is something different from old-fashioned spin, which \n     tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world \n     where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where \n     carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no \n     matter which party was in power, it was much harder to \n     sustain a ``narrative'' over any serious period of time. Now \n     the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote \n     will almost always carry the day, and it [will be] very \n     difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where \n     the spin is coming from or why.\n       When I later visited Obama's former campaign mastermind \n     David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian \n     vibe of an information space where old media structures and \n     hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires \n     who convinced the suckers that information was ``free'' and \n     everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a \n     former newspaperman, sighed. ``It's not as easy as standing \n     in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million \n     people like past presidents have been able to do,'' he said. \n     The bully pulpit by and large doesn't exist anymore, he \n     explained. ``So more and more, over the last couple of years, \n     there's been an investment in alternative means of \n     communication: using digital more effectively, going to \n     nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue \n     your constituencies are going to be found,'' he said. ``I \n     think they've approached these major foreign policy \n     challenges as campaign challenges, and they've run campaigns, \n     and [their] campaigns have been very sophisticated.''\n       Rhodes's innovative campaign to sell the Iran deal is \n     likely to be a model for how future administrations explain \n     foreign policy to the Congress--\n\n  Note that. The administration is going to have to campaign to the \nCongress--\n\n     and the public. The way in which most Americans have heard \n     the story of the Iran deal presented--that the Obama \n     administration began seriously engaging with the Iranian \n     officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new \n     political reality in Iran, which came about because of \n     elections that brought [so-called] moderates to power in that \n     country--[this story of 2013] was largely manufactured \n     [``manufactured'' is their verb] for the purpose of selling \n     the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, \n     the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to \n     take away from those particulars are often misleading [and] \n     false. Obama's closest advisers always understood him to be \n     eager [for] a deal with Iran [back in 2012] and even since \n     the beginning of his presidency. ``It's the center of the \n     arc,'' Rhodes explained to me two days after the deal, \n     officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \n     was implemented. He then checked off the ways in which the \n     administration's foreign policy aims and priorities converged \n     [in] Iran. ``We don't have to be [in the kind of] cycles of \n     conflict if we can find other ways to resolve these issues,'' \n     he said. ``We can do things that challenge the conventional \n     thinking that, you know, `AIPAC doesn't like this,' or `the \n     Israeli government doesn't like this,' or `the gulf countries \n     don't like it.' It's the possibility of improved relations \n     with adversaries. It's nonproliferation. So all these threads \n     that the president's been spinning--[and in this sense I \n     don't mean it] in the press sense [of spinning, spinning] for \n     almost a decade, they kind of all converged around Iran.''\n       In the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the ``story'' of the \n     Iran deal began in 2013, when a ``moderate'' faction inside \n     the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat a regime of \n     [so-called] ``hardliners'' in an election and then began to \n     pursue a policy of ``openness,'' which included a newfound \n     willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its [so-called] \n     nuclear weapons program. The president set out the timeline \n     himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, \n     2015, [President Obama]: ``Today, after two years of \n     negotiations, the United States, together with our \n     international partners, has achieved something that decades \n     of animosity has not.'' While the president's statement was \n     technically accurate--there had in fact been two years of \n     formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the \n     J.C.P.O.A.--it was also actively misleading, because the most \n     meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran [were from mid-\n     2012] many months before Rouhani and the ``moderate'' camp \n     were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by \n     Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah. . . . The idea that \n     there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the \n     Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for \n     the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, \n     and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-\n     minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their \n     neighbors and with America, Obama was [therefore] able to \n     evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but \n     clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that [the] \n     administration was making.\n\n  I want to repeat that sentence, by misleading the public on the date \non which negotiations began and therefore seizing upon this election \nthat happened a year later, ``Obama was able to evade what might have \notherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy \nchoices that [the] administration was making.''\n\n       By eliminating the fuss about Iran's nuclear program, the \n     administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural \n     tension between the two countries, which would create the \n     space for America to disentangle itself from its established \n     system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, \n     Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration \n     would effectively begin the process of a large-scale \n     disengagement from the Middle East.\n       The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to \n     Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month \n     period between July and September of last year, was located \n     inside the White House, and is referred to by its former \n     denizens as ``the war room.'' The White House Office of \n     Legislative Affairs helped run the team, which included three \n     to six people from each of several agencies . . . which were \n     the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to \n     the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), at times . . . the \n     Department of Defense and also the Department of Energy and \n     the National Security Council. Rhodes ``was kind of like the \n     quarterback,'' running the daily video conferences and coming \n     up with lines of attack and parry. ``He was extremely good \n     about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the \n     message out that just made more sense,'' [staff members \n     report]. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war \n     was Rhodes's go-to move--and proved to be a winning argument.\n\n  And just to be clear, that wasn't the choice. The choice wasn't \nbetween war and peace, and they knew it. They were spinning the public, \nthe press, and the Congress.\n\n       The person [credited] with running the digital side of the \n     campaign . . . the director of digital response for the White \n     House Office of Digital Strategy, . . . became known in the \n     war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal.\n\n  That is the Twitter handle.\n\n       Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response \n     account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran \n     deal. ``So, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal \n     is literally going to be the tip of everything we stand up \n     online,'' [we were told]. ``And we're going to map it onto \n     what we [already] know about the different audiences we're \n     dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, \n     Congress.'' By applying 21st century data and networking \n     tools to the white glove world of foreign affairs, the White \n     House was\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n     able to track what United States senators and the people who \n     worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing [at \n     different moments] online--and make sure that no potential \n     negative comment passed without a tweet.\n       As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by \n     how naive the assumption of a ``state of nature'' must seem \n     in an information environment that is mediated less and less \n     by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior \n     knowledge of the subjects they write about. ``People \n     construct their own sense of source and credibility now,'' \n     [the staffer told me]. ``They elect whoever they're going to \n     believe.'' For those in need of more traditional-seeming \n     forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey \n     Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped \n     retail the administration's narrative. ``Laura Rozen was my \n     RSS feed,'' [the staffer said]. ``She would just find \n     everything and retweet it.''\n       Rhodes's messaging campaign was so effective not simply \n     because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of \n     digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved \n     in guiding the deal itself.\n\n  In the interest of time, I am going to skip over a few paragraphs \nthat tell how Jake Sullivan and other administration players traveled \nto Oman to secretly meet with the Iranians in the summer of 2012.\n\n       The White House point person during the later stage of the \n     negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is \n     currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian \n     dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the \n     Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact \n     with Rhodes. ``I would often just call him and say, `Give me \n     a reality check,' '' Malley explained. ``He could say, `Here \n     is where I think the president is, and here is where he will \n     be.' '' He continued, ``Ben would try to anticipate: Does it \n     make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: \n     How do we sell it Congress? How do we sell it to the public? \n     What is it going to do to our narrative?''\n       Malley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art \n     of political communication; his father . . . who was born in \n     Cairo, edited [a] politics magazine . . . and proudly \n     provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the \n     days when the leaders' words might take [several] weeks to \n     travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. ``The Iran experience was \n     the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and \n     messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that \n     Ben is really at the intersection of all three. He reflects \n     and he shapes [all three] at the same time.''\n       As Malley and representatives of the State Department, \n     including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, \n     engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify \n     details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, \n     Rhodes's war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with \n     reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms-\n     control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social \n     media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-\n     clueless reporters. ``We created an echo chamber,'' he \n     admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of \n     freshly minted experts [who were] cheerleading for the deal. \n     [He continued:] ``They were saying things that validated what \n     we had given them to say.''\n       When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play \n     seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America's \n     future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. ``In the absence of \n     rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] \n     out of this,'' he said. ``We had test drives to know who was \n     going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to \n     use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and \n     whomever else [they needed to use]. So we knew the tactics \n     that worked'' [he said]. He is [very] proud of the way he \n     sold the Iran deal. ``We drove them crazy,'' he said of the \n     deal's opponents.\n       Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been \n     anything deceptive about the way the agreement itself was \n     sold. ``Look,'' [he said] ``with Iran, in a weird way, these \n     are state-to-state issues. They're agreements between \n     governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that \n     Rouhani and Zarif . . . are real reformers who are going to \n     be steering this country into the direction I believe it can \n     go in, because their public is educated and, in some \n     respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on [any of] \n     that.''\n\n  Do you all remember what we heard last summer when they were \ntestifying before us? We never heard this. We never heard this was the \nspin, but they didn't actually believe it. But now here, when the guy's \nthinking about his next step in life, we hear the real story. I will \ncontinue.\n\n       In fact, Rhodes's passion seems to derive not from any \n     investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or \n     centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the \n     future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are \n     matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it \n     derived from his own sense of urgency of radically \n     reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to \n     make the prospect of American involvement in the region's \n     future wars a lot less likely. When I asked him whether the \n     prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign \n     being run by a different administration is something that \n     scares him, he admitted that it does. ``I mean, I'd prefer a \n     sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of \n     Congress reflect and take a vote. . . . But that's \n     impossible'' [he concluded].\n\n  Mr. President, truth is bigger than talking points, and self-\ngovernment deserves more than spin. Does President Obama think there is \nsuch a thing as domestic propaganda? Does he think it is OK? Do we in \nthis Chamber think it is OK?\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/09/senate-section/article/S2652-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2:15 P.M.
