Madam President, this morning the Senate will complete \nwork on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and then we \nwill turn to Senator Collins' bill--commonsense legislation that will \nprotect our democracy from the egregious example of Executive overreach \nwe saw in November. In my view, this deserves broad support. Remember, \nPresident Obama said more than 20 times that he couldn't take those \nkinds of actions. He even referred to overreach such as that as \n``ignoring the law.'' So Senator Collins' measure simply takes the \nPresident at his word and helps him follow the law instead of ignoring \nit.\n  The Collins' bill also provides Democrats who led their constituents \nto believe they would address Executive overreach with a chance to show \nthey were at least a little bit serious when they said that. Democrats \nwon't achieve that by filibustering Homeland Security, and Democrats \nwon't achieve it by holding hypocritical press conferences just hours \nafter voting to block funding for DHS. But they can help us pass a \nsensible bill from Senator Collins that will hold the executive branch \nto account. After so many weeks of senseless filibustering, that is the \nleast these Democrats owe their constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1187-7", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are about 14 hours away from a shutdown \nof the Department of Homeland Security. The Senate will do its part \nthis morning and send the House a clean Homeland Security bill that \nfully funds the Department through the end of the year. It will stop a \ngovernment shutdown. Then the House must act, and it must act \nresponsibly. They must pass the Senate bill. We will not go to \nconference on some jerry-rigged situation they send back dealing with \nsomething they do not like about the President for whatever reason. We \nwill not pass any rider-laden monstrosity they send back to us.\n  The Senate is proving that there is broad bipartisan support for a \ngood, clean bill that will fund Homeland Security and keep that \ngovernment agency running. It would pass this House--this legislation \nwe are going to pass here in an hour or so--with broad bipartisan \nsupport if Speaker Boehner would simply allow a vote on it. If he \nallowed Democrats and Republicans to vote in the House, as has been \ndone for centuries, it would pass overwhelmingly. The only point of his \nwanting a conference would be to take a clean bill that would pass both \nHouses and turn it into something that can't pass anything.\n  This bill we will pass today is not just the Senate's product, it is \na bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. Last December the House \nand the Senate, in some very difficult negotiations, worked out an \nagreement where we would pass 13 funding bills as part of an omnibus \nspending bill. The House Republicans refused to pass the Homeland \nSecurity funding. We now have 12\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nof the 13 we agreed to done. They now have reneged on the deal to do \nthe 13th. This bicameral, bipartisan bill deserves a vote in the House. \nIt would pass, I repeat.\n  The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said this:\n\n       There's a clear majority in the Senate and the House to \n     pass this legislation.\n\n  You cannot govern by shutting down essential lifesaving departments \nof the Federal Government.\n  The junior Senator from Illinois said yesterday:\n\n       As a governing party, we've got to fund DHS and say to the \n     House, ``Here's a straw so you can suck it up.'' . . . this \n     battle should be the end of the strategy of attaching \n     whatever you're upset at the president [about] to a vital \n     piece of government.\n\n  Yesterday Congressman Peter King of New York put it more bluntly when \nhe said:\n\n       We can't allow DHS not [to] be funded. People think we're \n     crazy. There're terrorist attacks all over the world, and \n     we're talking about closing down Homeland Security. This is \n     like living in the world of the crazy people.\n\n  Congressman King went on to say:\n\n       I've had it with this self-righteous, delusional wing of \n     the party that leads us over the cliff. . . . It says a lot \n     about the party. It means trouble. How many times can we go \n     over the cliff and survive?\n\n  I agree with his sentiments. This isn't just about the Republican \nParty, this is about our country. How many times can House Republicans \nsend our Nation hurtling toward a cliff?\n  I listen very closely to the prayer virtually every day. Among other \nthings, the Senate Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black, said, in speaking to our \nHeavenly Father, ``Remind them that lawmakers can work miracles with \ncooperation but accomplish little with legislative brinksmanship.'' \nThat was in the prayer offered here this morning.\n  How many times can we narrowly avert catastrophe just so Republicans \nget a gold star from radical pundits? They need to do the right thing \nand pass the Senate's clean bill--pass it today and quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1188-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as the vice chair of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I rise to speak on the Homeland Security funding bill.\n  This morning the Senate moves to fulfill its responsibility--its \nnational responsibility--to pass the Homeland Security bill which would \nfully fund the Department through the fiscal year 2015. This fulfills a \nconstitutional oath we Senators took to protect and defend the \nConstitution and the people of the United States against all foes, \nforeign and domestic. The domestic is here today. The domestic is in \nhomeland security. The domestic is in what we need to do to fulfill our \nresponsibility. We take oaths to the Constitution. We say we want a \nconstitutionally driven government. So do I. We need to get off of our \npress releases and pass this bill.\n  I am really proud of the fact that we on the Committee on \nAppropriations did our job, and we did it in December. The subcommittee \nchairs of Homeland Security did their due diligence and came up with an \naffordable framework for funding the Homeland Security bill. It met the \nbottom line, met the budget caps, but also met our compelling national \nsecurity needs.\n  Congressman Hal Rogers in the House, for whom I have nothing but \ngreat respect, and I came to a fiscal agreement, but we did not have \nthe ability to move it forward because there were those who wanted to \ndelay putting it in the omnibus because they were having a temper \ntantrum with the President of the United States over his Executive \nauthority. Could he move his Executive authority on the topic of \nimmigration? So there was a solution to delay the funding so that we \ncould have cooler heads prevail: Oh golly, do it after the election. \nAnd once again we punted and delayed and parsed, punted and issued \npress releases. That is what we got out of the House and somewhat out \nof the Senate.\n  Where are we today? Thanks to the leadership of the two leaders, \nSenators McConnell and Reid, we have a path forward. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at this path. The significant part of it is to pass \na clean funding bill to make sure Homeland Security is funded the \nentire year so we can meet the needs of the national programs, such as \nthe Coast Guard, and make sure that grants go out to our first \nresponders, who are truly our boots on the ground, such as volunteer \nfire departments that right now are out there in some parts of our \ncommunities getting sick people out with snowmobiles. Senator Collins \nof Maine and I have talked about her Maine and my Garrett County, \nwhere, when we have had a hurricane, these people go and get elderly \npeople out on Zodiacs, sometimes wading through water and wondering if \nthey are going to step on power lines.\n  We have to get real here. There are those who want to increase \ndefense funding so we can protect America against ISIL. We protect \nAmerica from ISIL right here in this bill. You want to protect America, \nvote for the clean funding bill. You want to protect America's border, \nfight for the funding bill. You want to make sure we don't have illegal \naliens in this country, make sure you are funding the Border Patrol--\n23,000 people all in uniform out there on the border manning the best \ntechnology we can afford. So whatever we say we want to do, this is the \nway to do it. This is the way to do it.\n  We understand the Senate would also like to debate immigration. We \nrespect that viewpoint. We also respect that the matter that is of \nconcern about the President's Executive authority is going through the \ncourts. Don't punish the Border Patrol agent, don't punish the person \nworking in the Coast Guard out on an ice cutter, don't punish the \nvolunteer firefighter because you are angry at Obama. I say to my folks \non my side of the aisle, make sure we vote to pass a clean funding bill \nhere today. And I say also to the other side of the aisle to do it.\n  I really appreciate the fact that Senator Reid and Senator McConnell \nhave arrived at this parliamentary Senate vote to get us where we need \nto be going. But I say to my friends in the House, to delay this 3 more \nweeks is reckless and it is dangerous. What are we going to know? We \nare waiting for the courts to decide? Who knows when the courts will \ndecide. What we do know is not what the courts will decide, but we know \nwe have a legal process. A judge has made a decision. It will go \nthrough the court of appeals, maybe even to the Supreme Court. Let the \ncourt follow its process. But in the meantime, while the courts are \ndoing their job, can we at least get around to doing our job so that \nthe men and women who provide for us and fight every day, whether it is \nthe local volunteer fire department or our Secret Service, our Coast \nGuard, or those working in cyber security--and the Director of National \nIntelligence, Director Clapper, says cyber security is a bigger threat \nthan ISIL--can do theirs?\n  So let's get on with it, and let's fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibility when we said we take the oath to protect America against \nall enemies, foreign and domestic.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to stripping \noff all of the House language from the Homeland Security funding bill \nand proceeding with a ``clean bill.''\n  I do so because I took a constitutional oath, and I take that oath \nvery seriously. The language which we are debating in the Homeland \nSecurity funding bill from the House goes directly to that oath and \ngoes directly to that responsibility. It does so for two reasons.\n  First of all, this Executive amnesty, which has about 5 million \nillegal aliens getting blanket significant amnesty because of the \nPresident's Executive action, is a big deal. It is a big deal in terms \nof policy. It is a big deal regarding his overreaching his legal and \nconstitutional authority.\n  First, policy. It is a fundamental rule of economics--it is a \nfundamental rule of life--that when you reward behavior, you get more \nof it. When you penalize certain behavior, you get less of it.\n  A blanket overarching amnesty which gives about 5 million illegal \naliens in the country here amnesty is rewarding behavior. It is \nrewarding behavior we say we want to curtail, we say we want to stop, \nbut we are rewarding it, and we are going to get more of it. That is \nnot just me saying that theoretically. We have lived that over and over \nagain.\n  The President a few years ago took a similar but smaller Executive \naction commonly referred to as DACA. That focused on younger illegal \naliens. Guess what. Soon after that action, a wave of new young illegal \nminors, unaccompanied minors, started coming into this country in \nnumbers like we had never seen before.\n  Does anyone think that was unrelated? Does anyone think that timing \nwas just coincidence? Of course it wasn't. The President rewarded \nillegal crossings and--surprise, surprise--he got a whole lot more of \nthem in exactly the class--younger, illegal, unaccompanied minors--that \nhe had acted on through DACA.\n  So this is going to happen again on a much larger scale. We are going \nto grow the problem through this policy, not get control of it.\n  The second concern I have is even far more fundamental, because it \ngoes to his constitutional power and authority, and the fact that he is \ngoing well beyond that constitutional power and authority, I think, \nclearly.\n  Presidents have significant authority. They are the Executive. They \nneed to execute the law. In executing the law, they often have to fill \nin the blanks, fill in the details that Congress has not fully \nprovided. But that is very different from acting contrary to the law--\n180 degrees contrary to statutory law--and that is what the President \nis doing in this instance. No President has that authority. If they \nwant to do that, they need to change the law. As every schoolkid knows, \nthat goes through Congress, and then the President obviously has a role \nin terms of a veto. But the President doesn't want to do that. He can't \ndo that. Congress disagrees with him. So he is just changing the law \nwith the stroke of a pen. That is what is clearly illegal and \nunconstitutional, because he is acting contrary to statutory law.\n  Some of his apologists--including Loretta Lynch, for example--say: \nWell, every President can set prosecution priorities. We are simply \nsetting priorities. We are simply saying this class of folks is not a \npriority for legal action, deportation prosecution.\n  I asked Ms. Lynch directly after she said that: Isn't it true the \nPresident is going beyond that? Isn't it true he is giving this entire \nclass of illegal aliens a new legal status? She had no substantive \nresponse.\n  I said: Isn't it true the President is going beyond that? He is \ncreating a new document out of thin air, with ``work permit'' at the \ntop, and handing it to these illegal aliens and suggesting they now \nhave a right to work legally in this country, even though statutory law \nmakes it crystal clear they do not. She had no substantive answer to \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues not to strip out this important House language. \nThe President's action is bad policy that will grow the illegal \nimmigration problem, and it is acting clearly beyond his legal \nconstitutional authority.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this morning we have the opportunity to \naccomplish two important goals.\n  First, we can pass legislation which will fully fund the Department \nof Homeland Security so it can perform its vital mission.\n  Second, we have the opportunity to stand up for our constitutional \nsystem of separation of powers.\n  I support and voted for comprehensive immigration reform. But the \nPresident's overreach usurps the role of Congress and undermines our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances.\n  The failure of Congress to pass a law to the President's liking \ncannot become an excuse for the President to usurp the powers of the \nlegislative branch.\n  The President knows he lacks the authority to write the law. He has \nsaid so 22 times, on 22 different occasions.\n  Allow me to describe my bill very briefly. Specifically, it does four \nthings.\n  First, it bars the administration from using funds to implement the \nimmigration orders issued by the President in November of last year.\n  Second, it has absolutely no effect on the much more constrained and \nlimited Executive orders the President issued in 2012, the so-called \nDACA Program that protects the DREAMers, to whom I am very sympathetic.\n  Third, it directs the Department to give the highest enforcement \npriority to the deportation of foreign nationals in our country \nillegally who have been convicted of domestic violence, child abuse, \nexploitation, or a sex crime. Why would we want to keep in this country \nsomeone who is deportable who is a sex offender, who has been convicted \nof child molestation or domestic violence? It makes no sense.\n  Ironically, just this week the Senate Judiciary Committee held an \nexcellent hearing on sex trafficking. We heard heartbreaking stories of \nvery young girls who had been abused by men. If there are foreign \nnationals in this country who have been convicted of these crimes, they \nshould be deported.\n  And, fourth, it includes a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the \nexecutive branch should not act to give foreign nationals who are here \nillegally an edge in competing for jobs against American citizens or \nlegal residents with green cards.\n  The Founders gave us a system of separation of powers and checks and \nbalances not to tear us apart but to pull us together. They gave us no \nshortcuts on purpose.\n  The President's November 2014 Executive actions are ill-advised \nprecisely because they attempt to shortcut the process by usurping \nCongress's authority to pass legislation.\n  My legislation would block that effort without in any way altering or \ndiminishing the more constrained and important 2012 DACA Program.\n  I want to see the Department of Homeland Security fully funded. It \nhas an absolutely vital mission at a time when our country faces \nnumerous threats.\n  I urge my colleagues this morning both to vote for the clean DHS bill \nand for my legislation to stand up for the role of Congress in our \nconstitutional system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining on the Democratic \nside.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me say at the outset Senator Collins \nis my friend and colleague, and we have worked on many things together. \nI respect her especially because the Department of Homeland Security \nwas literally her creation, along with Senator Lieberman and others.\n  The fact that we have now agreed on a bipartisan basis to set aside \nthis immigration debate and to fully fund this critical Department is \nthe right thing to do. A 98-to-2 vote is unusual on the Senate floor. \nIt reflects the fact that we finally reached that consensus on funding \nthe Department of Homeland Security. I hope our vote later today also \nreflects that. But I do take exception to some of the statements she \nhas made about her own measure which she is offering.\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\n  First I would like to invite her--and I am sure she has been there a \nthousand times--to walk down this corridor and look up the staircase to \nthe painting, a painting that shows Abraham Lincoln with his Cabinet. \nIt is the moment when he signed an Executive order. President Lincoln \nsigned an Executive order, and with that Executive order 152 years ago, \nthe Emancipation Proclamation freed 3 million slaves in the United \nStates of America.\n  Barack Obama is not the first President to issue an Executive order \nnor is he the first President to issue one which affects millions of \npeople. Which President held the record for an Executive order giving \nrights to 1.5 million immigrants in this country before Barack Obama? \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. In fact, virtually every President since \nEisenhower has issued an Executive order relative to immigration. Now \nwe didn't see Republican hair on fire when it was being done by \nPresident George W. Bush or George Herbert Walker Bush. It is only when \nBarack Obama does it that they scream and rage it is unconstitutional. \nYet let's look at the argument they are making.\n  Senator Collins is making the argument that the Executive order \nsigned by President Obama, known as DACA, that affected children who \nmight qualify under the DREAM Act and could protect up to 2 million \nyoung people in America, was legal. I agree. She says her bill that she \nis offering today reflects that.\n  Then she says that 2 years later, when the President issued an \nExecutive order that could protect on a temporary basis up to 5 \nmillion, that was clearly unconstitutional. What is the difference? \nWell, it is a difference the courts will have to try to resolve. I \nthink we ought to think twice before we try to defund or repeal the \nPresident's Executive orders of November 2014.\n  President Obama makes it clear that if you are the parent of an \nAmerican citizen child or a legal resident alien child, you have to \ncome forward, pay a filing fee, submit your name for a criminal \nbackground check, and if you have a bad criminal record, you are gone. \nIf your record clears and you have no criminal history to be concerned \nabout, then you can work in the United States on a temporary basis for \n2 years. That is it. It doesn't give you permanent citizenship or legal \nstatus beyond that.\n\n  Isn't it better that our country be safe enough to know that these \nmillions of people are no threat to us, where they live, who they work \nfor? I think that makes sense.\n  It is a shame Congress hasn't done it. We can still do it, and I hope \nwe will. But the Collins approach, sadly, is going to deny that, and it \nis going to say, frankly, that the priorities currently set for \ndeportation of dangerous people will be swept away but for the \nspecified crimes which she includes in her bill.\n  I will state that the President's Executive order already covers \nevery one of those offenses--every one of those felonies. So Ms. \nCollins is not adding anything to the debate. I know that the Senator \noffered this in good faith, and I believe she can be an important part \nin finding a bipartisan solution to the immigration question. But I \nurge my colleagues to reject the Collins bill that comes before us \ntoday. It was a bill crafted in the House of Representatives in anger \nover the President's Executive order. It does not protect DACA and the \nDREAMers, and that is why the immigration groups to a person have come \nout against the Collins amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against the measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 68, the nays are \n31.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Cloture having been invoked, the motion to commit falls as \ninconsistent with cloture.\n  Under the previous order, all postcloture time is yielded back with \nthe exception of 10 minutes for the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, or his \ndesignee.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, in November 2014, the President of the \nUnited States issued a series of Executive orders effectively granting \namnesty to millions of people who were in the United States unlawfully, \noutside of what our laws allow--laws passed by Congress and signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States.\n  In other words, under article I, section 8, we, as a Congress, are \ngiven power to establish a uniform system of laws governing immigration \nand naturalization. If our laws allow someone to come in, they may come \nin, but if they do not, then those people need to make sure they go \nabout getting into the country legally and lawfully.\n  If and when the President of the United States, or anyone else for \nthat matter, thinks these laws are inadequate, there is a way to change \nthem. The way to change them is to go back to the Congress of the \nUnited States, go back to the lawmaking body, go back to that entity \nrecognized in article I, section 1 of the Constitution, to the very \nfirst substantive line which says, ``All legislative Powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall \nconsist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''\n\n  Unfortunately, the President of the United States chose not to change \nthe\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\nlaw that way. Unfortunately, the President of the United States, \ncontradicting his own prior statements, chose to take Executive action \nto legalize millions of people currently in the United States \nillegally.\n  Ultimately, this is an issue that ought to be of concern to every one \nof us. It is an issue that is neither Republican nor Democratic. It is \nneither liberal nor conservative. It is simply an American issue. It is \nsimply an issue that flows from the rule of law, flows from the notion \nthat ours is a system that runs under the rule of law and not under the \nrule of individuals.\n  There is a means by which we as a Congress can resist the \nencroachments of an overreaching Chief Executive. It is the same means \nidentified by James Madison in the Federalist papers, and that means \ninvolves the use of the power of the purse.\n  Congress, of course, funds the operations of the Federal Government. \nThe President of the United States cannot do that all on his own. So \nshould we choose to do so, as Congress has chosen to do on so many \nother occasions--when we see something within the government, whether \nimplemented legally at the outset or not, when we see something we \ndon't like, we can choose not to fund that.\n  We have, over the last few weeks, tried to do precisely that in \nresponse to this Executive action. One month ago the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bill to keep the Department of Homeland \nSecurity funded, with the understanding that at midnight tonight that \nfunding stream would expire. At the time the House of Representatives \npassed that legislation, the House of Representatives--a body most \naccountable to the people at the most frequent intervals--made a \ndecision. They said, We are going to keep everything else within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funded, and the House of \nRepresentatives said, We will, however, direct the Department of \nHomeland Security not to spend any money implementing certain Executive \norders issued by the President, in November 2014 and previously, \ndealing with Executive amnesty.\n  The Senate has been trying to proceed to that bill for nearly 4 \nweeks. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nrefused to allow us to proceed to that bill. They have blocked our \nattempts. They have engaged in obstruction and they have not allowed us \nto proceed to it. Why? Because they didn't like that appropriations \nrider. They didn't like that spending restriction. Apparently, they do \nnot think we should be exercising that power described by James Madison \nand foreseen by our Founding Fathers as that last great protection \nagainst an overreaching Executive. So they refused to allow us to get \nonto the bill.\n  As we are on the verge of getting on the bill--as we are just getting \nonto the bill--all of a sudden, they say, OK, we are OK with doing this \nas long as we are the only ones who get to offer amendments, as long as \nwe get our amendment--the amendment that strips out all of the spending \nlimitation language in the House-passed bill. We are OK with it as long \nas we, the Democrats, get our amendment, but no Republican gets his or \nher amendment. That isn't fair.\n  I wish to make clear that those of us who are supporting this have \nnot objected to the running of the time. Those of us who are supporting \nthis have not objected to anyone else getting amendments. Those of us \nwho are supporting this simply want a vote. We want a vote on a product \nthat is even narrower than what was sent over from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In a moment I will be calling up my amendment No. 265 and I will be \nasking this body to consider it and vote on it. What it says is that we \nwill not allow the Department of Homeland Security to spend any money \non implementing the November 2014 Executive amnesty Executive order. \nThat is what we are trying to do. In the event it is objected to, then \nI will be moving to table the procedural mechanism by which other \namendments are being blocked.\n  I implore all of my colleagues to remember themselves as operating \nwithin the constitutional framework, in which, far more than our status \nas Democrat or Republican, as liberal or conservative, we are here to \ndefend our own power, our own authority that we have been given by our \nown people.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up my amendment No. 265.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 258\n\n  Mr. LEE.

Madam President, I rise for a minute to talk about trade \nbetween the United States and our trading partners around the world.\n  To make the point of my remarks, I ask rhetorically for everybody in \nthe auditorium and the Senate Chamber to answer these questions:\n  Are you willing to cut American sales of goods and services by over \n$2 trillion?\n  I think the answer would be a resounding no.\n  Secondly, are you ready to diminish or lose 39.8 million jobs?\n  Nobody in here wants to give up $2.3 trillion in American business, \nand everybody wants more jobs in the middle class, and nobody wants to \ncost America 39 million jobs. But that is exactly what is going to \nhappen if we don't pass TPA, if we don't enter into trade agreements \nand aggressively work to make the three pending trade agreements the \nUnited States has workable for our country.\n  Yesterday I listened as Members of this body came to the floor to \ntalk against trade and talk against the trade promotion authority. For \nthe benefit of our new Members, trade promotion authority is our \nauthorization to give the President the parameters, the limitations, \nand the prerogative to negotiate trade agreements, which come back to \nus for a final ratification up or down. That is a good way to do \nbusiness. The world recognizes that if our President has trade \npromotion authority, he can sit down across the table from them and he \ncan make a deal, and it is only subject to one vote of the U.S. Senate. \nIf we leave it as it is now, where there is no trade promotion \nauthority, then we can vote on every amendment, every prerogative, \nevery limitation, every opportunity, and make negotiations for the \nadministration and our country impossible.\n  We have three pending agreements before the United States of America: \nfirst, the trade promotion authority for the President; second, the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, which expires in September of this \nyear; next is the trade and investment partnership with Europe; and \nlastly is the transpacific trade agreement with the Pacific Rim. All \nthree of those agreements are important for us to negotiate and close \nthe deal on. Yet, without passing TPA, we can do none.\n  Ambassador Froman and the administration are doing an outstanding job \nof representing the United States. I have traveled with him to the \nAfrican Union in Africa to work on the goal. I was with him yesterday \nafternoon. I talked with him about some of the obstacles we have in \nterms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and I have talked to him about \nthe transatlantic trade and promotion act--all of which we need to pass \nand all of which he needs to be able to negotiate. But without TPA, the \nUnited States of America is sitting at the table but they can't make a \ndeal, and the President doesn't have the authority that he needs and \nthat he says he wants.\n  Most of the opposition I have heard on the floor of the Senate comes \nfrom the people in the President's own party. In the last two State of \nthe Union Addresses, the President of the United States has underlined \nthe importance of TPA. He said it again this year. But yesterday seven \nMembers of his party came to the floor to talk against trade promotion \nauthority.\n  It is time for us to sit around the table and talk about $2.3 \ntrillion in business for our country and 39.8 million jobs in our \ncountry. Let's talk about how we can increase those jobs. In my State \nof Georgia, 1.2 million jobs are directly export-related. The Congress \nof the United States appropriated $706 million over the next 6 years \nfor the deepening and expansion of the Savannah Harbor in Savannah, GA. \nThe Panama Canal is being widened and next year will open to the ships \nof the 21st century. Are they going to go somewhere else if we don't do \ntrade promotion authority? Probably so. We all saw what happened last \nweek when the west coast shut down because of the longshoremen's strike \nand what an impact it had on our economy. That is the kind of impact we \nare going to have if we don't do trade promotion authority for the \nPresident.\n  It is ironic that almost unanimously the Republican Members of the \nSenate are for trade promotion authority, and it appears, after \nyesterday's speeches, that a significant majority of the Democratic \nParty is against it. Yet their President is for it.\n  All of us are for jobs. All of us are for business. All of us are for \neconomic activity. It is time we put our differences aside and \ndelineate for the President of the United States the negotiating \nparameters, the negotiating authority, and the ability we grant to him \nto make deals in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic \nTrade and Investment Partnership and the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct. All three will mean jobs not just for my State of Georgia but for \nour country. All three will be good for our national defense and our \nsecurity. People don't tend to fight with or bomb people with whom they \ndo business. The more trade agreements we have, the more business we \nshare, the more exchanges of our currency and economic prosperity, the \nbetter off our country is, the better off our security is, and the \nbetter off are jobs for those in the middle class.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak from the \nfloor, and I encourage all my Members in the Senate, Republican and \nDemocrat alike, to dedicate themselves when we come back to \nexpeditiously bringing up trade promotion authority, delineating our \ndifferences, negotiating those differences, and giving our President \nthe opportunity to create more jobs for America, more jobs for Georgia, \nmore jobs for West Virginia, and more jobs for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1193-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1193-S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING FATHER THEODORE HESBURGH\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, back in 1973 a young man caught a \nlucky break that changed his life. That young man was I, and it was my \nacceptance letter to the University of Notre Dame that opened up the \ngates of opportunity for me.\n  Last night, the beloved president emeritus of Notre Dame, Father \nTheodore Hesburgh, passed away at the age of 97. On his last day, \nFather Ted said Mass in the morning and passed away 12 hours later. He \ncounseled Presidents and Popes, but he was first and foremost a \npriest--one who ministered to the homeless, the poor, and those in \nneed--and that is when he was also the happiest.\n  We were so lucky to have him touch our lives, and those of us in \nIndiana were fortunate enough to experience him as our friend and \nneighbor. Nobody who ever walked the streets of South Bend could forget \nFather Ted driving around in his little Ford Mustang, giving a wave to \neverybody he saw.\n  Our country and the world is a better place because of Father Ted. He \nloved his God, his country, and Notre Dame, and he ministered to anyone \nwho asked him for help.\n  Father Hesburgh grew up near Syracuse, NY, and was ordained and \nbecame a priest in 1943. He promptly asked that his first assignment as \na priest be as the chaplain of a naval aircraft carrier. The leaders of \nthe Holy Cross religious order were not surprised, as they knew of \nFather Ted's great patriotism, his love of the U.S. Navy, and his \ndevotion to our servicemembers. However, they asked him to stay at \nNotre Dame and minister to the families and servicemembers who were \ntraining at the time at Vetville at Notre Dame. As always, Father Ted \nsmiled, took the assignment, and worked nonstop. That began a journey \nthat included the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold \nMedal, 16 Presidential appointments, and 150 honorary degrees. But more \nimportant to Father\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nTed than all of these awards were the millions of souls he nourished, \nsaid Mass with, prayed for, and guided to a wonderful life.\n  When we look at Father Ted's amazing accomplishments at Notre Dame, \nwe can't help but see what a stronger academic institution and better \nand more inclusive place it has become and that he left behind. Father \nTed broke down the barriers and admitted women to Notre Dame back in \nthe early 1970s, which changed the place forever and made Notre Dame a \nhome for everyone. My wife and daughter, both of whom graduated from \nthe university, were direct beneficiaries of his wisdom and his vision.\n  Father Hesburgh stood up to Presidents whenever necessary, stood \ntogether with Martin Luther King for civil rights, and ministered to \nthose in poverty and need every chance he could.\n  Father Ted never gave a second thought about preaching truth to \npower; it helped to define who he was. We marked 50 years last July \nsince he linked arms with Martin Luther King, Jr., in Soldier Field, \nChicago, and sang ``We Shall Overcome'' when others turned down the \ninvitation to be there. Father Ted believed in doing what was right, \nnot what was easy. Next week I will travel to Selma for the 50th \nanniversary of the start of the marches there, and I will take Father \nTed's example with me on that journey.\n  He expected doing what is right and not what is easy or popular from \nhis students as well. He had a big heart, and he wanted his students to \ndo their best, but a lack of effort was never an acceptable way of \ndoing business with Father Ted. As a student, I remember seeing his \nlight on in his little dorm room with his iron cot at midnight or 2 \na.m. Every student there knew that meant Father Ted was open for \nbusiness. Students would stop by and seek a comforting word if a parent \nhad just passed away or when worried about ``How am I ever going to be \nable to pay the next tuition bill?'' or when they looked at their grade \npoint average and said ``How am I ever going to be here for other \nreasons next semester?'' or if they had personal heartbreaks. Father \nTed was there for all of us to talk with. He wanted every student to \nknow they were loved and cared about and special, just like the cooks \nand gardeners and professors and the people of Notre Dame he went up \nto, shook hands with, smiled at, and gave encouragement to every day.\n  God bless you, Father Ted. I would never be here in the Senate \nwithout your kindness and your example. And there are Domers--as Notre \nDame students are known--all over the world who know you helped give \nthem the chance to open doors, to be given opportunities, and to have a \nbetter life that never would have happened without you.\n  There is a saying on the door of the Sacred Heart Basilica at the \nUniversity. It says, ``God, Country, Notre Dame.'' Father Hesburgh \nlived that every day.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1194-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1194-S1195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               VENEZUELA\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I want to speak about the ongoing crisis \nin Venezuela--something that doesn't capture a lot of attention in the \nheadlines because we have situations going on in the Middle East, as we \nhave seen the horrifying reality of what ISIS is doing, just this week \nkidnapping more Christians.\n  As we look at that situation in the Middle East, we should remind \nourselves that there is a sectarian component to this that extends \nbeyond ISIS's desire to convert the entire region to their version of \nradical Sunni Islam, but it also includes driving out all the \nChristians from the Middle East, and that is why they are specifically \nbeing targeted for brutalization. We have seen it again this week, and \nour heart breaks; and it should move us to move even faster in our \nefforts to destroy them. We can do this.\n  I also know the world's attention is being paid to Ukraine where a \ndelicate ceasefire is being violated by Russians, both Russian regular \ntroops, by the way, who make incursions into Ukraine to fight side by \nside with rebel forces against the central government of Kiev, but also \nthe weaponry that they continue to harm them with and the heavy \nshelling that at times comes across the border from Russia into \nUkraine.\n  These are significant issues we are being confronted with, and I \nunderstand why our attention is being paid to these things. But there \nis something happening in our own hemisphere that is not getting our \nattention, and I hope to use a few moments on the floor of the Senate \nto call attention to it, and that is the horrifying human rights \ncatastrophe of Venezuela.\n  Venezuela is a rich country--rich in oil and rich in people. Its \npeople are well-educated, hard-working, talented. It is the cradle of \ndemocracy in Latin America and in the Western Hemisphere; but over the \nlast 3 years especially it has spiraled downward and out of control.\n  A once rich and prosperous nation has shortages of everyday goods \nfrom toilet paper to soap, with people having to wait in long lines. \nThere is no U.S. embargo in Venezuela. There are no economic sanctions \non Venezuela that they can blame on us or anyone else. It is due simply \nand entirely to the mismanagement and incompetence of Nicolas Maduro, \nthe clown who runs that country, and the thugs who surround him in his \ngangster-style government.\n  Venezuela ostensibly portrays itself as a democracy but in reality it \nis not. The court system is completely controlled by the government of \nMaduro. The elections are constantly manipulated by Maduro. There is no \nfreedom of the press. For example, the government gets unlimited hours \nto talk on television about whatever they want, and the opposition gets \nvirtually none. Newspapers that oppose the government find that they \ncannot import newsprint--the actual paper--so they can't print. Other \nmedia outlets have been either bought or the owners have been forced \nout of the country and been bought and turned over to owners more \nfriendly to the government. The point is Venezuela is not a democracy, \nor is a democracy in name only.\n  Beyond that, it is a government that is losing control and for the \nfirst time a few weeks ago or months ago authorized the National Guard \nto use deadly force on protesters. So it should not surprise us that \nearlier this week a young man--a high school student--was shot and \nkilled in one of those protests, and we should expect to see more of \nthis in the days and weeks to come, unfortunately. I hope I am wrong \nand pray that I am wrong, but I believe that is where they are headed, \nbecause there is no way out of this mess for the government.\n  In fact, their situation is so dire that one of the things that has \nallowed them to keep the elite on the side of Maduro is the gas \nsubsidy. Gasoline is very cheap in Venezuela because it is subsidized \nby the government. I predict over the next few weeks or months the \nVenezuelan Government is going to have to go to the people and say we \nhave to take away the subsidy. And when that happens, Maduro may lose \nthe support that is even around him. That is why he is being so careful \nabout announcing it, but they are going to have to do it. There are no \nifs, ands, or buts about it. And when they do, it could quickly spiral \nout of control as well.\n  There are reports of coup attempts internally, with some of the \nmilitary starting to bristle at the heavy-handedness of this government \nthere, and that is something worth watching. The point is Venezuela is \nspiraling out of control. We need to pay attention to this because it \nis happening in our own hemisphere. It is happening in our own \nbackyard. It has the ability and the potential not just to dramatically \nimpact the people of Venezuela, but the countries of the region and \neven our own. I don't think enough attention is being paid to this, \nwhile every single day the brutality continues.\n  I called attention to this for the first time last year in February \nwhen the first wave of protests happened. We worked diligently to try \nto achieve sanctions on the individuals responsible for these human \nrights violations. Thanks to my colleagues here who were able to pass a \nbill that authorized the administration to impose sanctions\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\non individuals in Venezuela responsible for human rights violations. To \ndate the administration has imposed visa bans on some of these \nindividuals, but they have not taken the next step of economic \nsanctions on the people responsible for these human rights violations.\n  A few weeks ago I wrote the President a letter asking him, please \nbegin to use this tool against those who are violating the human rights \nof the people of Venezuela. He has yet to do so. So I once again renew \nthat call: Please impose these sanctions on the human rights violators \nin Venezuela.\n  I hope I can use these moments to describe to people what I am \nhearing from people inside Venezuela and the expat community in \nFlorida. They feel as though no one is paying attention. They feel as \nthough they have been abandoned. They feel as though they are alone. \nEvery single day the news leads off with all these things happening \naround the world--and they are worried about these things, too--but \nthey feel as though no one is speaking out for them. They feel \nabandoned by all the other nations in the region.\n  Where are all the governments of the Western Hemisphere? Where are \nall the other countries that are neighbors to Venezuela? Where is the \nOrganization of American States? What is the point of even having that \norganization if it can't serve as an institution and a forum for \ncondemning this sort of activity? Where are all the democracies of \nLatin America and the Western Hemisphere? Why are they not speaking out \nand condemning what is happening here?\n  It is interesting, we sent a couple of Guantanamo detainees to \nUruguay and the Uruguayan Government says they are asylum seekers, that \nthey are refugees--basically implying they are refugees to American \noppression. They have no qualms whatsoever about speaking out against \nthe United States for putting in jail enemy combatants and terrorists \nresponsible for the murder of Americans, responsible for acts of \nterrorism, responsible for supporting the Taliban. They have no problem \ncondemning us, claiming that the people we released to them--which we \nshould never have done--are refugees and asylum seekers, but they are \nsilent and say nothing when it comes to what is happening in Venezuela. \nThe hypocrisy of it is unbelievable.\n  I challenge the heads of state of the countries of Latin America to \nspeak out. The only problem is they are going to turn back around and \nsay, Where is your head of state? Why isn't your President speaking out \nabout it? The answer is, I don't know. I am grateful that he signed \nthat bill. It is time to put it in effect. It is time to begin to use \nthe tools in those sanctions to go after these individuals, but I wish \nthe White House and the President would more forcefully and more \nconsistently speak out against these human rights violations that are \noccurring.\n  When you think about it, why are the people of Venezuela feeling \nabandoned? They look to us. They see America as the beacon of hope. We \nare supposed to be the premier defender of human rights and freedom and \ndemocracy on the planet; and instead, from the White House and the \nPresident, there is silence. There is silence.\n\n  We cannot lose that aspect of our foreign policy. I understand that \nreality has a significant role to play in foreign policy, the balancing \nof different considerations; but morality and human rights must always \nbe a key cornerstone of where we stand on issues of global affairs. If \nwe lose that, if we lose the moral authority of this Nation, we lose \nour standing as a beacon of hope and freedom to people all over the \nworld.\n  I know sometimes we read newspaper articles and these leaders \ncriticize us. But I hope it is understood that although people may talk \nbadly about America, even in places where there might be some \nresentment about America, at its core people admire America. They \nadmire us because they know someone from there who came here and was \nable to achieve things they never could have done in their own \nhomeland. They admire us because every time there is an earthquake, \nAmericans are the first ones there. Every time there is a flood, \nAmericans are the first ones to respond. Every time there is hunger or \nsuffering, it is American charities and the American Government first \non the scene. They remember that and they admire it and they admire us \nfor it.\n  They admire our freedoms. They admire our democracy. They admire the \nfact that I am able to stand here on the floor today and criticize the \nPresident of the United States and there isn't some police officer \noutside that door ready to handcuff me and take me to jail.\n  Meanwhile, in Venezuela, just this week a member of their legislative \nbranch was ousted. Do you know why they kicked him out? So he could \nlose his legislative immunity and they could arrest him. Two weeks ago \narmed agents stormed the office of a mayor, fired shots in the air to \ndisperse crowds and arrested by force a member of the opposition \nparty--a mayor. This is happening in our own hemisphere and this is \nhappening in the 21st century. It was just two decades ago that the \nWestern Hemisphere was full of dictators, rightwing and leftwing, \nstrong men who controlled and oppressed their people. We paid a \nterrible price for that in this hemisphere and in this country. Then \nthere was this opening of democratic progress in the region. Now it is \nstarting to erode and we are standing by and saying nothing about it, \nas if it doesn't even exist.\n  You see it eroding in Nicaragua where the Sandinistas are back in \ncharge. They won an election and then they used that power to erode \ndemocracy. You see it in Bolivia, you see it in Ecuador. You even see \nhints of it in Argentina. And you really see it in Venezuela.\n  By the way, let me point out one more thing. Today, even as I speak \nto you, Cuban agents are here negotiating. I say Cuban agents. They \ndress as diplomats and act as diplomats, but in fact they are spies. In \nfact, the chief negotiator for the Cubans in these talks they are \nhaving with the State Department, Josefina Vidal, was asked to leave \nthis country with her husband because her husband was an intelligence \nofficer and she is known to be one as well. But these Cuban spies are \nhere to negotiate with the State Department. They send spies. We send \ndiplomats.\n  Let's not forget who has taught the Venezuelan Government these \ntactics of oppression, these violent tactics, these ways to crack down \non society. Let's not forget who has coached them. Let's not forget \nthere are thousands of Cuban agents working in the Government of \nVenezuela right now. Let's not forget there are thousands of Cuban \nagents infiltrated in the Armed Forces--not infiltrated, they are \nopenly in the Armed Forces of Venezuela right now.\n  Let's not forget that in Venezuela, Maduro, and before him Chavez, \nousted the sovereignty of Venezuela to the Castros. Let's not forget \nwho the source of all of this in Venezuela truly was--who coached them, \nwho taught them, who supported them, who provided personnel for them to \ncarry this out. It is Cuba, a nation that is a global sponsor of \nterrorism, because they harbor fugitives from American justice, because \nthey helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions openly and nothing \nhappened. Now the State Department is thinking about removing them from \nthe list of sponsors of terrorism--one concession after another.\n  But, anyway, on the issue of Venezuela, I hope we will pay more \nattention to it, because there are people right now suffering--not just \neconomically but politically and physically at the hands of a brutal \nregime. They are looking to America and its leaders to speak clearly \nthat we are on their side, that we will speak out for them, that we \nwill stand for them, and we will use the power of this government to go \nafter and punish those who are committing these crimes against them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

A majority of the Senate has \nvoted repeatedly over the last few weeks to advance legislation that \nwould, if enacted, prohibit the Department from implementing the \npolicies reflected in those memoranda. I and my colleagues in the \nmajority who voted to fund the Department today did so to avoid a \nshutdown of its operations, many of which are necessary to safeguard \nour Nation. In voting to fund the Department, we were also mindful of \nthe fact that the policies and directives that are embodied in these \nmemoranda, and to which we object, are the subject of a preliminary \ninjunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof Texas, which is preventing the Department from implementing them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1196-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ARLENE AND ALAN ALDA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Marcelle and I met Arlene and Alan Alda \non a trip with Senator Lloyd Bentsen. We had dinner together but I had \na chance to talk to Alan Alda about our mutual Italian heritage. Later \nI told my Italian-American mother how nice a couple they were. She \nsaid, basically, what would I expect? With an Italian background, they \nwould have to be nice.\n  The New York Times recently ran an article about this remarkable \ncouple, focusing on her prolific writing, and his acting and writing, \nbut especially their ability to maintain a wonderful marriage and a \nsense of life. I wanted to make sure my fellow Senators and anybody \nelse who reads the Congressional Record would read this profile. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article from the \nNew York Times entitled ``There's Always Room for Rum Cake.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 2015]\n\n                    There's Always Room for Rum Cake\n\n                         (By Lois Smith Brady)\n\n       Arlene Alda, 81, and her husband, the actor Alan Alda, 79, \n     say that one secret to a long-lasting marriage (theirs has \n     been going for almost 58 years) is forgetfulness, which comes \n     naturally to them at this point.\n       The Aldas, who discussed their decades together by \n     telephone, with Ms. Alda also weighing in later by email, \n     haven't had a serious argument for the last 20 years, she \n     said, primarily because they can no longer remember for very \n     long whether they are angry with each other or why.\n       ``I have a short memory, and so does he,'' Ms. Alda said. \n     ``Was that always true? I don't recall.''\n       Both emanate warmth and thoughtfulness in the way of \n     beloved English professors or concerned therapists. Mr. Alda, \n     whose career in television and theater has been as remarkably \n     durable as his marriage, and Ms. Alda, a writer and \n     photographer, possess laughs that are like old jeans: \n     comfortable and well used.\n       Ms. Alda said that laughter is ``the real glue that keeps \n     us happily and willingly stuck together.'' They are \n     definitely not the kind of couple who sit silently across the \n     table from each other. ``We're both loud laughers,'' she \n     said. ``Guffawing ones.''\n       He said: ``I have a very highfalutin notion about laughter. \n     I think when you laugh you make yourself momentarily \n     vulnerable. Your defenses are not up, and if you can stay in \n     a playful mood, where you are susceptible to laughter, your \n     chances of being antagonistic with each other are lower.''\n       In general, they do not seem to act their ages. She \n     described a recent afternoon: ``I have a blurb to write for \n     someone's book. I have soup I want to cook. I have a good \n     chicken I want to roast. I have a book I'm reading that I \n     want to finish. I have email correspondence. I have Facebook \n     posts.''\n       Her 19th book, ``Just Kids From the Bronx,'' a collection \n     of vignettes about 65 noteworthy people who grew up in rough \n     Bronx neighborhoods and escaped in their own idiosyncratic \n     ways, is to be published next month.\n       Ms. Alda, who grew up in the Bronx herself and is a Hunter \n     College graduate, met Mr. Alda in 1956 while he was attending \n     Fordham University. They connected at a dinner party on the \n     Upper West Side when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the \n     kitchen floor and they were the only two guests who did not \n     hesitate to eat it.\n       ``He was a kindred spirit who was also funny, so there was \n     this great chemistry,'' she said. ``It sure was fun and \n     delightful to be with him that night. Boys from Manhattan \n     didn't date girls from the Bronx. That was a given. It was \n     too long of a trip. He took me home to the Bronx. Unheard \n     of.''\n       Eleven months later, they were married in a modest ceremony \n     (18 guests watched) that reflected their humble goals at the \n     time. They mainly wanted to be able to pay the rent and not \n     suffer as their parents had.\n       ``There was a lot of unhappiness in my parents'' marriage \n     partly because my mother was psychotic,'' Mr. Alda said. ``We \n     were already ahead of the game in that neither of us were \n     seriously mentally ill.''\n       Her parents had struggled financially and had no time for \n     luxuries like dinner parties or showing affection for each \n     other. ``I wanted something different,'' she said. ``I wanted \n     something without stress.''\n       So they filled their marriage with affection, music, dinner \n     parties with artists and actors and celebrations of every \n     paycheck.\n       ``The first job I got was with a traveling children's \n     company where we had to lug our own scenery,'' Mr. Alda said. \n     ``I got $10 a performance, and we were so glad, we went out \n     to get pizza to celebrate.'' To this day, whenever he gets a \n     new acting job, they celebrate by sharing a pizza.\n       Early on, they lived in Cleveland, where Eve, their first \n     child, was born. He often read poetry and short stories aloud \n     in the evenings. ``I'd be stirring a pot of soup, and the \n     baby would be sleeping, and he'd be reading to me,'' Ms. Alda \n     said. ``It was a warmth that's hard to describe.''\n       They eventually had two more daughters, moved to Leonia, \n     N.J., and discovered they had very different parenting \n     styles. ``I was the drill sergeant, and he liked to play with \n     the kids,'' she said. ``These were disagreements we had to \n     work out. How important is it for the kids to go to bed on \n     time?''\n       She added, ``We would talk a lot and talk angrily. When you \n     look back, you think, 'Why did I have to be angry?' ''\n       From 1972 to 1983, Mr. Alda commuted from New Jersey to Los \n     Angeles to play the part of Dr. Hawkeye Pierce in the iconic \n     television series ``M*A*S*H.'' Ms. Alda suddenly found \n     herself juggling raising their girls with trying to spend \n     time with a husband who was increasingly busy, famous and out \n     of town.\n       ``I was not a good juggler,'' she said. ``It all took \n     energy, and I found that I had spurts of energy. Not \n     sustained at all.''\n       Not wanting to become ``just an audience'' for her husband, \n     Ms. Alda worked harder on her own photography and writing \n     projects. ``I had my own drive,'' she said. ``One challenge \n     of marriage is how to keep your sense of self yet be able to \n     meld and blend with the other person.'' She said that being \n     married to a celebrity ``diminishes you, unless you feel \n     really secure in yourself.''\n       ``I like basking in someone else's glow,'' she said, ``but \n     not as a daily diet.''\n       Today, they live in an Upper West Side apartment and are \n     practically inseparable. On Facebook, she mentions Mr. Alda \n     in almost every post, and they seem to be always headed out \n     to a concert, play, lecture or reading. They even work on \n     their separate writing projects together.\n       Mr. Alda, who has written two memoirs, writes in the living \n     room, while Ms. Alda works in the study. They keep all the \n     doors open so they can talk back and forth, bounce ideas off \n     each other or call out when it's time to break for a meal.\n       ``Most likely one of us will die first,'' she said. ``I \n     can't even contemplate what that might be for either of us. \n     Meanwhile, we're doing what we should be doing. Living.''\n       Like many of the people profiled in ``Just Kids From the \n     Bronx,'' Ms. Alda believes that success in life--and in \n     marriage--is mostly a matter of luck. ``Luck is in neon \n     lights,'' she said, adding that there is no way a couple can \n     predict their future on their wedding day.\n       Both Aldas said it was especially lucky that they have \n     never grown bored of each other and that they didn't remain \n     penniless forever. ``I really do believe that scraping by can \n     damage a person and can damage a relationship,'' he said. \n     ``We have a lot of advantages. We know how lucky we are. I \n     don't think anybody can tell you how happy we'd be if we were \n     still scraping by.''\n       They have a house in the Hamptons and drink really good \n     wine, but otherwise they don't live particularly large. Both \n     dress in the comfortable baggy clothes of struggling writers \n     and have remained frugal and reluctant to waste anything.\n       ``That's never changed,'' she said. ``We are definitely \n     still those two people who would eat the cake off the \n     floor.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1196-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1196-S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n\n       This is the first hearing of not only our subcommittee but \n     the entire Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       How's that Senator Feinstein? We're the early bird, and I \n     want to say at the outset what a privilege it's been to work \n     with the Senator from California over the last few years. \n     She's been chairman, and I've been ranking member. Our seats \n     have switched, but the relationship hasn't changed. I look \n     forward to treating her with at least as much courtesy as \n     she's always treated me. Let's see if I can outdo her because \n     it's a treat to work with somebody who's capable of making a \n     decision, expressing herself well and easy to work with. So, \n     Senator Feinstein I look forward to our continued \n     relationship.\n       This morning we're having a hearing to review the \n     president's fiscal year 2016 budget request for the U.S. Army \n     Corp of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, which is \n     part of the Department of Interior.\n       Senator Feinstein and I will each have an opening statement \n     and then each senator may have up to five minutes for an \n     opening statement in the order in which they arrived. Senator \n     Graham has let me know that he has a 3 o'clock hearing, so if \n     the senators don't mind I'll try to work him in before 3 \n     o'clock as a courtesy to him. We'll then turn to the \n     witnesses for their testimony. Each witness will have five \n     minutes. We'd appreciate your summarizing your testimony in \n     that time. We'll include their full statements in the record. \n     And then, senators will be recognized for five minutes of \n     questions in the order in which they arrived.\n       I want to thank the witnesses for being here today and \n     thank Senator Feinstein for working with me on this. Our \n     witnesses include Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Assistant Secretary of \n     the Army for Civil Works. Welcome Assistant Secretary Darcy. \n     Estevan Lopez, Commissioner for the Bureau of Reclamation. \n     Mr. Lopez, welcome. Jennifer Gimbel, the Principle Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary for Water and Science. That's a long \n     title, nice to see you. And Lieutenant General Thomas P. \n     Bostick, Chief of Engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers.\n       Governing is about setting priorities, and unfortunately, \n     the president's budget request for these agencies shows a \n     failure to do so.\n       The president's overall budget proposes spending that \n     exceeds the budget caps established by the Budget Control Act \n     of 2011 by about $74 billion. And one of the priorities the \n     president often speaks about often is our nation's \n     infrastructure.\n       Yet despite all that proposed new spending and all that \n     talk, this proposal cuts the Corps' budget by $751 million, \n     or about 14 percent below last year's actual spending level. \n     This budget proposes cutting the Corps' funding to the actual \n     level of spending in 2007--we are literally moving backward, \n     on an agency that is crucial to maintaining our country's \n     infrastructure.\n       The reason this is such a problem is that the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers touches the lives of almost every \n     American. The Corps maintains our inland waterways, it \n     deepens and keeps our ports open, looks after many of our \n     recreational waters and land, manages the river levels to \n     prevent flooding, and its dams provide emission-free, \n     renewable hydroelectric energy.\n       All of these activities attract the intense interest of the \n     American people, and of their United States senators. I can \n     recall when, I was a member of the Environmental and Public \n     Works Committee, after the Missouri and Mississippi rivers \n     flooded four years ago, a whole room full of senators showed \n     up to ask for more money to deal with what went wrong and \n     what went right with disaster relief efforts. So, there's a \n     real interest in these proposals.\n       The reality is that for all the Corps does there are many \n     things it could do better, and setting priorities in our \n     spending is one way to better invest taxpayer dollars.\n       An important example of the administration's failure to set \n     priorities in my home state of Tennessee is the lack of any \n     funds in the president's budget request to restart \n     replacement of Chickamauga Lock. Congress has done its job \n     the last three years to move ahead promptly on replacing \n     Chickamauga Lock, and it's disappointing the Obama \n     administration has failed to do its job.\n       Here's what we've done. Congress, first, passed a law that \n     reduced the amount of money that comes from the Inland \n     Waterways Trust Fund to replace Olmsted Lock, a project in \n     Illinois and Kentucky that was soaking up almost all of the \n     money that is available for inland waterway projects. Second, \n     Congress worked with the commercial waterways industry to \n     establish a priority list for projects that needed to be \n     funded, on which Chickamauga ranks near the top, in fourth \n     place. And third, just this past year, working together, we \n     enacted a user fee increase that commercial barge owners \n     asked to pay in order to provide more money to replace locks \n     and dams across the country, including Chickamauga Lock.\n       These are three extremely important steps to give our \n     country the inland waterways that we need. These three things \n     taken together should make it possible for the Corps of \n     Engineers to move rapidly to begin to replace Chickamauga \n     Lock. The problem with Chickamauga Lock is it's made of aging \n     concrete and could fail if we don't replace it. In fact, in \n     October of last year, the lock was closed for several days to \n     all navigation traffic for emergency repairs after an \n     inspection revealed cracks in the concrete.\n       This project's not just important to Chattanooga, but to \n     all of Eastern Tennessee because of the number of jobs \n     affected. We're almost out of time for a solution--the lock \n     could close in a few years unless progress is made. If this \n     happens it would throw 150,000 trucks on Interstate 75, it \n     would increase the cost of shipping to the Oak Ridge National \n     Laboratory, the weapons complex and to manufacturers across \n     the state.\n       So you can see how Chickamauga Lock--and other projects \n     like it across the country--ought to be a priority, and why \n     the Corps' budget should make it a priority.\n       In addition to the Corps, we fund the Bureau of \n     Reclamation.\n       The Bureau of Reclamation delivers water to one in five \n     Western farmers, irrigating 10-million acres of some of the \n     most productive agricultural land in the world.\n       I would note that this is the first time that Commissioner \n     Lopez and Assistant Secretary Gimbel have appeared before \n     this subcommittee, and we welcome them both.\n       Without the infrastructure that these two agencies provide, \n     our nation would be vastly different. With that in mind, we \n     are here today to discuss the administration's fiscal year \n     2016 budget request for these both agencies. I look forward \n     to the testimony.\n       Before I turn to Senator Feinstein for her statement, I \n     would like to note that this is Roger Cockrell's last \n     hearing, at least the last one he'll attend in his capacity \n     with us as a staff member of the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee. He's retiring at the end of the month, and we're \n     going to miss him. For the past 14 budget cycles, senators on \n     the subcommittee, whether republicans or democrats, have been \n     well-served by Roger's expertise on both the Corps of \n     Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. It's hard to think \n     of anyone inside or outside of Washington who matches Roger \n     in knowledge or experience--and it is hard to think of a \n     water resources bill that hasn't benefited from his guidance. \n     So, Roger on behalf of the subcommittee, I wish to thank you \n     for your service over these many years and wish your family \n     best in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1197-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1197-S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE VICTIMS OF THE SUMGAIT POGROMS\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I wish to recognize the victims of the \nmass murder of Armenians 27 years ago during the state-sponsored \npogroms in Sumgait, Azerbaijan.\n  The citizens of Nagorno Karabakh peacefully petitioned to be reunited \nwith Soviet Armenia and spoke out against the arbitrary borders \nestablished by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. This democratic \nexercise of free speech expressing a natural desire for self-\ndetermination was met with 3 days of violence and brutality against \nArmenian civilians, who were hunted down in their homes. Security \nforces in Soviet Azerbaijan turned a blind eye, allowing the mass \nmurder of Armenians in a futile attempt to defeat this movement. The \nmassacres of Armenians did not stop in Sumgait but were followed in \nother Azerbaijani towns such as Kirovabad in November 1988 and the \ncapital Baku in January 1990. The U.S. Congress strongly condemned \nthese massacres at that time. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians fled \nAzerbaijan, many finding their home in my State of Michigan, where \nthere is a monument to the victims of the Sumgait massacres.\n  True democracies must respect the rights of the minority, allow \ncitizens to peacefully speak freely, and protect the human rights of \nall residents. The people of Nagorno Karabakh and the victims of this \nsenseless massacre played a critical role in promoting a democracy \nmovement which helped to end the Soviet Union.\n  Today, I remember the victims and ask my colleagues and the American\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\npeople to join me in honoring their memories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1198-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1198-S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Elijah McCoy in honor of Black History Month. Mr. McCoy was \na 19th-century African-American inventor whose innovation was crucial \nto our modern-day transportation system.\n  Throughout the month of February, we come together as Michiganders \nand as Americans to celebrate Black History Month and reflect on the \ntremendous contributions African Americans have made to our country. \nAfrican Americans have helped shape and enrich our communities, and \ntheir many contributions serve as a constant reminder that diversity is \none of our country's greatest strengths.\n  Elijah McCoy was born in Ontario, Canada, to fugitive slaves who had \nescaped to Canada through the Underground Railroad. Showing an interest \nin engineering from a young age, Mr. McCoy traveled to Scotland at the \nage of 15, where he took an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering. \nWhen he returned to the United States, racial barriers prevented him \nfrom finding work. Mr. McCoy then became a fireman and oiler for the \nMichigan Central Railroad. Through this job, he developed his major \ninvention.\n  Through analyzing the system of oiling axes, Mr. McCoy came up with a \nlubricating cup that evenly distributed oil over the engine's moving \nparts. He was granted a patent for his invention, thus allowing trains \nto run continuously for long periods of time. Railroad engineers came \nto ask for this equipment by name, requesting ``the real McCoy'' \nsystem--a term used to this day to describe quality and originality. \nReceiving approximately 60 patents throughout the course of his life, \nMr. McCoy later formed the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company and \nchanged the course of transportation history. Mr. McCoy is an example \nof true innovation and ingenuity. Elijah McCoy is buried at the Detroit \nMemorial Park East in Warren, MI, and it is fitting that we honored his \nlegacy by naming the U.S. Patent and Trademark satellite office in \nDetroit after him.\n  As we observe Black History Month, we should take a moment to \nrecognize how far we have come as a nation and yet how far we still \nhave to go as we work together to achieve true equality. The civil \nrights movement changed the course of our Nation's history for the \nbetter and left a lasting legacy that touches our lives every day. In \nhonor of Black History Month, let us recommit ourselves to the goal of \nmaking America a place where anyone who works hard and plays by the \nrules has the opportunity to succeed. As we continue to work toward \nequality, we must carry that legacy forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1199-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GENERAL HANSON SCOTT\n\n Mr. UDALL. Madam President, in my State of New Mexico, we are \nproud to be home to some of the finest military bases in the Nation. We \nare home to White Sands Missile Range, Kirtland Air Force Base, \nHolloman Air Force Base, and Cannon Air Force Base. New Mexicans have a \ngreat heritage of service in the Armed Forces, and our State's military \ninstallations play a key role in the Nation's national defense.\n  Today, I wish to express my thanks, and the thanks of all New \nMexicans, to General Hanson Scott, who retired on January 30th, after \nmany years of an illustrious career, both in active military service \nand in civilian life. He is a son of New Mexico, and a credit to our \nState.\n  General Scott is originally from Reserve, NM. He attended New Mexico \nState University, prior to receiving an appointment to the U.S. Air \nForce Academy, from which he graduated in 1961. During his 30 years in \nthe Air Force, he served with great distinction, including as commander \nof the 463rd Tactical Airlift Wing, Dyess Air Force Base; the 1st \nSpecial Operations Wing, Hurlbut Field; and Special Operations Command \nPacific, Camp H. M. Smith.\n  Following his retirement from the Air Force, General Scott continued \nto lead as the director of the New Mexico Office of Military Base \nPlanning and Support, reporting to the Governor and the Lieutenant \nGovernor. As director, he had the important responsibility of \naddressing State-level issues in support of New Mexico's military \ninstallations and supporting the New Mexico Military Base Planning \nCommission.\n  During the last BRAC round, General Scott played a key role in \nsupporting Operation Keep Cannon, as Cannon was saved from closure by \ndetermined State and community efforts. I was proud to work with him \nduring this effort. When the BRAC Commission made the decision to place \nCannon in enclave status, his team worked hard to ensure that a new \nmission would be identified for Cannon. As a result, the Air Force \nSpecial Operations Command made the decision to locate the 27th Special \nOperations Wing at Cannon. The wisdom of this decision cannot be \ndenied. Today, pilots from the 27th SOW can take advantage of New \nMexico's outstanding airspace as they prepare to carry out the \ncountry's national security priorities.\n  Prior to his appointment as the director of the Office of Military \nBase Planning and Support, General Scott was the executive director of \nthe Office for Space Commercialization, New Mexico Economic Development \nDepartment, and director of aviation for the city of Albuquerque, NM. \nHe also was a member of the steering committee of the Kirtland Air \nForce Base Retention Task Force, working with community leaders and the \nNew Mexico congressional delegation in preventing a significant \nrealignment of the base.\n  General Hanson Scott has led a life of service and commitment. He has \nproven his dedication to our military and the defense of our Nation \ntime and again. That dedication has required tremendous determination, \ntireless effort, and, at times, personal sacrifice. It has meant \ngetting up at 3 a.m. to make the roundtrip from Albuquerque to White \nSands or Holloman in 1 day. It has meant manning the phones, in all \ntime zones, sometimes while walking his dog Barney. Most of all, \nthroughout his career, it has meant trying to do what is best for New \nMexico and for the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  It is a privilege to say here today, to General Hanson Scott, thank \nyou. Thank you for a job well done. Thank you for your service. I wish \nyou all the best in your future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1199-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagree to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 240) making \nappropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes, and ask a \nconference with the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \nthereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1199-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1199-S1200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-790.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of P.S. 103 in West Baltimore, Maryland and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Justice \nThurgood Marshall's Elementary School Study Act. The elementary school \nthat Justice Marshall attended, known as PS 103, located in my hometown \nof Baltimore, is a place of national significance because it marks the \nsite where one of our nation's greatest legal minds began his \neducation.\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\n  Thurgood Marshall is well known as one of the most significant \nhistorical figures of the American civil rights movement. By the time \nhe was 32 he was appointed the chief legal counsel for the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. He served at \nthe NAACP a total of twenty-five years and was a key strategist to end \nracial segregation throughout the United States.\n  Perhaps the greatest illustration of this effort was his victory \nbefore the Supreme Court overturning the Plessy doctrine effectively \nending school segregation with the landmark decision in Brown v. Board \nof Education of Topeka, KS, in 1954. Not only did this case open up \neducational opportunity and sparked the civil rights movement in this \nnation, it also marked the beginning of Thurgood Marshall's career, \nstill a young attorney from Baltimore, as one of the greatest legal \nminds in all the land. This case was just one of the 29 cases he won \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Fittingly, Marshall was the first African American confirmed to the \nSupreme Court. He was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 \nand served 24 years, until 1991. On the high court, Marshall continued \nhis fight for the Constitutional protection of individual human rights.\n  But Thurgood Marshall was not always a legal giant. He was once a \nyoung boy growing up in West Baltimore. He received the first 6 years \nof his public education at PS 103. An apocryphal story goes that a \nyoung Thurgood Marshall studied the U.S. Constitution in the basement \nof the building while serving detention. Regardless of whether or not \nthis is true, the building powerfully tells the story of racial \nsegregation in America, PS 103 was a ``blacks only'' school when \nJustice Marshall was a student, and marks the academic beginning of one \nof the country's most brilliant legal thinkers and a pioneer of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  The building is located at 1315 Division Street in the Upton \nNeighborhood of Old West Baltimore. The building is part of the Old \nWest Baltimore National Register Historic District, and is listed as a \ncontributing historic resource for the neighborhood. The Old West \nBaltimore historic district is one of the largest predominately African \nAmerican historic districts in the country, and its significance is \ncentered on the African American experience in the area.\n  In Baltimore, we are fortunate to have the National Park Service \noperate two historical sites, Fort McHenry and the Hampton Mansion. \nAdding PS 103 is a unique opportunity for the National Park Service to \nwork in Baltimore's inner-city and to reach out and engage people about \nAfrican American history.\n  Needless to say, Thurgood Marshall's legacy is one that should be \npreserved. He was one of our country's greatest legal minds and a \nprominent historical figure of one chapter of our country's great \nhistory--the civil rights movement. This bill authorizes the Secretary \nof the Interior to conduct a special resource study of PS 103 to \nevaluate the suitability and feasibility of establishing the building \nas a unit of the National Park Service. Preserving the building that \nwas Justice Marshall's elementary school will give Americans insight \ninto Justice Marshall's childhood.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nrecruitment and retention incentives for volunteer emergency service \nworkers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Volunteer \nEmergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act of 2015. This bill \nfixes a long-standing problem with the tax code that harms the ability \nof volunteer fire departments to recruit and retain both firefighters \nand emergency service personnel.\n  For years, local and State governments have provided their volunteer \nfirefighters and EMS personnel with different forms of benefits \nincluding Length of Service Award Plans, commonly known as LOSAPs. \nThese are pension-like benefits for volunteer emergency responders.\n  Unfortunately, the way the tax code handles LOSAPs hinders the \nability of departments to administer plans and makes it more difficult \nfor volunteer emergency personnel to receive benefits.\n  My bill would simplify the taxation of LOSAPs in two steps. First, it \nwould allow an election to treat LOSAPs as deferred compensation plans, \nand second, it would exempt them from the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974. These two changes will improve access to LOSAP \nbenefits for volunteer emergency responders, without increasing Federal \nspending.\n  Today, an estimated 180,000 volunteer firefighters across 27 states \nparticipate in some form of LOSAP. Many states that do not offer these \nbenefits would be more likely to do so if the Federal tax code were \nsimplified. This, in turn, would help volunteer fire departments to \nrecruit more easily and retain personnel. These men and women, our \nlocal first responders, are the foundation of our emergency response \ncapabilities.\n  These volunteers put their lives on the line to help protect our \ncommunities, and their spirit of selflessness and service should be \nrewarded. I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator \nSchumer, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nbill through the Senate and into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/27/senate-section/article/S1203-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1203-S1204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 92--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 28, 2015, AS ``RARE DISEASE \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Coons, Ms. Warren, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
