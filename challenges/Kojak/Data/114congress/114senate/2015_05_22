Madam President, I am glad the Senate voted yesterday \nto take another step forward on the important trade legislation that is \nbefore us. This bill represents an opportunity for Republicans and \nDemocrats to stand together for the middle class, so I hope our friends \nacross the aisle will allow us to seize this opportunity. I am \noptimistic. We all know that trade is important for American workers \nand American jobs. We all know that by passing this legislation, we can \nshow we are serious about advancing new opportunities for bigger \nAmerican paychecks, better American jobs, and a stronger American \neconomy.\n  We want to process as many amendments as we can. The Republican and \nDemocratic bill managers, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, have done a \ngreat job managing this bill in a bipartisan spirit thus far. My hope \nis that, with some cooperation from across the aisle, we can vote on \nsome amendments today and complete our work on this trade legislation \ntoday.\n  I appreciate all the hard work from both sides that got us to the \npoint we are today. Let's keep the momentum going so we can finally \npass a bill that Republicans, President Obama, and many Democrats all \nagree is good for the middle class, good for the economy, and good for \nour country.\n  Let's also move forward in the same spirit to finish our work on the \nother two important issues on the Senate's to-do list. I will speak \nabout one of them in a moment. But the point is, we have to get our \nwork done, however long it takes. With bipartisan cooperation, we can \nget it done as soon as this afternoon.\n  On the issue I mentioned, following the attacks of September 11, the \nUnited States improved its laws and legal authorities in an effort to \nbetter understand the terrorist threat and, rather than treat it as a \ncrime to be handled by civilian prosecution, to combat it as a matter \nof warfare--not as a crime but as a matter of warfare. But that does \nnot mean Al Qaeda and its affiliates stood still. The terrorist threat \nmetastasized under regional affiliates such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula, al-Shabaab, Al Qaeda in Iraq, and AQIM.\n  We have all seen the advance of the Islamic State in Iraq and the \nLevant, which, despite coalition air attacks and Iraqi military ground \noperations, actually seized Ramadi last weekend. Although ISIL has \nbroken from core Al Qaeda, it is emblematic of how the threat continues \nto evolve.\n  Last week, the Director of the FBI explained how ISIL, operating from \nsafe havens within Syria, is now using social media to radicalize \nAmericans by making contact through Twitter and then directing them to \nencrypted venues. Moreover, through the publication of online \nmagazines, Al Qaeda and ISIL are able to radicalize recruits and reveal \nthe tactics needed for small-scale attacks here at home. These tactics, \nalong with the information gained by terrorist networks from the \nunlawful disclosure of classified information by Edward Snowden, \nchallenge counterterrorism officials in their efforts to detect \nterrorist plots and terrorist communications.\n  This all comes at a moment of elevated threats to the American \npeople.\n  Let me read something the L.A. Times recently reported. This is what \nthe Times had to say:\n\n       Alarmed about the growing threat from Islamic State, the \n     Obama administration has dramatically stepped up warnings of \n     potential terrorist attacks on American soil after several \n     years of relative calm.\n       Behind the scenes, U.S. authorities have raised defenses at \n     U.S. military bases, put local police forces on alert and \n     increased surveillance at the nation's airports, railroads, \n     shopping malls, energy plants and other potential targets. \n     Driving the unease are FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans \n     on terrorism-related charges this year in an array of ``lone \n     wolf'' plots, none successful, but\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n     nearly all purportedly inspired by Islamic State propaganda \n     or appeals.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  We need to recognize that terrorist tactics and the nature of the \nthreat have changed and that at a moment of elevated threat, it would \nbe a mistake to take from our intelligence community any--any--of the \nvaluable tools needed to build a complete picture of terrorist networks \nand their plans, such as the bulk data collection program of section \n215. The intelligence community needs these tools to protect us from \nthese attacks.\n  I would like to quote the observations that someone intimately \nfamiliar with this program made in the aftermath of the unauthorized \nleaks of classified material by Edward Snowden.\n  ``This program does not involve the content of phone calls or the \nnames of people making calls,'' he said. ``Instead, it provides a \nrecord of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls, metadata \nthat can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a \nparticular number is linked to a terrorist organization.''\n  He then described why the program was necessary.\n  ``The program grew out of a desire to address a gap identified after \n9/11,'' he said.\n\n       One of the 9/11 hijackers, Khalid A. Mihdhar, made a phone \n     call from San Diego to a known Al Qaeda safe house in Yemen. \n     NSA saw that call, but it could not see that the call was \n     coming from an individual already in the United States. The \n     telephone metadata program under Section 215 was designed to \n     map the communications of terrorists, so we can see who they \n     may be in contact with as quickly as possible.\n\n  Let me say that again: ``as quickly as possible.''\n\n       This capability could also prove valuable in a crisis. For \n     example, if a bomb goes off in one of our cities and law \n     enforcement is racing to determine whether a network is \n     poised to conduct additional attacks, time is of the essence. \n     Being able to quickly review telephone connections to assess \n     whether a network exists is critical to that effort.\n\n  He concluded by noting this:\n\n       The Review Group turned up no indication that this database \n     has been intentionally abused.\n\n  ``[N]o indication that this database has been intentionally abused.''\n\n       And I believe it is important that the capability that this \n     program is designed to meet is preserved.\n\n  The person who made those observations I just quoted was President \nObama, and he made them just last year--just last year.\n  Unfortunately, there is now a huge gap between the capabilities the \nPresident rightly recognized as being necessary for our intelligence \nprofessionals and the legislation he is endorsing today. The untried--\nand as of yet, nonexistent--bulk collection system envisioned under \nthat bill would be slower and more cumbersome than the one that \ncurrently helps keep us safe. At worst, it might not work at all due \nto, among many other problems, the lack of a requirement for \ntelecommunications providers to retain the data to begin with--no \nrequirement to retain the data.\n  Last week, the Obama administration briefed Senators on the current \nbulk data program under section 215. Senators were impressed with the \nsafeguards built into the current program, and they were impressed that \nthere had not been one incident--not one--of abuse of the program. But \nmany Senators were disturbed by the administration's inability to \nanswer basic, yet critical, questions about the alternate bulk data \nsystem that would be set up at some point--at some point--under the \nlegislation the administration now supports. The administration could \nnot guarantee whether a new system would work as well as the current \nsystem, and the administration could not guarantee whether there would \nbe much, if any, data available to be analyzed under a new system given \nthe lack of a data-retention requirement in the legislation.\n  Despite what the administration told us just last week about its \ninability to guarantee that this nonexistent system could even be built \nin time, it did an about-face earlier this week--sort of. The \nadministration had the Director of NSA write that the nonexistent \nsystem could be built in time if--if--the providers cooperated in \nbuilding it. And, of course, they are not required to.\n  The problem, of course, is that the providers have made it abundantly \nclear that they will not commit to retaining the data for any period of \ntime as contemplated by the House-passed bill unless they are legally \nrequired to do so. There is no such requirement in the bill. For \nexample, one provider said the following: ``[We are] not prepared to \ncommit to voluntarily retain documents for any particular period of \ntime pursuant to the proposed USA FREEDOM Act if not otherwise required \nby law.''\n  Far from addressing the concerns many have had about the USA FREEDOM \nAct, the administration in its letter only underscored the problem. It \nsaid the only way this nonexistent system could even be built in time \nis if the providers cooperate. But the providers have made it \nabundantly clear they will not cooperate, and there is nothing--\nabsolutely nothing--in the bill that would require them to do so.\n  This is just as cynical as the letter from the Attorney General and \nthe Director of National Intelligence that assured us they would let us \nknow about any problems after the current program was replaced with a \nnonexistent system. Let me say that again. This is just as cynical as \nthe letter from the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence that assured us they would let us know about any problems \nafter the current program was replaced with a nonexistent system. Boy, \nthat is reassuring.\n  This is beyond troubling. We should not establish an alternate system \nthat contains a glaring hole in its ability to function--namely, the \ncomplete absence of any requirement for data retention.\n  I have begun the legislative process to advance a 60-day extension of \nsection 215 and the other two authorities that will expire soon. This \nextension will allow for the Intelligence Committee to continue its \nefforts to produce a compromise bill we can send to the House that does \nnot destroy an important counterterrorism tool that is needed to \nprotect American lives.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 19, 2015]\n\n       White House Steps Up Warnings About Terrorism on U.S. Soil\n\n                           (By Brian Bennett)\n\n       Alarmed about the growing threat from Islamic State, the \n     Obama administration has dramatically stepped up warnings of \n     potential terrorist attacks on American soil after several \n     years of relative calm.\n       Behind the scenes, U.S. authorities have raised defenses at \n     U.S. military bases, put local police forces on alert and \n     increased surveillance at the nation's airports, railroads, \n     shopping malls, energy plants and other potential targets.\n       Driving the unease are FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans \n     on terrorism-related charges this year in an array of ``lone \n     wolf'' plots, none successful, but nearly all purportedly \n     inspired by Islamic State propaganda or appeals.\n       The group's leader, Abu Bakr Baghdadi, drove home the \n     danger in a 34-minute audio recording released online \n     Thursday. He urged Muslims everywhere to ``migrate to the \n     Islamic State or fight in his land, wherever that may be.''\n       The audio was released with translations in English, \n     French, German, Russian and Turkish, signaling the militants' \n     increasingly ambitious attempts to draw new recruits--and to \n     spark violence--around the world.\n       U.S. officials estimate the Sunni Muslim group has drawn \n     22,000 foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq, including about \n     3,700 from Western nations. About 180 Americans have gone, or \n     tried to go.\n       U.S. counter-terrorism officials initially viewed Islamic \n     State as primarily a regional security threat, focused on \n     expanding and protecting its self-proclaimed Islamist \n     caliphate in Syria and Iraq, rather than launching attacks \n     abroad.\n       But the analysis has shifted sharply as gunmen inspired by \n     the group, but not controlled or assisted by them, opened \n     fire at the Parliament in Ottawa; at a cafe in Sydney, \n     Australia; at a kosher grocery in Paris; and, on May 3, in \n     Garland, Texas.\n       In the Texas case, two would-be terrorists apparently \n     prompted by Islamic State social media messages tried to \n     shoot their way into a provocative contest for caricatures of \n     the prophet Muhammad. Both gunmen were shot to death, and no \n     one else was killed. Islamic State later claimed \n     responsibility for the assault, the first time it has done so \n     for an attack on U.S. soil.\n       James B. Comey, the FBI director, warned this month that \n     ``hundreds, maybe thousands'' of Americans are seeing \n     recruitment pitches from Islamic State on Facebook, Twitter \n     and other social media, as well as messages sent to \n     smartphones of ``disturbed\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n     people'' who could be pushed to attack U.S. targets.\n       ``It's like the devil sitting on their shoulders saying, \n     `Kill, kill, kill,' '' Comey told reporters.\n       The United States has entered a ``new phase, in my view, in \n     the global terrorist threat,'' Jeh Johnson, director of \n     Homeland Security, said Friday on MSNBC.\n       ``We have to be concerned about the independent actor, and \n     the independent actor who is here in the homeland who may \n     strike with little or no warning,'' he said. ``The nature of \n     the global terrorist threat has evolved.''\n       That poses a special challenge for U.S. intelligence and \n     law enforcement agencies, which spent years desperately \n     trying to penetrate and understand Al Qaeda's rigid hierarchy \n     and top-down approach to terrorism.\n       Now they are struggling to detect and prevent lethal \n     attacks by individuals--such as the April 2013 bombing of the \n     Boston Marathon by two Russian-born brothers--with little or \n     no outside communication or support.\n       The administration has sought to stiffen homeland defenses, \n     and intelligence gathering, in response.\n       This month, U.S. Northern Command boosted security at all \n     bases in the United States. Officials cited the May 3 \n     shooting in Texas, specific threats against military \n     personnel and the increasing number of Americans \n     communicating with Islamic State supporters.\n       In March, a group calling itself ``Islamic State Hacking \n     Division'' posted online the names, home addresses and photos \n     of 100 U.S. troops. The group wrote on Twitter that it was \n     posting the apparent hit list ``so that our brothers residing \n     in America can deal with you.''\n       More armed guards have been deployed at federal buildings \n     across the country, and Homeland Security officials have \n     quietly urged more security at privately run facilities and \n     infrastructure that could be targeted, including shopping \n     malls, railroads, water treatment facilities and nuclear \n     power generators.\n       ``Since last summer we have ramped up security at federal \n     installations across the country, and we have increased our \n     outreach with critical infrastructure operators,'' a senior \n     Homeland Security official said in an interview.\n       Authorities have urged companies to conduct more ``active \n     shooter'' drills to ``heighten awareness and make sure people \n     are leaning forward with security protocols,'' he said. The \n     official was not authorized to publicly discuss internal \n     communications and security measures.\n       Defeating Islamic State will take not only the ongoing \n     military operations in Iraq and Syria, U.S. officials said, \n     but stronger international efforts to block foreign recruits \n     from joining and to cut the group's financing networks. \n     Officials acknowledge they also need better messaging to \n     counter a barrage of polished videos, social media and \n     Internet appeals from the militants.\n       ``It's a long-term challenge,'' Brett McGurk, deputy \n     assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs, told \n     CNN. ``We have not seen this before. And it's going to take a \n     very long time to defeat them.''\n       Still, attacking Western targets is not the group's top \n     priority, as it was for Osama bin Laden, according to Seth \n     Jones, a former U.S. counter-terrorism official now with Rand \n     Corp., the Santa Monica-based think tank. The group is far \n     more focused on the battleground in Iraq and Syria, and \n     establishing ties to terrorist groups in Libya, Yemen, \n     Algeria and elsewhere.\n       Without a strong hand to help direct and organize attacks \n     abroad, they are ``likely to be less sophisticated,'' Jones \n     said. ``You actually need a lot of training to conduct a \n     Madrid-style attack or a London-style attack. Those kinds of \n     bombs are hard to put together.''\n       Most of the 30 Americans arrested this year were suspected \n     of aiding or trying to join Islamic State. Many were \n     approached on social media or on chat programs designed for \n     cellphones.\n       In March, for example, a 22-year-old Army National Guard \n     specialist was arrested at Chicago Midway International \n     Airport as he allegedly attempted to join Islamic State in \n     Syria. The FBI said he had downloaded military training \n     manuals to take with him and told an undercover agent he was \n     prepared to ``bring the flames of war'' to the United States.\n       That same month, a retired Air Force avionics instrument \n     specialist was indicted in Brooklyn, N.Y., on suspicion of \n     trying to travel to Syria to join the group. Prosecutors in \n     Brooklyn also have charged three other men with seeking to \n     link up with the militants.\n       And on Thursday, the FBI arrested a former interpreter for \n     the U.S. military in Iraq, now a naturalized American \n     citizen, who had tried to travel to Syria from Texas. In June \n     he had used Twitter to ``pledge obedience'' to Islamic State.\n       ``As a numbers game, it is pretty easy for ISIS to reach \n     out to a very large number of people using a very robust \n     social media presence,'' said J.M. Berger, a nonresident \n     fellow at the Brookings Institution, using a common acronym \n     for Islamic State.\n       ``I suspect we should see more plots going forward,'' he \n     added.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3255-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I think everyone knows that I disagree \nwith the reasoning for the trade bill. Based on my experience of \nlooking at trade bills that have passed the Congress in years past, it \nis not going to help the people whom I want to help.\n  I am happy that multinational corporations are doing well, but my \nfirst goal is not them. It is people who work for a living, middle-\nclass Americans, who work so hard, first of all to find a job, and then \nonce they find a job, they do everything they can to hang on to that \njob. The trade bill is another example of how we have ignored in this \nCongress the working men and women of this country.\n  I so admire our ranking member of the banking committee, Senator \nBrown of Ohio. He has done a remarkably good job of pointing out what \nis wrong with the trade bill. It passed, and I accept this. The vast \nmajority of Democrats opposed it, but there are some who didn't. I \nrespect them, and I respect their judgment. I am not here to criticize \nthem. I am here to criticize the underlying legislation. This \nRepublican-led Senate has done nothing to help the middle class. It \ndoesn't matter what you look to--minimum wage, equal pay for men and \nwomen, the burden of student debt, and, of course, the tremendous lack \nof impetus to do something about our surface transportation system, our \nhighways.\n  We have 64,000 bridges in America that are structurally deficient. \nFifty percent of our highway roads are deficient, and we do nothing. \nLikely, what will happen here in the next day or two is that we will \nextend the highway authorization for 60 days. It should be pretty easy \nto do because we have done it 32 other times.\n  Since the Republicans came to town and started flexing their muscles, \nwe found a situation where they were unwilling to help middle-class \nAmericans. Think about that. Our country has 64,000 bridges that are \nstructurally deficient. Does this really matter? Well, talk to the \npeople of Minnesota. One of their bridges collapsed and 13 people died. \nOf course it matters, and we are ignoring it as a Congress, and that is \nnot right.\n  Ray LaHood, a Republican, who was Secretary of Transportation for \nPresident Obama for a long time, said that our transportation system \nshould be called the pothole because that is all the highways are \nanymore.\n  The trade bill is an example of not helping the middle class, and it \nis an example of how we focus on multinational corporations.\n  My friend the Republican leader talked about the FISA bill, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Republican leader and I are \nfriends. We have served together for decades here in this body. But \nwith all due respect to him, I think I will take the word and opinion \nof the head of the FBI, the Attorney General of the United States, and \nthe man who is in charge of all of our intelligence, James Clapper, who \nhas said, without any question, that the bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives--by almost 390 votes--is what we should be doing here.\n  Among other things, in a letter they wrote to Senators Leahy and Lee, \nthey say:\n\n       The Intelligence Community believes that the bill preserves \n     essential operational capabilities of the telephone metadata \n     program and enhances other intelligence capabilities needed \n     to protect our Nation and its partners.\n\n  I repeat, the bill passed by a 4-to-1 margin in the House of \nRepresentatives. My friend the Republican leader talks continually \nabout bipartisanship. We have a piece of legislation out of the House. \nIt was one of the rare times where bipartisan efforts were made and \nthey worked. They passed this bill, and we should do the same before we \nleave here rather than extend this program.\n  Efforts have been made to extend a program that has already been \ndeclared by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States as \nillegal. How can we extend an illegal act? That is what some of the \ntalk is from the other side of the aisle. I think that is unfortunate, \nand I think we should make sure that before we leave here, we do what\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\nour intelligence community suggested to us, and in very strong words--\nthat we simply move forward on the legislation that has a name that \nmaybe says it all, and that is the USA FREEDOM Act. That is what that \nlegislation is, and we should pass that.\n  We know there is work to be done on the trade legislation, and I am \nhappy to work with Senator Brown, Senator Wyden, and anyone else who \nhas a way of moving forward on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3256-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as we resume the debate of our Nation's \ntrade policy, I want to take a few minutes to provide an update about \nwhere things really are, where we are going, and the possibility of a \npath forward.\n  We took a big step yesterday, and I thank all of my colleagues who \nvoted for cloture, once again, for helping us to get closer to the \nfinish.\n  I am, of course, aware that a number of Senators have concerns about \nthe process and amendments. I understand those concerns. As I said \nyesterday, I would have preferred a different path for moving this \nbill. It was always my preference to consider more amendments and have \na fuller debate on these important issues. I know that is what the \nmajority leader wanted, as well.\n  Sadly, there were some who just did not want to cooperate, and \ninstead of moving directly to the bill, we had to negotiate around a \nfilibuster. Then, instead of bringing up and debating amendments, we \nspent a lot of time addressing concerns and overcoming objections.\n  I am not going to point fingers or complain about anyone who chooses \nto exercise their rights under the Senate rules to slow down the \ndebate. We are all well aware that a number of Senators would love to \nprolong this debate forever to keep the TPA bill from passing. But with \na bill this important, we had to find a way forward, which led to a \ncloture motion and yesterday's vote.\n  But even now that cloture has been invoked, I am still working to try \nto reach a reasonable accommodation to address Senators' concerns. Both \nsides worked late into the night to try to come up with an agreement on \ntime and amendments in order to give Senators an opportunity to make \ntheir case. Up to now, no deal has been reached, which from my point of \nview is unfortunate. And keep in mind that under the rules, we don't \nhave an obligation to do that. We bent over backwards to try to solve \nthis problem, but so far, no deal has been reached.\n  I am still willing to work with my colleagues to address their \nconcerns, although it is becoming increasingly clear that some concerns \nare beyond accommodation. But I am always an optimist. As I said \nyesterday, if any of my colleagues have a reasonable proposal to solve \nthis impasse and allow us to consider more amendments, I am all ears. \nBut as of right now, cloture is invoked and only pending, germane \namendments can be considered without an agreement.\n  Until that time, however, one thing is clear: Absent an agreement on \ntime and votes, the Senate will deal with pending amendments and vote \non whether to invoke cloture on TPA this evening. I am, of course, more \nthan willing to wait that long, but I am sure there are many in this \nChamber who would prefer to see a solution come together before then.\n  Let's work together. Let's find a way to hear more amendments and \naddress more issues. I hope people will be willing to work with us on a \nreasonable path forward, but if not, it appears that the clock, more \nthan anything else, will determine how this debate will unfold.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on the Portman-\nStabenow currency manipulation amendment.\n  Up to now, we have all heard more than our fair share of arguments \nabout this amendment. I want to take a few more minutes today to \nexpress my opposition to the Portman-Stabenow amendment and to explain \nto my colleagues why they should vote against it.\n  I want to reiterate that the Obama administration has made it \nabundantly clear that if this amendment gets adopted, President Obama \nwill veto the TPA bill. As I have already said a number of times, a \nvote for the Portman-Stabenow amendment is a vote to kill TPA. That \nwould be, indeed, tragic.\n  I know that all of my colleagues are aware of the statements made by \nSecretary Lew and the White House on this matter. I also know that a \nnumber of my colleagues who support Portman-Stabenow have said that \nthey don't believe the President would veto the TPA bill over this \namendment.\n  Well, let's say, for the sake of argument, that they are right--but \nonly for the sake of argument. Let's assume that the administration is \nbluffing. Should we call that bluff? Should we pass the amendment and \ndare the President to make good on his veto threat? The answer to that \nquestion is an emphatic no.\n  Even if we take veto threats and administration statements of \nopposition completely out of the equation, one fact still remains: The \nPortman-Stabenow amendment is bad policy for America, and it is far too \nrisky.\n  Earlier this week, I laid out four separate negative consequences \nthat would result from the Portman-Stabenow amendment, and I would like \nto reiterate those concerns here today.\n  First, the Portman-Stabenow amendment would derail the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Once again, we know that this is the case. I have chatted \nwith Japanese leaders, and they tell me this is the case. That is a \nvery important aspect of what we are trying to do here. We are trying \nto get Japan, for the first time, to agree to a trade policy that \nworks. I think we have a new leadership there that wants to agree, and \nwe ought to help them.\n  None of our negotiating partners would sign a trade agreement that \nincluded the kinds of rules mandated by the Portman-Stabenow amendment. \nWe have already heard from countries such as Japan that they would walk \naway from the agreement if the United States were making these types of \ndemands.\n  Furthermore, the United States would never agree to these types of \ndemands, either. What country would willingly sign a trade agreement \nthat would subject their monetary policies to potential trade \nsanctions? No country that I am aware of.\n  I heard some of my colleagues respond to these claims the same way \nthey responded to the President's veto threat. They don't believe Japan \nwhen they say they will walk away from the TPP or they say that any \ncountry refusing to accede to these types of\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nstandards must be planning to manipulate their currency.\n  Now, I am all for healthy skepticism around here, but maybe--just \nmaybe--if our government, as well as all of our negotiating partners, \nall say that Portman-Stabenow is bad policy that they cannot sign onto, \nthere has to be something to those claims.\n  Guess what. There is something to them, which brings me to the second \nnegative consequence that we would see under the Portman-Stabenow \namendment. It would put the Federal Reserve's independence at risk and \nsubject our own monetary policies to trade disputes and possible \nsanctions.\n  Once again, we have colleagues in the Senate who have simply decreed \nhere on the floor that U.S. monetary policy is aimed at purely domestic \nobjectives and that it is only other countries that manipulate their \ncurrencies to gain trade advantage. But anyone who paid attention to \nthese issues knows that not all of our trading partners share that \nassessment. Other countries have already accused the United States of \ncurrency manipulation, and the Portman-Stabenow amendment would set \nforth a clear and accessible process for turning those accusations into \ntrade disputes subject to possible sanctions.\n  We may not agree with those allegations against U.S. monetary policy. \nI certainly don't. But the problem is that the Portman-Stabenow \namendment would take those determinations out of our hands and give \nthem over to international trade tribunals. So whether we agree or not, \nwe are going to find ourselves in a mess no matter what happens, should \nthat amendment be accepted.\n\n  At this point, the proponents of this amendment will likely point out \nthat they have included language to exempt ``the exercise of domestic \nmonetary policy'' from the enforceable rules mandated by the amendment. \nWith all due respect to the authors of the amendment, that is a red \nherring.\n  Keep in mind that the U.S. dollar is a global currency, the primary \nreserve currency in the world today. That being the case, our Nation's \nmonetary policies necessarily have a global impact, making it very \ndifficult to determine what constitutes purely domestic monetary policy \nand what is meant to be international. Once again, after this \namendment, that extremely difficult determination will not be made here \nin the United States but by international trade tribunals. I don't know \nabout my colleagues, but I have to say that causes me great alarm.\n  We also need to keep in mind that under currently available economic \nmodels and methodologies, it is virtually impossible to definitively \nmeasure currency manipulation. There is no clear and obvious threshold \nat which anyone can, with certainty, declare that a country's currency \nhas been manipulated.\n  Most like to point to the standards set by the International Monetary \nFund. However, even their formulations have been unable to determine \ncurrency manipulation with any level of specificity.\n  For example, IMF models recently showed that in 2013, Japan's \ncurrency was anywhere between around 15 percent undervalued and 15 \npercent overvalued. In other words, existing standards for determining \nwhat is and what is not currency manipulation are flimsy and ill-\ndefined. It would be very dangerous to subject U.S. monetary policies \nto enforceable rules based on these standards. Yet that is precisely \nwhat the Portman-Stabenow amendment would do.\n  Third, under the Portman-Stabenow amendment, the traditional role of \nthe U.S. Treasury in setting U.S. exchange rate policies would be \nwatered down and potentially overruled in international trade \ntribunals. Thus, adoption of the Portman-Stabenow negotiating objective \ncedes independence and full authority over not only monetary policy for \nthe Federal Reserve but also the exchange rate policy for the Treasury.\n  Fourth, the Portman-Stabenow amendment would deal a serious setback \nto ongoing efforts to fight currency manipulation by encouraging our \ntrading partners to evade regular reporting and transparency of \nexchange rate policies. If currency standards become enforceable and \nimmediately subject to sanctions under a trade agreement, parties to \nthat agreement would almost certainly start withholding full \nparticipation in reporting and monitoring mechanisms that are designed \nto uncover and combat currency manipulation.\n  Put simply, we cannot enforce rules against unfair exchange rate \npractices if we do not have information about them. The Portman-\nStabenow amendment would make it far more difficult to obtain that type \nof information. Their approach would push currency manipulation \npractices into the shadows as countries would fear being hit with trade \nsanctions if a trade tribunal--once again using ill-defined standards--\ndeems their policies to be manipulative.\n  As we can see, concerns about the Portman-Stabenow amendment extend \nwell beyond the veto threats. Indeed, even if no veto threats had been \nissued--and make no mistake, they have definitely been issued--there \nare enough problems inherent in the approach taken by this amendment to \nwarrant opposition on its own. Can we take those chances? I don't think \nso.\n  Colleagues don't have to take my word for it. Every living former \nU.S. Treasury Secretary, both Republicans and Democrats--every one--has \nexpressed opposition to the approach taken by the Portman-Stabenow \namendment. During the Finance Committee's consideration of the TPA \nbill, Congress received a letter signed by Tim Geithner, Hank Paulson, \nJohn Snow, Paul O'Neill, Larry Summers, Robert Rubin, Nicholas Brady, \nJames Baker, Michael Blumenthal, and George Shultz stating, among other \nthings, that ``it is impossible to get agreement on provisions that \nsubject currency manipulation to trade sanctions in a manner that both \nthe United States and other countries would find acceptable.''\n  It is ``impossible.'' That is their word, not mine.\n  We also received a letter from 14 former chairs of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, again both Republicans and Democrats, expressing \nsimilar views. The letter was signed by Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, \nCharles Schultze, Martin Feldstein, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Martin Baily, \nGlenn Hubbard, Austan Goolsbee, Alan Krueger, Christina Romer, Edward \nLazear, Harvey Rosen, and Greg Mankiw.\n  All of these leaders--these experts in economic policy--have \ncautioned against requiring enforceable currency standards in our trade \nagreements that are subject to sanctions. They all noted such an \napproach, which would be required under the Portman-Stabenow amendment, \nwould hinder our own economic policies.\n  Our current Secretary of Agriculture said much the same thing in a \nletter this week. In his letter, Secretary Vilsack stated:\n\n       Enacting a TPA currency discipline that requires an \n     enforceable negotiating objective would likely derail our \n     efforts to complete the Trans Pacific Partnership and cause \n     us to lose ground on holding countries accountable on \n     currency.\n\n  He continued, arguing:\n\n       An enforceable currency provision in our trade agreements . \n     . . could give our training partners the power to challenge \n     legitimate U.S. monetary policies needed to ensure strong \n     employment and a healthy, robust economy.\n\n  We have also heard from leaders in the business community. In fact, \nwe received letters signed by almost every major business association \nin this country, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business \nRoundtable, and countless others weighing in either against the \nPortman-Stabenow amendment, in favor of the Hatch-Wyden alternative or \nboth.\n  We have heard the same from agricultural organizations, including the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the National Pork Producers Council, and many \nothers.\n  In short, both the business and \nagricultural communities over-\nwhelmingly--overwhelmingly--oppose Portman-Stabenow. This isn't about \npolitics, this is about sensible policy.\n  Now, I am not arguing that we shouldn't do anything about currency \nmanipulation. Senator Wyden and I have submitted an alternative \namendment that would take a much more sensible and effective approach \nto deal with these issues.\n  The Hatch-Wyden amendment would put a number of tools at our disposal \nto\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nfight currency manipulation, including enhanced transparency, \ndisclosure, reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanisms, as well as \nenforceable rules--the only tool in the Portman-Stabenow amendment. The \nPortman-Stabenow amendment provides this single tool: enforceable \nrules, subject--and this is what a lot of people miss--subject to trade \nsanctions. This single tool is grossly unreliable and poses a serious \nthreat to U.S. interests if we fail to monitor what is going on in \ninternational tribunals against the United States.\n  The Hatch-Wyden amendment would give us maximum transparency and \neffectiveness with the ability to specifically tailor our efforts at \naddressing currency manipulation.\n  The Portman-Stabenow amendment would tie our hands and give us no \nother option than to subject our trading partners and ourselves to \npotential sanctions based on unreliable, indefinite standards.\n  The Hatch-Wyden amendment would preserve the integrity of our current \ntrade negotiations. It would pose no threats to the independence of the \nFederal Reserve and would not subject our own monetary or exchange rate \npolicies to the whims of an international trade tribunal, and it would \nincrease transparency and accountability of our trading partners' \ncurrency practices.\n  In pretty much every way, the Hatch-Wyden amendment provides a better \napproach to dealing with currency manipulation than the one offered by \nthe Portman-Stabenow amendment.\n  So, once again, even if we think the President is blowing smoke when \nhe said he would veto any TPA bill that includes Portman-Stabenow, that \nis no reason to vote in favor of the amendment--and I don't believe he \nis blowing smoke. Our alternative approach represents a better solution \nto a myriad of serious problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Portman-Stabenow currency \namendment and support the Hatch-Wyden alternative. I think my \ncolleagues will be happy if they do that because I think I have made a \nvery strong case this morning. There is more to be said, but this ought \nto cause everybody to think and to pause and to say, Should I really \ntake the chance of voting for this? Is it really possible the President \nmight veto it? Is it really possible it will interfere with our Federal \nReserve policy? Is it really possible we could be subject to all kinds \nof international tribunals--over what? Something we could have avoided \nwith the Hatch-Wyden amendment.\n  I could go on and on. All I can say is I hope our colleagues will \nvote for Hatch-Wyden. It is not a matter of wanting to win on \nsomething. It is a matter of needing to win on something for the \nbetterment of our country and its foreign policy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, Senator Durbin, who has been very gracious to \nlet me follow the Finance Committee chairman, be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, and colleagues, Chairman Hatch has made a \nnumber of important points this morning. I wish to follow up and give a \nlittle bit of an update on where we are and touch on one issue that has \nnot been discussed.\n  First, under Chairman Hatch's leadership, both sides have been \nworking together in good faith with respect to the amendments, and I \nthink it would be fair to say the chairman and I are optimistic that we \ncan have a good and fair list of amendments. That is No. 1. I wish to \ncommend both the Democrats and the Republicans who were part of that \namendment discussion.\n  Second, with respect to the currency issue which Chairman Hatch has \naddressed--and I certainly share his views--I would also sum it up by \nsaying the Hatch-Wyden approach on currency provides a wider array of \ntools to deal with the currency issue without undermining our monetary \npolicy. That is really the heart of the Hatch-Wyden proposal. We wanted \nto come up with the widest possible array of tools but at the same time \nnot undermine monetary policy. That is what Janet Yellen has been \nconcerned about. She has always been concerned about what would happen \nif, Heaven forbid, we had another financial crisis. She doesn't want \nher hands tied or the hands of the Fed tied in terms of being able to \nfight that challenge.\n  We know that during that period of quantitative easing, a number of \ncountries said the United States was manipulating our currency. Now, of \ncourse, that was an outrageous assertion. Chairman Hatch and I \ncertainly disagree with that, but that is what we are up against. To \nme, what we ought to be trying to do is to provide the widest array of \ntools to fight these currency manipulation issues while at the same \ntime not undermining our monetary policy. So those are two concerns.\n  Now, I wish to provide an update from yesterday. Yesterday, I came to \nthe floor because colleagues were talking about excessive secrecy in \nthe way trade policy has been made in the past. I made clear that I \nhave very much shared that view, and I went through in considerable \ndetail how we have put in place a new approach that I am calling the \nsunshine trade policy. In particular, what it means is that before any \nMember of the Senate and the House vote on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership or any other agreement--the American people will have that \nagreement in their hands for close to 4 months before any Member of the \nSenate or any Member of the House actually votes on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership.\n\n  The way it works--and I thank Chairman Hatch also for his efforts to \nbuild this sunshine trade policy--is that before the President of the \nUnited States even signs the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that document \nhas to be public for 60 days. On top of that, there are probably about \nanother 2 months that the American people would have that document in \ntheir hands.\n  I know the Presiding Officer of the Senate is here. We welcomed her \nto the Senate. What this means is that when my colleague from West \nVirginia has a community meeting--and certainly people in West \nVirginia, like the rest of our country, care greatly about trade--\npeople would be able to come to a townhall meeting in West Virginia \nwith the Trans-Pacific Partnership document in their hands for close to \n4 months before you or any other Member of Congress votes on it. So \nthat is an awful lot of sunshine, Madam President, and it is long \noverdue. I thank Chairman Hatch again for working closely with me on \nthis matter. This is required by law. It is required by law that the \nPresident of the United States make public the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership for 60 days before it is signed.\n  Beyond that, yesterday we talked about the labor and environmental \nissues. Once again, there is a very dramatic set of changes, and that \nis why the President and I have said this is the most progressive trade \npolicy in our country's history.\n  For example, during the 1990s--my friend from Illinois is here. We \nremember all those fierce debates in the 1990s. One point that I think \nall Members now realize is that those labor and environmental positions \nmeant very little. They weren't enforceable. They were off on the side. \nThey were really shunted way out of real opportunities to affect the \ndebate. That is different now because labor and environmental rights--I \nwent through them in great detail yesterday--are now enforceable.\n  On the labor issue, we are going to comply with the International \nLabor Organization standards, the ILO. So this is going to be a very \ndifferent day, and it is why the President and I have both said this is \nthe most progressive trade policy in our country's history.\n  To just touch on one other topic briefly, I want to address some of \nthe misstatements about what this trade package will and will not do. \nWe have heard suggested, for example, that it is a backdoor route for \nimmigration reform or action on climate change. We have heard some say \nthat a future President could use trade deals to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act or water down Wall Street reforms. These hypotheticals somehow \njust seem to be getting more and more far-fetched. My sense is that at \nthe rate these hypotheticals are going, one is bound to hear that a \nfuture President working on a trade deal might have second thoughts \nabout the Louisiana Purchase.\n  Now, to me, it is pretty important to keep this debate grounded in \nfacts, and the fact is that the bipartisan legislation passed by the \nFinance Committee\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\nsays in clear terms that trade deals cannot change or override American \nlaws or regulations. Let me repeat that. Trade deals cannot change or \noverride American laws or regulations. But there has been an awful lot \nof spin out there on this point, and I want to address some of those \nissues this morning.\n  Many of the hypotheticals are centered on a common part of trade \nagreements called investor-state dispute settlement, also known as \nISDS. Over the course of three decades with this approach in our trade \nagreement, our country has never lost a single dispute settlement case \nor paid one dime in penalties. So I have heard all kinds of discussion \nabout this. We never lost a single dispute settlement case. We have \nnever paid a dime in penalties. In fact, our country has been sued 17 \ntimes, and if you look at the number of years we have had it, it is not \nas if there is some kind of tidal wave of litigation.\n  Some have said that even the mere threat of a lawsuit causes laws and \nregulations to get watered down. Again, when you have gone 17-for-17 in \ndispute settlement in those cases, you have to put that upfront in this \ndiscussion.\n  What we know is that our country has regulations challenged nearly \nevery day in our own domestic court system, and there are thousands of \nlawsuits every year. This trade promotion legislation makes it clear \nthat companies do not have greater rights under the investor-state \ndispute settlement approach than they do in U.S. courts.\n  The fact is that our country is a safe and welcoming environment for \ninvestment, but that sure hasn't been the case all over the world. \nProperty can be stolen, governments can dream up regulations designed \nto discriminate against our investors, or companies in fields such as \nrenewable energy can be targeted and punished in unfair ways. Those are \ncompanies that we think are right at the heart of a vibrant economy--\nrenewable energy companies--and they have been targeted.\n  In some places, unlike the United States, there is not a reliable \ncourt to turn to for help. This raises serious questions. What happens, \nfor example, if a Malaysian judge decides to vote against an American \ncompany and it costs them millions? In another era, our country turned \nto gunboat diplomacy to protect our economic interests, but, in my \nview, the rule of law is a better option than military force.\n  It is also important to recognize that there are an increasing number \nof cases brought by pro-environment plaintiffs. That looks to me like a \npositive trend, whether it is the renewable energy companies \nchallenging a European Union state that has rolled back incentives for \nsolar or wind energy or the ecotourism investors suing Barbados for the \ndischarge of sewage in a wetlands area.\n  Skeptics have argued that the arbiters are invariably biased in favor \nof corporations and that the panels that decide cases are rife with \nconflict. The numbers, however, tell a different story, which is that \nthe overwhelming majority of cases are decided in favor of government. \nThe record does not support the proposition that all of the arbiters \nare unprincipled individuals who allow corporations in those dispute \nsettlements to get laws and regulations tossed out.\n  Finally, I want it to be clear that I will only accept a plan for \ndispute settlement that uses a transparent process. What is true in \ntrade negotiations overall has to be true with dispute settlement, too. \nAmerica cannot be kept in the dark. The hearing briefs, the decisions--\nall of the important matters must be open to the public.\n  My bottom line is this: The bipartisan trade legislation that is now \nbefore the Senate will go further than ever before to protect American \nsovereignty and affirm the fact that only democratically elected \nleaders write the laws in our country.\n  Done right, our trade policies help guarantee that American companies \nthat have grown up here, invested here, and found opportunities to sell \nbrand Oregon and brand America around the world are going to get the \nsame fair treatment abroad that they get here at home.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Durbin, for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from Utah for their leadership on this important issue. \nAlthough we may disagree on some elements, they have really poured \ntheir hearts and souls into this debate, which is one of the most \nimportant ones we have faced.\n  Thank you for your leadership on that.\n\n\n                        Issues Before the Senate\n\n  I would like to at this point kind of reflect on where we are in the \nSenate at this moment where we have three major issues facing us and \nsay a word about each. I will address some aspects of the trade bill \nand questions about our national security that have been raised by the \nextension of FISA.\n  Before I get into those elements, in respect to the Presiding Officer \nof the Senate from the great State of West Virginia, I would like to \nreflect for a moment on McColloch's leap.\n  Samuel McColloch was a major during the Revolutionary War, and he was \ngiven the assignment of keeping the western border frontier of the \nUnited States safe, which at that time focused on Fort Henry in what is \nnow Wheeling, WV. Major McColloch had this famous moment when he was \nturned away from the gates of Fort Henry and had to ride away with the \nNative Americans--the Indians--in hot pursuit. He rode up the side of \nthis hill or mountain, and as he reached the top there were more Native \nAmericans or Indians waiting for him. He was surrounded, in a desperate \nsituation. As the story or legend goes, at that point, Major McColloch \nwent to the edge and, on his horse, with his rifle in hand, leapt off \nthe side of this mountain or hill. The Native Americans rushed to look \ndown, feeling that he must have died, and looked down, as the legend \ngoes, to see him ride away on his white horse. They say he made this \n300-foot leap on a horse. I don't know if he did or didn't, but that is \nhow the story goes.\n  What does that have to do with what we are facing here in the Senate? \nIt is personal, but I used to drive Route 40 in those days between St. \nLouis and Washington, DC, when I went to college here at Georgetown. I \nhad a 1962 red Volkswagen, and I used to drive it back and forth. No. \n1, it was a long trip. It was a long trip because there were not many \nopportunities to avoid cities. You went right through the middle of \nIndianapolis, right through the middle of Columbus, and right through \nthe middle of Wheeling, WV. On the famous hill or mountain of \nMcColloch's leap, traffic would slow to a crawl--so slow that although \nI never stopped, I was able to read the sign above McColloch's leap \nbecause I was stuck in traffic and it was right in front of me.\n  I always thought about that--well, someday I will go back and take a \ncloser look at it. Well, I did get back to Wheeling and found out that \nthe old Route 40 has changed a lot, and it doesn't go through Wheeling, \nWV. I don't get to see that sign on the side of the building, ``Marsh \nWheeling Stogies,'' and all the places that used to be there, because \nof the interstates.\n  There are amazing interstate opportunities now around Wheeling, WV; \naround Columbus, OH; around Indianapolis; around St. Louis; around \nChicago, and it calls to mind one of the issues we are facing here at \nthe close of this session: Why do we have such a great Interstate \nHighway System? Three words: Dwight David Eisenhower, the President of \nthe United States, the successful general who led the D-day invasion \nand our conquest in World War II. When he was President, he envisioned \nthe creation of an interstate highway system in America. Where did he \nget the idea? From Germany. He looked at their highway system and \nrealized what an asset it was to that nation at war, that they could \nmove people and supplies in such an efficient manner on the autobahns. \nHe had a vision that the same thing would be available for America. He \ncalled it the Interstate Highway System. He created it in the 1950s.\n  Virtually everyone in America today would concede it was a brilliant \nidea. It has created a backbone for commerce in America. In my State of \nIllinois, having an interstate near your town or passing through your \ntown is really the best thing you could have for your\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\neconomy except for one other thing--having the intersection of \ninterstates nearby. Then you know what is going to happen. There is \ngoing to be a lot of retail, a lot of commerce, a lot of business \nopportunities.\n  So here we have this Interstate Highway System which for almost 60 \nyears has proven to be such a great success in America.\n  Why do I dwell on this issue in the closing moments--we hope--of this \nsession? There are Members of the Senate who have announced publicly \nthat they want to put an end to this. They have said that from their \npolitical point of view, we have to put an end to this Federal, \nnational highway transportation system. They believe it should all be \ndone by States and the localities. They think whatever we have done is \nfine, but from this point forward, the Federal Government should have \nno role, no voice. We should not collect the Federal gas tax and put it \ninto the construction of highways and bridges and mass transit across \nAmerica.\n\n  That is their position. You would dismiss it as just a marginal \npolitical position, but it turns out they have power within the \nRepublican Party. Add to that group those who believe we should not be \ncollecting revenue--any more revenue--for the Federal highway trust \nfund. It explains where we are today.\n  Because of the opposition of these two groups within the Republican \nParty, those who want to do away with the Federal highway program and \nthose who are unwilling to talk about any revenue for the program, \ntoday we are going to be asked for the 33rd short-term extension of \nsurface transportation programs. Just to put this in perspective, we \nused to pass laws that reauthorized the Federal highway trust fund, \nFederal transportation trust fund for 5 and 6 years. That makes sense, \ndoesn't it? If you are going to build a highway, it takes some time. It \ntook a long time in Wheeling, WV, and Chicago and St. Louis. You need \nmore than just a few months' commitment, you need several years of \ncommitment to make an investment that pays off for America.\n  So we used to pass these transportation bills when I was in the \nHouse, even in the Senate. It was the easiest political lift that we \nwere assigned. Why was it so easy? Because Members of Congress could \nnot wait to go home and announce that Federal highway funds were going \nto come back home and make a difference. I was one of them. I do not \nknow how many shovels I have collected over the years from \ngroundbreakings for highways or scissors for ribbon cutting. We do a \nlot of that as politicians.\n  This Federal highway trust fund was a mother lode of public relations \nopportunities for Members of the House and Senate. Why? Because in my \nState 75 to 80 percent of all the money spent in Illinois on highway \nconstruction comes from Washington.\n  So if we can pass this bill, we can point to projects that make a \ndifference. When I was a Congressman, there was a stretch of interstate \ncalled the Central Illinois Expressway that starts on the eastern \nborder of my State at Danville and goes all the way across Central \nIllinois to Quincy, which has dramatically improved the economy of that \nregion--dramatically.\n  I was happy to--every time we would complete a segment--be there for \na photo and a press release. But then the argument started that maybe \nwe should not do this and maybe we cannot afford to ask those who burn \ngasoline to pay a tax to build new highways and to repair the old ones.\n  Now we are stuck in this situation where we cannot pass a Federal \nhighway bill. Madam President, 32 times now--32 times--we have given \nshort-term extensions of surface transportation programs. This one is \nalmost laughable. Listen to this: We are going to extend the Federal \nhighway trust fund for 60 days. What can you build in 60 days? Well, \nyou can fill a pothole--maybe quite a few of them, as a matter of fact. \nBut if you are going to repair a bridge, 60 days does not really give \nyou much to work with. If you are going to build a new highway, that is \nout of the question.\n  So what we are doing, limping along, extending the Federal highway \ntrust fund for 60 days, 6 months, sadly, is ignoring the obvious. There \nare darn few things you can point to with certainty that the government \ncan do to help build the American economy, but one, I am sure, is \ninfrastructure, which used to be a bipartisan issue. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike agreed: build the infrastructure for business to keep \nbusinesses, to attract businesses, and to create opportunities for jobs \nin America--not anymore.\n  Under the Republican leadership of the House and the Senate, they \nhave refused to even schedule a hearing for a markup for the Federal \nhighway trust fund. Nope, not going to do it. They want to extend this \nFederal highway trust fund for 60 days. They, I guess, believe that if \nyou fill enough potholes you can build a highway. I don't think so. \nThey think America can patch its way to prosperity. I don't think so.\n  I think we have to look at the obvious. If we are committed to this \ncountry, to its future, to building the economy and creating jobs and \nkeeping them, if we want our children and grandchildren to have \ninfrastructure that builds competition into the 21st century, you \ncannot do it with a 60-day highway bill. It cannot be done. I had a \nlong discussion with my Democratic caucus over the last several weeks \nand told them I think we are making a serious mistake. I think this \n``go along, get along, 60 days, we are living for a week for Memorial \nDay'' attitude has to come to an end.\n  I think the Republican leadership in the House and Senate has to \nstand and accept responsibility. That means passing a Federal highway \nbill, a Federal transportation bill. It is not just highways and \nbridges, as critically important as they are; it includes mass transit.\n  In the State I represent, Illinois, downstate we love our highways. \nYou get up to the Chicago metropolitan area, we love our highways \nstill, but without mass transit we could not move all the people we \nneed to move to keep the economy humming in the Chicagoland area. \nTwenty percent of this Federal Transportation bill goes to mass \ntransit. Now, I am all for it. I support that; more people in trains, \nmore people in buses, fewer people on the highways, less congestion.\n  I think we ought to look at the big picture, too, even beyond the \nFederal Transportation bill. Can you imagine when that tragedy occurred \non Amtrak just a little over a week ago--I believe eight people lost \ntheir lives and hundreds were injured--that the very next day, the next \nday, the House of Representatives held a hearing and decided to cut the \nappropriations for Amtrak. It is a classic case of ``what are they \nthinking?'' We want Amtrak to be safe, reliable, efficient. The people \nof America have told us they want it to grow.\n  If you want to ride an Amtrak train in my State, coming into Chicago \nor going out of Chicago, you better get a reservation because those \ncars on Amtrak trains are packed. Sadly, most Amtrak rolling stock is \nabout 30 years old, and we are not investing in Amtrak for our future. \nWhere I live, Amtrak makes a big difference. Without Amtrak service out \nof Chicago, headed downstate in Illinois, I can tell you a lot of \nuniversity presidents will tell you they will not have enough students.\n  The students come from Chicago down to Champaign-Urbana to the \nUniversity of Illinois; to Charleston, at Eastern Illinois University; \nCarbondale for Southern Illinois. They take that west side of our State \nrun on Amtrak down to Quincy University in Western Illinois, Knox \nCollege.\n  Over and over again, Amtrak service is a critical part of our State \nand its economy. Yet those in leadership on the Republican side don't \nbelieve in it. They want to see it go away, just like they want to see \nthe Interstate Highway System come to an end. I think they are wrong. I \nthink they are shortsighted. I think the public of this country has to \nspeak up.\n  So I guess I am serving notice here. This 60-day extension will go \nthrough. I understand that. But from this point forward, it is not \ngoing to be automatic anymore. It is not going to be: Well, we will do \nanother 60 days and then we will do maybe 180 days. No. I think we need \nto have a moment in the Senate and in the House where this convenient \nextension, at the expense of America's future, comes to an end. It is \ntime for the Republican Speaker and the Republican majority leader to \nlead, to call together their committees and to pass Federal highway \ntrust fund.\n  They have 60 days--60 days from the end of this month to get it done. \nThat\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nis enough. I hope they do it. Because if they don't, many of us are not \ngoing to stand by again and say: Let's just let this new approach of \npatchwork America become the symbol of our future.\n  The second issue which we still have not resolved, is what to do \nabout the PATRIOT Act. It was 9/11/2001. I was in a meeting just off \nthe Senate floor. We had just seen, on a small television in our room, \nthe second plane crash into the New York Trade Towers. It was pretty \nclear at that moment this was not just an accident. This was done by \ndesign.\n  It was not 15 minutes later that somebody broke into the room and \nsaid: Leave immediately. Get out. There is another plane on the way. We \nevacuated the United States Capitol Building. I have never seen \nanything like it in my life. Tourists everywhere ran out those doors \nand stood out on the grass and looked at one another and said: Where \nare we supposed to go? What are we supposed to do? It had never \nhappened before.\n  Because of that experience and the tragedy of losing 3,000 American \nlives, we came together as a nation and said: We are going to stop this \nfrom happening again. We passed something called the PATRIOT Act, which \nempowered our government to go further than it had ever gone to keep us \nsafe. We put a sunset on it. That was a wise idea. We said: It is not \npermanent law. It is going to be reviewed in a matter of 2 or 3 years \nbecause we are acting now with this emotional feeling about what has \nhappened to America. We think we are doing the right thing, but we want \nto reflect on it and revisit it on a regular basis.\n  Why? Because we are dedicated to the safety of this country, No. 1--\nsecurity and safety--but we are also dedicated to the rights of \nAmerican citizens, our rights to privacy. So we wanted to strike the \nright balance. We thought we did, but we would return to it. Now, we \nare returning again.\n  Here is the basic question we face; that is, what will be the reach \nof our Federal Government in gathering information to keep us safe? \nSpecifically, in this case, we are talking about telephone records, not \nthe substance of your phone conversations but your records. Whom did \nyou call? How long did the call last? Whom did that person call? How \nlong did the call last? Maybe two or three generations of telephone \ninformation.\n  ``Bulk collection'' is the term that is used. It means, basically, \nthat if you suspect someone in my home downstate area code of 217 in \nIllinois, if you suspected someone in that area code of being involved \nin terrorism or connected with a terrorist, the Federal Government \nwould have the power to reach in and gather all of that phone \ninformation from area code 217.\n  You might say to yourself: Well, why would they want to take all of \nit? They certainly have a name or telephone number of the suspect. No, \nbulk collection suggests gathering all of that information. Many of us \nhave questioned over the years whether that is needed or if it was too \nfar.\n  I have offered amendments in the past which were unsuccessful because \nwe did not know details about what the government was doing, and I \ncould not disclose it. It was classified at that time, how much we were \ngathering, how often we were gathering. So over the years, my \namendments would not succeed, but the cause continued to grow, to the \npoint where we now have a USA FREEDOM Act, which says, basically, the \nFederal Government can reach into area code 217 to go after a suspect, \nthat suspect's phone records, and the people that suspect may be in \ntouch with.\n  So we are more or less localizing it, particularizing it, going to an \nindividual rather than collecting all of this information, bulk \ncollection. This is what USA FREEDOM Act does. It limits government \nreach. Now, we do not want to limit it to the point where it endangers \nus. So we went and asked the professional, the intelligence agencies \nand the Department of Justice: Is this new version of the law enough to \nkeep America safe?\n  They came back to us and they said yes. As a result, we have a \nbipartisan bill, which has passed the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats and Republicans, supported by Speaker Boehner, the Republican \nleader, passed overwhelmingly the USA FREEDOM Act, and it has now come \nover the Senate. Why do we have to take this up now? Because at the end \nof May, the authority of the Federal Government to collect information \non telephone records expires. The sunset I talked about recurs.\n  So we have an obligation to do something before the end of May. I \nbelieve we should call up the USA FREEDOM Act that passed in the House \nof Representatives and pass it here. We are told by the President, the \nAttorney General, the head of our intelligence agencies that this is \nenough authority to keep us safe and not go too far. I failed to add, a \nrecent court case in the State of New York found that this bulk \ncollection of telephone records was illegal. So we clearly have to act \nand do something. We can, but it is tied up in knots. This morning, the \nmajority leader came to the floor and took exception to some Members of \nhis own party as well as my party and our position supporting the USA \nFREEDOM Act. I hope that he will give us a chance to pass that, and I \nhope there is a bipartisan majority to pass it.\n\n  The last issue which I wish to address is the trade bill that is \npending. It is a controversial measure. I will not go into any depth. I \ncan't add a great deal to what has been said by so many people on the \nfloor about this legislation. But the currency question raises an \ninteresting question for us. There are ways to have unfair trade \npractices that are not very obvious, and there are some that are. One \nof the obvious ways to deal unfairly in trade is to dump a product in \nanother country.\n  What does that mean? It means if you are going to create and \nfabricate a ton of steel in Brazil and then sell it in the United \nStates for less than your cost of production, you are dumping it. That \nis exactly what happened to us about 12 years ago. Brazil, Japan, and \nRussia decided to dump steel in the United States.\n  Why would any country want to sell steel at lower than the cost of \nproduction. They are going to lose money on it, right? They saw that in \nthe short term, but in the long term they knew what would happen. U.S. \nsteel producers couldn't compete. They couldn't sell at that price. So \nthey kept dumping steel in the United States until more and more steel \ncompanies in America went out of business.\n  Oh, they filed their grievances for unfair trade practices, and \ntherein lies the problem. Those grievances--those complaints--went to \nthe International Trade Commission, which sat down to study the issue \nand make a decision on the issue. By the time they made a decision and \nfound out that yes, there was dumping on, and yes, it was unfair to the \nUnited States, all of the U.S. steel companies that were affected had \nlost and gone out of business.\n  So when you have a trade agreement, it isn't just a matter of having \nprovisions. They need to be enforceable in a timely fashion or we will \nlose business and we will lose jobs in America.\n  We have two other issues before us now. One of them relates to \ncurrency. You can price a product by the value of your currency against \nanother country's currency. China and Japan have developed quite a \nreputation in the world for their currency manipulation to make sure \nthey always had an advantage over the United States, no matter how good \nwe were.\n  So currency is an important issue that has been brought up in an \namendment today, and it is an indication to everyone who follows this \ndebate of the complexity of the debate on trade.\n  There is a second issue that was brought up by Senator Wyden of \nOregon, who is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and \nthat is the whole issue of what to do when you have a dispute with \nanother country about a provision of law.\n  Here is an illustration. Australia passed a law, which required \nwarnings on their tobacco packaging so that people in Australia \nunderstood the health risk of using tobacco. That is not uncommon. We \ndo it in the United States. But Philip Morris, an international company \nthat had offices in Hong Kong, protested to Australia that these \nlabels, which discouraged people from buying their tobacco products, \nwould cost them business. And they used this investor trade dispute \nmechanism, which meant they didn't have to go through the courts of \nAustralia. They went through this basic mechanism,\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nthis tribunal created by the trade agreement. The net result of it was \nthat Australia faced this prospect: Either to remove the law requiring \nlabeling or to pay Philip Morris for the effectiveness of that labeling \non their profits.\n  The argument for this separate tribunal is that you cannot always \ntrust the courts of the country. I heard that from my friend from \nOregon. But also, when you take this out of the court system and let it \nbe decided by corporate leaders, it really puts you at risk.\n  What is going to happen when some company protests in America about \nour environmental laws, about our banning toxic chemicals, about our \ntobacco warnings? That means in addition to going through the courts of \nthe United States, it may also go through a tribunal. I worry about \nthat. Again, that is an aspect of trade which most people don't think \nabout, but it could affect each and every one of us very personally.\n  We are likely to finish this session this weekend, I hope, and we \nhave three important issues. We are probably going to extend the \nhighway trust fund for 60 days--and I hope that comes very soon.\n  I see my friend from Tennessee on the floor. I want to say a word \ncongratulating him for his leadership on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and bringing about an extraordinary bill which passed on the \nfloor of the Senate related to the negotiations with Iran. It is one of \nthe highlights, I might say to my friend from Tennessee, of what we \nhave achieved this year. I thank him for that.\n  I don't know if he serves on any appropriate committee, but if he \ncould take his skill and wisdom to create a bipartisan highway trust \nfund bill, we need it, and I hope we can do it.\n  Secondly, I hope we can pass the USA FREEDOM Act. It is the right \nthing to do, striking a balance between security in America and \nprivacy.\n  Finally, we are likely to complete this part of the trade debate. I \nhope we have a fulsome debate on the amendments, which raise some \nimportant issues, two of which I have spoken to this morning. It is \nimportant that we do this business and we do it right. A lot of people \nare counting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the matter \nbefore us, which is the trade promotion authority that is so important \nto our Nation.\n  I realize that whenever we deal with issues such as this, there are \nalways parochial issues that people deal with in order to make sure \ntheir State's interests are represented well. I realize, for instance, \nthat issues such as the Ex-Im Bank are very important to various people \naround our country based on manufacturing operations that happen to be \nin their States, and I respect that.\n  I appreciated yesterday that we were able to move beyond an issue \nthat was holding us up and get to a place where we are going to be able \nto vote on some final amendments and, hopefully, move trade promotion \nauthority into fruition.\n  I know we have talked a lot about these parochial issues. I want to \nmove back to those in just one moment, but I want to talk about the \nimportance of trade promotion authority and an agreement that I hope \nwill come to fruition after we pass this, which is TPP.\n  I know that many in our country--especially now as we see things on \nour television screen and in newspapers about unrest that is taking \nplace around the world--have been concerned about our foreign policy. \nWe have been concerned about the effectiveness of what we have been \ndoing.\n  One of the areas that our committee focused on this last week was \nmuch of what is happening in the South and East China Seas at present. \nBecause of those activities, I was in Southeast Asia within the last 12 \nmonths.\n  Let me just say that there are concerns there among friends, people \nwho want to move more toward a Western-based value system in their \ncountries. They are very concerned about many of the activities that \nare taking place in the South China Sea but also about the economic \ndominance that is occurring now in China as it continues to export not \nonly its strength into the South China Sea but also its economic \ndominance.\n  They have been very concerned about the fact that our pivot to Asia \nreally hasn't borne much fruit. They haven't really been able to see \nanything very substantial taking place in that regard. I think people \non both sides of the aisle have concerns about what is happening in \nthat area.\n  But here we have an opportunity to do something that has nothing to \ndo with military might, has nothing to do with things that could evolve \ndown the road such as kinetic activity or anything along those lines.\n  We have an opportunity now to hugely shape that part of the world by \npassage of this trade promotion agreement, which will allow the \ncountries to finally put their last deal on the table. Without this, \nthere is no way we are going to get to a final TPP agreement that will \nbring that region more closely aligned to the United States.\n  It calls us to do much greater business with them, which will help \npeople in Tennessee. It will help people in West Virginia. It will help \npeople all across this country to be able to export goods to other \nplaces. But, importantly, it will draw those countries more closely to \nthe United States, and it will act as a buffer against the dominance \nthat is taking place now with China.\n  In meeting after meeting, constantly I was asked: Will the United \nStates come together and deal with this issue in an appropriate way? \nWill the United States actually be our partner? Will the United States \nwork with us to make sure that our economies expand as the United \nStates' economy expands? Will we be able to count on the United States \nto enter into an agreement where we have a balance, where we have the \nopportunity not just to export our goods to China and deal with China \nbut also have the opportunity to deal with the United States? Can we \ncount on the fact that the United States is going to promote free \nenterprise, is going to promote the rule of law, is going to promote \nanticorruption, is going to move away from state-owned enterprises, \nwhich in many cases is dominating that area?\n  I just want to say that TPP--and passage of TPA, in order to cause us \nto come to a final agreement on TPP--is in our national security \ninterest. It is the best way for us to counter what is happening in the \nregion that we consider to be a threat. It is the best way to promote \nAmerican values.\n  In the process, what we are doing is actually raising the standard of \nliving of Americans. So this is a win-win. Again, I know we have a lot \nof parochial issues that people care about rightly--I don't challenge \nthat--and that could possibly get in the way. I hope that over the \ncourse of the next several hours, we will figure out a way to \nappropriately deal with amendments that allow people to voice concerns, \nespecially concerns that they have in their own respective States. But \nI hope, when we move beyond that, when we move beyond disposing of \nthose amendments as a group, that we will come together and pass this \nTPA, which, more than anything else we can do now in the region, will \ncause us to be a bulwark and will cause us to allow people to move \ntoward the Western values that we hold so dear.\n  That brings me to an issue, first, on the national security front. We \nhave a host of former Secretaries of Defense who have signed a letter--\npeople on both sides of the aisle, former generals who have worked in \nthe region. They know how important TPA is and TPP following on. They \nknow how important they are to our national security interests.\n  In addition, I think you know we have had 10 Treasury Secretaries who \nsigned a letter talking about one of the amendments that may be on the \nfloor dealing with currency.\n  I don't know what the office of the Presiding Officer is like right \nnow, but we are being inundated with emails, especially from the auto \nindustry, regarding this currency issue. During the crisis, I know the \nPresiding Officer was serving in the House of Representatives, and I \nwas in the Senate. During the auto crisis, the Senate debated issues \nrelative to the auto crisis. I know the House did the same. But during \nthat crisis, President Bush, late in December, decided that he would \nuse\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nU.S. taxpayer monies to bail out the auto industry. And President \nBarack Obama, who was elected and came into office shortly thereafter, \nfollowed up on what President Bush had put in place. Through something \ncalled TARP, which was unexpectedly put in place to be utilized to bail \nout the financial industry--again, something that was regrettable and \nhad to take place--the auto industry was bailed out. Taxpayers of the \nUnited States bailed out the auto industry to the tune of $80 billion. \nSo $80 billion we invested in the auto industry.\n  What that did was not just bail out the large entities that needed \nthe money, but it bailed out the supply chain that worked to support \nwhat they did in their manufacturing operations. And so the taxpayers \nof this country, in a massive way, in an unprecedented way, back in \n2008 and 2009, injected taxpayer money--taxpayer money--into private \nenterprises to make sure they would survive. It was obviously \ncontroversial. Today, obviously, many jobs have stayed in place as a \nresult of that. People certainly have differing opinions about what \nshould have happened during that time.\n\n  I fear what is happening right now is that the auto industry is back \nand asking for another bailout. In our office anyway, and I think other \noffices around the Capitol, we are hearing from the auto industry right \nnow about a currency provision--a provision they want inserted in TPA \nin order to give them another bailout. They want to ensure, as we move \ninto this agreement, that they will have a competitive advantage.\n  I think all of us understand that the President has said he would \nveto TPA if it has this currency provision in it. We have had Treasury \nSecretaries--10 of them, highly respected on both sides of the aisle--\nwho have told us we should not have currency provisions of this type in \na TPA agreement. I think we understand the difficulties having these \ncurrency provisions in TPA will create in actually completing the TPP \nagreement, which again I have mentioned before. Obviously, it is \nimportant to us economically, but it is hugely important to us from a \nnational security standpoint and from our national interest standpoint.\n  So I know these currency issues sometimes are difficult to deal with. \nI think it is important certainly for Senators to be able to express \nconcerns about things that may happen in their own States, and I \nrespect that. I respect that, but I hope as a body we will rise above \ngiving another bailout to the auto industry because, if we do, it will \ngreatly complicate our ability to enter into an agreement called TPP, \nwhich will be in our national interest, it will be in our economic \ninterest, and it certainly is something Treasury Secretaries, Defense \nSecretaries, and others who know of the great national interest at \nstake oppose.\n  I thank the chair for the time. I hope as a body we will do what is \ngood for our Nation and not just for a small group of people; that we \nwill do something that will stand the test of time; we will do \nsomething that will increase the standard of living for these pages who \nsit before us today and cause them to be safer; that will cause \nAmerican values to be more prolific and certainly benefit our Nation's \neconomy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, in just 10 days, authorization for the \nhighway trust fund will expire. The fund will run out of money entirely \nby the end of July, which means transportation projects in New \nHampshire and across this country will grind to a halt.\n  What is Congress's response to this crisis? This week, leadership \nwill bring to the floor yet another inadequate short-term extension of \nthe highway trust fund authorization, and there is no plan whatsoever \nto address the insolvency of the fund. In other words, once again, we \nare kicking the can down the road. But in this case the road is \noverwhelmed by traffic, badly in need of modernization, and filled with \npatches and potholes. For a country that seeks to remain competitive in \nthe 21st century global economy, this is totally dysfunctional and \nunacceptable.\n  I know my colleagues and the Presiding Officer travel around the city \nof Washington. Sometimes I feel like I am in a Third World country when \nI travel along the roads in DC. There are few more basic and necessary \nfunctions of government than providing for modernized highways, \nbridges, and other infrastructure. Yet Congress is grossly neglecting \nthis responsibility. China spends about 9 percent of their gross \ndomestic product on infrastructure, Brazil spends about 8 percent, but \ninfrastructure spending in the United States has fallen to just 2 \npercent of our GDP. That is half of what we were spending in the 1960s.\n  Our highways and bridges face a more than $800 billion backlog of \ninvestment needs, including nearly one-half trillion dollars in \ncritical repair work, and Americans spend a staggering 5.5 billion--\nthat is billion not million--hours stuck in traffic each year. Yet \nearlier this month, the majority party in Congress voted almost \nunanimously for a budget resolution that will slash Federal funding for \ntransportation by 40 percent over the next decade. This is just \nirresponsible. This isn't about cutting fat and extravagance from the \ntransportation budget; this is about cutting the muscle, the sinew of \nour Nation's critical transportation infrastructure.\n  Last week, I went with the mayor and the city manager to Concord--New \nHampshire's capital city--to inspect one of three bridges that are \ncritical to the city of Concord. It is rusted out and it is now \nclosed--the Sewalls Falls Bridge. Our office had worked with the city \nand U.S. DOT to get the approvals to replace this bridge. The city of \nConcord lined up all the permits--and then nothing. Because of \nuncertainty about Federal funding for the project, it was stopped dead \nin its tracks, until the city and State last week, when they realized \nwe weren't going to act, stepped in with short-term funding in \nanticipation we would finally do the right thing.\n  Well, thousands of other road and bridge projects across the country \nhave been put in this same jeopardy and limbo because of our failure to \ndo our job. This neglect is creating bottlenecks in our economy, it is \nhurting our global competitiveness, and it is killing jobs, especially \nin the construction trades, where employment still has yet to recover \nfrom the recession. According to a Duke University study, providing \nFederal funding to meet the U.S. Department of Transportation's \ninfrastructure requests would create nearly 2\\1/2\\ million jobs.\n  Earlier this month, I joined with a bipartisan group of eight \nSenators who previously served as Governors: Senators King, Rounds, \nKaine, Hoeven, Warner, Carper, Manchin, and myself. We sent a letter to \nour Senate colleagues urging them to commit to fully funding national \ninfrastructure priorities and putting a stop to the destructive, \ndysfunctional short-term fixes that have become routine in recent \nyears.\n  Madam President, you are too young to remember, but I remember being \nin elementary school when Dwight Eisenhower championed our great \nInterstate Highway System. That was a visionary move. I remember \ntalking about it in class and being excited about it. The National \nInterstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 ensured dedicated Federal \nfunding to build a network that today encompasses more than 46,000 \nmiles of roadways. That system has transformed our economy and it has \ncreated countless millions of jobs, but it is now six decades old. Its \ndedicated funding mechanism--the highway trust fund--is in constant \nshortfall and today is just 2 months away from becoming insolvent.\n  So for Congress to pass yet another short-term extension is damaging \nand dysfunctional. It kicks the can down a road that is crumbling, \ncongested, and increasingly uncompetitive. It is time for Congress to \ncome together, on a bipartisan basis, to break the cycle of patchwork \nfixes. It is time to pass a 5- to 6-year funding bill that will allow \ngovernment at all levels to plan long-term capital investment projects \nand to build a 21st century transportation system that meets the needs \nof our 21st century economy.\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                        Exciting News on Cancer\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to speak about an amazing \npresentation I have had the privilege of witnessing twice now in the \npast several months at the University of Pennsylvania, at the medical \ncenter there. I want to speak a little about the work some scientists \nand doctors are doing that is extremely exciting and has great \nimplications for all of us.\n  Let me start with a little background and some facts. In 2014, over \n585,000 Americans died from cancer. There were over 1.6 million new \ncases diagnosed. I think it is fair to say that every one of us has a \nfamily member, a very close friend or we know somebody closely who has \nbeen afflicted with some form of this terrible disease. The fact is \ncancer is on the verge of overtaking heart disease as the leading cause \nof death in America.\n  Now, we have made a lot of progress on many forms of cancer, but we \nstill have a long way to go. I want to speak a little about a very \nexciting new therapy, but let's start with talking about cancer a \nlittle bit itself.\n  The fact is cancer cells have this protective shield, if you will. It \nis a shield that allows the cancer cell to hide from our immune system. \nIf our immune system were able to function normally with respect to \ncancer cells, we wouldn't have cancer. The immune system would destroy \nthe harmful cells, but that doesn't happen in cancer, and it is because \nof this protective shield. So imagine if we could develop a therapy \nthat would penetrate that protective shield and allow our immune system \nto break through and destroy the cancer cells.\n  Astonishingly, the very viruses that have been responsible for \nkilling millions of people around the world--HIV, polio virus, \nmeasles--are now being used to create exactly this capability--this \ncapability to break through cancer's protective shield.\n  Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania--a team of researchers \nled by Dr. Carl June--have developed a process to harness the body's \nimmune system and enable it to identify, track down, attack, and \ndestroy an important form of leukemia, a blood cancer that is most \noften found in children. In their trial, 90 percent of the patients \nwith this relatively rare form of recurrent leukemia went into \nremission after they got this groundbreaking treatment and their cancer \nhas not returned.\n  Dr. June and his colleagues don't ever say this, but they may be on \nthe verge of curing leukemia, and it is very exciting. So let me talk a \nlittle bit specifically about this form of leukemia. Acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer in children ages 1 \nthrough 7. For young children, this is the most common form of cancer \nthat afflicts them. There are 60,000 cases in the United States alone \nof acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is hard to say, so it goes by ALL. \nThis cancer results when abnormal white blood cells accumulate in the \nbone marrow. The leukemia cells then are carried through the \nbloodstream to other organs and tissues, including the brain, liver, \nand other areas, where they continue to grow and divide.\n  Now, most ALL patients can be successfully treated with conventional \nchemotherapy, expensive and sometimes dangerous bone marrow \ntransplants, and stem cell transplants. These therapies have improved \nenormously, and they work in most cases. I think about 80 percent of \nALL cases can be cured with these conventional treatments. But the \nrecurrent ALL--those who don't respond and are not cured by these \nconventional treatments--their prognosis is much worse. Approximately \n3,000 pediatric patients relapse after the bone marrow transplant \nprocedures, and most of these relapses are early relapses and, \ncandidly, have a pretty dismal outcome--only a 15- to 20-percent \nsurvival rate for children with these kinds of relapses. This is where \nthis new therapy comes in. It is called chimeric antigen receptor--or \nCAR-cell therapy.\n  What happens is doctors remove T-cells from the cancer patient. T-\ncells are a type of white blood cell we all have as part of our immune \nsystem. They then take those T-cells and they insert new genes from an \ninactive, harmless component of the HIV virus. They actually use part \nof the HIV virus to get into the T-cells, which gives the T-cells a new \ncapability. Specifically, they develop the capability to identify and \nlink to a protein that is on the surface of the cancer cell. That is \nthe shield that protects the cancer cell. This enables the T-cell, in \nturn, to then destroy that cancer cell. So that is the idea. The T-cell \nis taken out, it is modified with a component of the HIV virus, and it \nis then injected back into the patient, where it multiplies massively \nand begins this wonderful search-and-destroy mission--searching for the \ncancer cells it has been programmed to find and killing them.\n  This treatment is specific to every individual patient and works in \npart because it works with a patient's own T-cells. So that creates a \nwhole set of protocols and challenges. You have to make sure that you \nare withdrawing a person's T-cells. You can go through almost a \nmanufacturing process whereby you transform them so that they can be \nused for this purpose.\n  One of the most exciting things about this therapy is that after a \npatient has been treated, after they have gotten their modified T-cells \nput back into their body and after the T-cells have served their \npurpose, they don't just vanish; they remain in a person's system. They \nremain as part of the immune system, sort of on standby, ready and able \nto attack if the cancer should emerge.\n  They are still in the trial phase of this new process. Dr. June and \nhis team were willing to take on the most difficult cases. In fact, \nthat is all they were allowed to take on initially. The first 30 \npatients they tried this therapy on had already undergone chemotherapy \nseveral times and the chemotherapy had failed. In fact, everything had \nfailed for these patients. They had no treatment options left. By the \ntime they got to Dr. Carl June and his team, these patients had weeks \nto live.\n  In the first trial, 27 of the 30 patients were cancer free 1 month \nlater--So 1 month after receiving the treatment, no cancer--and 78 \npercent of the patients were alive 6 months after the treatment.\n  Now, 125 patients have received this personalized cellular therapy at \nthe University of Pennsylvania for several kinds of leukemia. They have \nmodified the treatment to address other forms of cancer, including non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma, for instance. In more than 90 percent of the \npediatric leukemia cases they treated, the patients are still in \nremission. Four out of five adults with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have had \ncomplete remissions.\n  This is amazing stuff. It is very exciting. Scientists, medical \nresearchers, and doctors across the country who are following this have \nbeen blown away by the success, and they refer to it as ``a major \nbreakthrough,'' as ``phenomenal,'' and it has been what ``we've been . \n. . hoping for.''\n  Just last year, the FDA agreed that the progress is so stunning that \nthey granted what they call ``breakthrough therapy'' designation for \nthis therapy, for this treatment, because of the success they have \nshown in the early trials. This designation is going to allow Dr. \nJune's team to treat more patients more quickly who are in these very \ndifficult circumstances.\n  In fact, the University of Pennsylvania is already working with \nNovartis in anticipation of the time that they will be able to roll \nthis out as a standard treatment, where it will one day--hopefully \nsoon--no longer be considered experimental and no longer be the last \nresort for patients but an early resort. The conventional treatments--\nchemotherapy and bone marrow transplants and stem cell treatments--tend \nto have very unfortunate adverse side effects. It has been necessary \nbecause they can be successful. But one of the wonderful things about \nthis therapy is there are no lingering side effects.\n  So it is enormously encouraging. It is very exciting. One of the \nthings that are most exciting about this is that this technique \nconceptually could very well apply to any number of cancers, maybe all \ncancers. It is not a small matter. It is a challenge. But these guys \nare meeting this challenge. The challenge is to design the \ntransformation of the T-cell in a way that will pierce that shield, \nthat unique shield for each form of cancer, and they are making \nremarkable progress. They\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nhave also made tremendous progress on fighting multiple myeloma, which \nis another blood cancer that is very serious.\n  I should point out that Dr. June and his team at the University of \nPennsylvania are not alone in pursuing this general direction. MD \nAnderson in Texas is working to use the common cold virus--the virus \nthat causes the common cold--to help fight brain tumors in a similar \nfashion.\n  Penn researchers have already developed a way to engineer immune \ncells in mice to fight a very dangerous form of brain cancer, and that \nhas been so successful in the animal trials that this fall they will be \nable to begin human trials on this as well. This kind of brain cancer \nthat they will be trying to treat affects over 22,000 Americans. It is \ncalled glioblastoma. People who are diagnosed with stage IV \nglioblastoma are in very dire circumstances. The mean survival rate is \nless than 18 months. This is, in fact, the form of cancer that took the \nlife of Senator Kennedy, a former colleague of so many of us. This is \nextremely exciting. And ``60 Minutes'' did a profile on some doctors at \nDuke University who are using a reformulated version of the polio \nvirus. Instead of HIV, they are using the polio virus in a similar \nfashion to enable our immune system to attack this brain cancer, \nglioblastoma.\n  I am, frankly, fascinated and incredibly excited about the progress \nthese scientists and these doctors are making. But along the way, to \nget there, it costs money, and there has been a struggle for the funds \nto get this done. Dr. June's study has been supported by the NIH, by \nthe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Specialized Centers of Research Grant \nProgram, and a Stand Up To Cancer-St. Baldrick's Dream Team \ntranslational research grant.\n  In 2008, the NCI had originally denied funding because they thought \nthis was perhaps too risky. Fortunately, the Leukemia & Lymphoma \nSociety and the Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy stepped in.\n  After they treated the first several patients, despite their success, \nthey ran out of money and they had to stop treating patients for over a \nyear while additional funding was lined up.\n  The fact is, this research funded by the NIH has given us tremendous \nstrides in early detection and treatment methods and survival rates for \na variety of cancers but especially for this work.\n  I know my colleagues and I are committed to continuing to fund the \nkind of research that makes these breakthroughs possible in a \nresponsible way. I wanted to come down to the floor today and talk \nabout how important this is and how exciting this is. I personally \nthink we are in an extraordinarily exciting moment for health care for \nour whole society. Technology is producing spectacular breakthroughs, \nand it seems to be happening on an accelerating basis. Some of the big, \ngigantic intellectual breakthroughs of recent years--the Human Genome \nProject, the gene sequencing--the technology that is available now \nwasn't even imagined a few years ago. The combination of these things \nis enabling us to make discoveries and breakthroughs and treatments \nthat were beyond human imagination just a few years ago. So I think we \ncould be on the threshold of some absolutely stunning and wonderful \ndevelopments. Personalized medicine is a big part of it. Understanding \nhow our genes contribute to the health care problems we have but also \ncan be used to combat these problems--I think this is all readily \nwithin reach. I am very excited about it.\n  In closing, I guess my message is that when we think about where we \nare and how close we are to these stunning cures for some amazingly \ndevastating diseases, I think we should set our goal at curing these \ndiseases. Our goal shouldn't be to figure out how we treat this, how we \nextend life for a few months. We will do that for as long as we have \nto, but our goal should be to cure. Our goal should be to cure cancer. \nOur goal should be to cure heart disease. Our goal should be to cure \nAlzheimer's. We are going to be able to do this. We should make this a \ngoal. We should make this a priority.\n  We have a lot of competing priorities for the limited resources \navailable to the Federal Government. I can't think of any that are \nhigher than this extremely noble effort, and I can't think of any \nreason not to support it. It is within reach. The progress is stunning \nand exciting, and it is happening all across America and very much in \nPennsylvania. I am proud of the work that is being done in \nPennsylvania, and I look forward to seeing it continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am speaking today on the underlying \nbill, but I do want to indicate, supporting my friend from \nPennsylvania, that there is incredible, exciting work being done with \nthe National Institutes of Health that is focused on those cures. I \nthink the challenge for us is that the budget that was passed will \nactually end up cutting NIH, and with this very bad policy of \nsequestration that I hope we are going to be able to fix--if that \ncontinues, then we will not only not have the ability to move forward \non exciting cures, but we will actually be seeing NIH cut, which I \nthink would be foolish and devastating to all of us in the long run \nand, for a lot of reasons, going in the wrong direction. So I hope we \ncan work together on a bipartisan basis to fix that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  Madam President, let me first say, coming to the floor on the \nPortman-Stabenow amendment, that I ask unanimous consent to add two \nmore cosponsors today: Senator Tester and Senator Markey. That brings \nus to a total of 30 bipartisan cosponsors on this very important, \ncommonsense amendment outlining the importance of the biggest 21st-\ncentury trade barrier, and that is currency manipulation. So I thank \neveryone who has joined together to cosponsor this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I also know there has been a tremendous amount of \nenergy going on trying to defeat this amendment in the last day, and \nthere are a lot of comments being made on the floor. I do want to first \nof all say in response to comments from someone whom I greatly respect, \nthe Senator from Tennessee, who has played an incredibly important role \nin moving forward on some important foreign policy issues, that I would \ncaution that we call support for manufacturing--whether it be autos or \nothers or supply chains or materials manufacturing--somehow a bailout \nwhen we are talking about protecting American jobs--I would point to \nthe fact that there is a very important company, Alcoa, in Tennessee \nthat just received an advanced technology vehicle loan. I was proud to \nauthor that loan program back in 2007 in the Energy bill. They make \naluminum, as we all know, and they are retooling to be able to benefit \nfrom Ford Motor Company's policy of moving to aluminum to take 700 \npounds out of the F-150 truck to make it more energy efficient. Alcoa \nis benefiting, a Tennessee company. I don't consider that loan a \nbailout any more than I consider any other loan programs we put \ntogether for manufacturing a bailout.\n  But I would suggest that we have literally millions of jobs across \nour country connected to the supply chain, whether it is autos, whether \nit is dishwashers, whatever it is that we are making.\n  We have manufacturers--large and small--telling us that if we are \ngoing to move forward and give negotiating objectives to this \nadministration to negotiate a trade agreement with 40 percent of the \nglobal economy in Asia, we better understand that the No. 1 trading \nbarrier used by Asian companies is currency manipulation--No. 1. I find \nit astounding. It would almost be funny if it were not so crazy. There \nare these arguments, on the one hand, that somehow, setting up a \nnegotiating principle and just saying that if you negotiate something \non currency, we want it to be enforceable for the first time--not just \nwords--we have a lot of words. We have years and years of lots of words \nabout currency manipulation. But this time, if you actually negotiate \nsomething, we want it to be enforceable. And somehow that is going to \nbring down the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If that is the case, then we \nhave a lot more to be worried about than this amendment, in my \njudgment, in terms of what sounds like not a very good agreement \noverall.\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\n  We are continually hearing, on the one hand, that things are getting \nbetter with China, that Japan does not do this anymore, and that the \nBank of Japan does not do this anymore. But if they do not do this \nanymore, then why do they care? How can anyone with a straight face say \nthey will walk away from a major Trans-Pacific Partnership because we \nsay to our negotiators, on the list of things we think are important on \nbehalf of American businesses and workers, that we count currency \nmanipulation in that list. And by the way, if you do something--and we \ndo not prescribe what it ought to be--it ought to be enforceable.\n  I am astounded at the amount of energy going into this to say this is \na poison pill. The reality is that in the House of Representatives this \namendment would actually pick up votes, and there is going to be a lot \nof need to pick up votes in the House of Representatives.\n  I do not know anybody who says they are voting for this and that \nsomehow because this is in here--or somebody who is not voting for it--\nthey would not actually vote for the TPA.\n  It is amazing to me, and it is amazing to me that my partner in this \nis a former U.S. Trade Representative who sat at the negotiating table, \nwho supports TPA, who is saying that this is reasonable and will not \ninterfere with the ability to negotiate.\n  As I said before, I would like to go further. I would like to say \nthat you do not get fast-track authority unless you do something on \ncurrency because this has cost us over 5 million jobs and counting. But \nthat is what this amendment says. This creates maximum flexibility for \nthe administration. It simply says on the list of things that are \nimportant that we care about wages, we care about the standard of \nliving, we care about protecting the environment, we care about \nintellectual property rights, and we care about currency manipulation. \nAnd if you put something in there, it should be enforceable under the \ninternational rules under the WTO and meet the definition of the IMF. \nWe are not mandating the outcome of any particular negotiation. If \nsimply having this in here means that Japan walks away, then there is \nsomething else going on here that we ought to all be very, very \nconcerned about.\n  We have also heard that this will affect countries to attack us on \nour domestic policy, including quantitative easing. Our amendment \nexplicitly exempts domestic monetary policy. In fact, in the text of \nthe amendment, it says: ``Nothing in the previous sentence shall be \nconstrued to restrict the exercise of domestic monetary policy.''\n  In the side-by-side by the leaders of our Finance Committee--by the \nway, they have no such exemptions, which is interesting. Some have \ncontended that by adopting our amendment, particularly Japan will walk \naway. They really cannot have it both ways. Either the Bank of Japan is \nor is not doing what they have done for 376 times in the last 25 \nyears--376 times, despite the fact that they signed on the dotted line \nwith 188 countries, signed on the dotted line through the International \nMonetary Fund: We are part of the IMF, and we will not manipulate our \ncurrency. And they have done it 376 times. So if they are not going to \ndo it anymore, why should they care that we put this in as a priority \nfor the United States, for our workers and manufacturers? And if they \ncare so much and if they would walk away just by our simply raising \nthis and saying we ought to do something enforceable, it is obvious \nthere is going to be 377. And we ought to all be extremely concerned \nabout that, because what does that mean? What are we really talking \nabout?\n  It means foreign products are cheaper here and American products are \nmore expensive there, and in a global economy, when our manufacturers \nare competing not to get into Japan but competing around the world with \nJapan, we have already seen the results at other points in time--\nanywhere from $6,000 to $11,000 more on the cost of one vehicle. Think \nabout that. As a consumer, you are going to buy a car, and there is a \n$6,000, $8,000, $10,000, $11,000 difference in price. That is a big \ndeal. That is a very big deal. I mean, for all of us who say we want a \nlevel playing field on trade, that our people are smart and competent \nand compete successfully with anybody, we ought to care about this--\nthat when the Bank of Japan intervenes, we are seeing anywhere from a \n$6,000 to $11,000 difference in the cost of an automobile. This has \ncost us over 5 million good-paying jobs in America.\n  I thought that was supposed to be our priority. That was our job--to \nbe fighting, but not for the Bank of Japan. In fact, Ford Motor Company \nsays they will compete with anybody around the world, but they cannot \ncompete with the Bank of Japan. So this is about a level playing field.\n  Why does it matter? It is not just about selling in Japan. Unlike \nAmerica, the Japanese have a preference for buying their own vehicles \nas a matter of patriotism in their country. I wish we had the same. So \nit is not just about getting into Japan, the little, small islands of \nJapan. It is about competing with them on everything in between. It is \nabout the 1.2 billion people who live in India, where we are trying to \nsell to them and Japan is trying to sell to them. If they can sell a \nvehicle for $6,000 or $10,000 less, what do you think is going to \nhappen? It is about the 200 million people in Brazil, whom we are \ntrying to sell to and Japan is trying to sell to.\n  They are fighting so much, even having a negotiating principle that \nsays: If we put language in, it ought to be enforceable. If they are \nfighting so much, it must be because they are really looking at those \ncountries and saying: You know what; we want that $6,000 difference. We \nwant that $10,000 difference. We do not want anything to get in the way \nof that.\n       Frankly, protecting Japan, Japanese automakers and \n     suppliers, and Japanese workers is not our job. It is not our \n     job. Our job is to stand up for American workers and American \n     businesses, and that is what this amendment is all about.\n  By the way, the issue of currency manipulation affects every part of \nthe economy--agriculture, medicines, and every part of the economy. All \nwe are saying is to give us a shot here. Give American manufacturers \nand workers a shot, at least by saying in fast-track that we want \nsomething done on currency. If you do it, it should be enforceable.\n  Countries have been signing up for years saying they will not \nmanipulate their currency and nobody has ever enforced it. No one has \never enforced it. All we are asking is if we negotiate something, it \nshould have enforceable standards. It is not enough to have a handshake \nagreement anymore.\n  How many years do we have to go on and how many millions of jobs do \nwe have to lose, when all we get is good-faith assurances and \nhandshakes?\n  Let me say this. I hope when this debate is done, the intensity to \ndefeat this amendment that our manufacturers promote--by the way, they \nalways support free trade. These are folks who are in the global \neconomy, and they want to trade. But if we are going to put aside \nAmerican manufacturers, American suppliers, American workers, I hope \nthe next thing we will do is to focus on fast-tracking the middle class \nand have as much intensity, as many late-night calls, and as many \nmeetings together to make sure we have a minimum wage in this country, \nto make sure we have a long-term investment in transportation that will \nnot only deal with safety and fixing roads and bridges and transit and \nrail for our farmers but that creates millions of jobs. I hope we have \nas much intensity on that.\n  I hope we have as much intensity on lowering the cost of college so \nkids have a fair shot to do what we want them to do, which is work \nhard, to get the grades, to go to college, and to go to work. I hope we \nhave as much intensity around that.\n  If we had more intensity around fast-tracking the middle class, we \nwould not have to worry so much about what we are doing on trade \nagreements.\n  I hope we have intensity about closing loopholes that are allowing \ncompanies to go overseas on paper while they still drive on our roads, \nbreathe our air, drink our water, and send their kids to schools here \nbut avoid paying their fair share because they moved on paper.\n  I hope we have as much intensity around that. I hope we have as much \nintensity about making sure that in this global economy, we have a race \nup to increased standards of living, wages with which you can care for \nyour family and send the kids to college and do\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\nall the things that we want to do for our families rather than having a \nrace to the bottom where somebody is told if you just work for less and \nlose your pension and health care, we can be competitive. So let's have \nfast-track. Let's have fast-track about the things that really matter \nto people in this country, which is getting back to having a middle \nclass where you can stay in the middle class.\n  While we are at it, let's pass an amendment that makes it clear we \nget how important currency manipulation is--when we are giving up our \nright to amend a trade agreement, when we are giving up our right to be \nable to use a 60-vote threshold on a trade agreement. And at least \nthere ought to be a provision in there that says: Do your best on \ncurrency. And, by the way, if you get some language, how about we make \nit enforceable this time? Five million jobs and counting--that is what \nwe lost and that is enough.\n  I hope my colleagues will come together and support the Portman-\nStabenow amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                              Memorial Day\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, as Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee in the Senate, and on the eve of Memorial Day, I think it is \nappropriate that we pause for a moment. We debate as Democrats and \nRepublicans today on the floor of the Senate currency, trade, national \nsecurity, fast-track, and the issues of the day in a contentious \ndebate. We do so freely. We do so without fear of retribution. We do so \nwhen we go home tonight knowing we are at peace and comfort and knowing \nthat we are in a safe nation. We are because of the men and women who \nhave worn the uniform, sacrificed, and given their lives so America \ncould exist today.\n  I think it is only appropriate that each of us on the Senate floor \ntake a moment to pause and give a prayer for our soldiers who risked \ntheir lives and gave their lives for our country.\n  For me, as the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I make an \neffort to go to the American cemeteries all over the world to make sure \nwe are still taking care of them and honoring those who sacrificed the \nway they should be honored.\n  I want to share with the Senate a brief story to point out how \nimportant Memorial Day really is.\n  On Memorial Day in May of 2007, I went with Senator Burr and other \nMembers of the Senate to the American Cemetery in Margraten in the \nNetherlands where over 8,000 Americans are buried who fought in the \nBattle of the Bulge to root the Nazis out of Germany and liberate the \nJews from concentration camps. They were successful, but they died.\n  I walked down the rows of crosses and Stars of David looking at each \nname--ostensibly looking for Georgians so I could say a brief prayer \nfor them. I came to the end of row H, toward the back of the cemetery, \nthe last cross in that cemetery, and it said the following: Roy C. \nIrwin, New Jersey, died December 28, 1944. A tear welled up in my eye \nbecause that was the day I was born.\n  Mr. President, 70 years later I have existed as a free person in a \nfree society, been elected to the United States Senate, served in the \nmilitary, raised a family, have had nine grandchildren, and have had \nall of the joys everybody in the Senate has had thanks to people like \nRoy C. Irwin, who on the day I was born died on the battlefield of the \nBattle of the Bulge in the Netherlands while fighting for democracy, \nfreedom, the liberation of Europe, and saving the Jewish people.\n  No matter what we debate or how contentious it gets, we must remember \nwhat Memorial Day is all about. It is about those who made the ultimate \nsacrifice for you and me to engage in this debate and to move our \ncountry forward.\n  One other point. We should say a special prayer for the parents of \nthose young Americans who fought and died in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nthe current wars today. We had a tragedy with the fall of Fallujah, and \nwe had a tragedy with the fall of Ramadi. We need those parents to know \ntheir sons and daughters did not die in vain; they died for a cause \nthat ultimately will prevail because we, as Senators, will see to it \nthat America does what America always does, and that is liberate the \noppressed of the world and only ask for one thing when we leave, and \nthat is a couple of acres to bury our dead who sacrificed for \ndemocracy, freedom, and liberty.\n  On this Memorial Day, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nI say thank God for the American soldiers who fought and died for our \ncountry, and thank God for the United States of America.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to share \nsome remarks and show my support for the Portman-Stabenow currency \namendment.\n  I think we are at a point in world history and world trade where our \nmercantilist trading partners have gotten to be very clever. On \noccasion, they use a variety of tools, some of which are used all of \nthe time. Among these, we are seeing that we are unfairly subjecting \nAmerican manufacturing to currency manipulation, and this is not free \ntrade. It is not free trade. Currency manipulation and other trade \nbarriers are just as much of an obstacle to free and fair trade as are \ntariffs. That is one of the things that we have to get a handle on if \nwe are going to protect our workers here in America.\n  After the Korea trade agreement, which I voted for, the numbers did \nnot materialize that were promised. In 2010, before the trade agreement \npassed, President Obama's Web site said:\n\n       . . . the U.S.-Korea trade agreement . . . [would] add an \n     estimated 70,000 jobs from increased goods exports alone, \n     with additional job potential from the further opening of \n     Korea's large services market to American firms, and other \n     measures.\n\n  Well, that is what I had hoped would happen. He said it was an \nadvancement of the idea of free and fair trade and so forth.\n  His own Web site said that the U.S.-Korea trade agreement would \nincrease exports of American goods by $10 billion to $11 billion and \nthat the agreement would help create 70,000. Well, I guess 4 or 5 years \nhave passed now. Have we achieved a $10 billion increase in exports to \nour ally, our friend, our tough, smart trading partner Korea? Did we \nget that kind of improvement? The answer is no. We are at $0.8 billion, \nless than $1 billion. But what about Korea's imports to the United \nStates? Did they go up or down? Korea's imports to the United States \nduring this time have increased by $12 billion. It almost doubled the \ntrade deficit between our countries.\n  I am saying this because it raises a fundamental question: What is \nhappening here? In this trade agreement, people have been pretty \ncareful--the promoters of it. They have not promised it would reduce \nthe trade deficit, they have not promised it would create new jobs, and \nthey have not promised it would increase wages. They suggest it. They \nsay things like it will increase job prospects or wages in export \nindustries. Well, we only export 13 percent of what we make. So this \nhas been the only promise that they made.\n  I have asked the President--written him--and asked other colleagues: \nTell me if you believe this agreement is going to increase jobs. Tell \nme what studies and documents you have that say it will increase wages. \nTell me or show me any reports or data that would suggest this trade \nagreement we now have before us would in some way reduce our surging \ntrade deficits, which hit a virtual record last month--or at least in \nMarch. They are not going give an answer, and I have to tell you why--\nbecause jobs are going down, not up, and the trade deficit is going up \nand not down, and that is not good.\n  Well, why do they persist in this? I suggest that it is an ideology. \nI have suggested that it is almost a religion. We are for any trade \nagreement or any file or stack of papers that has ``trade agreement'' \non it. Why? Well, I recall that back in the late 1990s, then-Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was before I believe the Budget \nCommittee, which I was a member of, and I asked him a question. The \nquestion was this: Mr. Greenspan, if we are trading with a country and \nthey stop buying all products from the United States and block our \nsales to them but want to sell products to the United States\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nand want us to buy their products, should we buy them or not buy them? \nThat is a pretty simple question, and I remember it well. Should we buy \nfrom them? What do you think his answer was? Yes.\n  I believe that is an extreme idea. I think that is an idea that in \ntheory could have some validity, but you have to know, colleagues and \nfriends, it is out there. It is a fundamental part of the movement for \ntrade agreements that people don't really care whether they are \nreciprocal or not, and they are not worried about whether they shut \ndown plants and facilities in your community, whether people lose their \njobs, because their theory is that you are getting a better product at \na cheaper price, and that is the only thing that counts, that is the \nmost important thing, and somehow this is going to all work out.\n  The Wall Street guys who manage capital can move their capital to \nanyplace in the world, and they think they will do fine. But nobody is \nthinking about what it is like in the real world where people's jobs \nare at stake, where our steel industry is under stress and we are \nfacing competition that is not fair. I just feel strongly about that.\n  I am reversing, in a way, my position on trade. I believe it is time \nfor this country and this Congress to begin to ask tougher questions \nabout why we continue to have huge trade deficits, why we continue to \nhave a decline in wages, a decline in median family income--$3,000 \nsince 2009--and why all of these things are happening. Part of it is \nthat we have been unwilling--unlike our trading competitors--to ask \nthese kinds of questions. I think we are operating on a religious view \nof trade.\n  How do you deal with that?\n  Mr. Dan DiMicco wrote a very important article in Forbes magazine a \nfew months ago. The title of it is `` `Fast Track' To Nowhere: Congress \nShouldn't Give Obama Power To Ram Through TPP.'' He is a former CEO--\nactually, CEO emeritus, I think--of Nucor Steel. They have steel plants \nall over America, and they are in one of our most vibrant, competitive \nindustries. They deal with foreign competition every day. He lives with \nit. Currency and issues like that are critical to him and anybody in \nthe steel industry, automobile industry, or manufacturing industry. \nThese things are real. It is not academic. It is not theory. It is \nreal.\n  He said a number of things in this very important article. He talked \nabout the cheerleaders for trade and said they make a big mistake.\n\n       That's net trade--not gross trade. In other words, net \n     exports increase our economic size while net imports shrink \n     it. This is not a liberal plot, or a Tea Party plot, or a \n     protectionist plot. It is basic and uncontroversial economic \n     math that the TPP cheerleaders either don't understand or \n     don't want to.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In 2013, the U.S. economy amounted to $16.8 trillion. \n     Consumption was 68% of GDP. Investment was about 16%. \n     Government procurement was about 19%. But net trade \n     subtracted about 3% from our economy (because imports \n     exceeded exports.) This shrinkage is cumulative, compounding \n     year after year.\n       America is the picture of an unbalanced economy, \n     disproportionately relying upon unsustainable consumption. \n     Investment is too small. . . . Stated another way, we need to \n     produce more of what we consume.\n\n  Isn't that true? So this theory--it doesn't make any difference where \nproducts are made as long as they are cheaper? This is comparative \nadvantage? People can manipulate their currency, they can subsidize \ntheir industry so they can have more exports, more people working, and \nit makes no difference to us, and we can allow American businesses to \nfail?\n  Then he talks about mercantilism. This is the strategy of most of our \ncompetitors. He said: ``Free trade was crafted as an antidote to \nmercantilism, not an enabler of it.'' So he says our trade policies \nhave not confronted our competitors' mercantilism and therefore we have \nenabled them and have allowed them to continue.\n  Then he quotes President Reagan. I know a lot of people say President \nReagan believed in total free trade. He did not. He was a realist.\n  This is what Mr. DiMicco says:\n\n       President Reagan gave a speech that established the \n     principle of ``free and fair trade with free trade and fair \n     traders.'' More specifically, he established the 3 R's: \n     Rules, Reciprocity, and Results.\n       ``Rules'' mean that the trade must be rules based and every \n     nation should follow them. ``Reciprocity'' meant that there \n     will be reciprocal reduction in tariffs, quotas and other \n     barriers rather than one-sized reduction. ``Results,'' the \n     point forgotten most, meant that America must gain a net \n     benefit from trade arrangements rather than being taken \n     advantage of.\n\n  I believe it. My father always taught me that a good trading \nagreement, a good contract, a good business deal was when both parties \nreceived advantages.\n  Another person who knew Ronald Reagan well was Clyde Prestowitz. \nClyde was the President's counselor to the Secretary of Commerce in \nPresident Reagan's administration and Vice Chairman of President \nClinton's Commission on Trade. He negotiated Asia trade agreements with \nJapan and others. He was there. In his article he makes a very harsh \nstatement about President Obama's statements. He said: Will the \nJapanese be driving Chevys in Tokyo?\n\n  The President suggested we want to see more American-made cars being \ndriven in Tokyo. He quoted the President as saying:\n\n       Why wouldn't we want to rewrite those rules so there is \n     some reciprocity and we can start opening up the Japanese \n     market? That would be good for American workers.\n\n  Mr. Prestowitz responded to the President's statement saying:\n\n       Hearing that amazingly ignorant statement one could only \n     wonder if there is no one in the White House to prevent the \n     President from embarrassing himself. Apparently he is unaware \n     of the endless efforts of U.S. trade negotiators over the \n     past 50 years to open up the Japanese market. As one of the \n     Reagan administration's lead negotiators with Japan and as \n     the Vice Chairman of President Clinton's Commission on Trade \n     and Investment in the Asia-Pacific Region, I can assure the \n     President that reciprocity in trade with Japan has been the \n     aim of every agreement signed by both Republican and \n     Democratic administrations for half a century. I can also say \n     that virtually no former U.S. negotiator believes the TPP \n     will achieve reciprocity with Japan.\n\n  They have nontrade barriers that Mr. DiMicco lays out in his article; \nhe names them. These are not allowing for free trade, reciprocal trade \nthat produces results that are beneficial to America.\n  We can do better. We absolutely need more trade. We need to continue \nto negotiate good trade agreements, but this creates a situation that \nis dangerous.\n  What kind of numbers do we have about this agreement? Do we have any \nstudies, anybody who says anything other than what I believe, which is \nthat it is going to be a net negative to our balance of trade?\n  Well, the Wall Street Journal, that usually support trade agreements, \nhad an article by Mr. Mauldin that examines a study by Mr. Peter Petri, \nprofessor of international finance at Brandeis University. This was \njust released this week, May 18--or at least this article was. He talks \nabout the auto sector. Mr. Petri has done this study--the only study I \nknow of that has dealt with the question.\n  The article says: In the transportation sector, led by cars, the TPP \ncould boost imports to the United States from Japan by $30.8 billion by \n2025, compared with export gains to Japan of $7.8 billion, according to \nMr. Petri. That sounds like the Korea agreement.\n  So we would export $7.8 billion more, but Japan would export $30.8 \nbillion more to us. The result is what? Less American manufacturing on \nnet, more cars being bought from abroad, and a greater detriment to our \ntrade balance. That is just the way it is.\n  So I believe we need to get away from the religious view of trade and \nwe need to do what President Reagan said, which is to look at the \nresults. Don't tell me some theory. Let's live in the real world. It is \nour duty to see our manufacturers, our workers get a fair chance to \ncompete in the world marketplace. We are not sufficiently there now.\n  A part of this trade agreement that I have mentioned before and that \nI am very concerned about and that has gotten very little discussion \nand that needs to be discussed, I will take a minute to discuss it.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service--our own group--the \nTPP's ``living agreement'' provision is ``unprecedented.'' Indeed, I am \none of the few, I think, who went to the secret room to read the secret \ndocument, and when it described the living agreement, it said it was \nunprecedented. I presume\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nI will not be arrested for making that quote from the secret document.\n  The United States Trade Representative's Web site is very candid \nabout the purpose of this living agreement provision. It is to ``enable \nthe updating of the agreement as appropriate to address trade issues \nthat emerge in the future as well as new issues that arise with the \nexpansion of the agreement to include new countries.''\n  It creates a commission--another commission--consisting of \nrepresentatives from each member nation, which has vast powers to \ngovern the agreement and govern, to some degree, the countries that \nparticipate in it. Among the powers given to the Commission is the \nauthority to consider any matter relating to implementation and \noperation of the agreement and to consider amendments and \nmodifications.\n  What we have to understand is that this is a new entity, an \ninternational entity, of which we are a member, and it gets to meet and \nvote and set new behaviors unlike what we approved in the Senate. But \nit can be amended as time goes by. It is unprecedented. This has not \nbeen done before.\n  While the TPP states that those amendments must be agreed to ``in \naccordance with the applicable legal procedures of each party,'' that \nphrase is not defined. The TPP ``Chapter Summary''--a book that is \nprovided to Members when we go to the secret room--states that this \namendment process would occur similar to the process that occurs under \nthe WTO, the World Trade Organization.\n  So it says how the--the procedure is being handled like WTO. But \nunder WTO and its implementing legislation, changes to the agreement \nand the addition of new parties are not to be approved by Congress, \nand, more importantly, not by consensus or a unanimous vote. The \n``Chapter Summary'' states that this process will be similar to the WTO \nunder which the WTO can be--members can be added and certain amendments \nadopted by a two-thirds vote.\n  So it gives the appearance of having consensus as the basis.\n  In addition, new member nations under WTO can be added by only a two-\nthirds majority vote--that is pretty clear--and apparently would be \ncleared under this agreement.\n  So we have asked the President: What does this mean? Can China be \nadded by a simple majority vote? We vote no and it happens anyway?\n  We asked the U.S. Trade Representative staff about this situation. \nThey didn't have an answer. This is a staff of the administration \npushing for the bill. They simply asserted that changes to the TPP \naffecting U.S. law would require congressional approval. We asked \nwhether USTR would agree to make that explicit in the TPP so we didn't \nhave--wouldn't have any ambiguity, and they have declined to give us a \nreply.\n  So if it is true that congressional approval is required, then why \nshouldn't they be willing to have it explicitly in the TPA and the TPP? \nIn fact, there are already examples in the TPP of other countries \nmaking clear that certain procedures must comply with their domestic \nlaw. Why don't we make it ours? I have offered an amendment to that \neffect. I am disappointed that it is apparently not going to be given a \nvote.\n  While the TPA states no standard trade agreement that has not been \nlegislatively implemented can trump existing Federal, State or local \nlaw or prevent any Federal, State or local government from amending or \nmodifying its law, the implementing legislation of a trade agreement \nwould do these things and could--and certainly will--in many areas. It \nwill delegate congressional authority when we pass it to the new TPP \nCommission.\n  So by voting for it, we have delegated authority, it will be \ncontended and probably correctly, that we gave it to them to amend the \nlaw. This is especially important because the whole purpose of fast-\ntrack is to implement and expedite this legislation.\n  So I think these trade agreements need to be considered carefully by \nCongress and the American people before the United States cedes one \niota more of American authority and sovereignty, and Congress must \nretain the power to carefully review and vote on all future changes to \nthese trade agreements.\n  So I have offered this amendment. As Mr. Mark Hendrickson recently \nwrote in Forbes magazine, discussing what I had said about this: TPP \ncannot be an ``open-ended document'' lest ``the rule of law and \nrepublican government itself be lost.''\n  That is why TPA must provide strong and enforceable protections \nagainst this kind of overreach.\n  We just have to be careful. The normal process for treaties is a \nrigorous one. It requires, in the end, a two-thirds vote. So they have \nwritten this not as a treaty but as an agreement. It will be moved \nforward in a way so that when the final agreement hits the floor, it \nwill be unamendable, it will be not subject to a 60-vote threshold to \nmove forward, and it can be passed within 20 hours, without a single \namendment, on a simple up-or-down vote.\n  I really believe it is time for us, colleagues, to move away from a \nreligious view of trade to ask what is happening in the real world. If \nour businesses, our manufacturers, and our American workers are not \nbeing treated fairly on the world stage, we should take action to \nensure they are. I believe in trade, and I have supported it over the \nyears. But I think it is time for us, in light of declining wages, a \ndeclining middle class, surging trade deficits, to ask ourselves: Can't \nwe do better with our trade agreements? Here we have this huge one, \nrepresenting 40 percent of the world economy, creating a new commission \nwith all kinds of powers to be able to add new members that we may not \napprove of, and we are just going to pass it, hardly without reading \nit. Very few Senators have been to the secret room to see what is in \nthe document.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                        Issues Before the Senate\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the three bills \nthat are pending before the Senate: The trade bill, the highway bill, \nand the continuation of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Every one of us is in love with our cars. America is in love with \ntheir cars. Every one of us can remember the first time we learned to \ndrive. I started out on country roads in an International pickup truck \nwith cow bodies on the side--those are the wooden slats that go out--so \nI could put my heifers on the little Ranch that I had, so I could haul \nthem around. That is how I got to and from high school. Every one of us \nhas a different story like that. America has been spoiled because of \nthe automobile. It has now become an exceptionally creature-comfort \nroom in which we can suddenly climb in and lose ourselves in beautiful \nmusic, comfortable seats, while easily accessible in the cup holder is \na cup of coffee. But America's love affair with the automobile will not \ndo us any good if we don't have any roads to drive on and especially if \nthe roads are just filled with potholes or if you can't go across the \nbridges because they are in danger of falling down.\n\n  Of course, that leads us to the obvious; that here in front of us is \nthe highway bill, a transportation bill which involves other things as \nwell--transportation safety and considerable transportation \nenhancements in urban areas. But we can't get together, even though \nprobably every one of the Members of the Senate would agree we have to \npass a highway bill.\n  The problem is we can't figure out how to fund it. It has to be \nfunded with something called revenue. It either has to be taken out of \nthe general revenues of the U.S. Government--and Lord knows those \nrevenues are being cut back with this meat-cleaver approach across the \nboard called the sequester, the results of which--for example, we have \nhad the Joint Chiefs up here telling us this is going to severely \nhamper their ability to protect the national security. We have had the \nhead of NIH up here telling us about the consequences of the sequester \nin the past. A few years ago, when the sequester kicked in, he had to \ncancel 700 medical research grants, all of which almost all of us would \nsupport because of the extraordinary medical research successes that \nwere going on. So general revenue out of the U.S. Treasury is going to \nbe hard to come by to fund the highway bill. If we do this month, 2-\nmonth, 6-month extension, all that is saying is that we are going to \npull that out of general revenue.\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\n  Then, transportation companies, departments of transportation back in \nour respective States, can't plan on building the roads because they \nhave to have such lead times for the design and engineering and the \neventual building of the roads. It is similar to building an aircraft \ncarrier. Money cannot be appropriated for an aircraft carrier in 1 \nyear. It is going to take, in the case of an aircraft carrier, a decade \nto build. Well, it doesn't take a decade to build most of our roads, \nbut clearly one has to plan ahead to know the money is there so you can \nproceed.\n  What good is America's love affair with the automobile if we don't \nhave the efficient roads to drive on? Where is the money coming from? \nWell, some people have suggested a sales tax, others have suggested \nupdating the gas tax, and others want to look to general revenue. It is \ntime for us to come together and determine what that should be.\n  I can say to the Senate that this Senator will consider anything that \nwill give us the revenue so we can build this crumbling infrastructure, \nparticularly roads and bridges. One of the things that immediately does \nis it creates all kinds of jobs. I have seen one commentary. I don't \nknow that this is accurate, but it illustrates the point. If you spend \n$1 billion in building roads, there is some huge number of thousands \nand thousands of construction jobs.\n  So let's get real. Let's come up with the revenue. Now that is the \nFinance Committee. One place to start is the gas tax. The gas tax has \nnot been updated. Also, when it is updated, it needs to be calculated \nfor the increases in the cost of living over time. Since it is a user \ntax, it perhaps needs to be combined with other sources of revenue \nbecause we are going to have to face the music and come up with the \nrevenue. One of the issues that is holding us up right here, right now, \non a Friday afternoon just before Memorial Day weekend, is figuring out \nwhat we are going to do on continuing the highway bill authorization.\n  Mr. President, one of the other issues in front of us is the trade \nbill. This Senator is one of the Democrats who has voted for the trade \nbill known as fast-track, which is to enact a procedure that when the \nPacific trade agreement is negotiated, finalized, and announced, it can \nbe considered by the Congress, after ample time for examination, and it \nwould then be considered with an up-or-down vote, instead of the normal \nprocess where it would be subject to amendment.\n  Put a trade bill together with another 11 nations in the Pacific \nregion. If it were subject to the amendatory process in the Senate and \nthe House, it would get pecked to death. It would never survive the \nlegislative wars; thus, the need for this trade promotion authority, \nthe TPA, that we have in front of us.\n  I believe we will pass it, I believe it will be an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote, and I believe a big vote out of the Senate will send a \nsignificant message to the House, where there are some rumblings of a \nproblem. At the end of the day, when the Joint Chiefs come in front of \nyou and say that this is one of the most important things for them for \nthe national security interests of the United States in that region of \nthe world, the Pacific arena, then at the end of the day, it likely \nwill pass, and in this Senator's judgment it will be in the interests \nof our country.\n  Mr. President, the third issue that is before the Senate is the \nPATRIOT Act. Now, every one of us, if we were here--whether you were \nhere or not, you remember exactly where you were on that fateful day of \nSeptember 11, 2001. A number of us were in a room right off the floor, \nright over here on the west front. We were in a meeting with the \nDemocratic leader, the majority leader, Senator Daschle. The meeting \nstarted at 9 a.m. We saw on this grainy black-and-white TV what had \nhappened in New York. The human mind wants to play tricks and deny the \nreality of what was happening; that, in fact, it was no accident that \ntwo planes had flown into the two distinct towers of the World Trade \nCenter, but all doubt was cast aside when suddenly someone burst into \nthe room and said, ``The Pentagon has been hit.''\n  We leapt to the window overlooking the west side of the Mall and \nlooked in the direction of the Pentagon, and sure enough there was the \nblack smoke rising where the third plane had hit. I immediately raced \nto a telephone to try to reach my wife because we had just moved into \nan apartment overlooking the southwest corner of the Pentagon. I wanted \nto tell her to get out of the apartment and move down into the \nbasement. I couldn't reach her.\n  By the time I came back, the room was vacated. Out in the hallway, I \nsaw security take the majority leader and the minority leader off in a \ndifferent direction to a prearranged place for the congressional \nleadership in times of national security threats and national attack. I \nwill never forget going down those major stairs right out this door of \nthe Senate Chamber, and at the bottom of the stairs the Capitol Police \nshouting at the top of their lungs: Get out of the building. Get out of \nthe building. Run. Run.\n  They had heard the reports that there was a fourth airplane inbound. \nThat was a fateful day.\n  I huddled up outside with Senator Rockefeller, trying to get hold of \nour staff to tell them to vacate. Later in the day, the Capitol Police \ntold Senator Rockefeller and me not to come back to the Capitol \nComplex. We ended up at Senator Rockefeller's home. I was still \ndesperately trying to get my wife on the telephone. I will never forget \nthe eerie silence over Washington because all air traffic had been \nstopped, and that silence was pierced by F-15s and F-16s as they were \nflying CAPs over the Nation's Capitol.\n  Well, because of that attack that killed some 3,000 Americans--the \nfirst time, by the way, that we were rudely awakened to the fact that \nour national security was not protected here at home by two big oceans; \nthat an enemy could, in fact, attack and attack within--then how to go \nafter them to prevent it in the future.\n  That led to the PATRIOT Act. That led to trying to give our \nintelligence community and the NSA, the National Security Agency, the \ntools to, when the bad guys are planning--wherever they are, abroad or \nhere--and we get some snippet of evidence that they are planning a \ndastardly deed, we can give our intelligence community and our law \nenforcement the tools to try to go after them.\n  Now, let me give you an example. It used to be that if we would \ninvade somebody's privacy by going after their telephone, we would have \nto get a court order to be able to tap that telephone. Well, then came \nthe present-day technology. The terrorist does not use just one \ntelephone. The telephone they use now is multiple cell phones and, \ntherefore, you had to update the law to allow you to be able to go \nafter them and see whom they were calling--not from one telephone but \nfrom multiple telephones.\n  That is just one example of how the law was updated. The law was also \nupdated to allow the NSA to be able, at the request of the telephone \ncompanies, to obtain the business records--not the private \nconversations but only the business records--which showed that on such \nand such a date this number called this number and for how long. All \nthe telephone companies did not comply. A lot of them did.\n  The PATRIOT Act was enacted to allow a process whereby you would go \nto a special court classified for national security information, called \nthe FISA Court, and that court would give the appropriate legal \nauthority for the NSA to obtain those records.\n  Now, this whole disagreement in front of the Senate is over how you \nhold those business records. It has been misstated on the floor of the \nSenate that this is obtaining private conversations, invading privacy. \nThis is just a question of how you hold those records.\n  There will be an attempt to extend the current law, toward which I \nhave some degree of positive attitude, and that is at the request of \nthe NSA. Those records are held by NSA--the telephone business records.\n  But the legislation that we are going to vote on, the USA FREEDOM \nAct, is a change--a slight change--of the current law. It says that \nthose records would still be retained by the telephone companies; that \nthey would have to retain those records and not destroy them for some \nperiod of time; that if the government suspects terrorist activity, it \nwould go to get a court order to obtain the business records of a \nparticular number or person subject to a judge's order, just as we do \nif law enforcement or the FBI wants to go into\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\nour home and get evidence. They have to go to a court to show probable \ncause to the judge that, in fact, there may have been a crime \ncommitted.\n  This is the same process. You go to the classified court that can \nhandle the classified information. The court gives an order to obtain \nthose business records. Why is that important? It is important because \nwe might get a snippet of information about such and such a terrorist \nor such and such a number that has been used by the terrorist or \nsomeone suspected to have been talking to a terrorist. Then, in order \nto protect ourselves, the intelligence community and law enforcement \nare going to have to go and get the records so they can see where that \ncall went and then, from that person or number, where it went one more \nhop, with a limit of two hops.\n  This Senator prefers not to have those limitations. But that is not \nwhat is in front of us. So this Senator from Florida is going to \nsupport the USA FREEDOM Act because it is so necessary that by the end \nof this month the PATRIOT Act does not cease to exist because of all \nthe other provisions in it that allow our intelligence community to try \nto get the information to protect us before the terrorists can strike.\n  I can tell you, as a former member of the Intelligence Committee at \nthe time that this PATRIOT Act was drawn up and later amended, and I \ncan tell you as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nit is my judgment that this is clearly in the national security \ninterest. We cannot take the risk to let the PATRIOT Act cease to exist \nso that we do not have the tools to protect ourselves.\n  My final comment is that every day these bad guys are trying to do us \nin. Every day they are trying all kinds of things to find what is the \nlittle flaw or what is the little defect in our defenses. If we do not \ncontinue this legislation, as I am suggesting it be amended by the \nlegislation in front of us, then, in fact, we are not giving just a \nlittle crack in the door for the terrorists to get in, we are opening \nup the entire barn door. That clearly is not in the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n             The Middle East and the President's Leadership\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the evolving \nsituation in the Middle East. I have grave concerns, as do a majority \nof Americans, with the President's handling of the current situation in \nthat region of the world. Under this President's watch, the world has \nbecome increasingly unsafe. Under this President's watch, despots have \ndug in, and the most horrific terrorist organization we have ever seen \nhas risen to power and thrives.\n  This week the reality of this failure was brought to the forefront of \nthe world's attention. The fall of Ramadi marks the capture of another \nmajor city. We lost more than 1,300 U.S. soldiers in Anbar Province. \nThousands more were wounded. We fought across every foot of Al Anbar \nand now a handful of ISIS fighters have seized its Provincial capital. \nFor those in Ramadi, this was not just a setback; this cost them \neverything. Hundreds have already been executed at the hands of ISIS. \nBut the White House does not see it that way. The White House has tried \nto spin a different narrative, downplaying the significance of this \ndefeat.\n  When this narrative is challenged, the White House doubles down. The \nWhite House Press Secretary said: ``Are we going to light our hair on \nfire every time that there is a setback in the campaign against ISIL?'' \nSuch comments are dumbfounding and disturbing. The Obama administration \nis not only demonstrating a complete lack of situational awareness but \na total disconnect with how this conflict is being viewed by the rest \nof the world.\n  In fact, this week, President Obama chose to lecture the graduating \nclass of the Coast Guard Academy about climate change while Ramadi \nburned. To ISIS combatants in Syria and Iraq, the fall of Ramadi was a \ndefinitive victory. Even if it hands Ramadi back tomorrow, ISIS has \nshown it still has the capability to make major advances. To those \nliving in Ramadi, ISIS has already won. Regardless of what happens \nnext, for many of those people, their lives have been destroyed.\n  To potential recruits around the world, ISIS just won again, despite \nU.S. air strikes and 3,000 trainers for the Iraqi Army. However, \naccording to Secretary of State John Kerry, the fall of Ramadi was only \nISIS taking advantage of ``a target of opportunity.''\n  Does the Obama administration not understand how terrorist \norganizations operate? ISIS is not going to line up and go toe-to-toe \nwith the United States. It is going to seek out targets of opportunity \nwherever it can and avoid conflict where it knows it will lose. That is \nhow it operates. That is how it has been operating since the beginning \nof this conflict, all the way back to January of 2014, when President \nObama referred to ISIS as the junior varsity of terrorist \norganizations.\n  Ramadi can be retaken. America can defeat ISIS. But we cannot beat \nISIS with half measures while consistently underestimating its \ncapabilities. This terrorist organization must be stomped out. It must \nbe defeated.\n  In Syria, ISIS is now in control of Palmyra, an ancient site with \nirreplaceable monuments that may soon be destroyed. Called the ``Venice \nof the Sands,'' this may be yet another historical scar left by ISIS \nthat will never heal.\n  President Obama often speaks of regional powers needing to step up \nand take the lead. Well, let's just be honest here for a moment. The \nUnited States has the most powerful military in the history of the \nworld. If our President does not show a little leadership, no one else \nis going to step up and lead.\n  If we are not going to utilize our overwhelming technological \nsuperiority to fight this enemy, at the very least--at the very least--\nembedding spotters with Iraqi forces to make air strikes more \neffective, why would others want to contribute their far more limited \nresources? We need our President to show absolute conviction that \ndefeating ISIS is his No. 1 priority, not trying to reach a mediocre \ncompromise on an Iranian nuclear deal, not having Secretary Kerry fly \nto Sochi to shake hands with Putin while he still occupies the \nterritory of other countries, and not having a summit at Camp David to \nlecture our allies on what America thinks is in their best interests.\n  There is a terror organization killing people, as we speak, in a \ncountry that we fought to liberate from a brutal dictator. We had won \nin Iraq. We had defeated this insurgency until it was determined, for \npolitical reasons, that we should pack up and go home. The President \nclaims he does not want to get into another prolonged war.\n  Well, unfortunately, that is exactly what he is doing. There is no \nway to defeat ISIS with half measures. There is no way to negotiate \nwith ISIS. Unless ISIS is defeated, it will grow and spread like a \ncancer. This President, throughout his administration, has shown \nhimself to be crippled by indecision. Against ISIS, we need decisive \naction. We need it now.\n\n\n                     Honoring American Fighter Aces\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to speak today to recognize the tremendous \nand selfless service of America's veterans. This week Congress honored \nAmerican Fighter Aces, the 1,447 military pilots who have earned the \nspecial distinction of destroying five or more hostile aircraft in air-\nto-air combat, by awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Of these distinguished aviators, 10 hailed from South Dakota. While \nthey are no longer with us today, their heroism and valor have not only \nbuilt the foundation of the modern air superiority that our Armed \nForces employ today but have shaped who we are as South Dakotans and \nAmericans.\n  Becoming an ace was no easy feat. In World War I, the pioneers of \ndogfighting faced perilous situations in wood and canvas biplanes that \nhad limited ranges and could barely top 100 miles an hour. Still, these \ninnovators refined the still-adolescent technology of flight and \nforever changed the nature of modern war.\n  Decades later, American pilots proved invaluable in turning the tide \nof World War II. Fighters flew attack and bomber escort sorties over \nEurope and attack and fleet protection missions in the Pacific. Just 2 \nweeks ago, when America and the world celebrated the 70th anniversary \nof V-E Day, 56 World\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nWar II-era aircraft in various formations flew over the National World \nWar II Memorial, the National Mall, and the U.S. Capitol in an \nimpressive display of the air power that helped secure victory for the \nallies.\n  The aerial parade included an F6F Hellcat, which one of my heroes, my \ndad Harold, flew off the USS Intrepid in the Pacific theater.\n  While my dad was one aerial victory short of achieving ace, his \nsquadron mate and fellow South Dakotan, the late CAPT Cecil Harris, \nracked up 24 victories.\n  Harris, a farm boy from Cresbard, SD, ended the war as the second-\nhighest Navy ace. South Dakota also produced the second-highest ace in \nthe Marine Corps during World War II, Medal of Honor recipient Joe \nFoss. Foss earned the title of ``ace'' in just 1 week in 1942 on his \nway to a total of 26 air victories.\n  Foss's service and leadership continued after the war. He helped \norganize the South Dakota Air Guard unit. He was recalled to duty in \nthe Korean war. He went on to serve two terms as South Dakota's \nGovernor and even as the first commissioner of the American Football \nLeague.\n  Our airport in Sioux Falls, Foss's hometown, is home to the South \nDakota Air National Guard 114th Fighter Wing and is appropriately named \nJoe Foss Field.\n  South Dakota is also proud and grateful for the service of our other \neight aces: Clarence Johnson, from Aberdeen, who was killed in action \nover Holland in 1944; Robert Graham from Beresford; Robert Buttke from \nLemmon; LeRoy Grosshuesch from Menno; Leslie Clark, from Mitchell; \nArthur Johnson, Jr., from New Effington; Gene Markham from Turton; and \nRobert ``Duke'' Hedman, from Webster, who achieved ace in a single day \nover Burma on Christmas Day in 1941.\n  When you come from rural America, it can be hard sometimes to see how \none might fit into the larger scheme of global events, let alone the \ndefining moments in our history. Yet when the world erupted in chaos \nover the Second World War, these were 10 South Dakotans in the thick of \nit. These are but 10 heroic examples of the dedicated selflessness \nSouth Dakotans have shown in conflicts past and present. South Dakotans \nhave always punched above their weight when it comes to military \nservice.\n  As the age of jets arrived and the capabilities of aerial firepower \nand defense systems have increased, the title of ``ace'' became even \nmore elusive. Still, on Wednesday, we celebrated the 40 American aces \nfrom the Korean war, as well as two pilots and three weapons systems \nofficers from the Vietnam war.\n  The maturation of our air combat capabilities, from the origins of \naerial combat in biplanes to the sophisticated airframes and advanced \nweapons systems on which we rely today, rest heavily on the courage of \nAmerican fighter aces. These aviators represent the best of our \nAmerican Armed Forces and helped shape history with their courage.\n  As we reflect on the gallant service of America's fighter aces, may \nwe also remember all those who answered the call to serve, all those \nwho supported the effort on the homefront, and those to whom, I should \nsay, we are forever indebted--those who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  This Memorial Day, as a free and grateful nation, may we remember \nthose who have fought and died for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise to talk and continue the \nconversation we were having in the Senate about trade and the need to \npass trade promotion authority, all geared toward hopeful entry and \nfinal conclusion of a Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement that this \nSenate will be able to vote on to approve or disapprove, if it is not a \ngood bargain, and eventual conclusion of a treaty with the European \nUnion, TTIP, and what we can do to make sure we are fashioning a trade \npartnership in this country to truly grow our economy.\n  One of the things that have made me so passionate over the years \nabout public service has been the economic circumstance and the \nconditions of rural America, what happens to Main Streets across our \ngreat Nation that are suffering. They have more boarded-up storefronts \nthan they have ever had at any other time in history. Perhaps one of \nthe greatest things we could do right now to help Main Street, to help \ncreate new jobs and opportunities, is to pass trade promotion authority \nlater today, tomorrow, whenever we get to it--to make sure it passes \nwithout provisions that could break up any future negotiations but do \nso in a way that allows agreements to be entered into like the Trans-\nPacific Partnership--all benefiting rural America and particularly \nrural Colorado.\n  To make rural America more successful, we have to find new ways to \nbring new value to those things we can produce in rural America, \nwhether it is wheat crops, corn crops or a small manufacturing \nbusiness. How do we add value to what is produced in and across rural \nAmerica?\n  According to a 2012 Peterson Institute for International Economics \nstudy, it is estimated that industries across this country could see a \n2-percent increase in added value as a result of a finalized Trans-\nPacific Partnership Agreement. So when we talk about adding value to \ncrops, and we talk about adding value to goods produced in rural \nAmerica, this study shows that if we pass the trade promotion authority \nand move to the successful conclusion of TPP, it adds value to what we \nproduce across this country, creating jobs and opportunity.\n  There are a lot of people who are concerned about the trade promotion \nauthority, people who are maybe opposed to it, people worried it may \nnot create the kind of value others believe it will.\n  But the conservative Heritage Foundation had a study that showed \ntrade was adding $1.7 billion to our GDP in 2013. In fact, this same \nstudy showed that, according to the Heritage Foundation, trade brings \nvalue to the average American household of over $13,000 per family. \nThat is $13,000 per family added to income in a household, that they \nwould be able to succeed with to achieve greater opportunity, to raise \ntheir value of life, to raise their quality of life--all because of and \npossible through trade.\n  Trade promotion authority is the first step we will take in this \nChamber and across the hall to the House of Representatives to make \nsure we are giving the tools to our negotiators to develop the best, \nstrongest, possible agreement.\n  Now this agreement doesn't just say do whatever you want, this \nagreement has sideboards on it, firewalls that create opportunities to \nenter into the best deal possible to direct our negotiators to tear \ndown barriers.\n  Some of the concerns I hear from people who may be unsure about the \npassage of trade promotion authority seems to be: This is about big \nbusiness, isn't it? This is only going to benefit those corporations \nthat are the biggest in the United States.\n  But that is simply not true, because what free-trade agreements allow \nus to do is to tear down trade barriers. It allows us to break those \nbarriers that are creating impediments to doing business. In fact, if \nyou are in a big business, corporate welfare has become a common way \nthat you are actually trying to succeed in this country. Corporate \nwelfare, where you have a lobbyist you can pay--or a team of lobbyists \nyou can pay--to provide, to get or to gain a special tax preference or \nmaybe there is a trade barrier you would like thrown up against some \nother nation that is importing goods into the United States, and this \nbig corporation says, you know what, we think we can stop this through \nspecial interest favors--so what is an advantage in big business is \ncorporate welfare.\n  By entering into a free-trade agreement by passing trade promotion \nauthority, allowing us to tear down those trade barriers like the TPP \nwill, it actually helps all businesses in this country by eliminating \ncorporate welfare, by taking out the advantage that a big business has \nto hire lobbyists to curry favor through legislation, giving small \nbusinesses an equal opportunity with that value that they added through \na trade agreement to sell their goods around the world.\n  So the Trans-Pacific Partnership, trade promotion authority, these \nare agreements that focus on sending goods from Main Street to \nMalaysia,\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nwhat we can do to create economic opportunity in Colorado and beyond, \nbecause everybody in Colorado is benefitting right now from free \nmarkets and free trade; 265,000 Colorado jobs are supported by trade \nwith nations that are represented in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In \nfact 48 percent of all Colorado goods, 48 percent of the goods we \ncreate in Colorado, were exported to nations represented in the TPP, \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  In a State that exported over $8.4 billion worth of goods, we can see \nthe kinds of jobs and economic opportunity that trade promotion \nauthority will lead to. In fact, there have been economists who have \ntalked about pillars of our economy; one pillar being lower taxes, one \npillar being spending restraint, one pillar being lessening the \nregulatory burden on businesses around this country. But another pillar \nis trade, the ability to create goods in the United States to send them \noverseas. That creates jobs and opportunity for all of us. Whether it \nis our agricultural commodities, whether it is manufacturing in \nColorado, aerospace or technology, we know we will benefit from a \nstrong agreement that tears down barriers giving big and small \nbusinesses alike the opportunity to enter into a promising economic \nopportunity that we will all share in.\n\n\n                              Memorial Day\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to talk about this upcoming weekend. \nPeople and families across this country will be celebrating Memorial \nDay, sharing time with family and friends celebrating the weekend. In \nColorado, normally you would be celebrating by possibly going to the \nlake or going on a hike in the mountains or down the river, but \nunfortunately the weather may not be as nice as it has been in past \nyears. We are receiving much needed rain and moisture, but it may not \nlet up in time for a lot of the outdoor activities that we would \nnormally enjoy over Memorial Day.\n  But one thing that will not be dampened, one thing that will not stop \nis the observation of Memorial Day and the tribute, the thoughts, the \nremembrance that we pay to those who served our country. Now, it may be \na little wetter than normal, there may be more tents than perhaps the \njackets we usually have, but Coloradans across the State will still go \nto the cemeteries paying their respects. They will still share stories \nwith their families about the members of their family who have served \nthis country, who have given so much and sacrificed so greatly for this \ncountry.\n  It is 70 years ago this year that one of the Colorado Guard units was \ninvolved in World War II in the liberation of Dachau. Seventy years \nago, Felix Sparks was one of the first to arrive on that atrocious \nscene. That is something that will no doubt be on the minds of many \nveterans in this country and in Colorado this year, the sacrifices they \nhave given so people all around this world will be able to enjoy \nliberty, share in the democracy that free people have, and where we can \ncontinue to provide opportunities to enrich liberty, to promote \ndemocracy. That is what this Nation will continue to do thanks to the \nsacrifices of our veterans and the noble goals and efforts of those men \nand women in uniform today.\n  I wish the people in this country a very good Memorial Day.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of Senator Blumenthal for up to 5 minutes, the Senate \nrecess today until 2 p.m., and that the time during recess count \npostcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Memorial Day\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from \nColorado in celebrating and saluting on this historic day the service \nand sacrifice of so many of our military men and women who have given \ntheir lives so we can enjoy the precious freedom all of us will benefit \nfrom over this weekend. The freedom to gather as we wish, speak as we \nplease, worship, and gather together with friends--all of these \nfreedoms are due to the service and sacrifice of the men and women \nwhose lives we celebrate this weekend.\n\n\n                       Identity Theft of Veterans\n\n  As it happens as well, my office is issuing a report that shows our \nveterans and servicemembers often are victims of practices around the \ndiscounts and promotions that will be offered this weekend. Many \nretailers will offer sales and discounts to our veterans and, in fact, \nour veterans are twice as likely as the ordinary population and the \ngeneral public to be victims of identity theft and fraud because they \nare asked to provide information in connection with taking advantage of \nthese discounts.\n  I am proposing reforms to be adopted by the Department of Defense \nunder existing authority, and these reforms will save veterans from \nidentity theft and fraud when retailers offer discounts but demand \nsensitive personal information.\n  A national recognition of service card will honor our heroes and save \nthem from scammers who may prey on them after they provide this \ninformation. Retailers who commendably--and I emphasize commendably--\noffer veterans discounts, especially around this holiday and others, \nshould not put them at undue risk in verifying their status.\n  As Memorial Day approaches and as we celebrate it today, the \nDepartment of Defense should adopt the recommendations of the report I \nam offering today. And I will offer legislation, if necessary, to \ncompel these kinds of reforms. Our veterans and servicemembers need and \ndeserve commonsense protections so discounts don't become really bad \ndeals. The reforms, such as the national recognition of service card, \ncan guarantee privacy and protection for our veterans and \nservicemembers, even as they take advantage of the discounts and \npromotions that will be offered to them over this Memorial Day weekend, \nand avoid disclosure of information to third parties who may not \nprotect that information as they should.\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM Act\n\n  I want to say a few words about the choice currently before this body \nin connection with the USA FREEDOM Act and the PATRIOT Act--words that \ncome to mind over this Memorial Day weekend so often and frequently on \nour lips. This issue before our body is a profoundly important one. It \nhas been framed as a question of whether the Senate passes the USA \nFREEDOM Act or the short-term extension of the PATRIOT Act that \nauthorities say is a compromise.\n  There is supposedly a compromise before this body, but let's keep in \nmind that the USA FREEDOM Act is, in fact, a compromise. It reflects \nthe views of hawks and doves, Democrats and Republicans, the House and \nthe Senate, the Congress, the executive branch, and the judiciary.\n  Many of us have made significant concessions to reach the USA FREEDOM \nAct. In fact, I have wondered at times whether to walk away from this \nso-called compromise because it does too little in the way of reform \nand perhaps shortchanges the proposals I and others have made to \nprotect privacy and balance that protection with the very profoundly \nimportant need to preserve our national security.\n  A short-term extension is not a compromise. The USA FREEDOM Act is, \nin fact, already a compromise, and that is why I have opposed and will \ncontinue to oppose a short-term extension, even when it is portrayed \nand depicted as a compromise, as has happened so far.\n  Another important point here is that a short-term extension will not \nsolve our problem. A short-term extension is simply an invitation for \nmore uncertainty, more litigation, more expense, and, in fact, more \ncompromise to our national security.\n  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has made it absolutely crystal \nclear that if Congress authorizes section 215, the Second Circuit will \nread it as disallowing bulk collection. That court held: ``If Congress \nfails to reauthorize Section 215 itself, or reenacts Section 215 \nwithout expanding it to authorize the telephone metadata program . . . \nthe program will end.''\n  That means if Congress passes the so-called short-term \nreauthorization, phone companies in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont \nwill not be able\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\nto comply with a bulk collection order. Around the Nation, the court of \nappeal's ruling is the law of the land, or should be given that \nrespect, and it will be unclear around the land and throughout this \ncountry what kind of order, in fact, is demanding of them. The result \nis likely to be legal uncertainty that will last long after Congress \ndecides to act.\n  The only way to avoid endless litigation is to pass legislation that \nspecifies what section 215 allows, what it does not allow, and the only \nproposal that does that task is the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I continue to believe that one of the central core provisions of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act is that it requires transparency and the adversarial \nprocess, containing reforms that I proposed to make sure that this FISA \nCourt is no longer a secret tribunal considering arguments in secret \nand issuing secret opinions--exactly the kind of court that prompted \nour rebellion from England. When it operates and when it hears \narguments, it should hear both sides--it should hear from an adversary \nto the government that offers a different point of view. Courts make \nbetter decisions when they hear both sides of the argument. That is why \nI proposed from the start a constitutional advocate who will make \narguments against the government without compromising the need for \ntimely warrants and other surveillance and without in any way reducing \nthe secrecy of this court where it is appropriate.\n  I hope this body reaches a result that includes the USA FREEDOM Act. \nI hope we pass it. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my observation about the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3274-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been having a lot of people ask me \nwhere we are on the USA Freedom Act of 2015, and we actually have a \nvery interesting, easy choice: We can either pass the bipartisan bill \nthe House of Representatives passed with a majority of Republicans and \na majority of Democrats voting for it, or we can let the expiring \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act sunset at the end of the month. Some \nmay prefer that. I think the House made a number of improvements which \nprotect our freedoms and protect our security, and that is what we \nought to pass.\n  Some people have talked about short-term extensions. Well, we could \nhave a 2-day extension or we could have a 5,000-year extension; we \nwould be extending something that doesn't exist. The fact is that the \nHouse gave us the USA FREEDOM Act in plenty of time to act upon it, to \namend it if we wanted to, to send it back and go to a conference. But \nnow the House has adjourned and gone on recess. If we don't vote for \ntheir bill, we will end up at the end of the month with nothing. There \nwill be nothing to extend. We could feel good about passing an \nextension, but we can't extend something that is dead.\n  I have worked for more than two years with Members of Congress from \nboth parties and in both Chambers to develop the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2015. It is a commonsense, balanced reform bill that protects \nAmericans' privacy, while also ensuring our national security.\n  The bill doesn't go nearly as far as the bill I first introduced in \nOctober of 2013 with Congressman Sensenbrenner. It doesn't go as far as \nthe USA FREEDOM Act that was filibustered last November by Senator \nMcConnell and others. At that time, the incoming majority leader wanted \nto wait and see how it would be with a Republican majority and was able \nto rally his Members to delay reform. But we shouldn't delay it any \nfurther. Americans deserve to have their privacy restored and their \nnational security protected. There should be no more excuses.\n  In the bill Senator Lee and I have introduced and supported, the USA \nFREEDOM Act of 2015--it has not just our support, it has the \nadministration's support, it has the support of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, the Attorney General, the FBI Director, a \nsupermajority of the House of Representatives, the technology industry, \nprivacy and civil liberties groups, librarians, and the NRA. I mean, \nwhen are we ever going to find all these groups coming together? Well, \nthey came together because they know the USA FREEDOM Act is a good \nbill, and the support for our bill continues to grow.\n  Just yesterday, national security experts at the conservative \nHeritage Foundation concluded that the USA FREEDOM Act ``strikes a \nbalance between maintaining our national security capabilities and \nprotecting privacy and civil liberties.'' Why? Because it is a \nreasonable and responsible bill. When we get the civil liberties \ngroups, the NRA, the Heritage Foundation and privacy groups together, \nwe have something.\n  I have been here 41 years. I have seen very few pieces of legislation \nwhere these diverse groups come together, and they did because the USA \nFREEDOM Act is a responsible and reasonable bill. But even if they \nhadn't come together, it is the only option left for any Senator who \nwants to avoid a sunset of the surveillance authorities at midnight on \nMay 31. We won't be in session. The other body won't be in session. The \none thing that will happen is our current authorities will sunset. They \nwill go away. Wow. Can't you hear the cheers from some of our enemies?\n  Last year when the current Senate majority leader led the filibuster \nof the USA FREEDOM Act, we were told that the Senate needed more time \nto consider the issue and that the new Senate would take up the matter \nunder new leadership. All right. We have known the sunsets were coming \nfor years. That is why I brought up the bill last year. There has been \nnothing done on this urgent matter this year--no public hearings and no \ncommittee markups, unlike the six public hearings I held in the \nJudiciary Committee last year.\n  In contrast, the House leadership has acted responsibly and \ndecisively. They moved the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 through the \nJudiciary Committee and passed this bipartisan bill overwhelmingly.\n  We had significant debate on this issue this week. I have heard \nSenators across the political spectrum who have spoken at length on the \nSenate floor about their views. Most of these Senators have urged us to \nreform the government's bulk collection program--which is, of course, \nthe same way the vast majority of Americans feel. But there have also \nbeen voices urging more surveillance. We have heard the familiar fear-\nmongering and demands for a data-retention mandate on the private \ntelecom companies. Well, I disagree with those Senators who voiced that \nperspective, but they have at least been heard.\n  Unfortunately, the clock has been running. The House worked very \nhard, they completed their work, and they left. They are not coming \nback until after the surveillance authorities are set to expire. And \nthe House leadership has made clear that they will not pass an \nextension. Even if they were in session and we passed an extension, \nthey made it very clear to Republican and Democratic leadership that \nthey will not take it up.\n  So here is the choice. It is a very simple one. We can let the three \nprovisions at issue expire--some may like that; frankly, I don't--or we \ncan pass the bipartisan and bicameral USA FREEDOM Act of 2015.\n  We all know that the NSA has for years been using section 215 of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act to sweep up phone\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nrecords of innocent Americans without any connection to terrorism. I am \nsure innocent Americans who may be in the Chamber or who are hearing \nwhat we are saying have had their phone records swept up. Well, I don't \nthink anybody would feel very comfortable with that.\n  We also know that the NSA used a similar legal theory for years to \ncollect massive amounts of metadata related to billions of emails sent \nto and from innocent Americans--a parent to a child asking, ``how is my \ngranddaughter's cold coming along?'' or ``How did my grandson do in \nschool?'' or somebody writing to a friend, back and forth.\n  The American people oppose this indiscriminate dragnet collection of \ntheir records--not only that, the courts do, too. They found it to be \nunlawful. The House of Representatives listened to the American people, \nthey listened to the courts, and they voted overwhelmingly to end this \nprogram through the USA FREEDOM Act and assumed, of course, that the \nSenate would do what the courts have said and what the vast majority of \nthe American people said.\n  Last November, when Senator McConnell convinced his caucus to block \nthe USA FREEDOM Act, I warned that we would not have much time in the \nnew Congress, and that the American people were demanding action. \nPeople should go back and see the number of letters and emails that \ncame pouring in to the Capitol saying: We want this passed. Yet, here \nwe are--Congress racing against the clock to act before the sunsets \ntake effect next weekend.\n  Well, this is a manufactured crisis. I think there are some who hope \nthat enough Senators will be scared by the prospect of these \nauthorities expiring that they will blindly vote in favor of a clean \nextension even though that will go nowhere. We have all seen this movie \nbefore. We know that opponents of the USA FREEDOM Act simply want to \ndelay again. Well, I don't frighten.\n  Many Americans, especially my constituents, are wondering what \nopponents of the USA FREEDOM Act have been doing for the past six \nmonths? They are rapidly approaching a sunset that has been on the \nbooks for years--the original sunset provision written by myself and \nRepublican leader Dick Armey. It is not as though this deadline \nsuddenly snuck up on the leadership or the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, who is just now considering alternative proposals.\n  Remember, we are just a few days away from the expiration date. But \ndespite this urgency and the extensive debate we have been having for \nmany months, the only bill that has been filed by the opponents of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act is a 2-month rubberstamp of the USA PATRIOT Act \nprovisions--a bill the Senate sponsors know cannot pass the House even \nif they were in session. And because they are not in session, if we \nwere to pass it here, it would become a ``nothingburger'' because there \nwould be no law to extend.\n  I read in the press that there may be an alternative proposal in the \nworks. It may include a provision to keep the bulk collection program \nin place for more than two years. But even if we could legally pass \nthat, it is entirely unnecessary.\n  Just this week, the NSA Director stated in a letter to Leaders \nMcConnell and Reid that the NSA only needs 180 days to transition to \nthe new targeted program established by the USA FREEDOM Act. Not 2 \nyears. The 180-day transition has been part of the USA FREEDOM Act for \nmore than a year. And during all the negotiations about the bill, \nneither the NSA nor the intelligence community ever raised a concern \nwith me about this provision. In fact, we have on the record that they \nsupport it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nMay 20 letter from Admiral Rogers, the head of NSA.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                      National Security Agency\n\n                            Fort George G. Meade, MD, May 20 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McConnell and Reid: The USA Freedom Act would \n     establish a 180-day period for transitioning from the current \n     bulk-collection program for telephone metadata to a model \n     where queries would be carried out against business records \n     held by telephone service providers. Several questions have \n     been raised about the feasibility of the 180-day deadline.\n       Should the USA Freedom Act of 2015 become law, NSA assesses \n     that the transition of the program to a query at the provider \n     model is achievable within 180 days, with provider \n     cooperation. We base this judgment on the analysis that we \n     have undertaken on how to make this model work. Upon passage \n     of the law, we will work with the companies that are expected \n     to be subject to Orders under the law by providing them the \n     technical details, guidance, and compensation to create a \n     fully operational query at the provider model. We are aware \n     of no technical or security reasons why this cannot be tested \n     and brought on line within the 180-day period.\n       We very much appreciate the time and attention the Senate \n     continues to devote to this important issue.\n\n                                            Michael S. Rogers,\n\n                                     Admiral, U.S. Navy, Director,\n                                         National Security Agency.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We all know this last-ditch attempt at further delay is \njust too late. We have two options: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act or let the \nprovisions expire. A growing majority of the Senate--a straight up-or-\ndown vote--supports the USA FREEDOM Act. If we pass it today, the \nPresident can sign it today or tomorrow.\n  Also, the intelligence community says: Is the law going to be here or \nis the law gone? By passing the USA FREEDOM Act, they can move forward \nwith the certainty they need to protect the American people.\n  Senator Lee and I, along with a bipartisan group of Senators ranging \nfrom Senator Durbin, to Senator Heller, to Senator Schumer, to Senator \nCruz--and that is going across the political spectrum--are moving for a \nresponsible path forward.\n  We have worked for 2 years on this bill to end the NSA bulk \ncollection of Americans' phone records. Republicans and Democrats have \nworked together for 2 years to end the NSA's bulk collection of \nAmericans' phone records, something that every one of us, at a townhall \nmeeting--I do not care what State you are in, if you ask Americans ``Do \nyou want a bulk collection of all your phone records?'' you know what \nthe answer would be: ``Of course not.''\n  The clock has run out, but there is a responsible choice before us. \nLet's pass the USA FREEDOM Act today. Then we will have important \nreforms, we will keep America secure, and we will not have all of these \nauthorities expire.\n  Mr. President, I see other Senators on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for Senator Daines \nand I to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Chuck Johnson\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great Montana \njournalist. I got to know Chuck Johnson some 16 years ago when I was \nrunning for the State senate, but his distinguished career started long \nbefore that.\n  While attending the University of Montana School of Journalism, Mr. \nJohnson was accepted to be a congressional intern here with the \njournalists in Washington, DC. That gave him a taste of political \nreporting.\n  In 1972, Chuck Johnson was assigned to cover Montana's Constitutional \nConvention for the Associated Press. Little did he know at that time \nthat this assignment would launch his professional career covering \nMontana politics, and little did he know that he would be writing \nhistory as he watched Montanans draft one of the most progressive State \nconstitutions in the country.\n  In his long career, Chuck Johnson covered 9 Governors, 9 U.S. \nSenators, 10 Congressmen, and more legislative sessions than I can \ncount, including the years I had the honor of serving the great State \nof Montana in Helena. He pushed for increased media access and stood up \nfor more transparency and for a reporter's right to be in the room. \nThanks to Chuck, Montana now has a requirement that political caucuses \nare open to the press.\n  Mr. Johnson and his colleague Mike Dennison worked hand in hand for \nyears at the Lee State Bureau and\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\nwrote powerful stories that had sweeping impacts across our great \nState. So when news broke yesterday that Lee Enterprises was closing \nits State Bureau and Mr. Johnson would be retiring, the world of \npolitics was buzzing. While a few politicians might be relieved, many \nof us recognize what a loss for journalism and for Montana this will \nbe. As Chuck leaves political journalism, he leaves a giant hole that \nwill be difficult, if not impossible, to fill.\n  In the day of a 24-hour news cycle and a demand for immediate \ninformation, the people of Montana still count on Chuck Johnson to \npresent the facts. Even though he started writing his stories on a \ntypewriter, he has adapted with the times, learning how to tweet.\n  Known as the ``Dean of the Capitol Press Corps,'' Mr. Johnson would \ntake young reporters under his wing, teach them how to understand the \ngovernmental process, and share his vast knowledge of Montana politics.\n  From his reporting on taxes and budgets, he has a way of making it \neasy to make sense to the average reader. But where his reporting \nreally stands out is in his ability to track and understand campaign \nfinance. He has been known to plow through election reports late on a \nFriday night when all of the other reporters have called it quits and \ngone to bed, digging for a story, holding elected leaders accountable, \nand reporting the facts.\n  It is his integrity, his commitment to the truth, and fair reporting \nthat have earned the respect of politicians and readers alike from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  It is in that spirit that I would ask my colleague Senator Daines to \njoin me.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from the State \nof Montana, Mr. Tester.\n  I also rise today to recognize the career and service of Chuck \nJohnson, a longtime Montanan, a Montana reporter who will be entering \ninto a well-deserved retirement at the end of next week.\n  Chuck's career covering Montana politics began more than 40 years ago \nwhen he was asked to cover the Montana Constitutional Convention for \nthe Associated Press. Since then, he has covered nearly two dozen \nsessions of the Montana State Legislature and countless political \nconventions.\n  I remember seeing Chuck late at night at conventions, giving up a lot \nof his personal time for the sake of covering these stories across our \nState. He has covered hundreds of elected officials and has been a \nsteady presence on Montana's campaign trail.\n  Over the past two decades, Chuck has led political reporting for Lee \nNewspapers, and he spent the past 10 years working alongside his fellow \nLee State Bureau colleague Mike Dennison.\n  If it has to do with Montana politics, Chuck has probably covered it. \nI am told Chuck has the best political campaign button collection in \nall of Montana. Chuck's life has been spent in Montana. He grew up in \nHelena, and he went on to earn his degree in journalism at the \nUniversity of Montana.\n  I can speak as a Montana State Bobcat. I know that Chuck is a \ntestament to the quality of journalists produced by the University of \nMontana School of Journalism. It goes without saying as a Bobcat, I do \nnot always see eye to eye with Chuck on important issues, like who to \ncheer for during the Brawl of the Wild or which colors are better--blue \nand gold or maroon and silver. But I do know that Chuck took a fair \namount of joy in seeing this Bobcat receive a Montana Grizzlies shirt \nafter a disappointing Cats loss during the 2013 game.\n  Setting aside our personal allegiances, it has been a great privilege \nand tremendous honor to work with Chuck in my years representing \nMontana and being involved in Montana politics.\n  With Chuck's retirement and the closing of the Lee State Bureau, \nMontana is saying farewell to not only a talented and dedicated \nreporter but also a historian of our State and a mentor to countless \nyoung reporters looking to make their own mark in Montana's news media.\n  I thank Chuck personally for his years of service to Montana and his \nlifelong commitment to making our State's government open and more \naccessible to all Montanans. He has made a lasting mark on the State of \nMontana. His depth of knowledge and his lifetime of experience will be \ndifficult, if not impossible, to replace, and his byline on newspaper \nstories across Montana will be greatly missed.\n  Chuck, congratulations on your retirement. We appreciate all you have \ndone, and we wish you the very best.\n  I would like to yield back to the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. \nTester.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Senator Daines. It was a pleasure to share the \nSenate floor with you this afternoon.\n  As Chuck Johnson retires and puts away his pen and his notebook, I \nwant to say thank you to Chuck. In this body, we often think we are \nirreplaceable when we are not. I will say this about Chuck Johnson: It \nwill be a long time before Montana sees someone as good as Chuck in the \nreporting corps. So, as a body, we honor Chuck Johnson's contributions \nto Montana, to our country, and to our democracy.\n  Good luck, Chuck.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Highway Bill\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk today about one of the \nthings we need to do before we leave here--the extension of the highway \nbill. And nobody is satisfied with a short-term extension of the \nhighway bill. I would be among the group who would be least satisfied \nwith that. But as we look at what has happened so far this year, we \nmoved in a positive way in a number of areas. We don't have time while \nwe are here to do what we need to do to have a truly long-term highway \nbill.\n\n  The last two bills under the two previous Congresses--the two \nprevious Senates--were very unhelpful and unsatisfying in many ways: a \n6-month extension of the highway bill--you cannot build roads and \nbridges 6 months at a time. Not only can you not do the work 6 months \nat a time, you cannot get the kind of competitive bidding process and \nplanning to do this work in the right way. Before that, we only had a \n2-year bill. I will be very disappointed if we cannot beat both of \nthose standards. The reason to do the 2-month bill today will be the \nimportant reason that, one, we have enough money left, because of \nwinter conditions, that we can do 2 months of further construction with \nthe money that is available, and that way we don't do anything to slow \ndown construction here at the best building time of the year.\n  We need to work really hard in the next 2 months--and we should be \nworking right now, and I know we are working right now--to come up with \nthat long-term solution that lets us look at the transportation needs \nof the country in a way that allows us to compete. So many great things \nare out there in the next few decades for our country, but they all \ninvolve a transportation system that works.\n  I think the country is clearly ready to make things work again. I was \nso pleased in the last Congress that we were able to add the advanced \nmanufacturing bill to the arsenal of things we had. Senator Brown and I \nworked together and passed that bill. Now we have the arsenal we need \nto be in the position of making things again. The right kind of energy \npolicy can clearly get us to where we make things again.\n  Certainly what is going to happen in agriculture, manufacturing, and \nhealth care technology--all great opportunities with great potential, \nbut we have to have a transportation system that works. We are the best \nlocated country in the world to deal in the commerce of the world. We \nare the best located country in the world to connect with the \nmarketplace of the world, but we have to have a transportation system \nthat allows us to do that.\n  I hope we are working hard, and I believe we are, to find what we \nneed to do to fill that gap between what the current gas tax creates--\nat the Federal level I don't think there is any likelihood of \nincreasing that tax in the next few years. We need to look at what that \ntax creates and what funding source is out there that helps us fill the \ngap between the gas tax and reasonable aspirations for our \ntransportation system. This is one of the areas\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nthe American people think the government address.\n  There may be an argument about whether it should involve the Federal \nGovernment or the State government or how this works in terms of the \ngovernment, but we know this is something we can't do for ourselves.\n  Since the very earliest days of the Congress, what the Federal \nGovernment could and should do regarding interstate commerce and \ntransportation--and the Constitution itself talks about building postal \nroads and it talks about interstate commerce.\n  Hopefully, we will take this vote today or tomorrow or whenever we \ntake this vote, to be sure that we continue the construction already \nunderway, but don't stop for a minute in working on this process until \nwe get a highway and bridge and construction bill for transportation \nthat allows us to move forward and to move forward for a significant \nfuture of what we need to do.\n  We are going to lose the advantages we have if we don't maintain and \nimprove the transportation network we have. I look forward to seeing \nthat happen and encourage my colleagues to vote for that 2-month \nextension, but don't give a moment's relaxation seeking the multiyear \nhighway bill--the multiyear transportation bill--that the country \nreally needs.\n\n\n                 Memorial Day and Choices for Veterans\n\n  Also, Mr. President, I wish to talk about one other subject before we \ntake this work period for Memorial Day. This is an important time to \nhonor those who have served, those who have sacrificed, people who have \ngiven their all for the country or even those who have served and were \nable to live a full life after service. We honor them on Memorial Day \nas well.\n  As I am thinking about Memorial Day this year, I am continuing to be \nfrustrated with how we treat our veterans. The Veterans' Administration \nsystem is not what it should be, and it continues, it seems to me, that \nthe Veterans' Administration wants to focus on what is good for the \nVeterans' Administration instead of what is good for veterans. I am \ntired of it. I think many people in the country are tired of it, and we \nneed to do something about it. We got a report in our State this week \nabout one of the St. Louis facilities--the John Cochran Hospital. This \nhospital has had seven acting directors in 2 years. It is a hospital \nwith problems. It is a hospital that is not serving veterans the way it \nshould, and it has had seven acting directors in 2 years. I cannot \ncontact the same director twice before they are gone, and the new \ndirector is trying to figure out what the problems are. It seems to me, \nbefore they can figure out what the problems are, there is another new \nacting director.\n  We just had an inspector general report on that hospital, and the \ninspector general report found 45 areas that needed improvement at a \nVeterans' Administration hospital. These are issues such as dirty \npatient care areas, expired medication, and inadequate staff training. \nWe are not talking about having the most expensive or the best or the \nmost up-to-date equipment; we are talking about getting the medicine \noff the shelf that is retired or having patient care areas that are \nclean. Certainly, like everywhere else at this facility, just simply \ngetting patients scheduled to come has been a problem.\n  The Director of the Veterans' Administration, Mr. McDonald, needs to \nchange the VA, not manage the VA. He came to this job with well-\nheralded management experiences, but this is not just a management job; \nthis is a change job, and he needs to make those changes. There is no \nexcuse for a 2-year vacancy in a troubled facility. There is no excuse \nfor not looking at every way they can to provide more choices for \nveterans.\n  It is clear the Congress wants to have more choices. Senator Moran, \nfrom Kansas, has a bill I am proud to cosponsor that emphasizes one \nmore time--just in case we were not clear enough last year that we want \nveterans to have choices--that we want veterans to have choices. There \nis no reason for veterans to drive by a facility that could do a better \njob than a veterans facility only to stand in line at a veterans \nfacility.\n  There are a few things the VA system should be better at than anybody \nelse. They should be better at dealing with post-traumatic stress and \nthey should be better at prosthetics, the replacement of arms and legs. \nThis is something that--at least since before the Civil War--the \nVeterans' Administration has always been pretty good at because they \nhad a lot of tragic reasons to be good in this particular area.\n  There is no reason to believe the Veterans' Administration hospital \nis necessarily the best place to get your heart stent put in. There is \nno reason to believe the Veterans' Administration is necessarily the \nbest place available for you to have your cancer treatment. There is no \nreason to believe the Veterans' Administration is the best place to go \nand have your kidney surgery. We ought to let veterans go to the best \nplace. We ought to let veterans have more choices, particularly young \nveterans.\n  Last year, I sponsored a bill called the Excellence in Mental Health \nAct. By the way, we are launching that program right now and looking \nfor the first eight States that are properly qualified facilities and \nwant to treat mental health just as they do all physical health.\n  The Excellence in Mental Health Act brought forth the mental health \ncommunity and the law enforcement community. Veterans group after \nveterans group--particularly young veterans--said they want to have \nmore choices. They want to be able to go to places where they can take \ncare of their health care problem in a way that works with their family \nand in a way that works with their work.\n  These are important choices and Congress has spoken but apparently \nnot quite loud enough. The Veterans' Administration wants to say, if a \nveteran is within 45 miles of any facility, whether it provides the \nservice they need or not--the most technical reading of the law would \nsuggest it really doesn't matter if they need a heart transplant. If \nthey are within 45 miles of a facility where they can get their blood \npressure checked, then they don't qualify for the program that gives \nthem more choices. That is a ridiculous interpretation of the law.\n  We will do our best to try to make the law clearer, but I think the \nVeterans' Administration could make it clearer if they wanted to. They \nare afraid to compete, and we should wonder why they are afraid to \ncompete.\n  We looked at the problems at the Cochran Hospital and other \nfacilities. We should understand why they are afraid to compete. This \nis not the way veterans should be treated. This is not the way we \nshould be honoring our veterans. It is not the way we should be going \nhome on Memorial Day, and I hope we commit ourselves to do a better job \non this topic and, more importantly, to force the Veterans' \nAdministration to do the job it is supposed to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, at some point soon, I presume, the Senate \nis going to adjourn for the Memorial Day week break, and I want to say \na few words on some of the important issues we are now confronting.\n  I suspect later today there will be a vote on the TPP. I suspect that \nthose who are for the TPP have the 60 votes necessary to pass it. I \nknow there are a number of amendments that will be offered, and I will \nsupport the strongest of those amendments. But the bottom line is, in \nmy view, that the TPP is a continuation of failed trade policy which \nhas resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs in this \ncountry, which has resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of \nmanufacturing facilities as corporations have shut down in America and \nmoved to China, Mexico, and to other low-wage countries.\n  In my view, it is wrong to ask American workers to compete against \npeople in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 56 cents an hour, to \ncompete against people in Malaysia where, in some cases, you literally \nhave indentured servitude, people who have lost their ability to leave \nthe country and are working for incredibly low wages in horrendous \nworking conditions. That is not what a trade policy should be.\n  I hope our colleagues in the House have more resolve than we have had \nin the Senate, and I hope they stand up and say enough is enough. \nCurrent trade policies have failed. We need\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\ntrade policies that work for the average American and not just for the \nmultinational corporations.\n\n\n                        Free College For All Act\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to say a word on another issue that I know \nis of deep concern in the State of Vermont and I am quite confident is \nof concern in 49 other States as well. We are in a competitive global \neconomy right now, and we have hundreds of thousands of bright, young \npeople who want to go to college, get a higher education but today are \nunable to afford that higher education.\n  Here we are desperately needing to have the best educated workforce \nin the world so we can compete effectively, and what we are saying to \nour bright, young people is, sorry, you are not going to be able to get \nthe education you need in order to get the high-quality jobs that are \navailable in this country.\n  What we are saying to hundreds of thousands of those young people is, \nno, you are not going to be doctors, you are not going to be nurses, \nyou are not going to be scientists, you are not going to become \nteachers, you are not going to be able to become employees in high-tech \ncompanies because you just don't have the education.\n  Frankly, I think that is absolutely absurd not only for the dreams of \nlow- and moderate-income young people who want to make it into the \nmiddle class, but also it is absurd if we are talking about the future \nof this country having a strong economy.\n  Thirty years ago, the United States led the world in terms of the \npercentage of our young people who had a college degree. Today, we are \nin 12th place. We are in 12th place, and we are competing against \ncountries all over the world that understand the importance of their \nyoung people getting the education that is needed in this day and age.\n  We are also facing a related problem in that we have millions of \npeople--many of whom are no longer young--who are dealing with \nincredibly oppressive and large student debt. The average graduate now \nof a 4-year college is approximately $29,000 in debt. That is the \naverage. So there are many more who are graduating $30,000 or $40,000 \nin debt. If a person goes to graduate school, that number goes much \nhigher.\n  I recall speaking some months ago to a young woman in Burlington, VT, \nwhose crime was that she went to medical school and is now practicing \nprimary health care among low-income people, which is exactly what we \nneed to see happening in this country. Yet she is saddled with a \n$300,000 debt. I talked to dentists who are also practicing in \ncommunity health centers, where we need them. We have a major dental \ncrisis in this country. They are saddled with a $250,000 debt.\n  Now, what is absurd about the current student debt situation is that \nat a time when a person can go out and get an auto loan for 1 percent \nor 2 percent, millions of our young and middle-aged people are paying \ninterest rates on their student debt of 4, 5, 6, 7 percent, and even \nhigher than that. So how does it happen that a person can go out and \nget an auto loan for 1 or 2 percent, how does it happen that a person \ncan refinance their home mortgage to take advantage of low interest \nrates, yet people are stuck with 5, 6, 7 percent in interest rates on \ntheir student loans? It makes no sense to me at all.\n  The other part of that is that over a 10-year period, the Federal \nGovernment now makes over $80 billion in profits from student loans. \nFrankly, I would rather see the Federal Government make that money than \nthe private banks. But, in fact, the Federal Government should not be \nprofiting off of the loans that were needed by low- and moderate-income \nstudents and their families. That is not a way to make money.\n  So I have introduced legislation called the Free College For All Act, \nand it is a very simple piece of legislation. What it says is that, No. \n1, we are going to make in this country tuition-free college for all \npublic colleges and public universities in America--tuition-free. We \nare going to do that by establishing a matching grant program of 2 to 1 \nfrom the Federal Government--$1 for the State. When we do that, it will \nmean that every qualified young person in this country who wants to get \na higher education will be able to go to their State colleges, their \nState University and do it tuition-free.\n  Now, is that an expensive proposition? It is an expensive \nproposition. But I think long term, by having a well-educated society, \nby allowing young people today who cannot afford to go to college to \nget that education, from an economic point of view, we will gain \nsignificantly by this legislation.\n  This legislation is also paid for in a fair and progressive way. It \nsays to the people on Wall Street who have made huge, huge sums of \nmoney by speculating in a whole lot of arcane and dangerous financial \ntools that we are going to establish in this country a tax on stock \ntransfer--a transfer-stock fee--of one-half of 1 percent. That will \nraise more than enough money to provide a tuition-free education in our \npublic colleges and universities.\n  So this is an issue that I am going to pursue. I think it is \nimportant, if we want to deal with income inequality and if we want to \nmake sure that everybody in this country gets the education they need, \nregardless of the income of their families.\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT Act\n\n  Mr. President, there is another issue I wish to very briefly touch on \nas well today. That issue deals with the USA PATRIOT Act and FISA and \ncivil liberties in this country. Let me make a few basic points.\n  There is nobody in the Senate, there is nobody in the House who does \nnot understand that there are terrorist groups out there that want to \nattack the United States of America and our allies and that want to do \nus harm. There is nobody in the Senate or in the House or, I think, in \nthe United States of America who does not believe that as a nation we \nhave to do everything we can to protect the people of our country from \nterrorist attacks. There is no debate on that. What the debate is about \nis how we protect the American people without undermining the \nConstitution of the United States of America or undermining the privacy \nrights of the American people.\n  I think everybody does understand and should understand that modern \ntechnology in all of its forms--from iPhones to a dozen or 100 \ndifferent ways--has greatly outstripped public policy in terms of \nprotecting privacy rights. By and large, the privacy rights we have on \nthe books now were written years and years before the development of \nthe technologies we see right now.\n  It is absolutely imperative that as a nation we begin a serious \nconversation, which includes some of the most knowledgeable people in \nthis country--people who know about what technology can do today and \nwhat it can do tomorrow, people who are concerned about civil liberties \nand privacy rights, our law enforcement officials, our national \nsecurity people, and Members of Congress. What that discussion should \nbe about is pretty simple: How do we protect our country against \nterrorism at the same time that we protect our privacy rights and our \nconstitutional freedoms.\n  As we consider whether to reauthorize parts of the PATRIOT Act, we \nmust take stock of where we are today. It is no secret that NSA \ncollects vast sums of information and at one point or another has \ncollected information on virtually every person in this country who \nuses a telephone. That is no great secret. Since June 2013, we have \nlearned that the NSA collects phone call metadata, including the \nnumbers of both parties, location, time, and duration. They collect \ntext messages, email chat, and Internet browsing history; smart phone \napp data, including Google Maps, which can pinpoint a person's location \nto within a few yards. They collect maps of people's social networks, \nbank and credit card transactions. This is just the tip of the iceberg. \nThere is undoubtedly much more being done that we simply don't know \nanything about.\n  Further, local governments and other agencies are also collecting \ninformation about the movements and the habits of law-abiding \nAmericans. When we drive down the street, there are cameras that can \ntake pictures of license plates. There are cameras on street corners, \ncameras in private buildings. The government knows where we are \ntraveling and how long we are gone. Let's be clear. While today we are \nfocusing appropriately on the role of the Federal Government in issues \nof civil liberties, we must also understand that\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\nit is not just the government that is collecting information on law-\nabiding Americans. In fact, the private sector's collection of \ninformation is just as intrusive and equally dangerous. Private \ncompanies, private corporations know a whole lot about what we do. Our \nevery move can be tracked by a smart phone. Almost two-thirds of the \nAmerican people, by the way, have smart phones.\n  Private companies can know what we read, what we are emailing about, \nwhat Web sites we visit. They know when we have purchased a ticket, and \nthey know where that trip is taking us. They know whether we are going \non a plane or a train or a bus. When we go to a grocery store, our \ndiscount card gets scanned and the grocery store knows exactly what we \nare eating. It is the same situation at the pharmacy. They know what \nkind of medicine we are buying, enabling people to make judgments about \none's health. They know when a woman is pregnant based on her \npurchases. In the name of fitness, people are wearing watches and \nFitbits that record our heart rate and exercise pattern and how much we \nsleep.\n  In the wrong hands, this information could prevent us from getting \nhealth insurance through our jobs. It could even prevent us from \ngetting hired in the first place. In other words, enormous, enormous, \nundreamed of amounts of information are out there and, in the wrong \nhands, that could be a real danger to our country and to the lives of \nmillions of innocent people.\n  This is what the attack on privacy looks like. Someone can access our \nphone calls. They can access our credit card records. They can comb \nthrough our purchases. They can analyze our spending habits. They can \naccess our emails and our contacts. They can track our movements. \nPretty much anything and everything we do these days can be tracked and \nrecorded.\n  Now, many of my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and talk \nabout America being a free country. Well, if somebody knows everything \nwe are doing, maybe it is time to recognize that we are not quite as \nfree as we think we are. I know that in response to the argument I am \nraising, people will say: Well, trust these large corporations; trust \nthe government. They are honest people. By and large, many of them are. \nI am not suggesting otherwise.\n  In terms of government policy, however, let us not forget that 45 \nyears ago we had a President of the United States named Richard Nixon. \nAnd what Richard Nixon believed was that anything the President of the \nUnited States did, by definition, was legal. The President can break \ninto his or her opponent's political headquarters--not a problem. He is \nthe President. He can spy on people--not a problem. He is the \nPresident.\n  So I ask my colleagues and the American people--and I do not suggest \nfor one second that this is true of the Obama administration. But I ask \nthe American people to think about what happens in the future if we \nhave a President who really does believe that he or she is the law, \nthat he or she can or should have access to the kinds of information \nthat are out there. Think about the incredible power the administration \nhas, the potential for blackmail, the political advantages that \nadministration has.\n\n  People say: Well, it is a pretty crazy idea. It is never going to \nhappen.\n  Well, a lot of things have happened that we never thought could \nhappen.\n  It seems to me that now is the time for us as a nation, for us as \nelected officials to have a very important conversation about how we \nbalance our need--of which there is no debate--to protect the American \npeople against terrorist attacks while at the same time we respect the \nprivacy rights and the constitutional rights of our people and how we \nmaintain America as a free and open society.\n  I got involved in this issue a number of years ago when I voted \nagainst the USA PATRIOT Act. I remember some librarians in the State of \nVermont came to me and they said: You know, as a result of section 215 \nof the USA PATRIOT Act, law enforcement officials--the FBI can come to \na librarian and demand that the librarian provide information about the \nbooks people are borrowing from the library.\n  Of course, section 215 goes a lot further than that.\n  Do we want to be a nation in which we are looking over our shoulders \nand worrying about the books we are reading because somebody may say: \nOh, well, you are reading a book about Osama bin Laden; clearly, you \nmust be a terrorist. Is that really the kind of fear we want to see \nestablished in this country?\n  So I say to my colleagues, it is great to come to the floor and talk \nabout freedom, but what freedom is about ultimately is the right of \npeople to do what they want to do in a law-abiding way without harming \nother people. That is called freedom. In my view, people have a right \nto make a telephone call today without that information being collected \nby the government. People have a right to go on the Internet and send \nan email with the absolute assurance that as law-abiding citizens their \nvisits to a Web site or the emails they send will not be tracked by the \ngovernment. People have a right to go to a grocery store and make \npurchases without somebody knowing what they are buying.\n  I intend to introduce legislation shortly which will call for a \ncomprehensive review of data collection by public and private entities \nand the impact that data is having on the American people. I don't know \nif this is a progressive piece of legislation or a conservative piece \nof legislation, but I would hope this concept would have broad support \nacross the political spectrum from people who actually do believe in a \nfree society, that our young people should not be worried about the \nkinds of books they read or the Web sites they visit.\n  We must bring together leaders in the technology world, people who \nnot only know what technology today is doing as far as invading our \nprivacy rights but what the future holds, because I am quite certain \nthat every single day, this technology is growing more and more \nsophisticated and more and more intrusive, and sitting down with people \nwho are experts on technology--we have to have civil libertarians, \npeople who understand what the First Amendment is, what the Fourth \nAmendment is, what our Bill of Rights is about, what our Constitution \nis about, and, of course, involved in that discussion must be law \nenforcement and our security experts. The goal of all of this must be \nto create legislation which does everything we can to protect the \nsafety of the American people but also protects our privacy rights and \nour constitutional rights.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle on that legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have been on the floor a number of times this week talking about \nthe importance of trade and talking about the need for us to expand \nmore exports around the world. The United States has not been in a \nposition for 7 years to do that. That is why trade promotion authority \nis incredibly important to our workers, our farmers, and the people we \nrepresent. By doing so, we will give people a shot at actually \nincreasing their salary and their family's income because trade jobs \ntend to pay better and have better benefits.\n  In my home State of Ohio, 60 percent of our soybean crop is exported. \nWe want to be sure those farmers have access to more markets. Twenty-\nfive percent of our manufacturing jobs--factory jobs--are now trade \njobs. So these exports are very important.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened over the last 7 years is that as we \ntry to sell our products and our services to the 95 percent of the \nworld outside of our borders, it is getting harder because other \ncountries are concluding trade agreements with each other.\n  So during this time when the United States has basically been sitting \non the sidelines, other countries have negotiated trade-opening \nagreements. This means lowering tariffs and nontariff barriers, \nactually taking market share away from us that we would otherwise have. \nSo this is an important issue. If you are for jobs, you should be for \nexports. You should be for the U.S. Government helping our workers and \nhelping us to be able to knock down these barriers.\n\n[[Page S3280]]\n\n  Other countries tend to have higher tariffs. They tend to have higher \nnontariff barriers. So this is part of what we ought to be about in \nthis body. I am glad we are finally taking this up. The administration \nnow supports this. That is good. However, as we do that, we also have \nto be darn sure that the playing field is more level.\n  What do I mean by that? Well, we know that other countries have \nhigher tariffs than we do, on average. But they also do other things \nthat make it harder for our workers to compete. One is that they \nsubsidize their products. We know this because we have taken a number \nof these countries to court--meaning the World Trade Organization--\nabout this very topic.\n  Here in the United States, we have the ability, if a company is \nselling into our market with a subsidized product, to seek relief for \nthat. We should. It is not fair. Second, some countries just want to \ndump their products here in the United States at below their cost. Why? \nIt is kind of like what they say in business: This is a loss leader. \nThey will take a loss on it, but they will get market share and knock \nout a U.S. competitor. That takes jobs away from us. That is also not \nfair.\n  Again, there are international tribunals that deal with this, but \nalso we have our laws here in this country that say: If you are dumping \nyour product here in the United States, that is considered unfair. A \ncompany can bring a case. If they can prove they are materially \ninjured--that the company is materially injured--they can find some \nrelief there.\n  So as we are expanding opportunities for trade all around the world, \nwhich is a good thing, we also have to be sure that our laws work to \nprotect our workers who are not getting a fair shake. By the way, a lot \nof these workers are doing everything right, everything that is being \nasked of them. They are going through worker retraining to learn how to \noperate the most highly technical, sophisticated machines that are the \nmost efficient.\n  Frankly, that often results in fewer jobs, but it results also in \nvery high quality U.S. products that are being made with the best \ntechnology. Some of these workers have been asked to make concessions \nin their pay or their benefits in order to be competitive. What they \nsay to me is: Rob, you know we are in a global marketplace. We know we \nare going to have to compete. We know it is not just about competing \nwith Indiana anymore; it is about competing with India, China, Japan, \nBrazil, and the European Union. So we are willing to become more \ncompetitive, to learn these skills, to play by these global rules. But \nonce we do that, we want that playing field to be level.\n  That is fair. That is the least that they should expect from us here \nin the Congress--to ensure that while they are making these changes to \nbe more competitive that we are watching their back. That is what a lot \nof the debate has been about with regard to this trade promotion \nauthority vote that we are having.\n  This is the opportunity for Congress to express its will as to what \nthese trade negotiations ought to look like. It is not about a specific \nnegotiation, the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the TTIP negotiations \nwith the EU or other bilateral relationships, it is about establishing \nwhat Congress believes ought to be the right rules going forward.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  I am very hopeful that today on the floor we will have the \nopportunity to vote on a couple of different amendments related to \nthis. One that the Presiding Officer is very well aware of is a strong \ninterest of mine. It is ensuring that other countries do not manipulate \ntheir currency so that their exports are less expensive to us and our \nexports that we send to them are more expensive. That is not fair.\n  When they intervene deliberately in their currency for that purpose \nand do it in a large-scale and protected way, that is called currency \nmanipulation. There are rules against it. The International Monetary \nFund has rules against it. As an example, every one of the partners in \nthe trade agreement that is being negotiated now with the Pacific \ncountries--every one of those countries in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--has signed up to those obligations already.\n  So the amendment we will be voting on today simply says: Here is the \nstandard that you have already agreed to. Let's say that when you are \nnegotiating a trade agreement with us to lower barriers--both here in \nthe United States, to give them more access to our market, and to give \nus more access to their market, which, as I said earlier, is something \nwe have to be doing to help our farmers and our workers--let's be sure \nthat those benefits cannot be undone by them going in and manipulating \ntheir currency, which is a market distortion.\n  Most countries would say: We agree with that. We are not doing it. \nCurrently that is true. I don't think any of the 12 countries we are \ntalking about here are currently doing it. I will say that they have in \nthe past. Since 2012, I do not believe Japan has been doing it. Don't \ntake my word for it. Listen to the International Monetary Fund and the \nDepartment of Treasury. They give us a report every year on this.\n\n  But before that, they did it over 300 times. It makes it a whole lot \nharder for us to compete. Again, our workers and our farmers are \nwilling to be the most productive, the most efficient. They know they \nhave to compete. We should applaud them for that. We should support \nthem and help them. But they want to be sure that after they have done \nall of that and after we have reduced some of these barriers, the \nplaying field does not tilt, making it easier for these other countries \nto send their products here, which outcompete ours because of currency \nmanipulation.\n  That is what that issue is all about. There will be two amendments, \none of which will be offered by Senator Hatch and one offered by me and \nSenator Stabenow. The one that we are offering is one that does have \nteeth in it. In other words, it seems to be an enforceable provision. \nBut it leaves the discretion within the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to determine how that is done. This is an office that I \nhad the honor of holding at one time. I had the great honor of \nrepresenting our country all around the world in negotiating agreements \nand talking about these very issues with other countries.\n  I can tell you that sometimes other countries may not want to talk \nabout it, but at the end of the day, they know that currency \nmanipulation is bad for everybody. It is bad for the international \ntrading system. It is tempting to do because short term, it makes your \nexports less expensive. If you want to be an export-driven economy, as \nChina is, that helps sometimes.\n  But it is not ultimately in anybody's best interests. So let's have \nthese disciplines, but let's make them enforceable, so that there is \nsome ability for us to truly stop this manipulation, to discourage it, \nto have disciplines in place. That is what that amendment is going to \nbe about. By the way, I know the administration has said they do not \nsupport this. It is interesting because here is Secretary Lew's letter \nthis week to Congress: ``Holding our trade partners accountable for \ntheir currency practices has always been important to this \nadministration.''\n  Well, let's hold them accountable. I agree with him. I agree with \nthis letter. I do not agree with his recommended veto threat to the \nPresident, should we actually put accountable language into trade \npromotion authority. So I hope they will stick with this letter and not \nhis recommendation to the President. The President himself has talked \nabout this.\n  He has talked about his opposition to currency manipulation, and, by \nthe way, so have 60 Senators. This was in 2013. They are not all \ncurrently serving in the Senate, but 60 Senators actually signed a \nletter saying: ``In our trade agreements, we must have accountable, \nenforceable currency manipulation provisions.''\n  So most of this body has been on record in the past. This is what the \nPresident said back in 2007. It was not this week, but it was 2007. He \nsaid he would work with his colleagues in the Senate to ensure that any \ntrade agreement brought before this Congress is measured not against \nthe administration's commitment--not just a commitment, but that we \nwill do this--but instead against the rights of Americans to protection \nfrom unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation.\n  So the notion that the President might veto this because it has \nprotections against currency manipulation--I\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\ndo not think so. I think he understands the importance of trade \npromotion authority. I certainly do. I think he knows that we need to \nget off the sidelines and get back in the business of negotiating \nagreements that make sense for our farmers, our workers, and our \nservice providers.\n  But I think in his heart, he also realizes he has to have this \ndiscipline in place. The alternative, by the way, would be interesting. \nYou could end up with lowering tariffs and nontariff barriers in this \nagreement. Then one of these countries that has previously been \ninvolved in currency manipulation, such as Malaysia or Japan could step \nin and do it again and undo so many of the benefits. That would be \npretty tough to explain to our constituents. We had the opportunity to \naddress this and chose not to. Some are concerned about this being a \npoison pill. I would just say the obvious. If you have more protections \nin here, it won't be harder to pass this in the House of \nRepresentatives, because the concern, obviously, a lot of people have \nis that trade is somehow not fair.\n  I agree that we ought to pass trade promotion authority. It is \nincredibly important to the people I represent. It is incredibly \nimportant to our country. It is even a geopolitical issue now because \nAmerica's footprint in that region of the world, Asia-Pacific, should \nbe greater. We are competing with China in so many respects. One is \nwith regard to commerce.\n  China is one of those countries that are negotiating agreements \npretty rapidly with countries all throughout the region. It is \nimportant that we get back in the business of establishing those trade \nties. That is the geopolitical issue.\n  I would even say it is a national security issue and a strategic \nissue. But it is also just important to our economy. We all want to \ngive this economy a shot in the arm. This weak recovery we are working \nthrough right now is weaker because we are not seeing the gains in \nexports we would otherwise see if we were opening up these markets. By \nthe way, we only have free trade agreements with 10 percent of the \nglobal GDP.\n  If you think about it, we don't have an agreement with the EU or with \nChina or with Japan or with many other large economies, such as Brazil. \nBut with about 10 percent of the world we do have trade agreements. We \nsend 47 percent of our exports to that 10 percent of the world. From \nOhio, by the way, it is more than half. It is about 52 percent of our \nexports. But again, as we do that, let's be darn sure that we are \nleveling that playing field, that we are addressing these issues we all \nknow exist, whether it is dumping products here or whether it is \nillegally subsidizing products or whether it is manipulating currency. \nIt seems to me that this is the right balance. It seems to me that this \nis something that Congress owes the people I represent--to watch their \nbacks, to make sure they get a fair shake.\n  The other amendment that I hope we will have the opportunity to vote \non this afternoon is being discussed right now in another room off this \nChamber. It is an amendment that ensures that you have a more level \nplaying field with regard to being able to bring these cases against \ncompanies that sell their products in the United States unfairly \nbecause they sell them at below cost, they dump them or they subsidize \nthem.\n  There are governments that do a lot of subsidization. Again, that is \nanother market distortion. We should fight against it. The rules that \nare currently in place have been there a long time. They are consistent \nwith the World Trade Organization. Other countries have these rules in \nplace as well. But I will tell you that the way in which companies seek \nrelief and get relief right now is far from perfect, because so often, \nby the time a company can show that they are materially injured--which \nis the standard--it is too late. The market share is gone. Many of the \nworkers are gone. Sometimes the companies themselves are gone.\n  This legislation is going to be offered by Senator Brown, my \ncolleague from Ohio, and me. Senator Brown has been talking about this \nissue on the floor. He is passionate about it. When we travel around \nthe State, both of us, to places such as Cleveland, Toledo, Youngstown, \nand Dayton, we hear about this issue.\n  We hear: Yes, we can operate on a level playing field, but please \nhelp us to ensure that when we find a product that is subsidized and \nwhen we find a product that is being dumped here, we have the chance to \nbe able to get the relief that we deserve.\n  So this amendment enhances those protections for Ohio workers seeking \nrelief from these illegally undersold or subsidized imports. By the \nway, the amendment is now backed by over 80 trade associations and \ncompanies, including some great companies in Ohio: Nucor, \nArcelorMittal, U.S. Steel, Timken, and others. It is a commonsense, \nbipartisan measure that basically says that workers should not have to \nlose their jobs before their company can get relief from these illegal \nactions. And 78 out of 100 of my colleagues here on the floor of the \nSenate recently backed a Customs bill that included this language. So \nthere is a lot of support for this here on the floor.\n  We would love to get this included in this legislation because this \nis the legislation that is the most likely to move through the House \nand to the President. This is the legislation where it ought to be, \ngiven that we are talking about how to expand exports. That is good. \nBut also ensure that we have more fairness in terms of international \ntrade situations.\n  Last night on the floor, I was talking about AK Steel, in West \nChester, OH. They have 4,000 workers in the State of Ohio. I talked \nabout their production facilities in Zanesville, OH. Some 250 workers \nare there--UAW workers. They make grain-oriented electrical steel. It \nis a specialty steel. It is exported all over the world.\n  I went through what happened to them. They were exporting it to \nChina. China illegally shut out this kind of specialty steel. They lost \n92 percent of their exports to China, even though it was illegal for \nChina to do it. The U.S. Government took China to the World Trade \nOrganization and won. China then appealed that. China used all the time \nthey could to avoid complying with that order. By the time it was over, \nit was 5 or 6 years. They lost 92 percent of their exports. So they \nlost hundreds of jobs in Ohio because they couldn't get into that \nChinese market.\n\n  By the way, it is now happening in the European Union. For other \npurposes--apparently because of concern about other products--the \nEuropean Union is also now blocking some of this specialty steel made \nin my home State of Ohio.\n  So it happens overseas; we know that. Yet, when this same company \ngoes to our Commerce Department and our International Trade Commission \nto seek relief for illegally traded imports coming in--these are \nimports which are illegally traded--they have a hard time getting \nrelief in time for it to be helpful to them being able to get on their \nfeet. So American products are shut out of China and the EU, but \nAmerican workers cannot get the help they deserve in a timely manner to \nkeep illegally traded imports from flooding our market.\n  This amendment would change that. This is the amendment we have been \ntalking about. It is called the level the playing field amendment. It \nhelps protect thousands of American jobs that would otherwise be put at \nrisk because our trade laws frankly haven't kept up with the speed of \ninternational commerce.\n  I had some Ohio steel pipe and tube manufacturing companies in my \noffice yesterday. As some of you know, Ohio is a leader in this part of \nthe steel industry, which is a growth industry for the most part \nbecause there are a lot more oil and gas wells, natural gas wells \ncropping up around the country. These companies employ thousands of \nworkers across my State.\n  Frankly, they are having a tough time because of the market--nothing \nto do with imports but the fact that the price of oil is such that it \nis harder to justify drilling new wells. So the fracking has slowed \ndown and they have lost some business.\n  But the other thing that has happened is there has been a surge of \nforeign imports. So there are now a record number of imports of pipe \nand tube products coming into this country at a time when our companies \nare already seeing kind of a soft market because of the lower price of \noil and less activity in the oilfields and natural gas fields in Ohio \nand around the country.\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\n  So there are companies, such as TimkenSteel, which has over 1,000 \nworkers in Canton, OH, that are continuing to make investments in their \nplants so they can be updated, modern, and the most efficient plants in \nthe world.\n  They just made a $300 million investment. Indeed, I was there \nrecently. I was able to visit with them and see some of their new \ninvestments. It will be one of the most modern steel plants in the \nworld. Their export products are very impressive. They send them all \nover the world. These are engineered steel products. Just yesterday, \nthey told me they are now approaching about 50-percent capacity. That \nis barely breaking even for them. By the way, they are at a higher \ncapacity than most in the industry these days. Again, it is a \ncombination of a soft market and a record number of imports of pipe and \ntube products.\n  A little further east, in the Mahoning Valley, Vallourec in \nYoungstown also produces pipe and tube products. Some of you have \nfollowed Vallourec because it has been in the news. It is kind of a \nposter child for what American manufacturers should be doing, which is \ninvesting in plant and equipment. It is the first new steel mill in \nMahoning Valley in probably a couple of generations. It is very \nexciting. But, boy, they are having a tough time right now. Even though \nthey have invested in their infrastructure and they are doing all the \nright things and they are becoming more competitive, they are having a \ntough time.\n  Some of you may know about them because actually just a couple of \nyears ago President Obama was in that factory in Youngstown using it as \na backdrop to tout our American manufacturing comeback.\n  A record level of import penetration is now causing incredible \ndisruption in their production. These imports are entering our country \nat very low prices, and we all suspect this is the basis for a future \ntrade remedy case. Again, it is either dumping, selling below cost, or \na subsidized product. They want to make sure they have the ability to \nbring this case before it is too late. Our trade remedy laws haven't \nkept up with the fast pace of the global economy. Vallourec had 1,200 \nworkers in Youngstown just a couple years ago. They have now had to \nfurlough 300 workers, and I am told they are at about 20 percent \ncapacity.\n  Last week when I was on the floor, I talked about another company, \nWheatland Tube, which is also in Mahoning Valley. I now have an email \nfrom one of the officials at Wheatland Tube, and this is what he said:\n\n       As an individual employed in manufacturing, I understand \n     better than most that trade is a key component for economic \n     growth.\n\n  He starts off saying they know we need to trade. Then he says:\n\n       However, it's important for U.S. manufacturers (i.e. steel \n     pipe and tube producers) to have the tools to challenge \n     unfair trade, and that's why I believe that ANY and ALL \n     future trade agreements considered must include enforcement \n     provisions to ensure that trade is conducted fairly.\n       As a U.S. citizen who makes a living in manufacturing . . . \n     provisions included in the Leveling the Playing Field Act--\n\n  That is the amendment I am talking about--\n\n       will close loop holes in the trade laws to ensure that \n     companies can access these laws to challenge trade distorting \n     practices. I also support language in the TPP that prevents \n     currency manipulation and the ``dumping'' of foreign products \n     in the U.S.\n       It's essential that provisions to close loop holes in trade \n     laws are included in a final trade bill. After all, there's a \n     huge difference between FAIR trade and FREE trade. JMC Steel \n     Group--\n\n  Which is the parent of his organization--\n\n       relies on these laws, and has utilized them in recent years \n     to challenge trade distorting practices that have injured our \n     industry and our employees. Without laws to regulate unfair \n     trade, I know my job--\n\n  \"My job,'' he says--\n\n       and the jobs of thousands of other manufacturing workers, \n     is at risk.\n\n  So to Mike Mack, who sent me this email from Wheatland Tube in \nWarren, OH, I appreciate your expressing your point of view, and I \nappreciate your supporting this amendment. I appreciate the fact that \nyou understand that trade is important and that you have to be \ncompetitive. And that is not easy. It requires some concessions, and it \nrequires some sacrifices. But once you do that, we have to be sure we \nhave their back.\n  When these American pipe and tube manufacturers were in my office \nyesterday, they said one thing that really worried me. They said: If \nour trade remedy laws aren't fixed and fixed quickly, one of us will \nnot be at this table next year because we will be out of business.\n  These are good companies. These are companies that are doing the \nright thing. And they are telling me: Look around the table. There are \nseveral of us here now. At least one of us may not be here next year.\n  Because of these concerns we are hearing from workers and companies, \nwe are offering a very simple and modest clarification of U.S. law \nregarding the definition of ``material injury.'' In fact, I believe it \nis actually exactly what Congress intended originally.\n  The proposed legislation makes no changes to the definition of \n``material injury.'' Instead, the legislation clarifies that ``the \n[International Trade] Commission shall not determine that there is no \nmaterial injury or threat of material industry to a domestic industry \nmerely because the domestic industry is profitable or because the \nperformance of the domestic industry has recently improved.'' I think \nthis clarification underscores what the current language already shows. \nThe definition of ``material injury'' is not intended to be so \nburdensome on U.S. companies that they have to go under or at least see \njob loss before they can get the relief they deserve.\n  I hope this amendment will be supported, as it was in the Customs \npackage. I hope we can get it to the floor for a vote. I think it is \nincredibly important that we make sure this goes along with something \nthat is also very important, which is to expand our exports all around \nthe world.\n  We want to be sure American companies that are being harmed by \nillegal imports feel we are here to back them up and know they won't \nhave to wait and watch as subsidized or dumped imports put them on the \nverge of going out of business and laying off hundreds, if not \nthousands, of workers.\n  So the whole notion here is that before companies are gravely or \nseverely injured, they have the chance to make their case, that they \ncan have confidence that the U.S. trade laws will be enforced as \nCongress originally intended them to and that they will be able to \ncompete on this level playing field.\n  Protecting workers and jobs is not a partisan issue; this is \nsomething both sides of the aisle believe in. It is about fairness. It \nis about ensuring that those factory workers and towns all across \nAmerica understand that as we expand exports, as we open trade between \ncountries, we are also looking out for them and ensuring it is done in \na fair way.\n  But if they are willing to work hard, play by the rules, they can \nindeed not just succeed but thrive here in this, the greatest country \non the face of the Earth, the country that has this economy that has \nbeen in the past the envy of the entire world, on the cutting edge. We \nneed to get back to that. We need to continue making things in this \ncountry. We need to continue encouraging innovation and creativity. In \ndoing so, we will be able to have the kind of robust economic recovery \nall of us hope for. Part of this is trade, more exports, and being sure \nit is fair. Part of this is ensuring that in this body, we provide \nthose rules of the road. If we do so, I believe we will not only be \nable to help the people we represent, as we should, but also begin to \nrebuild a consensus around the importance of trade.\n  Some of you have probably followed what is going on in the House this \nweek with regard to trade promotion authority. It is tough to find the \nvotes, and I think that is reflective of the fact that a lot of our \nconstituents back home are skeptical. They are skeptical about trade \nbecause they have seen too often, as I mentioned earlier, that other \ncountries were not playing by the rules, and I gave the specific \nexamples of the U.S. steel company trying to sell its product in China \nor the EU and being blocked but not getting relief here.\n  We can fix this. It is not a matter of changing our posture on trade. \nWe are a country that is courageous. We believe in trade. We are not \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nshrink from it. But we are also a country that believes in rules and \nbelieves in taking care of the people whom we represent so that they \nare not unfairly treated in the international marketplace. That is what \nthis debate is about.\n  I hope we will have a good vote on the currency manipulation \namendment we talked about. Whether or not we will be able to get up the \nother amendment is still a matter of debate, as I understand it. I hope \nwe will be able to work through that and offer this incredibly \nimportant amendment, which is bipartisan, called level the playing \nfield that I talked about. I think having votes on both of those \nstrengthens trade promotion authority. Frankly, it makes it easier to \nget that legislation through the House and also, in the end, get \nAmerica back in the business of helping the workers and farmers and the \nservice providers whom we represent.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The PATRIOT Act\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will be talking about the PATRIOT Act \nand the USA FREEDOM Act that has been offered, and I think it is an \nimportant issue. I believe the PATRIOT Act provides critical tools that \nhave helped protect America, and I believe it does so without any \ninfringement on constitutional rights.\n  Some say we have to compromise rights or balance rights against the \nthreats. Maybe sometimes we have to do that. But when we wrote the \nPATRIOT Act in the Judiciary Committee--of which I am a member, Senator \nLeahy is a strong libertarian, Senator Hatch is a strong libertarian, \nSenator Hatch was chairman, Senator Leahy was ranking member, I had \nbeen a Federal prosecutor for 15 years; people like Jon Kyl and Dianne \nFeinstein and so many others worked on it for months--it wasn't passed \nin a few days without thought. People talked about it. It was on the \nradio and television, we got letters, we had hearings with professors \nand constitutional scholars, law enforcement officers, some public and \nsome classified briefings, and we tried to write a bill, and I believe \ndid, that provided the Federal Government an expedited method to access \nphone call data, metadata as it is called, under section 215 of the \nact.\n  Now, this data has no content--no phone communications at all. It is \njust phone numbers, even less than you get on your telephone bill when \nit comes to you in the mail every month. That data is maintained at the \ntelephone companies in their records. Everybody who makes a phone call \nshould know that, if they are alert to the world. So that record is not \nyour personal record. That record is the telephone company's record.\n  Now, if you have documents at home, if you have records in your desk, \nrecords anywhere in your house, if you have a gun or drugs that are \nillegal in your house, nobody can come in your house, they can't go \ninto your car, can't go into your glove compartment or trunk without a \ncourt order because it is within your custody and you have a right, \nunder the Fourth Amendment, to be free from an unreasonable search. The \nlaw enforcement officer has to get a court order, backed up by facts, \nbefore they can breach that Fourth Amendment.\n  Of course, the Fourth Amendment simply says that your right is \nagainst unreasonable search and seizure. It doesn't say the government \ncan never conduct a search. An unreasonable search and seizure is what \nthe Constitution talks about. I would say, first and foremost, it is \nreasonable the government be able to identify certain matters of \nevidence that could prevent a 9/11-type attack on America that could \ncause the deaths of thousands of Americans.\n  So what is it that is provided for under this act? I am raising this \nbecause I think my colleagues have misunderstood it, and they are more \nworried about it than they should be. In fact, I think many of their \nworries are based on a false understanding of how the system works and \na false understanding of how law enforcement is conducted in America \nevery day.\n  So these telephone companies all maintain these records and they are \naccessible by law enforcement. And it does not take a court order, \ncolleagues; it takes a subpoena. A subpoena is an order for production \nissued by an entity empowered to issue subpoenas.\n  The basic standard for a Drug Enforcement Administration agent to get \npeople's telephone records that are in the possession of a telephone \ncompany is the administrative subpoena. They do not have to go to a \njudge, they do not have to go to the U.S. attorney or any Federal \nprosecutor. They are empowered if the documents are relevant to an \ninvestigation they are conducting because they are not an individual's \npossession; they are the phone company's records. This is done every \nday.\n  Now, oddly, the FBI doesn't have that power. The FBI is the Agency \ncharged with the responsibility of investigating and stopping terrorist \nattacks, but they have never been given this power. They have to issue \ntheir subpoenas simply by calling the Federal prosecutor in the U.S. \nattorney's office. I was a U.S. attorney for 12 years, an assistant \nU.S. attorney for 2\\1/2\\. I approved hundreds and hundreds, thousands \nof subpoenas.\n  In almost every major investigation you want telephone toll records. \nYou are investigating a drug dealer and you capture somebody and he \nstarts providing evidence. He says: I talked to the main drug dealer. \nHow many times? Hundreds. Did you use a phone? Yes. So you immediately \nsubpoena the telephone records. Those come right in, and they can prove \nhe is telling you the truth. He has made 50 or 100 phone calls to the \nmain drug dealer. That corroborates his testimony and builds truth and \npower in the prosecution's case that this person is indeed a drug \ndealer and this witness is telling the truth.\n  Now, there are all sorts of reasons for getting documents. That is \njust one of them, but it is done every day by a subpoena. As I said, a \nsubpoena does not require a judge's approval.\n  So this all got stirred up in the PATRIOT Act, and we set up this \nprocedure with judicial oversight where the phone companies' phone \ndata--metadata--is simply put in one secure system that is accessible \nby the Federal Government. I don't believe that violates any \nconstitutional rights. It is just a mechanism by which to further the \nsystem. And before they can access it, the FBI, the National Security \nAgency, has to have more proof and put out more evidence and go through \nmore hoops than the drug enforcement agent does to get your telephone \nrecords. Remember, these records have no names. They have nothing but a \ntelephone number, the date the number was called, and how long the \nconversation was.\n  Nobody is accessing those records for personal gain. Only 30-some \npeople in the United States have the ability to access this system. \nThat is the way it works, and so I believe, colleagues, this does not \nin any way impact the integrity of the constitutional right to be free \nfrom unreasonable search and seizure under the Constitution.\n\n  Somebody may say: Well, they could abuse that. Well, they could abuse \nit, that is true. But I have to tell you, I have seen this system. I \nhave seen the people who operate it. They are not out there trying to \ncorruptly spy on politicians or anyone else. I don't know how they \ncould use the system to do that anyway. Anybody who works at the \ntelephone company can access your telephone toll records now. So how \nmuch security do you have in your telephone toll records, pray tell?\n  But these people aren't doing that. They are intensely focused. If \nthey have information connecting a phone number to a foreign terrorist \nor terrorist organization and they can see other people have called \nthat number. They can do some preliminary investigations and if there \nis a hit and some information that coincides with other data they have, \nthey may be able to investigate it. That may lead to other information \nthat may stop an attack on the United States of America.\n  These people are not after drug dealers, they are not after bank \ncheats, fraudsters or armed robbers; they are\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\nafter terrorists. That is all they are authorized to use the system \nfor.\n  I just have difficulty having the words to express how I feel about \nthis.\n  So this system can save this country from massive attacks. We know, \nand our officials are telling us, there are more threats out there than \nbefore.\n  A lot of people watch these television programs, these CSI shows and \nthings, and they get the false impression of the power of the American \nGovernment to conduct surveillance and the extent to which it is \nlimited. I have worked with FBI agents, DEA and IRS agents. They are \nnot risking their careers. They are not signing false statements. You \nsee that sometimes on television. Even the heroes do things that \nviolate the rules. In my experience, none of the Federal officers I \ndealt with violated the rules. If criminals walked, they walked. Even \nthough they desperately needed some information, the agents do not lie, \ndefraud or cheat.\n  I will tell you, these people at the NSA aren't doing that. They are \npatriots. They are the best kind of people you want to have serving in \nAmerica. So I think this is an exaggerated thing.\n  I hope, colleagues, we will spend more time identifying and looking \nthrough the challenges we face, the threats we face in America, and \nthat we will examine this program and be sure we fully understand what \nis at stake and the advantages that it brings. The President has given \nus examples of what will happen. Director Comey of the FBI said that \nlosing these authorities would be a big problem as the Agency uses \nsection 215, the key section, in about 200 cases a year to get records \nthrough the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n  By the way, colleagues, the Internal Revenue Service can issue an \nadministrative subpoena to get your bank records. I think they have the \npower to issue telephone toll records too--but, no, not here in this \nsystem. You have to go through the court process.\n  We talk about the roving wiretap authority that would expire if we do \nnot reauthorize these programs. That is used in counterespionage and \ncounterterrorism investigations and it allows the FBI to conduct \nsurveillance on a person who may be using a burner phone. In other \nwords, using a telephone and then throwing it away and switching to a \nnew phone so they maintain their ability to communicate without \ninterception.\n  This is important when you actually do get a warrant that allows a \ntitle III wiretap of a terrorist phone. You get this ability when you \ngo to court. In the affidavits I have seen--in all 12 years as a U.S. \nattorney, I think I had one or two wiretaps approved--they were \nhundreds of pages of affidavits. You have to monitor it all. It takes \ntremendous time, but if you are after a terrorist, a wiretap can be a \ndecisive and important matter.\n  Then, you face the problem of, well, you have a wiretap and it names \nthe phone and the number of it, but he throws that phone down and picks \nup another one. How do you deal with that? So this allows a roving \nwiretap and provides a mechanism for a person who changes phones, and \nit is consistent with the fundamental principle we use in drug cases \nand organized crime cases.\n  In a Washington Times article published today, the President of the \nLaw Enforcement Legal Defense Fund and former Assistant Director of the \nFBI, Ron Hosko, said:\n\n       ISIS is singing a siren song calling people to their death \n     to crash on the rocks--and it's the rocks that ISIS will take \n     credit for. They're looking for those who are disaffected, \n     disconnected and willing to commit murder. So if we're \n     willing to take away tools, OK, congressman, stand behind \n     it [and] take the credit by putting the FBI in the dark.\n\n  In other words, be sure we will be taking credit for shutting off the \nability of our investigators to protect America.\n  President Obama said it is indeed helping protect America. Last year, \nhe said:\n\n       The program grew out of a desire to address a gap \n     identified after 9/11. One of the \n     9/11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar, made a phone call from San \n     Diego to a known al-Qaida safehouse in Yemen. NSA [the \n     National Security Agency] saw that call, but could not see \n     that the call was coming from an individual already in the \n     United States.\n\n  They didn't have the legal ability or a system at that time that \ncould do it.\n  The President went on to say of the telephone metadata program:\n\n       Section 215 was designed to map the communications of \n     terrorists, so we can see who they may be in contact with as \n     quickly as possible.\n\n  Speed is critical.\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       This capability could also provide valuable information in \n     a crisis. For example, if a bomb goes off in one of our \n     cities and law enforcement is racing to determine whether a \n     network is poised to conduct additional attacks, time is of \n     the essence. Being able to quickly review telephone \n     connections to assess whether a network exists is critical to \n     that effort.\n\n  I think the President is right about that. We don't have superhuman \nabilities in this country. We don't monitor everybody's phone calls. \nThere is no way humanly possible Federal agents can do that. But once \nthey identify someone who is being connected to a terrorist group, they \ncan at least follow their phone number and whom they may be calling.\n  Passing the House bill I believe is not the right thing. The bill \nwould eliminate entirely the database through which our intelligence \nanalysts are able to quickly access information to connect the dots.\n  The bill ends these programs. It just does. It ends the metadata \nprogram, replacing it with a nonexistent, untested system. It relies on \nthe hope that private telephone companies will agree to retain this \ndata. But these companies have made it clear they will not commit, and \nflatly refuse to commit, to retaining this telephone data in their \ncomputer systems for any period of time as contemplated by the House-\npassed bill, unless they are legally required to do so--and the bill \ndoes not require them to do so.\n  One provider said the following:\n\n       [We are] not prepared to commit to voluntarily retain \n     documents for any particular period of time pursuant to the \n     proposed [House bill] if not otherwise required by law.\n\n  The House has refused to put that in.\n  Colleagues, when I was prosecuting, phone companies kept the data 3 \nyears, some phone companies more. One rural phone company never got rid \nof their data. It was amazing how often older phone calls helped \nconnect the dots, improved facts that are critical in a prosecution.\n  For example, somebody says: I never called John Jones, and then you \nfind 50 calls from their phone document to John Jones. These things \nhave tremendous importance. When we are looking to prevent an attack on \nAmerica, trying to produce intelligence to prevent enemy attacks on \nthis country, just the fact that one individual is calling another \nindividual who is known to be a terrorist is exceedingly valuable \ninformation. My goodness, maybe it is an innocent call, but it is \nworthy of looking at and investigating. That is how investigation work. \nThat is how crimes are solved. That is how attacks are stopped. One \nshred of evidence, one bit can lead to new bits that can lead to more \nand more evidence and reveals an entire organization poised to attack \nour country.\n  Let me repeat. I don't believe we have a violation of the \nConstitution. I am absolutely convinced the procedures utilized in this \nprocess are utterly consistent with the policies approved by thousands \nof court cases nationwide that law enforcement uses on a daily basis to \ninvestigate tax cheats and drug dealers. And we can't use these same \ntactics against terrorists who are enemies of the United States and \nseek to perhaps blow up and kill thousands of people?\n  I think this is a mistake. I urge my colleagues to be careful about \nit.\n  Yesterday, we received a letter from the Sergeants Benevolent \nAssociation. It pleads with us to do a short-term extension of the \nprogram: Congress, do your duty. The letter says:\n\n       With provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act set to expire in \n     less than two weeks, the responsible course is to pass a \n     short-term extension of the expiring authorities--including \n     section 215. This will allow time for the Senate to undertake \n     the kind of serious deliberative process critical national \n     security issues demand and that the American people expect of \n     ``the world's greatest deliberative body.''\n\n  I think we are doing that now. That is my opinion. I was present when \nthe law was drafted, and we tried to be sure we did that and I believe \nwe did. Some of the concerns are real. A lot of good people are \nconcerned about it. So I think it is time for us to slow down, go\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\nback to the basics, lay out this program, see what the complaints are, \nand then see if they are justified. If they are, the program will have \nto end. But I don't believe it needs to end, and right now we are \nheading on a path that will end it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Republican Leadership In Congress\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I read this morning's news, I was \nintrigued and struck by a Pew Research poll. Pew conducted a national \nsurvey to gauge Americans' satisfaction with Congress. Unsurprisingly, \nAmericans are disillusioned with the Senate and the House Republicans.\n  I guess that is kind of an understatement, if you look at the content \nof the poll. Despite constant self-congratulations from the Republican \nleadership, the American people are rejecting the Republican leadership \nin Congress.\n  Just listen to a few of these findings: Seventy-two percent of \nAmericans disapprove of the job being done by Republican leaders in \nCongress. That is an alltime high; just 4 percent of Americans say \nRepublicans in Congress have exceeded expectations--4 percent; even \nself-identifying Republicans object to how their party has governed; 55 \npercent of Republicans disapprove of Republican congressional \nleadership's job performance; fewer than 4 in 10 Republicans say their \nparty is doing a good job representing their views, but among the \nresults of the Pew survey, there is an especially troubling trend. The \nsurvey found that 65 percent of Americans say Republicans have failed \nto live up to their campaign promises; only 27 percent of Republicans \nbelieve their party is keeping its campaign promises--not Independents, \nnot Democrats but Republicans.\n  ``Integrity'' is a simple word, but here in the Capitol it is \neverything. As elected officials, all we have to offer our constituents \nis our integrity. If we are not as good as our word, then we are no \ngood for anything.\n  It is appalling that 5 months into this new Congress, most Americans \nbelieve the congressional Republicans cannot be trusted to keep their \nword.\n  What were those promises Republicans made? How about this one from \nthe majority leader: ``Our focus would be on passing legislation that \nimproves the economy, that makes it easier for Americans to find jobs, \nand that helps restore Americans' confidence in their country and their \nGovernment.''\n  That is what the majority leader said last year, but his record this \nyear tells a completely different story. So far this year, Republicans \nhave ignored the needs of their constituents. Just look at how Senate \nRepublicans have spent their time so far this year:\n  The Keystone Pipeline legislation, which is a handout to billionaires \nand certainly special interests, is a bill that brings foreign oil into \nour country and then ships it right back to the foreign nations; a near \nshutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, even as ISIS and other \nterrorist groups were threatening our Nation; a senseless delay over \nfunding for victims of human trafficking took weeks to finally finish; \nan unprecedented delay in the confirmation of the Attorney General of \nthe United States being held longer than any prospective Attorney \nGeneral in the history of the country, not only of her but many, many \njudges, not even holding hearings for them and other Cabinet and sub-\nCabinet officers--not even holding hearings.\n  Of course, there is nothing on the calendar because the committees \nare reporting nothing out of the committees.\n  They passed an immoral budget that cuts taxes for the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations, while attacking working families and \nseniors; a trade bill that is tantamount to aid for foreign \ncorporations and does nothing for the middle class; procrastinating a \nreauthorization of job creating legislation such as the highway bill.\n  We are going to be asked in the next few hours to extend the highway \nbill for the 33rd time--33rd time--for a couple of months. What a \nshame, when we have 64,000 bridges that are structurally deficient, 50 \npercent of our highways and roads are in really bad need of repair.\n  Now, 65 percent of Americans say yes, 53 percent of Republicans say \nso, too, that they are not living up to their campaign promises. So who \ncan argue with that?\n  One need only look at Senate Republicans' legislative agenda to \nrealize there is nothing on the horizon that helps working American \nfamilies. At this rate, Congress will finish this year with nothing to \nshow the middle class--nothing.\n  This trade bill, as I mentioned this morning, is a handout to \nmultinational corporations and does nothing for the middle class, \nexcept cause them to lose jobs that will be shipped overseas. But the \nwealthiest 1 percent have reaped benefits during this first 5 months of \nthis Congress. That is why Americans--72 percent of Americans--\ndisapprove of the way Republicans are leading Congress.\n  But there is still time to right the ship. There are many things we \ncan do in the Senate to help boost the middle class. We can pass a \nhighway bill that immediately injects jobs into our economy, while \nensuring that our businesses and families have safe roadways, rails, \nand bridges to navigate. We can give American workers a livable wage \nand ensure that no full-time employee is living in poverty.\n  We can address the mounting burden that student loan debt has on our \neconomy, which is worse than any other debt, more than credit card \ndebt, more than anything else. There are many other things we can do \nfor American families that have not been done.\n  It is clear Republicans are not accomplishing much on their own, so \nwhy not work with us? Democrats are willing.\n  Together, we can all keep our word to our constituents. We can follow \nthrough on our commitment to help middle-class Americans and get them \nthe help they need and deserve.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the distinguished ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, Senate Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Outstanding issues in the trade debate\n\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, I want to thank Senator Wyden for his \nefforts in trying to accommodate the priorities of Members of the \nSenate during debate on this bill. We have been hard at work trying to \naddress various concerns. Now, as we approach a final vote, we need to \ntalk about some outstanding issues that we have not been able to \nresolve during this debate.\n  Specifically, there are four issues that we are committed to \naddressing.\n  First, during this debate we developed language to address Member \nconcerns about immigration policy, particularly the concerns that trade \nnegotiations could be used to alter U.S. immigration law or policy. An \namendment filed by Senator Cruz during the floor debate clarified this \nissue.\n  Second, one of the provisions of the TPA bill relates to forced labor \nand human trafficking. Senator Menendez championed an effort to include \nthese provisions in the bill reported by the Finance Committee. Since \nthat time, Senator Menendez worked with us to refine these provisions \nand to improve their operation. We supported an amendment filed by \nSenator Menendez to make these refinements.\n  There is also strong bipartisan interest in providing more robust \ndirection for trade in the fishing industry. Senator Sullivan has been \na leader in this area.\n  Finally, there were proposed amendments to strengthen U.S. trade \nremedy laws. Senators Brown and Portman were key leaders in this area \nand filed an amendment to address this issue on the floor. We supported \nthis amendment as well.\n  I believe there was strong bipartisan consensus in favor of all four \nof these efforts. Unfortunately, we were unable to address them during \nconsideration of the TPA bill on the floor. Going forward, I want to be \nclear that we are committed to address all four of these concerns in \nthe context of the future conference of the Trade Facilitation and \nTrade Enforcement Act, which has already passed the Senate. I have a \nletter here from Chairman Ryan of the\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee committing to work with us on these \nissues when that bill goes to conference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden: As the Senate \n     is considering the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities \n     and Accountability Act, I would like to convey that I intend \n     to seek adoption of legislative changes to H.R. 1907, the \n     Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, when it \n     is considered in the House. These changes will include the \n     following four provisions:\n       Legislation sought by the House Congressional Steel Caucus \n     (H.R. 2523), to make improvements to the antidumping and \n     countervailing duty laws;\n       The text of Senate Amendment 1384, offered by Sen. Hatch \n     and Senator Cruz, to ensure that trade agreements do not \n     require changes to U.S. immigration laws;\n       The text of Senate Amendment 1430, offered by Senator \n     Menendez, related to human trafficking; and\n       The text of Senate Amendment 1246, offered by Senator \n     Sullivan, related to opportunities for trade in fish, \n     seafood, and shellfish.\n       I look forward to continuing to work with you on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would ask Senator Wyden if he is willing to work with me \nto address these issues in this fashion.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I agree, that these are very important issues that we are \ncommitted to addressing in the coming conference on the Trade \nFacilitation and Trade Enforcement Act.\n  I will note that the Brown-Portman trade remedy legislation was \nincluded in the Senate version of the bill. I think it would be \nappropriate to try to address these other issues in that context as \nwell, and I commit to working with Chairman Hatch to do so.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into \na colloquy with Senators Hatch and Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             NEPALI EXPORTS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Senators Hatch and Wyden, I appreciate your work on \nthe trade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance \nlegislation. As you have said, this bill authorizes the President to \nconclude high-standard free-trade agreements, which are expected to \ntremendously benefit California and the Nation. It also reauthorizes \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to provide retraining and \nincome support for workers displaced by international trade. In 2013, \nmore than 7,000 Californians received assistance from this program.\n  While I support H.R. 1314, I remain concerned that the United States \nmust do more to help the people of Nepal recover from the earthquake \nand aftershocks that have devastated the country. As you know, the \nearthquakes have killed nearly 10,000 people, displaced more than 2.8 \nmillion others, and damaged or destroyed more than 500,000 homes. The \nU.S. Geological Survey estimates losses could exceed Nepal's $20 \nbillion annual gross domestic product, which is a truly staggering \nfigure for such a poor nation.\n  While the international community has rushed to provide humanitarian \naid, the United States can do more to assist Nepal's long-term economic \nrecovery.\n  Senator Hatch, do you agree that the United States should consider \nproviding preferential treatment to Nepali exports to help the country \nrecover?\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Yes, I agree. The United \nStates came to Haiti's aid after it suffered a devastating earthquake \nin 2010. We should do the same for Nepal today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Senator Hatch. To that end, I have filed \nan amendment, No. 1438, that would provide nonsensitive Nepali exports \nduty-free treatment in the U.S. market. Doing so would be consistent \nwith our response to Haiti's devastating earthquake in 2010 and would \nattract much needed international investment in Nepal during this time \nof need.\n  While I understand that we will not have an opportunity to further \namend H.R. 1314, I ask you to provide your commitment to work include \nmy legislation in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of \n2015--also known as the Customs enforcement bill--or a similar bill as \nreported by a conference committee to reauthorize trade facilitation \nand trade enforcement functions and activities.\n  Mr. HATCH. You have my commitment to do so.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Senator Hatch. I appreciate your \ncommitment to assisting Nepal.\n  Senator Wyden, do you also commit to include my Nepal legislation in \nthe Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, I also commit to include your Nepal legislation in \nthe Customs enforcement bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate Chairman Hatch and Ranking \nMember Wyden's work on this bill, and agree that this bill provides \naccountability and transparency. On immigration, I have expressed \nconcerns every step of the way about the executive branch negotiating \nchanges to immigration laws through trade agreements. Even before I \nbecame chairman of the Judiciary Committee--in fact, when I was \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance committee--I opposed \nprevious administrations' attempts to include immigration provisions in \ntrade agreements.\n  Because of that, I demanded that the Judiciary Committee be consulted \non anything related to immigration. That has been done, and that has \nhelped stop the administration in recent years from including \nprovisions in trade agreements requiring changes to the immigration \nlaws.\n  During consideration of this bill in the Finance Committee this year, \nI asked USTR Ambassador Froman about this issue, and specifically if \nthey were including anything on immigration in the next agreement, \nspecifically the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He gave us assurances that \nthey were not. Ambassador Froman was clear that other countries are \nmaking offers to each other in the area of temporary entry, but that \nthe U.S. has decided not to do so.\n  Nevertheless, Chairman Hatch and I wrote him a letter after he \ntestified, and he wrote back with more assurances. Ambassador Froman \nacknowledged that there is a chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nagreement on the temporary entry of persons, but that this chapter only \nincludes ``good governance provisions on transparency with respect to \nvisa processing and cooperation on border security.'' He also said that \nthis chapter includes commitments of other Trans-Pacific Partnership \nparties to make information on requirements for temporary entry \npublicly available. The U.S. already is very transparent about its visa \napplication processes and eligibility requirements, and already \nprocesses visas as expeditiously as possible.\n  When the committee took up the bill, Chairman Hatch and Ranking \nMember Wyden, at my request, included language in the accompanying \nreport that would make it very clear that Congress will not tolerate \nchanges to immigration laws, policies, or practices. This language is \nvery strong and sends a signal to negotiators that trade agreements \nwill not pass if they require changes to our immigration system, \nprevent us from changing our immigration laws or policies or even just \nrepeat commitments we may have unfortunately made in previous trade \nagreements.\n  I appreciate the Chairman and Ranking Member's attention to this \nissue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the trade \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  What we have done so far has been to consider:\n  No. 1, the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. This bill extends \na number of trade preference programs related to Africa and Haiti. It \nalso reauthorizes the Generalized System of Preferences Program, which \nexpired in 2013.\n  No. 2, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. This \nbill includes new trade enforcement mechanisms to protect American \nworkers from unfair trade practices. The\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\nlegislation also includes a complete ban on importing goods created by \nchild labor, which I strongly support.\n  No. 3, trade adjustment assistance. This bill reauthorizes Federal \nassistance for worker retraining and income support to those displaced \nby trade. In fiscal year 2013, 7,609 Californians received training \nunder the program, so I believe it is critical that we continue this \nassistance.\n  No. 4, trade promotion authority. This bill authorizes the President \nto conclude free-trade agreements with our trading partners. In \nexchange, those agreements will receive an up-or-down vote in the \nCongress.\n  I voted for these bills because they will update our trade policy in \na smart, effective way.\n  The process of considering these bills has enabled me to see the \nextraordinary importance of trade to California's economy.\n  In 2013, California's total gross domestic product was an estimated \n$2.2 trillion. That makes it the eighth largest economy in the world, \nsurpassing that of Russia and Italy and soon to overtake Brazil. The \nservices industry--both high-skilled professional services and lower \nskilled jobs in accommodation, food and administration--have lead \nCalifornia's economic recovery since the 2008 recession. In fact, 66 \npercent of all new jobs in California created over the past year were \nin services.\n  Trade is critical to sustaining this job growth. In 2013, California \nexported $114 billion in services, which was a 58-percent growth since \n2006. California's services exports substantially contributed to the \noverall services trade surplus of the United States, which reached over \n$200 billion in 2013.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is expected to boost services exports \neven more by prohibiting customs duties for digital products; applying \nthe same nondiscrimination standards for digital goods as manufactured \ngoods; prohibiting countries from requiring companies to transfer their \ntechnology, business processes, or intellectual property; and requiring \nstrong and enforceable intellectual property rights. From Silicon \nValley to Hollywood, these expected provisions will continue to drive \nCalifornia's services exports and our overall economy.\n  In 2014, California exported $174.1 billion in total merchandise \ngoods, supporting more than 775,000 jobs. That is a near 11 percent \nincrease in jobs since 2009.\n  Now, there is a common perception that only large businesses benefit \nfrom trade. That has not been the case in my State. Small and medium-\nsized businesses--and their employees--have led the way in merchandise \nexports in California. Some 75,175 companies exported from California \nin 2013, of which 95.8 percent--72,032--were small and medium-sized \nbusinesses. Increased trade could grant these firms with new \nopportunities to grow, and their employees could see higher wages as a \nresult. According to an economist at Dartmouth's Tuck School of \nBusiness, businesses that export pay wages on average 15 percent more \nthan firms that do not. For a high-cost State like California, higher \nwages are a top priority. Increasing our exports is a commonsense means \nto that end.\n\n  I am confident that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will help \nCalifornia's small and medium businesses and our overall economy \nbecause that has been my State's experience with our existing free-\ntrade partners.\n  In 2014, of California's total merchandise exports, $70.4 billion \nwere to nations with which the United States already has free-trade \nagreements. Over the past 10 years, exports from California to these \nfree-trade partners grew by 50 percent. If the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership substantially reduces tariff barriers--as other agreements \nhave--California's exports will benefit substantially.\n  Today, my State's exports of computers and electronic products face \ntariffs as high as 35 percent; transportation equipment face tariffs as \nhigh as 70 percent; machinery face tariffs as high as 70 percent; and \nhealth products face tariffs as high as 30 percent. Reducing tariffs on \nthese manufactured goods has proven to be a boon to California's \neconomy, and I hope we can keep moving in that direction.\n  Finally, California agriculture relies on export markets. The State's \nagricultural exports were valued $21.2 billion in 2013. That is far \nmore than any other State. This trade has helped the state's \nagricultural industry become the largest by value in the United States. \nIn fact, the California Department of Food and Agriculture reports that \nCalifornia's 77,900 farms produced $44.7 billion in output in 2013. \nThis is a massive sum, and it will only grow with trade.\n  According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture study, under TPP \nnationwide agriculture exports are expected to increase 54 percent by \n2025.\n  For California's products, reduced tariffs and scientific-based \nsanitary and phytosanitary standards will be key. For example, \nCalifornia dairy products face a tariff of up to 35 percent in Japan, \nwhile California walnuts face a tariff of 30 percent in Vietnam. In \nAustralia, California beef has been blocked due in part to unfounded \nfears of mad cow disease. Reducing these trade barriers is expected to \nbenefit dozens of agricultural commodities in my State--especially \nfruits, tree nuts, vegetables, dairy, beef, wine, confections, rice and \ncitrus exports. In fact, TPP can sustain the growth of California's \nagricultural exports to those countries, which from 2009 to 2013 \nincreased in value from $4.8 billion to $7.5 billion. Overall, it is \napparent that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will continue to support \nthe immense success of California's farmers, ranchers, and producers.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that California relies on trade. It has \nbeen critical for our economic recovery and will be vital for \nsustaining our growth. Therefore, I am pleased to support passage of \ntrade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance. With trade \npromotion authority in place, I hope the President can send to Congress \nstrong and fair trade agreements.\n  While the Trans-Pacific Partnership holds tremendous promise, it is \nmy hope that the Obama administration concludes a final agreement that \nI can support.\n  I look forward to reviewing the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the \ncoming months.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, International trade is a vital part of our \nNation's economy. Nearly one-third of the country's gross domestic \nproduct is supported by trade in goods and services and, indeed, my \nState of Rhode Island exported goods totaling $2.4 billion in 2014. It \nis also a key component of our international partnerships and global \nsecurity efforts.\n  However, the question today is not whether we should engage in trade. \nIt is about the bill before us, and whether trade promotion authority, \nTPA, so-called ``fast-track,'' is in our best interest. It remains my \nview that Congress has a critical role to play in thoroughly vetting \ntrade agreements. Passing this legislation takes away this role, \nreducing Congressional approval to an up-or-down vote. The bill before \nus today would also prohibit amendments and limit debate to just 20 \nhours. I believe that the scope and complexity of modern trade \nagreements demand more time for debate and a greater ability to \ncontribute than this framework provides.\n  Further, this bill allows for a 6-year grant of TPA, meaning that any \ntrade agreement under any administration over the next several years \ncould receive this expedited approval. A number of trade agreements are \ncurrently being negotiated and it is impossible to know what additional \ntrade deals may be pursued and what other factors, both here and \nabroad, may change over the course of the next several years. Given \nthis, I do not think that Congress should vote to limit its own \noversight, particularly for such a long period of time.\n  I also have concerns about the negotiating objectives set forth in \nthis package. We need negotiating objectives that are enforceable. \nWithout stronger and more concrete language on a number of key issues \nincluding currency manipulation, labor, and environmental standards, \nthese negotiating objectives are unlikely to make an impact or be seen \nas a critical component for reaching a deal by our partners. For this \nreason, I joined Senators Portman and Stabenow and many of our \ncolleagues in cosponsoring and voting for amendment 1299, which, had it\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\npassed, would have established a negotiating objective that urges the \nadministration to press for rules against currency manipulation that \nare enforceable and consistent with IMF obligations. Without \nstrengthening this and other objectives within TPA, they become mere \nsuggestions, failing to afford critical protection to American workers \nand interests.\n  I commend the work of Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden, along \nwith Senator Brown and other colleagues, to find a path forward for the \ncustoms and African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, reauthorization \nbills that we passed last week, which I was pleased to join a majority \nof my colleagues in supporting. I am also pleased that a path forward \nhas been found for Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, which I have \nconsistently supported. Most recently, I cosponsored Senator Brown's \namendment to raise TAA funding levels to better support workers who \nhave been displaced by trade. We all know that trade is not a tide that \nequally lifts all boats, and, so while I am pleased that TAA appears to \nbe moving forward at this time, I am disappointed that the Brown \namendment to enhance support for TAA did not pass.\n  We need to set the highest bar for our trade policy. It needs to \nadvance our strategic and national interests while ensuring that \nAmerican workers are in the best position to compete in this global \neconomy. They deserve nothing less, and, in my view, TPA simply does \nnot do enough to protect workers in my State of Rhode Island and across \nthe country. For these reasons, I must oppose this legislation.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today I will vote to approve the \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act, which \nwill grant the President trade promotion authority, TPA, through 2021.\n  This was not an easy decision, but one I am confident is right for \nNorth Dakota. Exports are critical to the bottom line of our State's \nagricultural producers as well as our manufacturers.\n  Agricultural exports means jobs. In 2013, North Dakota exported over \n$4 billion in agricultural products ranging from beef to wheat to fresh \nvegetables. USDA estimates that in 2013, every $1 billion in U.S. \nagricultural exports, 7,580 American jobs are required. For North \nDakota that translated into more than 30,000 jobs supported by \nagricultural exports. We must do everything we can to expand \nagricultural exports to support existing jobs and create new ones.\n  In 2013, total North Dakota grain exports totaled over $3.5 billion. \nNorth Dakota-grown hard red spring and durum wheat exports made us the \nNo. 2 wheat exporting State in the Nation, with exports valued at over \n$1.2 billion in 2013. North Dakota was also the No. 2 exporting State \nfor soybeans in 2014/15, exporting 182 million bushels. These \ncommodities are exported around the world, but especially to the \nPacific Rim and Europe, where the United States is currently \nnegotiating free trade agreements which will remove barriers which make \nus less competitive.\n  North Dakota is also an important exporter of manufactured goods like \nfarm machinery. CNH Industrial's plant in Fargo exported nearly 35 \npercent of the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture 4wd tractors it \nmanufactured in 2014. The plant is supported by 23 North Dakota \nsuppliers from across the State, among others.\n  I continue to have concerns with several provisions of this bill and \nour overall trade policy, particularly as it relates to currency \nmanipulation and investor-state dispute settlement. As we have heard \ntime and again, currency manipulation is one of the biggest threats to \nU.S. competitiveness, costing us millions of jobs. I supported \namendments which would strengthen our negotiating position relating to \ncurrency, and I will continue to fight for policies which put U.S. \nexporters and workers on an even playing field.\n  Any trade package must also include strong enforcement provisions and \nassistance for workers whose jobs are impacted by trade. That is why I \ninsisted the Senate vote on a Customs and enforcement bill as a \ncondition for my support for moving TPA forward. This TPA bill also \nincludes an important extension of trade adjustment assistance to make \nsure those negatively affected by new trade agreements receive the \neducation and training they need to get new jobs and support their \nfamilies.\n  Additionally, I received a commitment from the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative that he will continue working to improve the integrity \nof the investor-state dispute settlement system. I will continue to \nwork to ensure this process does not put foreign companies at an \nadvantage over our American industries or threaten the sovereignty of \nour States.\n  I also fought for and secured a path forward for voting for the \nExport-Import Bank in June, before the bank's charter expires, as part \nof my negotiations on TPA. When we talk about the United States' trade \npolicy, we cannot leave out important tools which help our small \nbusinesses export and thrive. That includes reauthorizing the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  Today's vote is just the beginning of our work to open markets for \nour farmers, ranchers and workers. We live in a global economy. We can \ncompete on a global playing field while also making sure we focus on \nbuilding and supporting American jobs and businesses. I will continue \nto fight for North Dakota as we negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nAgreement and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership to ensure \nthat we not only have free trade, but fair trade.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Access to Community Care for Veterans Act of 2015\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to bring S. 1463 to the attention of \nmy colleagues.\n  The topic of the bill is one my colleagues have heard me speak about \nnumerous times before in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, where I am a \nmember. Just yesterday, I addressed this topic in the appropriations \nsubcommittee markup of veterans and military construction, where I am a \nmember and have many times on the Senate floor. The issue is the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and its interpretation of the CHOICE \nAct.\n  My colleagues will remember we passed the CHOICE Act back in August \nof last year. The important provision for today's conversation is what \nthat law says, which is, if a veteran lives more than 40 miles from a \nVA facility, the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide services, \nif the veteran chooses, at a location in his or her home community.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Veterans Affairs has interpreted it \nin a way that eliminates the opportunity for a veteran who happens to \nlive within 40 miles of a facility from accessing that care, even \nthough that facility doesn't provide the service the veteran needs.\n  S. 1463 corrects that problem. It indicates that the 40-mile rule \napplies only in the circumstance where a veterans facility provides the \nservice the veteran needs. The Senate has previously voted on this \nprovision. In fact, in our budget, it was adopted 100 to 0 on a \nrollcall vote.\n  I think what I am presenting is something that is very \nnoncontroversial. There is no fiscal consequence to the current \nspending. This is money that was appropriated in the CHOICE Act and \nshould be something that can pass on a unanimous consent request, which \nI will make momentarily.\n  The question may be why are you doing this? It is because it is \nimportant and needs to be corrected quickly. This bill, if adopted \ntoday by unanimous consent, will go to the House of Representatives \nwhere it can be considered.\n  I also hope what happens here is that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, which I believe can correct this problem on its own volition, \nwill do so, and when they see the Senate pass this legislation, \nhopefully by unanimous consent, they will respond and solve this \nproblem immediately.\n  There is no reason this can't be done by the Department, and I will \noutline the explanation of why that is true by reading the CHOICE Act \nand by the report that confirms our position.\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\n  Before I ask unanimous consent, I also wish to thank a number of my \ncolleagues, but in particular I thank the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, who has worked side by side with me to make certain \nthis legislation ultimately becomes law. In fact, the chairman and the \nranking member, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, have \ncommitted to me that on every occasion, should the House not pass this \nbill--I will say it this way: Three options can occur. If we pass this \nby unanimous consent today, the House picks it up, passes it, sends it \nto the President, the President signs it, and that would be a great \noutcome. Secondly, we pass this bill, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs realizes they can do this on their own, and that would be a \ngreat outcome. Thirdly, if neither one of those things happens, the \nchairman has committed to me that he will work side by side with all of \nus on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and with other Senators to \nmake sure, at every opportunity, the language included in this bill is \nincluded in every bill related to veterans affairs that is on its way \nto the White House. The chairman will work with me to make sure this \nlanguage is enacted into law.\n  I ask, through the Chair, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, if \nwhat I am indicating is accurate and have him explain his thoughts on \nthis topic in the few moments we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, responding through the Chair to the \nSenator from Kansas, his language is precisely the language that was \nintroduced by the committee in the Senate, which we were going to send \nto the House, but it got lost in the negotiations on the extension of \nthe authorization in the House. A technical difficulty is the only \nreason it wasn't already a part of it.\n  I wholeheartedly endorse everything the Senator from Kansas said and \npledge to him that if for some reason the House does not adopt the \nlanguage, we will take it up immediately in the Senate when we have our \nnext markup meeting in the Veterans' Affairs Committee and take care of \nit.\n  I personally wish to acknowledge Senator Bennet and Senator Gardner \nfor all the work they have done. We went to Colorado together to visit \nthe VA hospital, which is the genesis of where this motion comes from. \nThey have been champions for this, and I am glad we are reaching a \nresolution in the motion that will be made shortly to adopt the House \nposition on the authorization. We will see to it that the hospital in \nDenver remains open until we can solve the problems we have in the \nDenver hospital.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for his cooperation, and I commend \nhim on his language. I confirm everything he said as being accurate, \ntrue, and correct.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and very much \nappreciate his commitment to veterans. This is not about a specific \npiece of legislation, it is about keeping our commitment to those who \nserved our country, always, every day but especially in advance of \nMemorial Day.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1463, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1463) to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and \n     Accountability Act of 2014 to modify the distance requirement \n     for expanded availability of hospital care and medical \n     services for veterans through the use of agreements with non-\n     Department of Veterans Affairs entities.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1463) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2496, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2496) to extend the authorization for the \n     replacement of the existing Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, to make certain \n     improvements in the Veterans Access, Choice, and \n     Accountability Act of 2014, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the measure?\n  If not, the bill having been read the third time, the question is, \nShall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2496) was passed.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank \nmy colleagues for lifting the authorization cap to allow construction \nto continue on the VA hospital in Aurora, CO. This project has been an \nabsolutely shameful display of mismanagement from the very beginning. \nAnd the Colorado delegation has been screaming from the hilltops about \na flawed strategy on the part of the VA for years now. But with the \nright accountability and transparency reforms, we have all concluded \nthat the right thing to do is to move forward and complete this \nfacility. And today, we have acknowledged that the worst possible thing \nwe could do is to stop work on the construction site again. Doing so \nwould add hundreds of millions of dollars in extra costs to the project \nand would be a grave disservice to veterans throughout Colorado. This \nis an important step, but we have a long way to go.\n  The VA and Congress are going to have to work together to get this \nproject back on track. And finding the money to do this will be \npainful, which is why we need to ensure strong accountability and that \nwe protect critical programs and services for our veterans. Failing to \ncomplete this hospital, though, simply is not an option.\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\nHaving a half-finished hospital in Colorado would be a national \ndisgrace. And the hundreds of thousands of veterans across the Rocky \nMountain region that this hospital would service deserve better.\n  I especially want to thank Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member \nBlumenthal for their work on this project and for their commitment to \nfinishing the hospital. And, I want to thank my colleague Senator \nGardner for his work--especially in the last hours--to avoid a shut \ndown.\n  Mr. President, before I turn this over to my colleague from Colorado, \nI thank Chairman Isakson for his extraordinary leadership in getting \nthis done. It was very difficult to do.\n  Senator Isakson and Senator Blumenthal came to Colorado. They are \nboth men of their word, and I have never doubted that for an instant. \nThe chairman has set an incredible example for this body.\n  I also thank the Senator from Kansas for his work on this \nlegislation.\n  My colleague, Senator Gardner, from Colorado, has been a true \nchampion for our veterans. He has helped us keep our delegation \ntogether as we have gone through a rough patch here and, through the \nChair, I thank him for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I reiterate the thanks my colleague from \nColorado has given to Chairman Isakson of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee as well as to the Senator from Kansas who worked closely with \nus to make sure we could all get behind two measures we support, both \nof which would provide greater care and support for our veterans.\n  To my colleague Senator Bennet from Colorado, through the Chair, I \nthank him for the work we have been able to do. This has been a \ntireless effort in the hours leading up to Memorial Day to make sure we \nprovide the resources necessary to continue a hospital project in \nDenver that has been, no doubt, beleaguered by problems, but something \nwe must fulfill and must continue to fulfill to complete the project, \nto get this thing built, and to make sure it does not result in even \nhigher costs than it has already undertaken.\n  This is an effort that is going to take continued cooperation, not \nonly by the Colorado delegation but by the Veterans' Administration \nitself. Over the next 3 weeks, we have been given a reprieve to make \nsure we can find the policies and a viable path forward to get this job \ndone that results in a hospital that will complete and fulfill the \npromises we made to the veterans in Colorado.\n  Through the Chair, I say to my colleague Senator Bennet great thanks \nfor his leadership on all accounts, and I thank Chairman Isakson on \nbehalf of veterans across Colorado for his leadership and work in \nmaking this happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for the \nprogress we have been making on a very bipartisan basis.\n  I particularly wish to thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee for working so diligently on an immediate and temporary \nsolution to advance the Aurora project and enable us to keep it going. \nOur visit out there illustrated to us the importance of this project \nwhich my two colleagues and friends from Colorado have described so \nwell and eloquently.\n  I thank my friend from the great State of Kansas. He and I have \nworked to make sure veterans are really served by the CHOICE program, \nalong with the chairman, who has understood and enabled us to work \ntogether on a bill which will be passed by unanimous consent, I hope, \nand will be passed by the House of Representatives, I hope, by \nunanimous consent. But if not, as I have committed to him, I will \ncontinue to work to make sure the 40-mile rule and choice mean veterans \nare served by a facility that can give them the care they need and \ndeserve. Our heroes ought not to have to travel great distances or wait \nan inordinate amount of time to receive medical care that is so vital \nand so well deserved by them. They have earned it, and they ought to \nhave it.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for working so well and diligently on this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3290-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3290-S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ENSURING TAX EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from Judge Stephen Schwebel, who is both a dispute \narbitrator and president of the International Court of Justice. This \nletter provides a useful perspective on the investment matters that \nhave been discussed this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 5, 2015.\n     Senator Ron Wyden,\n     Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: I have been asked to comment on \n     statements that have recently been circulated that oppose \n     inclusion in the projected Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) of \n     provision for investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS). \n     Please permit me to note that I addressed criticism of ISDS a \n     year ago at some length in a speech to the Congress of the \n     International Council for Commercial Arbitration. A copy of \n     that speech is attached. I believe that it is of current \n     pertinence.\n       For my part, as a former Judge and President of the \n     International Court of Justice, with experience going back to \n     1954 in international arbitration between States, between \n     corporations and States, and in international commercial \n     arbitration, I remain convinced that investor-State dispute \n     settlement is a progressive development in international law \n     and relations that should be preserved and nurtured. It \n     should certainly be included in the TPP and in the comparable \n     transatlantic treaty under negotiation as it has been in more \n     than 3000 bilateral investment treaties, and in important \n     multilateral treaties, notably NAFTA and the Energy Charter \n     Treaty.\n       A letter of April 30, 2015 written to leaders of the Senate \n     and House by five distinguished professors of law and \n     economics and a former Circuit Court Judge criticizes 1SDS \n     because it allows foreign investors to avoid U.S. courts by \n     resorting to arbitral tribunals. The letter fails to take \n     account of the fundamental fact that treaties are reciprocal. \n     If the United States seeks to have disputes that arise \n     between American investors and foreign governments not \n     resolved by foreign courts, some of which may be less than \n     objective in their treatment of foreign investors; if the \n     United States seeks to substitute the rule of law for its \n     exercise of diplomatic protection which if and when \n     episodically extended is often ineffective; if the United \n     States seeks to avoid the gunboat diplomacy of earlier era, \n     then it must be ready to extend to foreign investors \n     investing in the United States the option of recourse to \n     international arbitration which their governments \n     reciprocally extend to U.S. investors. It is of course true \n     that U.S. courts generally have high standards in their \n     treatment of foreign parties. It is also true that the \n     substantive provisions of treaties providing for investor/\n     State arbitration are consistent with U.S. Constitutional \n     guarantees. In point of fact, few arbitral cases have been \n     filed against the United States in ISDS proceedings and so \n     far the United States has won them all.\n       A report of the Transnational Institute of 2012 charges \n     that a small group of arbitrators has decided a majority of \n     investor/State disputes, that this group is ``riven with \n     conflicts'', and that they exhibit a ``strong market \n     orientation''. An example cited is that of Marc Lalonde ``who \n     has served on the board for energy and mining company \n     Sherritt International'' while energy and mining cases \n     ``account for half of the 30 cases in which he has served as \n     arbitrator''. But in fact Mr. Lalonde earlier was a very \n     senior official of the Government of Canada for some 20 \n     years, serving as a Minister of the Crown--a cabinet officer, \n     in American parlance--for Health and Welfare, Status of \n     Women, Federal-Provincial Relations, Justice, Energy, Mines \n     and Resources, and Finance. By parity of reasoning, he should \n     exhibit not a strong market orientation but a strong pro-\n     State orientation. In point of fact, Mr. Lalonde exhibits an \n     impartial orientation and has the confidence of both \n     governments and investors, as his colleagues in the field do \n     as well. If they did not, the system of investor/State \n     arbitration would not have flourished as it has.\n       Charges by groups and individuals that the ISDS process \n     manifests ``a serious pro-company tilt'' are contrary to \n     fact. Of 144 publically available arbitral awards, as of \n     January 2012, where arbitrators resolved a dispute arising \n     under a treaty, States won 87 cases, and investors won 57. \n     ICSID statistics show that of its disputes decided in 2013, \n     jurisdiction was declined in 31%, the award dismissed all \n     claims in 32%, and an award upholding claims in part or in \n     fill issued in 37%. These figures in the large hardly support \n     the allegation of a bias against States. If investment \n     arbitrators were truly influenced by the prospects of \n     remuneration for extended proceedings and for further \n     appointments, why would they terminate so\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\n     many arbitral proceedings at the jurisdictional stage? \n     Moreover, the large majority of international arbitral awards \n     are unanimous, a fact that suggests that arbitrators are not \n     unduly responsive to the interests of the party that \n     appointed them.\n       In short, the integrity of ISDS is demonstrably high.\n           Your sincerely,\n                                              Stephen M. Schwebel.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to be brief because I know \nChairman Hatch and I are going to be propounding some unanimous consent \nrequests here in a moment.\n  On this currency issue, I want it understood that this is a serious, \nserious issue, and it is absolutely essential that our trade laws \ninclude tough enforceable currency rules and that we put in place those \nrules without doing damage to American monetary policy or to our \nability to tackle the big economic challenges in the days ahead.\n  The Senate has a choice between the amendment offered by Senator \nHatch and me and the amendment offered by Senator Portman and Senator \nStabenow. My view is this. The Portman amendment could outsource the \nquestion of the Federal Reserve's intent and decisionmaking to the \nwhims of an international tribunal. This could take tools out of the \neconomic toolbox that we could need--need greatly--during a potential \nfinancial crisis. We hope it will never happen, but the bottom line is \nthe Congress must not set up the possibility of collateral damage for \nthe Fed and our dollar.\n  The right solution, which Chairman Hatch and I have worked to offer \nas an alternative, will make sure that America gets the upside of \ncracking down on currency manipulators and avoids the downside of \nlimiting the Federal Reserve's toolkit of monetary policy. Our view is \nthat we strike the right balance. We make sure that we are going to \nhave the widest array of effective tools available, including strong, \nenforceable rules. I think we ought to take that route. The alternative \ncould subject our country to disputes over our own monetary policies. \nThat means, as I indicated, that the alternative--the Portman-Stabenow \namendment--would, in effect, outsource questions of the Federal \nReserve's intent to the whims of an international tribunal.\n  Now, the Portman amendment tries to carve out domestic monetary \npolicy. It sure sounds like a good idea. But when we have opened \nourselves up to attack over our policies, other countries will not have \nto take our word that our policies are on the up and up. Even with that \ncarve-out, other countries can still come after us.\n  For example, many countries argued that our quantitative easing \npolicy unfairly devalued the dollar. They were dead wrong on that. But \nthe Senate shouldn't do anything that could strengthen the hand of \nthose countries that want to attack our monetary policies.\n  Now that Chairman Hatch is here, I wish to propound a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Over the past few days, Chairman Hatch and I have been working in a \nbipartisan and cooperative fashion to come up with a balanced package \nof amendments that can be voted on. I very much appreciate the work of \nthe chairman and his bipartisan leadership and particularly of my \nnorthwest colleague, Senator Murray. It appears regrettable that we \nhave come up short, but for the benefit of colleagues, I wish to \npropound a unanimous consent request that would be acceptable to our \nside. These are amendments that I believe are important for the Senate \nto consider as part of this debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the following first-\ndegree amendments to the Hatch substitute be made pending during \ntoday's session of the Senate and that no other first-degree amendments \nbe in order:\n  Cruz-Grassley No. 1384 on immigration; Menendez No. 1430 on \ntrafficking; Sullivan No. 1246 on fish and shellfish; Warren No. 1328 \non financial services; Daines No. 1418 on Indian tribes; Donnelly No. \n1406 on training programs; Sessions No. 1233 on congressional approval; \nBoxer No. 1371 on minimum wage; Paul No. 1383 on bonuses for cost \ncutters; Manchin No. 1413 on State effects; Paul No. 1408 on auditing \nthe Fed; Cardin No. 1230 on human rights; Brown-Portman No. 1252 on \nleveling playing field; Whitehouse No. 1387 on unregulated fishing; \nMarkey No. 1308 on clean air and water; Merkley No. 1404 on food \ninformation; Casey-Murphy No. 1436 on Buy American; Baldwin No. 1317 on \ntrade remedy; Bennet No. 1309 on poverty/hunger;\n  Further, that the time until 5 p.m. today be equally divided in the \nusual form; that at 5 p.m. today the Senate vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed: Hatch-Wyden No. 1411 on \ncurrency; Portman-Stabenow No. 1299 on currency; Warren No. 1327 on \nISDS; Flake No. 1243 on striking TAA; Brown No. 1251 on China docking; \nCruz-Grassley No. 1384 on immigration; Menendez No. 1430 on \ntrafficking; Sullivan No. 1246 on fish and shellfish; Warren No. 1328 \non financial services; Daines No. 1418 on Indian tribes; Donnelly No. \n1406 on training programs; Boxer No. 1371 on minimum wage; Manchin No. \n1413 on State effects; Cardin No. 1230 on human rights; Brown-Portman \nNo. 1252 on level playing field; Whitehouse No. 1387 on unregulated \nfishing; Markey No. 1308 on clean air and water; Merkley No. 1404 on \nfood information; Casey-Murphy No. 1436 on Buy American; Baldwin No. \n1317 on trade remedy; Bennet No. 1309 on poverty/hunger;\n  Further, that no second-degree amendments be in order to the \namendments prior to the votes; that all after the Brown amendment No. \n1251 be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption; that \nupon disposition of the Bennet amendment No. 1309, all other pending \namendments, including Sessions No. 1233, Paul No. 1383, Paul No. 1408, \nInhofe No. 1312, McCain No. 1226, and Shaheen No. 1227, to the Hatch \nsubstitute be withdrawn; that all postcloture time be considered \nexpired; and the Senate vote on the adoption of the Hatch substitute \namendment, as amended; finally, if cloture is invoked on H.R. 1314, all \npostcloture time be yielded back, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of our side, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments and call up the following amendments: Cruz No. 1384; \nMenendez No. 1430; and Brown-Portman No. 1252; further, that amendment \nNo. 1252 not be subject to any points of order under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on my reservation, I don't have a problem \nwith the Senate voting on the three amendments included in Chairman \nHatch's request, but there are a number of other important amendments \nthat are not included in that request that colleagues on my side feel \nvery strongly about and want to have the Senate vote on. Because the \nchairman's request would not allow these important additional \namendments to be considered, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as everybody should know, both the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon and I have tried to work these \namendments out, and we were unsuccessful. There were objections and, \ntherefore, I apologize that we weren't able to do more. But cloture was \ninvoked, and that is the rule, I guess.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1411, as Modified\n\n  I wish to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Hatch-Wyden \namendment No. 1411. If adopted, our amendment would strengthen the \nnegotiating objective in the TPA bill relating to currency \nmanipulation. Specifically, it would provide our country with a \nmultitude of tools to address currency manipulation in the context of \nfree-trade agreements, including enhanced transparency, disclosure, \nreporting, monitoring, and cooperative mechanisms, as well as \nenforceable rules.\n  As we all know, this amendment is filed as an alternative to the \nPortman-Stabenow currency amendment, and it is superior in a number of \nways.\n  I know that many of my colleagues are sincerely concerned about \ncurrency manipulation and want to do something to address this issue. I \nshare\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\nthose concerns, which is why Senator Wyden and I introduced this \nalternative currency amendment that provides a more sensible approach--\none that has been endorsed by leaders in the administration, the \nbusiness community, and elsewhere.\n  Unlike the Portman-Stabenow amendment, the Hatch-Wyden amendment \nwould not derail the TPP negotiations. Unlike Portman-Stabenow, the \nHatch-Wyden amendment poses no threat to America's monetary \nindependence. Unlike the Portman-Stabenow amendment, the Hatch-Wyden \namendment would prevent future trade and currency wars. And unlike \nPortman-Stabenow, the Hatch-Wyden amendment would promote greater \nmonitoring and transparency of our trading partners' currency practices \nand keep manipulation practices out of the shadows. And, probably most \nimportantly, unlike Portman-Stabenow, the Hatch-Wyden amendment would \nnot kill TPA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH.

The question now occurs on amendment No. 1299, \noffered by the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, for herself and Mr. \nPortman.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address just \nfor 1 minute, equally divided between Senator Stabenow and myself, this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I am not \ngoing to object--I think the Senator deserves a minute, but I would ask \nthat I be given a minute after he finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we just adopted an amendment that puts \nthis Senate squarely in opposition to currency manipulation. Now the \nquestion is whether we have the courage of our convictions. The only \ndifference between the amendment we just voted and the one we are about \nto vote on is whether we actually have enforcement as part of that.\n  I want you to be able to tell your workers that you not only disagree \nwith currency manipulation but you want to be able to do something \nabout it.\n  I yield for my colleague.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, you have just heard a former U.S. Trade \nRepresentative who has led negotiations, a Senator who supports fast-\ntrack, tell you that this is a reasonable policy to include in TPA. \nSixty Members signed a letter a year ago to the President of the United \nStates saying any new trade agreement must include enforceable currency \nprovisions.\n  This amendment makes that letter mean something. Currency \nmanipulation has cost us 5 million jobs and counting. Enough is enough. \nPlease join us in supporting the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Portman-\nStabenow amendment No. 1299. This is important to me. There has been a \nlot of debate and discussion on this amendment. Currency manipulation \nis a complex issue. But the fact is the vote on this amendment is not \ncomplex at all. A vote for the Portman-Stabenow amendment is a vote to \nkill TPA. We know that. The administration has made it abundantly clear \nthat President Obama will veto any TPA bill that contains this \namendment.\n  A vote for the Portman-Stabenow amendment is also a vote to kill TPP. \nWe know that as well. Many of our negotiating partners have already \nindicated that they will not agree to standards required by this \namendment.\n  The President of the United States opposes this amendment. The \nSecretary of the Treasury opposes this amendment. The Secretary of \nAgriculture opposes this amendment. All living former Treasury \nSecretaries, Republicans and Democrats alike, oppose the approach taken \nby this amendment.\n  All I can say is, that being the case, I urge my colleagues to vote \nno on the Portman-Stabenow amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to also be heard \nfor 2 minutes in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, together with Senator Heitkamp, Senator \nManchin, and a dozen other Senators, I propose a simple change to the \nfast-track bill. This amendment protects America's sovereignty and the \nrule of law by turning off fast-track for trade agreements that include \ninvestor-state dispute resolution--ISDS. This is not a partisan issue. \nExperts on the left and the right agree that ISDS is a real threat. \nAccording to the director of trade policy at the Cato Institute, \npurging both the TPP and the TTIP of ISDS makes sense economically and \npolitically. In a recent letter, more than 100 law professors wrote \nthat ISDS threatens domestic sovereignty and weakens the rule of law. A \nprovision to give corporations special rights to challenge our laws \noutside of our legal system should not be part of our free-trade \nagreements.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield to Senator Heitkamp.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes \nto say I want everyone to remember the day you voted on this amendment \nbecause in 10 years, when you look back and you see the mischief that \nwill be created with ISDS without controls and without a broader \nframework for investor-state dispute settlements, you will be \nquestioning why you did not support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Colleagues, for three decades, our country has never lost \nan investor dispute case and never paid one dime in penalties. Let me \nrepeat that. We have never lost an investor dispute case and have never \npaid a dime in penalties. Here is our record: 17 cases, 17 victories.\n  These provisions are about raising the world to our economy's level \nof safety for investment. Without these protections, our small \nbusinesses with investments abroad will have nowhere to turn if a \ncorrupt government steals a factory or a crooked judge targets them \nunfairly.\n  Each of our States has businesses that started in a garage, grew up, \nand looked abroad for new chances to expand. Let's make the world safer \nfor the American brand.\n  I urge rejection of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on my small business amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I understand it is not germane, so we \nare not going to vote on it. But I think it is important, as we are \nthinking about trade, to keep in mind that 40 percent of large \ncorporations are able to trade internationally, but among small and \nmedium-sized businesses, it is only 1 percent. Yet, 95 percent of \nmarkets are outside of the United States. What this amendment would do \nis it would allow small businesses to be able to get access to those \ninternational markets because it would provide help for them in \nexporting.\n  This is a program we passed with the Small Business Jobs Act. It \nworked very well. We need do this.\n  There is no score to this amendment. The CBO said there is no cost, \nand this is something we can do. We can help our small businesses, \nwhere two-thirds of jobs are being created. I hope that my colleagues \nwill consider this in the future and that we can get this passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. We \nintend to work with her and see what we can do. I want to put that in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now occurs on amendment No. 1251, \noffered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, before President Obama or President Hillary \nClinton or President Lindsey Graham decides that China should be \nadmitted to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this amendment ensures that \nCongress play a role in that decision. A vote for this amendment is not \na poison pill. It does not kill TPP or TPA. This amendment simply \nspells out a process for future countries to join the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. It would require the President to notify Congress of \nintent to enter into negotiations, and it would require certification \nfrom Senate Finance and House Ways and Means and final approval by a \nvote of both Houses of Congress.\n  It is pretty simple. Before the world's second largest economy--the \nPeople's Republic of China--becomes part of TPP, there should be \nvigorous public debate and there should be congressional approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Brown \namendment,\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\nNo. 1251. I agree that it would not be advantageous for the United \nStates to become part of a trade agreement that includes China--or any \nother country, for that matter--without adequate oversight and approval \nby Congress. However, all of our existing trade agreements require \ncongressional approval before new parties can be added after the \nagreement is signed. It is also required under our TPA bill.\n  The very possibility of a trade agreement with the United States is a \npowerful incentive we can use to encourage other countries to raise \ntheir standards and institute reforms in order to meet the objectives \nof existing agreements. If we require a separate congressional vote \nbefore our negotiators can even talk to new countries, we will be \ngiving up one of our best tools that we can use to spur reform and \nadvance our country's values abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Brown amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is to try to repeal one of \nthe great ripoffs in the history of this body. We waste $15 million a \nyear on a catfish inspection office which is not only duplicative but \ndisgraceful. This is a classic example of protectionism and the kind of \nthing we are trying to avoid with a free-trade agreement. It is an \noutrage.\n  Nine times the Government Accountability Office has said this is a \nwaste of millions of taxpayer dollars.

The question now occurs on amendment No. 1243, \noffered on behalf of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Flake.\n  There is 2 minutes equally divided.\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking against the Flake amendment No. \n1243, this amendment would strike the extension of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act. I support trade, but I am not going to tie the hands of \nthe American workers from getting retrained or small businesses from \ngetting Ex-Im support or making sure that we have enough people to do \nenforcement. If we are going to have trade, we will also have to have \nthe tools to do trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Flake amendment and keep TAA.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this trade package is about bringing our \npolicies into 2015. This amendment would throw us back into the 1950s.\n  President Kennedy, who first proposed TAA, called it a program to \nafford time for American initiative, American adaptability, and \nAmerican resiliency to assert itself. To me, those sound like sound \nbipartisan priorities.\n  This package will expand TAA and help ensure workers are not knocked \noff stride in tough times. Let's not turn our backs on this country's \nworkers. Let's not break the bipartisan compact this bill represents.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I urge support for the amendment. Time and \ntime again when we do TAA, along with TPA, we find GAO--or whoever \nstudies it--finds that it is duplicative and wasteful. There are other \nFederal programs that do the same thing. And we find that people are \nclaiming that because the stipulations are so loose, people in jobs \nthat have nothing to do with trade or nothing to do with dislocations \nbecause of trade are actually claiming benefits because of it.\n  It is a large bill, and it is duplicative and wasteful, and we ought \nto get rid of it.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1243.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH (when his name was called).

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum call with respect to the cloture vote be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't want to take too much time, but I \ndo just say in advance of this next vote that I am very appreciative of \nmy colleagues who have worked with us to get to this point. This next \nvote is obviously a big one. I hope we can keep together. The \nbipartisan coalition of Senators who have helped get us this far has \nbeen important. I think we will once again.\n  I just want to reiterate that this is a good bipartisan bill, one \nthat reflects the priorities of Senators from both parties and in both \nChambers of Congress. This next vote will take us one step closer to \nallowing Congress to set the terms of our trade negotiations and giving \nour negotiators the tools they need to get the best deals possible. \nThis bill will do a lot of good for the American economy, our workers, \nand our job creators looking to sell more of their products overseas.\n  But we are not there yet. We need to get past this next hurdle. I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, the Senate now has an \nopportunity to throw the 1990s NAFTA play book into the dustbin of \nhistory and begin a new forward-thinking era in trade. This can be a \nmomentous day for creating more economic opportunity for our people, \ntransparency and sunshine and the forward march of American values.\n  The legislation can help us pry open the booming markets for our \nexports. It will strengthen the American brand in the fight against \ntrade cheats and bad actors who block our way. It will raise the bar \nfor worker rights, environmental safeguards, and human rights. It will \nhelp strip out the excessive secrecy that makes people skeptical about \ntrade. Colleagues, in a sentence, this is how you begin to get trade \ndone right.\n  I yield the floor and urge support for cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on final passage \nof the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015. This is a \nhistoric piece of legislation that will renew trade promotion \nauthority.\n  As I have already said here on the floor many times, this bill has \nbeen a long time coming. I personally have been focused on this for the \nlast 4 years, but I know that for those whose lives and livelihoods \nrevolve around American trade, the wait has been much longer.\n  This is an important bill, no doubt about it, and likely the most \nimportant bill we will pass this year. It is important to President \nObama, and I know it is important to many of us here in this Chamber. \nIt shows that when the President is right, we will support him.\n  From the beginning, TPA has been a bipartisan effort. Despite the \ndifficulties we have faced here on the floor, I am glad it has remained \nthat way throughout the process.\n  I am very appreciative of all those who have put in so much time and \neffort to get the bill to this point.\n  Going back to last year, I want to thank the former chairmen, Max \nBaucus and Dave Camp, who helped get the ball rolling on this TPA bill.\n  I would especially like to thank the staff, who put in a great deal \nof time on the initial draft of this legislation, including Amber \nCottel, former staff director of the Senate Committee on Finance; Bruce \nHirsh, former chief trade counsel; and international trade counsel Lisa \nPearlman.\n  I want thank my colleagues on the Committee on Finance, whose input \nand support has been instrumental both in drafting and developing this \nlegislation as well as helping it move forward. Most notably, I thank \nthe ranking member on the Committee on Finance, the coauthor of this \ncurrent legislation, Senator Ron Wyden. His commitment to his \nprinciples and constituents has been admirable. Although it has taken a \nlot of time for the two of us to get to this point, his efforts have \nundoubtedly improved the substance of the bill and helped broaden its \nsupport. I very much appreciate the efforts of Senator Wyden in the \ndrafting the bill and getting it through the committee and here on the \nfloor.\n  There are other Senators who played key roles in getting us to where \nwe are. I want to thank our distinguished majority leader and the \nmajority whip. I also thank Senators Carper and Murray.\n  Obviously, every Senator who has voted and worked to get us to this \npoint deserves thanks. I will thank you all individually as the clerk \ncalls the roll for this last vote.\n  Of course, I want to thank my staff on the Committee on Finance, who \nworked long hours for many months to get us here, and Senator Wyden's \nstaff as well. On the Republican side, I particularly want to thank \nEverett Eissenstat for leading the way, and his family, Janet, Alex, \nand Jacob Eissenstat, for lending him to us for so many hours. I want \nto thank the rest of the Republican trade staff: Shane Warren, Rebecca \nEubank, Karen Rosenbaum, Sahra Su, Andrew Rollo, and Kenneth Schmidt. I \nalso want to thank my senior team: Chris Campbell, Mark Prater, Jay \nKhosla, Jeff Wrase, and Bryan Hickman. And of course I need to thank \nour communications team: Julia Lawless, Aaron Forbes, Amelia Breinig, \nand Joshua Blume.\n  On the Democratic side of the committee staff, I want to thank Josh \nSheinkman, Jocelyn Moore, Mike Evans, Jayme White, and Elissa Alben for \nall their hard work, and others as well who worked on that side.\n  I also thank the Senate Republican leadership staff, who put a lot of \nblood, sweat, and tears into this endeavor. From their staffs, I need \nto particularly thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Brendan Dunn, \nTerry Van Doren, Erica Suares, Antonio Ferrier, Russ Thomasson, and \nJohnny Slemrod. From the Republican cloakroom staff, I want to single \nout the efforts of Laura Dove, Robert Duncan and Megan Mercer.\n  Of course, we need to mention the efforts of our attorneys at the \nlegislative counsel's office, particularly Margaret Roth Warren and \nThomas Haywood, who did a lot of heavy lifting in putting together the \nbill and the amendments.\n  The Parliamentarian's office has been immensely helpful as well. From \ntheir staff, I would like to thank Elizabeth McDonough, Leigh \nHildebrand, Thomas Cuffie, and Michael Beaver.\n  Throughout this process, we received assistance from the United \nStates Trade Representative. I thank Ambassador Froman and his staff \nfor all their assistance in this effort.\n  Really, the list of people I need to thank is too long to cover in a \nsingle floor speech. I just hope it is clear to everyone on both sides \nof the floor who worked on this bill just how appreciative I am.\n  As far as the Senate is concerned, we have one more vote to go on \nthis bill, but that is not the end for the bill. I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues in the House and with the administration to \nget this bill across the finish line. As I said earlier this week, for \nme, the work on TPA doesn't finish until we have a bill on the \nPresident's desk.\n  I look forward to continuing this particular effort and to working \nwith my colleagues on whatever challenge comes next.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  It would be an understatement to say there have been strong \ndifferences of opinion here in this Chamber and in our country with \nrespect to this legislation. I have said from the very beginning that \nopponents of this effort--trade promotion authority--have a number of \nvery valid points.\n  There is no question in my mind, colleagues, that there has been way \ntoo much secrecy in the past, so Senator Hatch and I set out to make \nsome very significant changes in that. Now, starting with the TPP but \nwith all other agreements, the American people will have that agreement \nin their hands for close to 4 months before anybody votes here in the \nSenate or in the House on TPP or a trade agreement. I think that is a \nstep toward a sunshine trade policy.\n  Second, I thought opponents were spot-on with respect to their \ncomments that we needed a completely new regime with respect to \nenforcing our trade laws. Again and again the American people say: What \nare you talking about in terms of passing a new trade deal if you \naren't doing a better job of enforcing the laws on the books? So we set \nabout to put in place a tough enforce act to go after cheats. We had \nSenator Brown's leveling the playing field, which I think is a very \nimportant piece of legislation, and an early warning system so that for \nthe first time, rather than waiting until it is too late, businesses \nand labor unions and others would see what is coming. I think that is a \nsignificant step forward.\n  Many skeptics said there isn't an aggressive approach to protect \nlabor and the environment. It essentially gets shunted to the side. Now \nwe have enforceable standards in this area.\n  Because of the good work of Senator Ben Cardin, for the first time, \ncolleagues, human rights will be a significant factor in trade \nlegislation.\n  Finally, we put in place a new process so that this body can put the \nbrakes on a bad deal. We have always talked about fast-track because we \nwant people to have an opportunity to consider a new agreement. We also \nought to put the brakes on a bad deal.\n  I will close with this point: At the end of the day, colleagues, we \nhave always known that one of the paths to more good-paying jobs in our \ncountry is exports. There are going to be 1 billion middle-class \npeople--1 billion--in the developing world in 2025. These will be \npeople with money, colleagues. They are going to buy our wine, our \ncomputers, our helicopters, our planes, and all kinds of goods and \nservices with the American brand. They are going to buy\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nour products because they buy and use our products with great pride. We \nall ought to appreciate the opportunity for more exports.\n  I know there are strong differences of opinion on this legislation. I \nwant it understood that we tried especially hard--and I appreciate the \nhelp of Chairman Hatch--to address as many of those concerns as we \npossibly could.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of all Senators, we are using \npostcloture debate time now. No Senator has to speak if he or she \nchooses not to. Any Senator who speaks will be limited to 1 hour. So \nthis can go on for as long as Senators want or for as short a time as \nSenators prefer, provided no one is seeking recognition. But if anyone \ndoes seek recognition, they are limited to 1 hour, at which point the \nChair puts the question. So I can't tell you with specificity when the \nvote will occur, but it will occur when no one is seeking recognition.\n  Once this bill is concluded later this evening, under the regular \norder, the cloture motions on the two FISA bills will ripen an hour \nafter we convene tomorrow, which could be as early as 1 a.m. tonight.\n  So just to reiterate, if no Senators are seeking recognition, we \nwould move to a vote shortly. If any Senator seeks recognition, they \nare limited to 1 hour. At the end of that, if no other Senator is \nseeking recognition, we will put the question and start the vote.\n\n  So I know of no other debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I think it is important, at this point in \ntime, for us to be reminded of the concerns of working people across \nour Nation.\n  This has been an intense debate, because so often, in the course of \nthe trade agreements we have pursued, the balance on the other end has \nbeen simply that millions of jobs have left this Nation.\n  We have lost 5 million jobs and 50,000 factories. That is a \ntremendous loss for workers across the States seeking for the \nfoundation of successful families because there is no government \nprogram that can compare to the value of a living-wage job.\n  What we have seen in the wake of NAFTA and the free-trade agreements \nthat have followed is not only a tremendous loss of jobs but a \ntremendous increase in inequality in this Nation.\n  Now, we have heard the opinion of some that this is a completely \ndifferent structure and that we should not be concerned about this \nbeing the result of this particular agreement, this particular set of \nstandards, that are going to be brought back to us in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. I disagree, and I disagree deeply, and I am going to tell \nyou why.\n  Let's start with the most fundamental issue on level playing field, \nwhich is wages that are roughly comparable.\n  The old agreements have no minimum wage. This agreement has no \nminimum wage. We are creating a structure of a group of seven very poor \nnations with very low wages, five affluent nations with higher wages. \nThink about the difference between running an operation in Vietnam or \nMalaysia or Mexico with a minimum wage of less than $2 per hour and in \nVietnam a minimum wage of only about 60 to 70 cents, depending on what \npart of the country you are in.\n  Think of the difference between that and the minimum wage in the \nUnited States. It is a 10-to-1 differential. If you throw in the type \nof benefits and the labor standards and the environmental standards, it \nis a differential of probably at least 20 to 1. That is why we are \nlosing jobs in manufacturing. Now, is there anything that puts a \nminimum wage into this agreement and addresses this key missing factor? \nThere is not.\n  Then let's turn to the rest of the labor and the environmental \nobjectives that are embedded. We have heard a lot that we are now going \nto have enforceable environmental standards and enforceable labor \nstandards. But the fundamental structure disagreement is the same as \nagreements we have had before.\n  Now, I applaud my colleagues who are working to tighten the \nenforcement on cheating on tariffs. That is important. But those are \nnot enforceable labor standards and those are not enforceable \nenvironmental standards.\n  Therefore, we can look back at the history of similar agreements and \nsay: When did we ever bring any sort of action on environmental \nstandards government-to-government?\n  The answer is: We have not.\n  When did we ever bring a complaint on labor standards?\n  The answer is: We have done it once. We did it in Guatemala. That was \n7 years ago. We still don't have any resolution of that single \ncomplaint, that single challenge.\n  So in order to have something that was fundamentally different, we \nwould have to have something like snapback tariffs--a situation where a \ncountry deeply violated its promises on labor standards, deeply \nviolated its standards or promises on environmental standards, and that \nthere be some sort of quick and certain reversal of the benefits of \ntrade agreements, but there is nothing like that in this agreement. \nThere is no change.\n  So here we are, repeating the same basic structure that has existed \nin the other agreements, with no changes for America and therefore no \nimprovement for the workers of the United States of America.\n  Now, there are objectives that have been placed into fast-track, but \nthose objectives require an agreement to come back with areas to be \naddressed, such as human rights and so forth that have been much \nvaunted. Those are objectives. Those are not standards.\n  If we were serious about saying what an agreement had to have in it \nto come and get the privileges of fast-track, we would have converted \nthose objectives into standards. That was one of the amendments that we \nnever debated on the floor of the Senate, so we never wrestled with \nthis deep deficiency.\n  Then, of course, we have the investor-state dispute settlement \nportion of this, and we have been affirmed here that we normally win \nwhen we are challenged. And that is correct--we have mostly won when we \nare challenged. We have won because we have out-lawyered the other side \nbecause, in general, we don't expropriate. But we have not won under \nall the trade agreements.\n  We lost a case on tuna that was dolphin-free or dolphin-friendly tuna \nlabels. Why did we lose it? Because under the WTO, Mexico challenged \nit. Under WTO, they challenged it and said: This discriminates against \nthe way we fish, and we lost. We lost on turtles. We lost on cotton.\n  What happened last week? Well, we lost on the labeling of food grown \nin the United States of America. The WTO said we cannot label our beef \nas USA made or raised or born or harvested.\n  I tell you this. I want to live in a country where, if our \nlegislators, at the local level, at the State level, at the Federal \nlevel, want to pass a law that informs every citizen about where food \nis grown because the citizens want to know, it should be possible to do \nso.\n  We should not give away our sovereignty to international panels that \ncan make decisions that wipe out our consumer laws or our environmental \nlaws--and there was a proposal to make sure we did not end up with that \nin this agreement, and it was defeated.\n  So we still have this substantial risk of losing future cases, just \nas we lost on dolphins, just as we lost on turtles, and just as we lost \nlast week on the labeling of food in the United States of America.\n  This particular issue of labeling our food goes to the heart of who \nwe are--free people who want to make decisions for the health and \nsafety of our families. The way we do that is when we buy things, we \nfind out information, and that information has to be on the label.\n  I was reading here earlier an article about how shrimp is raised in \nVietnam. It is farmed in pools, and it doesn't meet any of the \nstandards we would like, so they get artificial documentation and it is \nshipped at high volumes into the United States. Consumer Reports came \nout with a report recently,\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nand they said: Don't buy shrimp unless it is produced in the United \nStates, particularly don't buy it if it comes from Vietnam.\n  There is another example of why we should, if we want to be able to, \nhave labels on our food that say ``Made in America'' or ``Made in \nVietnam.'' Consumers should have a choice, so they can see Consumer \nReports and find out that shrimp is full of deadly bacteria, when they \nreceive Consumer Reports, and find out that shrimp is full of \nantibiotics that are put in because of deadly bacteria, and they don't \nwant their children exposed to those bacteria. If they don't want them \nexposed to bacteria, they should be able to make that decision, but we \ncan't do that if we give away our sovereignty to international dispute \nresolution panels.\n  So there are a host of problems inherent in this trade agreement and \nin this fast-track that have not been resolved.\n  We have not addressed having a minimum wage and steadily over time \nreducing the disparity between the lowest paid countries and the \nhighest paid countries so our workers will not be at this massive \ndisadvantage.\n  We have not addressed the enforcement of labor provisions because we \nhave not developed anything different from what we have done before, \nand we are unable to enforce them. We have only tried once, and we are \nstill out after 7 years with Guatemala. We haven't even tried with the \nenvironmental side, it is so difficult.\n  We have left intact an international panel of corporate lawyers who \non one issue can be the advocate, on the next can be the judge. It is \nfull of conflict of interest. We haven't addressed that.\n  So here is the bottom line: Do we want to live in an America where \nthe middle class is going to be wiped out because we have pulled out \nall the barriers between very low-wage countries, low-enforcement \ncountries, low-labor-standard countries, low environmental standards, \nand our economy--which then creates tremendous pressure for our own \nwages and standards to diminish. Why does it create pressure? Because \ncompanies say: You know what. If you push for higher wages or better \nworking conditions, we are going to move our factory overseas or they \nsay: You know what. We already have a factory overseas. We are going to \nincrease our production there and decrease our production here. That is \nthe pressure here on wages and working conditions in the United States \nof America.\n  What about the people overseas? This agreement is designed so \ncompanies who are producing in China--which will not be part of the \nagreement at this point in time--can say: If you raise your wages and \nyour working conditions, we will go to Malaysia, and if Malaysia raises \ntheirs, we will go to Vietnam.\n  So it isn't good for the foreign workers any more than it is for the \nAmerican workers.\n  There was an article yesterday in the Washington Post. The columnist \nor the op-ed writer said: It is basically like this. This agreement is, \nlike previous agreements, very good for the investor class. Because if \ncompanies can produce things at the lowest possible cost, that will \nraise their stock prices.\n  However, he said, it is really bad for the working class because less \nand less will go to the workers under these types of competitive \npressures between the United States or taking the work overseas or \nbetween one nation overseas and another nation overseas.\n  So I will conclude this simply by saying: This is why I voted against \nthis fast-track, because this fast-track is deeply flawed. It does not \naddress the fundamental issues that have been identified in previous \nagreements. Going down this track and bringing the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership to this Chamber, with no ability to mend it, no ability to \nextend debate because debate will be limited, no ability to hold it to \nthe normal standards in the Senate in terms of closing the debate--\nbecause of all that, this is simply the wrong direction to go.\n  In this final effort, in this final set of time before we take the \nfinal vote, let's recognize it is important that we, as Senators \nrepresenting the citizens of the United States, not simply fight for \nthe investor class; let's fight to make work work for working \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer).

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as we bring this very dramatic chapter in \nU.S. trade policy to its conclusion in the Senate, I wish to take a few \nminutes to acknowledge the many people who helped in ways large and \nsmall to\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\nbring about the passage of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade \nPriorities and Accountability Act.\n  First and foremost, I thank Chairman Hatch for his partnership \nthroughout the process. I think Chairman Hatch and I can smile a bit \nlooking back on some very spirited debates in the process of getting to \nthis point. I do want colleagues to understand that Chairman Hatch has \nbeen a true leader in this bipartisan effort in the Finance Committee \nand on the floor. I thank Chairman Hatch and his staff for all they \nhave done.\n  I think both Chairman Hatch and I also want to acknowledge our \npartner in the House, Chairman Ryan. All through the discussions, \nChairman Hatch, Chairman Ryan, and myself, all tried to make sure that \nwe would have a bipartisan, bicameral collaborative effort. The three \nof us obviously don't see eye to eye on everything, but we thought it \nwas very important to try to come together and move an extraordinarily \nimportant and challenging economic policy forward for the country. \nChairman Ryan has been there every single step of the way, and we look \nforward to returning the favor as he moves this historic package \nthrough the House and on to the President's desk.\n  We also thank Leader McConnell for his work in shepherding this \npackage through the process. It has not been easy, but Leader McConnell \nhas had a single-minded focus in terms of getting this bill across the \nfinish line.\n  While we are on the subject of Senate leadership, I especially want \nto acknowledge the extraordinary contributions of my Pacific Northwest \ncolleague Senator Murray and her staff. Over the last few years, \ncolleagues, we have seen time and time again Senator Murray demonstrate \nher extraordinary ability. She is a person of modest size, but she is \nsure good at getting big things done. This bill is no exception, and it \ncould not have happened without her leadership and help.\n  Finally, I note Chairman Hatch and I wish to thank all the members of \nthe Finance Committee because they had a lot of good ideas, and they \nwere constructive in terms of bringing this debate along, recognizing \nthat we had strong differences. Every single member of the Finance \nCommittee made a meaningful contribution, whether it was to the policy \nor to the process. Chairman Hatch and I want to say that when you look \nat a full recounting of all the great work done by Finance Committee \nmembers, if we were to do it all night, we would keep you all the way \nthrough the recess.\n  I wrap up with a quick word of my thanks to my staff who have done an \nexceptional job putting the legislation together: Jayme White, Elissa \nAlben, Greta Peisch, Anderson Heiman, Keith Chu, Malcolm McGreary, \nDanielle Deraney, Kara Getz, and Juan Machado.\n  I close by way of saying I think it is fair to say that there were a \nlot of observers, both in and outside this body, who thought it would \nnot be possible to move forward on an issue like this--which is going \nto affect 40 percent of the global economy--in a bipartisan fashion. We \nknow there are going to be a billion middle-class consumers in the \ndeveloping world in 2025, and they want to ``Buy American.'' They like \nour brand.\n  With the extraordinary leadership of Chairman Hatch and many others \nwho contributed to this effort, I think once again there is going to be \na very significant array of economic opportunities for the people we \nrepresent to get high-skill, high-wage, export-related jobs with \nproducts and services that we sell to these countries.\n  So I close this part of the debate tonight--again, as we began, I \nthink, 7 months ago, Chairman Hatch, by telling you that this, to me, \nis what we are sent to do, tackle the big issues in a bipartisan way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate stands in \nrecess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 9:36 p.m., recessed subject to the call of \nthe Chair and reassembled at 11:13 p.m. when called to order by the \nPresiding Officer (Mr. Sessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n               USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 2048.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 87, H.R. 2048, a bill to \n     reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require \n     the production of certain business records, conduct \n     electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace \n     devices, and use other forms of information gathering for \n     foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal \n     purposes, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3299-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3299-S3300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n                                  ____\n\n\n THE GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE NATIONAL MONUMENT GRAZING PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have always been proud of Utah's rich \nheritage. Utah is blessed with incredible natural resources, beautiful \nlandscapes, and breathtaking vistas. Utahns have always understood the \nimportance of maintaining a responsible balance between the development \nof our abundant resources and the need to protect the unique natural \nfeatures of our State. Today, though, the executive branch threatens to \ndisrupt that delicate balance. Countless rural communities in Utah are \ncurrently facing difficult challenges to their way of life as the \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, increases restrictions on traditional \neconomic activities, such as ranching and grazing operations on Federal \nland.\n  Under President Theodore Roosevelt's leadership, Congress passed the \nAntiquities Act of 1906--a short, four-paragraph law that gave the \nPresident unilateral authority to designate areas as national \nmonuments. Such designations were intended to protect special areas in \nour country that have particularly significant natural, historical, or \ncultural features. Congress crafted these designations to be limited in \nscope and ``confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care \nand management of the objects to be protected.'' At that time, the \nAntiquities Act was an essential tool to protect our Nation's \nhistorical treasures against growing dangers, such as looters and \nvandals. Congress drafted this law after archaeologists noticed that \nAmerica's natural treasures were turning up in overseas museums and \nprivate collections.\n  After President Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law, he \nsubsequently set aside nearly 20 such natural and cultural landmarks. \nThese monument designations were limited in scope and designed to \nprotect specific locations rather than massive acreages. For example, \nthe total area of our Nation's first national monument, Devil's Tower \nin Wyoming, spans only about 2 square miles. Unfortunately, over time, \nthe use of the Antiquities Act has evolved from protecting historic \nlandmarks to restricting development across vast swaths of land without \nany meaningful local input. For example, on September 18, 1996, \nPresident Bill Clinton issued a proclamation designating nearly 1.9 \nmillion acres in southern Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument. Utah's entire congressional delegation, the Utah \nState Legislature, and then-Governor Mike Leavitt all strongly opposed \nthis proclamation. President Clinton's declaration was made without so \nmuch as a ``by your leave'' to the people of Utah. There were no \nconsultations, no hearings, no townhall meetings, no TV or radio \ndiscussions, no input from Federal land managers, no maps, no \nboundaries--nothing. In fact, Utah's elected representatives in \nWashington had to learn about the proclamation from the Washington \nPost.\n  There are significant impacts on the ground when a monument is \ndesignated not only on Federal land but also on State and private land. \nHad President Clinton consulted with the State and the delegation, he \nwould have learned that the designation would land-lock and render \nuseless 200,000 acres of Utah School Trust Lands--lands held in trust \nfor the education of Utah's children. This designation deprived Utah \nschools of a significant revenue source. Fortunately, Utah's \ncongressional delegation was eventually able to pass legislation \nallowing these school trust\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nlands to be swapped out of the monument boundary. While this \nlegislation helped the schools, much of the local population still lost \ntheir jobs because of the President's declaration.\n  The only silver lining in this debacle was language written into the \nPresident's proclamation that protected livestock grazing on the \nmonument. While the President blocked significant mineral development \nand other economic activity in the 1.9 million-acre area, he at least \nunderstood that blocking traditional grazing in the area was untenable. \nSadly, since the 1996 monument designation, nearly 28 percent of the \nFederal livestock grazing animal unit-months, AUMs, have been \nsuspended, according to the Utah Cattlemen's Association.\n  According to the 2015 Economic Report to the Governor prepared by the \nUtah Economic Council, ``[o]f Utah's 45 million acres of rangeland, 33 \nmillion acres are owned and managed by the federal government, while \nonly 8 million acres are privately owned.'' With that in mind, most \nranching operations in Utah must combine private grazing, feed \nimportation, and access to the renewable grasses and forage through \nFederal grazing leases in order to be economically viable. \nUnfortunately, since the late 1940s, the Utah Farm Bureau found that \nthe BLM and the Forest Service have drastically cut or suspended Utah's \ntotal livestock grazing AUMs from 5.4 million AUMs in 1949 to just over \n2 million in 2012.\n  With grazing on Federal land already in peril, grazing on the \nmonument is at even greater risk. Currently, the BLM is considering an \namendment to the Management Plan that would eliminate grazing on the \nmonument altogether. If the BLM eliminates grazing on the monument, \nthere would be significant negative economic impacts to the area. \nConsider the economic benefits grazing already brings to these rural \ncounties in Utah. The Utah Farm Bureau reports that ``around 11,500 \nfeeder cattle sold out of Kane and Garfield County ranches brought in \nmore than $16 million dollars and generated in excess of $25-$30 \nmillion based on a conservative economic multiplier. With about one-\nhalf of the calf crop coming from grazing allotments within the \nmonument, of that total, about $8 million in direct feeder cattle sales \nand between $12--$15 million in economic activity is tied directly back \nto cattle grazing on the monument.''\n  Those ranching dollars create jobs in Utah's rural counties. The \nmoney also contributes to local tax revenue and supports vital public \nservices. Eliminating grazing on the monument would have disastrous \nimplications for the local economy.\n  The poor stewardship of the land presents another risk even beyond \nits effects on grazing and the local economy. The rangeland on the \nmonument is being mismanaged. Even if the BLM decides to change course \novernight and restore grazing to the historic levels that existed \nbefore the designation of the monument, the land in its current state \nwould not be able to sustain it. Over the last 20 years, we have \nwitnessed a worrisome decline in rangeland health. With this decline, \nlivestock carrying capacity has also decreased.\n  To protect rangeland health, I joined Senator Mike Lee and \nCongressman Chris Stewart to introduce the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument Grazing Protection Act. This bill would direct the \nBLM to create and implement a management program within the areas of \nthe monument to improve rangeland conditions for wildlife and livestock \ncarrying capacity. It would also restore livestock grazing to the \nhistoric levels that existed before the designation. There are many \nthings BLM can and should be doing to restore rangeland health. \nImproving the range would not only benefit ranchers and affected \ncommunities but also bring significant ecological and environmental \nbenefits to the entire area. This legislation will direct the BLM in \nthat effort.\n  This is a commonsense bill that will restore Utah's rangeland to \nhealth. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3300-S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to speak on a critical \nnational security issue: the importance of renewing the authority for \nessential anti-terrorism tools which is set to expire by the time \nCongress returns to Washington after Memorial Day.\n  Every single Member of this body remembers where he or she was on \nSeptember 11, 2001. I was here in the Senate. I remember evacuating the \nCapitol and the office building. I remember standing on the lawn \noutside, wondering if a plane was headed toward this very building.\n  That terrible day gave us a taste of what terrorists want to visit \nupon our country. We realized that these fanatics would stop at nothing \nto kill innocent men, women, and children and to bring our country to \nits knees.\n  Knowing the threat this country faced, we resolved not to let \nbureaucratic red tape hinder the ability of our law enforcement and \nintelligence communities to keep us safe. As the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I joined with colleagues of both parties as well \nas the Bush administration to craft the USA PATRIOT Act, which passed \nthe Senate 98 to 1. The PATRIOT Act and its subsequent reauthorizations \nhave proven critical to our ability to investigate terrorist threats \nand prevent another mass-casualty attack on the homeland.\n  Let me make one matter perfectly clear: we continue to face a very \nserious terrorist threat. The evil that struck us on September 11 has \nmetastasized and continues to present a clear and present danger to the \nnational security of the United States. As the American people's \nelected representatives, it is our primary duty to keep this country \nsafe. Accordingly, we must continue to provide the necessary tools to \nthe law enforcement and intelligence communities that have helped keep \nthis Nation safe for the past 14 years.\n  Unfortunately, some of these tools have become quite controversial, \ndespite the repeated showing of strong bipartisan support for them. The \ncollection of telephone metadata under section 215 has drawn particular \ncriticisms and worrisome calls for ``reform.'' I find this development \nenormously concerning.\n  Consider what President Obama himself had to say about our need for \nsuch a capability:\n\n       The program grew out of a desire to address a gap \n     identified after 9/11. One of the 9/11 hijackers, Khalid al-\n     Mihdhar, made a phone call from San Diego to a known al-Qaeda \n     safe house in Yemen. NSA saw that call, but it could not see \n     that the call was coming from an individual already in the \n     United States. The telephone metadata program under Section \n     215 was designed to map the communications of terrorists so \n     we could see who they may be in contact with as quickly as \n     possible.\n\n  The President was absolutely right. The collection of telephone \nmetadata in bulk facilitates our mapping of terrorist networks and our \nability to disrupt terrorist plots. Contrary to the wild fantasies that \ncritics frequently spout, this collection does not meaningfully intrude \non our privacy. It does not involve the NSA listening in on anyone's \ncalls. It is simply a very important means of finding a proverbial \nneedle in a haystack. We should reauthorize this authority without \ndelay.\n  A number of my colleagues have taken a different approach, taking up \nthe cause of the so-called USA FREEDOM Act to ``reform'' our \ncounterterrorism efforts. I find the name of this bill ironic, in the \nsense that their legislation aims to restore a freedom that was never \nunder threat while sacrificing critical tools that secure our freedom.\n  For instance, under this legislation, metadata would no longer be \ncollected by the government but instead retained by private \ncommunications corporations. While this idea may seem initially \nappealing, I have strong reservations about such an approach. Their \nproposal contains no requirement for these companies to maintain this \ndata for any length of time. Without such a requirement, the \neffectiveness of a search would obviously be compromised.\n  This is hardly my only concern. Consider also the provision of the \nso-called FREEDOM Act that would create a body of outside experts to \nadvise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on the government's \nwarrant applications. Such an unprecedented move would cause serious \nconstitutional concerns and could undermine the adversarial system \nwhich at the core of the judicial branch.\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\n  For these and many other reasons, I cannot support the so-called \nFREEDOM Act. While I would prefer to pass a long-term extension of our \ncurrent authorities, I will support a short-term extension to \nfacilitate the search for a long-term solution. I urge my colleagues in \nboth Houses to support this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3301-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHARLES E. BULLOCK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate and pay tribute \nto an honored Kentuckian, Mr. Charles E. Bullock. Mr. Bullock is a \nveteran of World War II who enlisted in the Army after the attack on \nPearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. But Mr. Bullock was a student at the \nold Hazel Green High School at the time. He missed his senior year \nbecause he was stationed in Europe fighting the Nazis. Mr. Bullock had \ngone from studying history to making it.\n  More than 70 years after putting on his country's uniform, Mr. \nBullock received his high school diploma at long last from the Laurel \nCounty Board of Education at a meeting of that organization. This proud \nveteran and recipient of the Bronze Star received a warm, heartfelt \nround of applause from the assembled audience twice--once upon \nreceiving his diploma, and again as he left the room.\n  I want to congratulate Mr. Bullock, 88, on receiving his diploma, and \nI thank him for his service to our Nation in uniform. This country owes \nhim a debt that can never be truly repaid, for his valiant fight \nagainst the Axis Powers during World War II. It is appropriate as we \napproach Memorial Day that every American reflect on the freedoms we \ncherish and that Mr. Bullock fought to defend. I know my colleagues \njoin me when I extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to Mr. \nCharles E. Bullock in praise of his service.\n  An article detailing Mr. Bullock's receipt of his high school diploma \nappeared in the area newspaper the Sentinel-Echo. I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWorld War II Veteran Receives High School Diploma--Bullock Joined Army \n                     in Wake of Pearl Harbor Attack\n\n                          (By R. Scott Belzer)\n\n       Charles E. Bullock, 88, didn't know he would not finish his \n     senior year of high school at Hazel Green in 1942. He also \n     didn't know he would have to wait more than 70 years to \n     receive his high school diploma.\n       Bullock--a World War II veteran--was honored on Monday at \n     the bi-weekly meeting of the Laurel County Board of Education \n     with an official Laurel County high school diploma, 73 years \n     after enlistment and deployment cut his high school career \n     short.\n       ``After the attack on December 7, 1941, many young men \n     enlisted in the armed services to soldier on behalf of their \n     country,'' said Dr. Doug Bennett, superintendent of Laurel \n     County Schools. ``Some of the young men were high school \n     students aged 17 or 18 who left their high school studies \n     before graduation in order to enlist. We're pleased to have \n     one of those young men with us this evening.''\n       Bennett went on to laud Bullock's choice to leave Hazel \n     Green High School to fight in World War II, stating that \n     Bullock chose to be a part of history rather than study it.\n       ``He was called to fight and protect the freedoms we enjoy \n     today,'' Bennett said. ``No longer was he reading about \n     history but became part of making history on the front \n     lines.''\n       Bennett said that Bullock represented the best and highest \n     ideals of Laurel County and was glad to be a part of his \n     formal recognition.\n       ``I appreciate what you men have done,'' Bullock said. \n     ``They took me out my senior year of Hazel Green High School \n     because I wasn't in my second semester. They took six of us \n     out of the high school and put us in the army. Three months \n     later we were fighting in Belgium, France and Germany.''\n       Bullock said he stayed in the army until the war was over \n     in 1945. He was awarded a Bronze Star, a medal awarded for \n     acts of heroism, meritorious achievement or meritorious \n     service within a combat zone. The medal, unfortunately, was \n     another thing he had to wait for.\n       ``I never got it when I came out,'' said Bullock. ``The \n     dischargers said `You can wait and get your medals, it'll \n     only take 15 days,' and I said, `I'm going home.' About 70 \n     years later I got so mad about some things going on and went \n     before Congressman Hal Rogers and he said he'd help me and he \n     did.''\n       School board member Joe Schenkenfelder quoted Ronald Reagan \n     in 1983 to end the presentation.\n       ``I've been thinking about this all day and I finally found \n     a quote-so often we don't know why we recognize our veterans \n     or why we send men and women out to fight for our country,'' \n     said Schenkenfelder. ``I thought this was very fitting: \n     `Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed down \n     for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset \n     years telling our children and our children's children what \n     it was once like in the United States where men were free.' \n     ''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3301-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE ADVOCATE-MESSENGER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of my home State's great \nnewspapers, the Advocate-Messenger, is celebrating its 150th \nanniversary this year, and I want to congratulate the staff and \npublishers of this venerable institution that is published out of \nDanville, Ky.\n  The newspaper that would become the Advocate-Messenger was first \npublished on June 24, 1865, as The Kentucky Advocate. Created by James \nL. Marrs, it was guided to considerable success by a trio of editors: \nG.W. Doneghy, W. Vernon Richardson, and W.O. McIntyre. The paper became \na daily in 1911 and a member of the Associated Press in 1914.\n  In the meantime, a local merchant named Hubert McGoodwin founded the \nDanville Messenger in 1910 as a competitor of the Kentucky Advocate. \nThis paper was purchased in 1918 by J. Curtis Alcock, an experienced \neditor and publisher, and he guided The Danville Messenger to \nconsiderable success in the ensuing decades while also serving as \nsecretary-treasurer of the Kentucky Press Association from 1911 to \n1942.\n  In 1940, the two newspapers merged to become the Advocate-Messenger \nand published Monday through Friday under that name. The Kentucky \nAdvocate became a Saturday afternoon paper for a decade before \nswitching to a Sunday-only paper in 1950, continuing to this day.\n  Many able hands have steered the ship of the Advocate-Messenger over \nthe years. Enos Swain, formerly the director of Centre College's public \nrelations, became the Advocate-Messenger's editor in 1944 and served \nthe longest tenure of any editor, 34 years. In 1977 current owner \nSchurz Communications bought the paper, and Mary Schurz became the \neditor and publisher in 1978 upon Enos Swain's retirement.\n  From 2006 to 2014, Scott Schurz, Jr., served as editor and publisher, \nand in July 2014, Larry Hensley was named president and publisher, \nposts he continues to fill today. John Nelson is the executive editor.\n  Under the supervision of Mr. Hensley, the Advocate-Messenger enjoys a \nhealthy circulation throughout southcentral Kentucky, with distribution \nprimarily in Boyle, Lincoln, Casey, Mercer, and Garrard counties. \nDanville benefits from being recognized by Time magazine as one of 10 \nsuccessful Main Street communities in the country and is the home of \nCentre College, one of the top liberal arts colleges in the region. I \ncan attest to my colleagues that Danville is a wonderful place, and I \nbelieve the Advocate-Messenger truly has its finger on the pulse of the \nregion.\n  A strong and vigorous free press being vital to the freedoms of our \ncountry, I wish to recognize the Advocate-Messenger as a newspaper that \ntakes its dedication to journalism and to serving the people of its \ncommunity seriously. One hundred and fifty years in publication is \nquite an accomplishment that few newspapers can claim, and I know my \ncolleagues join me when I say congratulations to the Advocate-Messenger \non the occasion of its sesquicentennial and best wishes for many more \nyears of publication to come. And congratulations to the newspaper's \npresident and publisher, Larry Hensley, and its executive editor, John \nNelson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3301-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3301-S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FOREIGN MEDICAL SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week I was pleased to be joined by my \nRepublican colleague from Louisiana, Senator Bill Cassidy, to introduce \nthe Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act.\n  I appreciate Senator Cassidy's leadership on this issue and his \nwillingness to work across the aisle. We were joined across the Capitol \nby Representatives Michael Burgess and Elijah\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nCummings, who introduced a House companion bill today.\n  This bipartisan, common-sense bill fixes a loophole in Federal law \nused by for-profit medical schools in the Caribbean to gain access to \nFederal education dollars without meeting the same requirements as \nother foreign medical schools.\n  Under current law, a small number of medical schools--about six, four \nof which are for-profits--are exempt from meeting the same requirements \nto qualify for Title IV funding that all other medical schools outside \nof the U.S. and Canada must meet.\n  This loophole allows these schools to enroll large percentages of \nAmerican students--which means access to more federal dollars.\n  The biggest of these schools are for-profits--St. George's, Ross, and \nAmerican University of the Caribbean whose enrollments of Americans are \n91 percent, 83 percent, and 86 percent respectively. Other schools are \nprohibited from having U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents make \nup more than 40 percent of enrollment.\n  These for-profit schools have turned the idea of being a foreign \nschool on its head--they are located outside of the U.S., but have \nmajority-American enrollments.\n  They don't have to meet the same high standards U.S. medical schools \nmust meet, but also don't have to meet the same requirements as schools \nlocated outside of the U.S. to access hundreds of millions of dollars \nof federal funding. It's a pretty good deal for them.\n  In fact in 2012, the three schools I mentioned earlier--St. George's \nand Ross and American University of the Caribbean, both owned by DeVry, \ntook in more than $450 million from the federal government--from \nAmerican taxpayers. That amounted to more than two-thirds of all Title \nIV funding that went to all foreign medical schools.\n  To sum up--three schools, 2/3 of the Federal funding, exempt from the \nlaw.\n  Not only are these three schools exempt from the enrollment \nrequirement, but they don't have to meet a minimum standard of \nsuccess--having 75 percent of their students pass the U.S. board \nexams--a requirement for any of its students to actually practice \nmedicine in the United States.\n  The University of Sydney, with its dozen or so American students, has \nto meet this standard in order to receive Title IV dollars. But DeVry's \nRoss University, with 1,000 or more American students, does not.\n  It doesn't seem right to the Department of Education, which says \nthere is no rationale for continuing the exemption. And it doesn't seem \nright to me either.\n  Especially when you consider what students are getting for this \nFederal investment--more debt, higher rates of attrition, and lower \nresidency match rates than U.S. medical schools. Translation: More debt \nand less chance of becoming a doctor.\n  In September 2013, an article in Bloomberg by Janet Lorin entitled \n``DeVry Lures Medical School Rejects as Taxpayers Fund Debt'' shined a \nbright light on the poor student outcomes of these schools.\n  It is no secret that for-profit foreign medical schools prey on \nstudents who have been rejected by traditional U.S. medical schools. \nThey promise to fulfill the unrequited dreams for students who want to \nbe doctors, but for one reason or another, did not make the cut in the \nU.S.\n  On average, scores on the MCAT, the test required to enter medical \nschool, of students attending these offshore for-profit schools are \nlower than those of students who are admitted to medical schools in the \nU.S. In 2012, students at U.S. medical schools scored an average of 31 \nout of 45 on the MCAT while students at DeVry's Ross medical school \nscored an average of 24.\n  The attrition rate at U.S. medical schools averaged 3 percent for the \nclass beginning in 2009 while rates at for-profit foreign medical \nschools can be up to 26 percent or higher. More than a quarter of the \nstudents at some of these schools drop out.\n  On average, students at for-profit medical schools operating outside \nof the United States and Canada amass more student debt than those at \nmedical schools in the United States. For example, graduates of the \nAmerican University of the Caribbean have a median of $309,000 in \nFederal student debt versus $180,000 for graduates of U.S. medical \nschools.\n  To add insult to injury, these foreign-trained graduates are on \naverage less competitive candidates for coveted U.S. residency \npositions. In 2015, residency match rates for foreign-trained graduates \naveraged 53 percent compared to 94 percent for graduates of medical \nschools in the United States. They are even less likely to land a \nresidency position the second time around.\n  According to the Bloomberg article I referenced earlier, one graduate \nof St. George's University, Michael Uva, amassed almost $400,000 in \nmedical school loans, but failed to land a residency spot twice. \nMichael was forced to work at a blood donation clinic earning $30 an \nhour instead. Although he sacrificed years of his life training for it, \nwithout completing a residency, he will never get to practice medicine \nand this $400,000 debt will likely follow him throughout his life.\n  Congress has failed taxpayers and students by subsidizing these \nCaribbean schools with billions in Federal dollars for years without \nadequate accountability and oversight.\n  This bill takes a first step at addressing that failure--by ensuring \nthese Caribbean schools must meet the same standards other schools \noutside of the United States and Canada must meet.\n  This bill should send a message to those schools down in the sunny \nCaribbean who may have thought they could continue to exploit taxpayers \nand students without anybody noticing.\n  It has broad support among the U.S. medical school community--\nendorsed by medical school deans of more than 60 venerable U.S. medical \nschools and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic \nMedicine.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Cassidy as well as Chairman \nAlexander and Ranking Member Murray to address this issue as the HELP \nCommittee begins consideration of the Higher Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3302-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3302-S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to explain why I support a short-\nterm reauthorization of the national security authorities that expire \non June 1, and why I will not vote for cloture on the latest version of \nthe USA FREEDOM Act at this time. These authorities need to be \nreauthorized and reformed in a way that appropriately balances national \nsecurity with the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans. I am \nhopeful that during the next few weeks we can do a better job of doing \njust that.\n  I start with the premise that these are important national security \ntools that shouldn't be permitted to expire. If that were to happen, \nthere is little doubt that the country would be placed at greater risk \nof terrorist attack, at a time when we can least afford it. This isn't \nexaggeration or hyperbole.\n  We have recently witnessed the emergence of ISIS, a terrorist \norganization that controls large swaths of Iraq and Syria, including, \nas of just days ago, the capital of the largest province in Iraq. ISIS \nis beheading Americans and burning its captives alive for propaganda \nvalue. And fueled in part by black market oil sales, ISIS reportedly \nhas at least $2 billion.\n  The organization isn't just sitting on that money. Members of ISIS \nand related groups are actively recruiting would-be terrorists from \naround the world to come to Syria. They are inspiring attacks, often \nusing social media, in the West, from Paris, to Sydney, to Ottawa, and \neven here in the United States, in places like New York City, Ohio, and \nGarland, TX. Director Comey has reported that the FBI has \ninvestigations of perhaps thousands of people in various stages of \nradicalization in all 50 States.\n  So this isn't the time to let these various authorities expire. This \nisn't the time to terminate the government's ability to conduct \nelectronic surveillance of so-called ``lone wolf' terrorists--people \nwho are inspired by groups like ISIS but don't have direct contact with \nthem. And this isn't the time to end the government's ability to seek \nroving wiretaps against terrorists. After all, this is a tool that \nprosecutors have used in criminal investigations since the mid-1980s.\n  Most of all, this isn't the time to sunset the government's ability \nto acquire records from businesses like hotels, car rental agencies, \nand supply\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\ncompanies, under section 215, in a targeted fashion. These kinds of \nrecords are routinely obtained by prosecutors in criminal \ninvestigations, though the use of grand jury subpoenas. It makes no \nsense for the government to be able to collect these records to \ninvestigate bank fraud, insider trading and public corruption, but not \nto help keep the country safe from terrorists.\n  While we must reauthorize these authorities, however, it is equally \nimportant that we reform them. But we don't yet have a reform bill that \nI am satisfied with.\n  The American people have made clear that they want the government to \nstop indiscriminately collecting their telephone metadata in bulk under \nsection 215. They also want more transparency from the government and \nfrom the private sector about how section 215 and other national \nsecurity authorities are being used. They want real reform.\n  I want to be clear that I emphatically agree with these goals. They \ncan be achieved responsibly, and doing so will restore an important \nmeasure of trust in our intelligence community.\n  I agree with these reforms because the civil liberties implications \nof the collection of this type of bulk telephone metadata are \nconcerning. This is especially so, given the scope and nature of the \nmetadata collected through this program.\n  Now, there haven't been any cases of this metadata being \nintentionally abused for political or other ends. That is good. I \nrecognize that the overwhelming majority of those who work in the \nintelligence community are law-abiding American heroes to whom we owe a \ngreat debt for helping to keep us safe.\n  But other national security authorities have been abused. \nUnfortunately, to paraphrase James Madison, all men aren't angels. I've \nbeen critical, for example, of the Department of Justice's handling of \nthe so-called LOVEINT cases uncovered by the NSA's Inspector General.\n  Given human nature, then, the mere potential for abuse makes the \nstatus quo concerning the bulk collection of telephone metadata under \nsection 215 unsustainable, especially when measured against the real \nyet modest intelligence value the program has provided.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act would in some ways reauthorize and reform section \n215 along these lines. It would end the bulk collection of telephone \nmetadata in 6 months, and transition the program to a system where the \nphone companies hold the data for targeted searching by the government.\n  But the bill's serious flaws cause me to believe that we can do \nbetter. Let me discuss just a few.\n  First, while the system to which the bill would transition the \nprogram sounds promising, it does not exist at present, and may well \nnot exist in 6 months. Intelligence community leaders don't know for \nsure how long it will take to build. They don't know for sure how fast \nit will be able to return search results to the government. They don't \nknow for sure whether the phone companies will voluntarily keep the \nmetadata for later searching by the government.\n  On this score, then, this bill feels like a leap into the dark when \nwe can least afford it. While we need certainty that the bulk \ncollection of telephone metadata under section 215 will end, we also \nneed more certainty that the new system proposed will work and be \neffective.\n  Second, the bill contains reforms to the FISA Court that are unneeded \nand risky. I am strongly in favor of reforming the court to make clear \nthat it can appoint a traditional amicus, or a friend of the court, to \nhelp it get the law right. This is a well understood legal concept.\n  But this bill goes further--potentially dangerously so. Under certain \ncircumstances, the bill directs the FISA Court to name a panel of \noutside experts who would, in the words of the New York Times, \n``challenge the government's pleadings'' before the court.\n  Especially when the bill already ends the kind of dragnet \nintelligence collection under section 215 that affects so many innocent \nAmericans, this is wholly unnecessary. And for this reason, the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts sent a letter alerting \nCongress to its concerns that this outside advocate could ``impede the \ncourt's work'' by delaying the process and chilling the government's \ncandor.\n  In addition, this proposed advocate is contrary to our legal \ntraditions, in which judges routinely make similar decisions on an ex \nparte basis, hearing only from the government. Mobsters don't get a \npublic defender when the government seeks to wiretap their phones. \nCrooked bankers don't get a public defender when the government seeks a \nsearch warrant for their offices. There is no need to give ISIS a \npublic defender when the government seeks to spy on its terrorists to \nkeep the country safe.\n  Third, the bill also contains language that amends the federal \ncriminal code to implement a series of important and widely-supported \ntreaties aimed at preventing nuclear terrorism and proliferation. \nHowever, the bill doesn't authorize the death penalty for nuclear \nterrorists. Nor does it permit the government to request authorization \nfrom a judge to wiretap the telephones of these terrorists or allow \nthose who provide them material support to be prosecuted. These common-\nsense provisions were requested by both the Bush and Obama \nAdministrations, but for unknown reasons they were omitted from the \nbill.\n  In fact, Senator Whitehouse and I have introduced separate \nlegislation, the Nuclear Terrorism Conventions Implementation and \nSafety of Maritime Navigation Act of 2015, which would implement these \ntreaties with these provisions included.\n  Recently, I have been heartened that there is a bipartisan group of \nmembers of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees who share these \nand other concerns. We have been discussing an alternative reform bill \nthat would also end the bulk collection of telephone metadata under \nsection 215. But it would also do a better job of ensuring that our \nnational security is still protected.\n  So I support a short, temporary reauthorization with the hope that an \nalternative reform bill can be crafted that addresses the core reform \ngoals of the American people and that appropriately balances national \nsecurity with the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans. There \nis work ahead, but it is important that we get this reform right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3303-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3303-S3304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the votes the \nSenate will soon take relating to three expiring provisions in the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  I will vote to support the USA FREEDOM Act, the bill passed by the \nHouse last week by a vote of 338 to 88, and strongly urge my colleagues \nto do the same. In my view, this is the only action that we can take \nright now that will prevent important intelligence authorities from \nexpiring at the end of next week.\n  Let me describe the situation in a little more detail.\n  On Monday morning at 12:01 a.m. on June 1, three separate sections of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, will expire. Two of \nthose provisions were first added to FISA in 2001 in the USA PATRIOT \nAct, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11. They are the \nbusiness records section, also known as section 215, and the roving \nwiretap provision.\n  The business records provision was originally intended to allow the \ngovernment to go to the FISA Court to get an order to be able to obtain \na variety of records relevant to an investigation. The authority was, \nand remains, very important for the FBI.\n  Since 2006, the business records authority in FISA has also been used \nby the NSA to get telephone metadata records from telephone companies--\nthe records of the telephone numbers and the time and duration of a \ncall. Metadata does not include the content or the location or names of \nthe individuals on the phone.\n  The roving wiretap provision allows the government to use \nsurveillance authorities under FISA, pursuant to a court order, against \nan individual who seeks to evade surveillance by switching \ncommunication devices. If a terrorist gets a new cell phone or changes \nan email address, the government can continue surveillance on that \nindividual under the same probable cause\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\nwarrant from the FISA court rather than having to go back to the Court \nfor authority to collect information from each new phone number or \nemail address.\n  The third provision, the so-called ``lone wolf'' provision, was added \nin 2004 over concern that the intelligence community may not be able to \ngather information on a known terrorist if it could not demonstrate his \nmembership in a specific terrorist group. Given the threat we face \ntoday from individuals inspired by ISIL, for example, that threat is \neven more real today than it was a decade ago.\n  These provisions have been reviewed by the Intelligence and the \nJudiciary Committees for many years and have been subject to enormous \npublic scrutiny.\n  For more than a year, there has been a strong desire by the American \npublic, supported by the President and by the House of Representatives, \nto make a basic change in the use of the business records authority. \nThat change is to end the bulk collection of phone records by the NSA \nand to replace it with a system for the government to get a FISA Court \norder to be able to obtain a much more specific set of records from the \ntelecommunications providers when there is a ``reasonable, articulable \nsuspicion'' that a phone number is associated with a foreign terrorist \ngroup.\n  The Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General have \nwritten to the Senate to indicate their support for this change, which \nthey state ``preserves essential operational capabilities of the \ntelephone metadata program and enhances other intelligence capabilities \nneeded to protect our nation and its partners.''\n  I would also note that the USA FREEDOM Act will allow private \ncompanies that receive requests and orders from the government to \nproduce information, at their own discretion, that allows them to be \nmore transparent about those requests and orders from the government. I \nsupport this additional transparency and thank the sponsors of the USA \nFREEDOM legislation for including it.\n  I have spoken to a number of technology companies, including several \nfounded and based in California, that believe that transparency is not \nonly good policy but that it will help them show publicly that their \nproducts and services are secure and independent from government \ncontrol.\n  So the choice before the Senate today is a clear one: whether to vote \nfor the only sure way to continue the use of important intelligence \nauthorities in a way that has the support of the American people, the \nPresident, the intelligence community, and the Department of Justice or \nto hope that the authorities will be renewed for 2 months despite clear \ncommunications from the House that it will not support such an \nextension.\n  FBI Director Comey said earlier this week that the expiration of the \nbusiness records and roving wiretap authorities would be a ``huge \nproblem,'' and I believe him.\n  Given the wide range of threats facing Americans, both at home and \nabroad--particularly from ISIL and Al Qaeda--we should not allow these \nvaluable authorities to expire.\n  To me, this is an easy choice, and I will support the USA FREEDOM \nAct.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy, ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, regarding important aspects of S. 337, the FOIA \nImprovement Act of 2015, that could affect the essential work of our \nfinancial regulators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3304-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3304-S3305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I recognize the principles of this legislation, which \nseeks to increase government transparency, but as the ranking member of \nthe Senate Banking Committee, I also recognize the need for regulatory \nagencies to thoroughly fulfill their oversight and supervisory \nresponsibilities over our Nation's financial institutions and the \nhealth and welfare of our financial system. The financial regulatory \nagencies are responsible for ensuring the safety and soundness of the \nfinancial system, compliance with Federal consumer financial law, and \npromoting fair, orderly, and efficient financial markets. Effective \nregulation requires that financial regulators have full access to \ninformation from regulated entities, and regulated entities should be \nconfident that regulators will be able to protect an entity's \nconfidential information from disclosure. Congress provided for this \nimportant exchange of information in the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA, by protecting supervisory information specifically in 5 U.S.C. \nSec. 552(b)(8), commonly referred to as exemption 8, and more generally \nin other exemptions. Accordingly, I appreciate that S. 337 does not \nintend to limit the scope of the protections under exemption 8, or \nother exemptions relevant to financial regulators; nor does the bill \nintend to require release of confidential information about \nindividuals, or information that a financial institution may have, the \nrelease of which could compromise the stability of the financial \ninstitution or the financial system, or undermine regulators' consumer \nprotection efforts. Because the release of confidential or sensitive \ninformation relating to the supervision of regulated entities could \ncause harm to such entities, their customers, or the financial system, \na financial regulatory agency could reasonably foresee that disclosure \nof such information requested under FOIA may harm an interest protected \nby exemption 8. This is precisely why Congress continues to provide \nthese statutory exemptions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Senator Brown for his interest and support for \nthis legislation. I agree that the safety and soundness of our \nfinancial system and financial institutions depends on our financial \nregulators' ability to perform effective oversight and supervision of \nfinancial institutions. I also agree that the free flow of information \nbetween regulators and financial institutions is important to this \nprocess. Exemption 8 was intended by Congress, and has been interpreted \nby the courts, to be very broadly construed to ensure the security of \nfinancial institutions and to safeguard the relationship between \nfinancial institutions and their supervising agencies. The proposed \namendments to FOIA are not intended to undermine the broad protection \nin exemption 8 or to undermine the integrity of the supervisory \nexamination process. In addition, I note that some information that the \ngovernment may withhold under exemption 8 is also protected under \nexemption 4, which exempts from disclosure commercial and financial \ninformation that is privileged or confidential. Exemption 4 covers \ninformation prohibited from disclosure under the Trade Secrets Act and \nsimilar laws, and as such does not provide for discretionary disclosure \nunder FOIA. As with other exemptions that are based on separate legal \nrestrictions, it is understood that the foreseeable harm standard will \nnot apply to most of the information falling under exemption 4. I will \ncontinue to work with the banking committee and financial regulatory \nagencies to clarify the scope of the bill as we move forward in the \nlegislative process and address any remaining concerns.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I, too, thank Senator Brown for his remarks and for his \ninterest and support for this legislation. I agree with Senator Leahy \nthat the important goals of this bill are not intended to impede \nregulatory agencies' oversight and supervisory responsibilities, nor \nare they meant to hinder communication between financial regulators and \nthe institutions that they regulate. I agree that it is important to \nensure that our financial regulators are able to do the work required \nto maintain the safety and soundness of our financial system. I will \nalso work with the chair and ranking member of the banking committee \nand the financial regulatory agencies to address any remaining concerns \non this issue as we advance this very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy for their work on \nthis important legislation and for working with me to clarify the scope \nof this bill. I hope Senator Cornyn and Senator Leahy continue to work \non these issues with the financial regulatory agencies, including if \nthe bill is considered in any conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, to ensure that this new standard will not undermine \nthe broad protections currently afforded to confidential supervisory \ninformation and in turn undermine the\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\ncooperative relationship between regulators and their supervised \ninstitutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3305-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF THE HUI PANALAAU COLONISTS\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I am deeply honored to represent Hawaii--\nmy home State is second to none when it comes to patriotism, public \nservice, and personal sacrifice.\n  I thank the Senate for so swiftly passing S. Res. 109, a resolution I \nauthored to acknowledge the deeds of 130 brave young men from Hawaii \nwho answered the call to serve our country at a perilous time in our \nNation's history.\n  Passage of this resolution commemorates the 80th anniversary of the \nlanding of the first Native Hawaiian colonists on remote equatorial \nislands in the Pacific. It also marks the 79th year since President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive order to proclaim the islands \nof Jarvis, Howland, and Baker under the jurisdiction of the United \nStates.\n  This was a 7-year colonization effort from 1935 to 1942 to secure and \nmaintain the islands under the jurisdiction of the United States. The \nvast majority of the 130 individuals involved in colonization efforts \nwere Native Hawaiian--many recent high school graduates of the \nKamehameha Schools. Later colonists included those of Asian ancestry \nand recent graduates from high schools across Hawaii.\n  These young men left their homes and families to be transported to \nbarren equatorial islands, and were then largely left to fend for \nthemselves and each other. They caught fish, constructed rudimentary \nlodgings, and throughout the years demonstrated great courage and self-\nreliance. What started as a dual purpose commercial and military \nventure, however, quickly evolved into a wartime strategy to extend \nAmerican jurisdiction into the equatorial Pacific, establish radio \ncommunications and monitoring outposts, and prevent further Japanese \nencroachment in the region.\n  Three young men lost their lives and others sustained permanent \ninjuries during their service. Jarvis, Howland, and Baker were distant \nfrom each other and located hundreds of miles away from any major \nlandmass. One colonist died due to the lack of access to medical \ntreatment. Two others were killed on December 8, 1941, when the islands \ncame under attack by Japanese submarine and military aircraft.\n  The islands were targeted by the Japanese military numerous times. \nThe U.S. Navy, consumed by the bombing of Pearl Harbor and official \nentry into World War II, could not rescue the surviving colonists until \n2 months after the initial onslaught of Japanese military attacks.\n  Upon their arrival home, the colonists shared little about their \nexperiences or the hardships they endured on those remote equatorial \nislands. They returned to Hawaii to enlist in the U.S. military, join \nthe civilian workforce, pursue higher education, raise families, serve \ntheir communities, and live out their days in relative anonymity. In \n1956, participants of the colonization project established an \norganization in Hawaii called Hui Panalaau, in part to preserve ``the \nfellowship of the group'' and ``to honor and esteem those who died as \ncolonists.'' Still, few outside of that group were even aware that \ncolonists had served on equatorial islands in the Pacific in the years \nbefore and during the advent of World War II.\n  A chance discovery of first source documents found in the possession \nof the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, including handwritten journals and \nlogs of colonists, led to an exhibition in 2002 and later the release \nof a documentary in 2012, based in part on those discoveries and \nsupplemented with the personal recollections of a number of surviving \ncolonists. This film introduced the subject to many in Hawaii. People \nin our State and across the Nation learned about a significant but \npreviously unknown part of our history.\n  Last year, President Obama signed an Executive order expanding the \nPacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument to include Jarvis, \nHowland, and Baker, and I worked to ensure that his proclamation cited \nthe ``notable bravery and sacrifice by a small number of voluntary \nHawaiian colonists, known as Hui Panalaau, who occupied the islands \nfrom 1935 to 1942 to help secure the U.S. territorial claim over the \nislands.''\n  And now the Senate has taken the formal action to extend our Nation's \ndeep appreciation to the Hui Panalaau colonists as well as condolences \nto the families of the three men that lost their lives in service of \ntheir country. It is my hope that the story of the Hui Panalaau \ncolonists will be shared even more widely in Hawaii. It is also my \nsincere hope that the sacrifices and valor of the 130 sons of Hawaii \nwill be understood in the context of the broader geopolitical strategy \nof World War II and that their deeds will be more fully understood and \nappreciated by Americans across the Nation.\n  I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate \nfor their support of this resolution, and their efforts to expedite \ncommittee consideration and floor passage.\n  I also want to thank the entire Hawaii congressional delegation--\nSenator Hirono, Representative Takai, and Representative Gabbard--for \nsupporting this coordinated effort.\n  The fact that the Senate chose to recognize the legacy of the Hui \nPanalaau colonists today, during the month of May--Asian American and \nPacific Islander Heritage Month--holds great significance. May is a \ntime of year we celebrate the vibrant diversity and rich heritage of \nAsian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and reflect on \ntheir contributions to our Nation's progress, and their prospective \nrole in America's continuing promise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3305-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3305-S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING GEORGE HALEY\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor the \nlife of George Haley, a distinguished Tennessean and distinguished \nAmerican who died at the age of 89 on May 13.\n  President Clinton appointed George as Ambassador to Gambia, the \ncountry from which George's ninth generation grandfather, Kunta Kinte, \nwas captured and brought to Annapolis, MD in the hold of a slave ship. \nGeorge's brother, Alex, wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \n``Roots,'' about the Haley family history.\n  Simon P. Haley, the father of George and Alex, was ``wasted'' when he \nwas growing up. This meant, as Alex told the story, that Simon was \nallowed to continue his education, ``wasting'' the opportunity for him \nto work in the cotton fields. Alex wrote the story of Simon P. Haley in \nthe Reader's Digest article, ``The Man on the Train,'' telling how his \nfather had become the first black graduate of Cornell's agriculture \ncollege, and then came to Jackson, TN to teach at Lane College.\n  It was in the small West Tennessee town of Henning where Alex would \nsit by the front porch steps in the summer listening to his grandmother \nand great aunts tell the stories of Kunta Kinte that eventually became \n``Roots.''\n  George Haley, after serving in the Air Force, entered The University \nof Arkansas Law School in 1949, where he was required to live and study \nin a cramped basement to separate him from the white students. ``It was \nreminiscent of a slave in the hold of a ship,'' he once said, ``I was \nthe Kunta Kinte of the law school.'' He stuck it out, graduating as a \nmember of the law review. Alex wrote about him as well in the Reader's \nDigest, ``The Man Who Wouldn't Quit.'' George had a remarkable and \ndiverse career serving as a Republican state senator in Kansas and then \nbetween 1969 and his death, serving in the administration of Presidents \nNixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton and George W. \nBush.\n  I first met George when I was governor of Tennessee during the 1980s. \nHe introduced me to Alex, who became one of our family's closest \nfriends. Few men or women have shown the intelligence, courage and \nsense of public responsibility during their lifetimes that George Haley \ndemonstrated. He was a kind man and a good friend. Honey and I offer \nour sympathies to his wife Doris and to other members of the Haley \nfamily. When remembering the life of George Haley, it is easy to do \nwhat his brother Alex always advised, ``Find the Good and Praise It.''\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``The Man on \nthe Train'' and ``The Man Who Wouldn't Quit,'' by Alex Haley.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Reader's Digest, Feb. 1991]\n\n                          The Man On The Train\n\n                            (By Alex Haley)\n\n       Though some people may attempt to live life from a purely \n     selfish, self-centered perspective, it is in giving of \n     ourselves to others that we find our greatest sense of \n     meaning. And so, as we search for meaning, one of the best \n     places to look is outward--toward others--using the principle \n     of charity.\n       Too often the meaning of charity is reduced to the act of \n     giving alms or donating sums of money to those who are \n     economically disadvantaged. But charity in its purest forms \n     involves so much more.\n       It includes the giving of our hearts, our minds, and our \n     talents in ways that enrich the lives of all people--\n     regardless of whether they are poor or rich. Charity is \n     selflessness. It is love in work clothes.\n       Alex Haley's father, Simon Alexander Haley, worked his way \n     through college and graduate school as a Pullman porter until \n     he met The Man On The Train. Always, Haley seems to be \n     telling us, opportunity awaits those who are prepared.\n       A poignant example is found in the story of The Man On The \n     Train. Recalled by distinguished and Pulitzer Prize-winning \n     author Alex Haley, it is the true story of a man Alex never \n     met, but one to whom he came to give great honor and credit.\n       In addition, Haley also shares why he broke down in tears \n     when he first visited the offices of a famous newspaper. As \n     you read his account, resist the temptation to reduce the \n     story to that of a kind man offering a handout.\n       Whenever my brothers, sister and I get together we \n     inevitably talk about Dad. We all owe our success in life to \n     him--and to a mysterious man he met one night on a train. Our \n     father, Simon Alexander Haley, was born in 1892 and reared in \n     the small farming town of Savannah, Tennessee. He was the \n     eighth child of Alec Haley--a tough-willed former slave and \n     part-time sharecropper--and of a woman named Queen.\n       Although sensitive and emotional, my grandmother could be \n     tough-willed herself, especially when it came to her \n     children. One of her ambitions was that my father be \n     educated.\n       Back then in Savannah a boy was considered ``wasted'' if he \n     remained in school after he was big enough to do farm work. \n     So when my father reached the sixth grade, Queen began \n     massaging grandfather's ego.\n       ``Since we have eight children,'' she would argue, \n     ``wouldn't it be prestigious if we deliberately wasted one \n     and got him educated?'' After many arguments, Grandfather let \n     Dad finish the eighth grade. Still, he had to work in the \n     fields after school.\n       But Queen was not satisfied. As eighth grade ended, she \n     began planting seeds, saying Grandfather's image would reach \n     new heights if their son went to high school.\n       Her barrage worked. Stern old Alec Haley handed my father \n     five hard-earned ten-dollar bills, told him never to ask for \n     more and sent him off to high school. Traveling first by mule \n     cart and then by train--the first train he had ever seen--Dad \n     finally alighted in Jackson, Tennessee, where he enrolled in \n     the preparatory department of Lane College. The black \n     Methodist school offered courses up through junior college.\n       Dad's $50 was soon used up, and to continue in school, he \n     worked as a waiter, a handyman and a helper at a school for \n     wayward boys. And when winter came, he'd arise at 4 a.m., go \n     into prosperous white families' homes and make fires so the \n     residents would awaken in comfort. Poor Simon became \n     something of a campus joke with his one pair of pants and \n     shoes, and his droopy eyes. Often he was found asleep with a \n     textbook fallen into his lap.\n       The constant struggle to earn money took its toll. Dad's \n     grades began to founder. But he pushed onward and completed \n     senior high. Next he enrolled in A & T College in Greensboro, \n     North Carolina, a land-grant school where he struggled \n     through freshman and sophomore years. One bleak afternoon at \n     the close of his second year, Dad was called into a teacher's \n     office and told that he'd failed a course--one that required \n     a textbook he'd been too poor to buy.\n       A ponderous sense of defeat descended upon him. For years \n     he'd given his utmost, and now he felt he had accomplished \n     nothing. Maybe he should return home to his original destiny \n     of sharecropping.\n       But days later, a letter came from the Pullman Company \n     saying he was one of 24 black college men selected from \n     hundreds of applicants to be summertime sleeping-car porters. \n     Dad was ecstatic. Here was a chance! He eagerly reported for \n     duty and was assigned a Buffalo-to-Pittsburgh train.\n       The train was racketing along one morning about 2 a.m. when \n     the porter's buzzer sounded. Dad sprang up, jerked on his \n     white jacket, and made his way to the passenger berths. \n     There, a distinguished-looking man said he and his wife were \n     having trouble sleeping, and they both wanted glasses of warm \n     milk. Dad brought milk and napkins on a silver tray. The man \n     handed one glass through the lower-berth curtains to his wife \n     and, sipping from his own glass, began to engage Dad in \n     conversation.\n       Pullman Company rules strictly prohibited any conversation \n     beyond ``Yes, sir'' or ``No, ma'am,'' but this passenger kept \n     asking questions. He even followed Dad back into the porter's \n     cubicle.\n       ``Where are you from?''\n       ``Savannah, Tennessee, sir.''\n       ``You speak quite well.''\n       ``Thank you, sir.''\n       ``What work did you do before this?''\n       ``I'm a student at A & T College in Greensboro, sir.'' Dad \n     felt no need to add that he was considering returning home to \n     sharecrop.\n       The man looked at him keenly, finally wished him well and \n     returned to his bunk.\n       The next morning, the train reached Pittsburgh. At a time \n     when 50 cents was a good tip, the man gave five dollars to \n     Simon Haley, who was profusely grateful. All summer, he had \n     been saving every tip he received, and when the job finally \n     ended, he had accumulated enough to buy his own mule and \n     plow. But he realized his savings could also pay for one full \n     semester at A & T without his having to work a single odd \n     job.\n       Dad decided he deserved at least one semester free of \n     outside work. Only that way would he know what grades he \n     could truly achieve.\n       He returned to Greensboro. But no sooner did he arrive on \n     campus than he was summoned by the college president. Dad was \n     full of apprehension as he seated himself before the great \n     man. ``I have a letter here, Simon,'' the president said.\n       ``Yes, sir.''\n       ``You were a porter for Pullman this summer?''\n       ``Yes, sir.''\n       ``Did you meet a certain man one night and bring him warm \n     milk?''\n       ``Yes, sir.''\n       ``Well, his name is Mr. R.S.M. Boyce, and he's a retired \n     executive of the Curtis Publishing Company, which publishes \n     The Saturday Evening Post. He has donated $500 for your \n     board, tuition and books for the entire school year.''\n       My father was astonished.\n       The surprise grant not only enabled dad to finish A & T, \n     but to graduate first in his class. And the achievement \n     earned him a full scholarship to Cornell University in \n     Ithaca, New York.\n       In 1920, Dad, then a newlywed, moved to Ithaca with his \n     bride, Bertha. He entered Cornell to pursue his master's \n     degree, and my mother enrolled at the Ithaca Conservatory of \n     Music to study piano. I was born the following year.\n       One day decades later, editors of The Saturday Evening Post \n     invited me to their editorial offices in New York to discuss \n     the condensation of my first book, The Autobiography of \n     Malcolm X. I was so proud, so happy, to be sitting in those \n     wood-paneled offices on Lexington Avenue. Suddenly I \n     remembered Mr. Boyce, and how it was his generosity that \n     enabled me to be there amid those editors, as a writer. And \n     then I began to cry. I just couldn't help it.\n       We children of Simon Haley often reflect on Mr. Boyce and \n     his investment in a less fortunate human being. By the ripple \n     effect of his generosity, we also benefited. Instead of being \n     raised on a sharecrop farm, we grew up in a home with \n     educated parents, shelves full of books, and with pride in \n     ourselves, My brother George is chairman of the U.S. Postal \n     Rate Commission; Julius is an architect, Lois a music teacher \n     and I'm a writer.\n       Mr. R.S.M. Boyce dropped like a blessing into my father's \n     life. What some may see as a chance encounter, I see as the \n     working of a mysterious power for good.\n       And I believe that each person blessed with success has an \n     obligation to return part of that blessing. We must all live \n     and act like the man on the train.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       The Man Who Wouldn't Quit\n\n                            (By Alex Haley)\n\n       In low tones, the dean was explaining to a prospective law \n     student the conduct expected of him. ``We have fixed up a \n     room in the basement for you to stay in between classes. You \n     are not to wander about the campus. Books will be sent down \n     to you from the law library. Bring sandwiches and eat lunch \n     in your room. Always enter and leave the university by the \n     back route I have traced on this map.''\n       The dean felt no hostility toward this young man; along \n     with the majority of the faculty and the trustees, he had \n     approved the admission of 24-year-old George Haley to the \n     University of Arkansas School of Law. But it was 1949, and \n     this young Army Air Forces veteran was a Negro. The dean \n     stressed that the key to avoiding violence in this Southern \n     school was maximum isolation.\n       George was dismayed at the pattern of life laid out for \n     him. He might have entered Harvard Law School, where he would \n     not have had to live the life of a pariah. Yet he had chosen \n     this! A letter from his father had determined him. During his \n     last semester at Morehouse College in Atlanta, he had opened \n     the letter to read: ``Segregation won't end until we open \n     beachheads wherever it exists. The governor of Arkansas and \n     educational officials have decided upon a quiet tryout of \n     university integration. You have the needed scholastic record \n     and temperament, and I understand that Arkansas has one of \n     the South's best law schools. I can arrange your admission if \n     you accept this challenge.''\n       George had great love and respect for his father, a college \n     professor and pioneer in Negro education. He accepted the \n     challenge.\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\n       The first day of school, he went quickly to his basement \n     room, put his sandwich on the table, and started upstairs for \n     class. He found himself moving through wave upon wave of \n     white faces that all mirrored the same emotions--shock, \n     disbelief, then choking, inarticulate rage. The lecture room \n     was buzzing with conversation, but as he stepped through the \n     door there was silence. He looked for his seat. It was on the \n     side between the other students and the instructor. When the \n     lecture began, he tried desperately to concentrate on what \n     the professor was saying, but the hate in that room seeped \n     into his conscience and obliterated thought.\n       On the second day, he was greeted with open taunts and \n     threats: ``You, nigger, what are you doing here?'' ``Hey, \n     nigger, go back to Africa.'' He tried not to hear; to walk \n     with an even pace, with dignity.\n       The students devised new ways to harass him. Mornings when \n     he came to his basement room, he found obscene and \n     threatening notes shoved under the door. The trips from the \n     campus back to his rented room in town became a test of \n     nerve. One afternoon, at an intersection, a car full of \n     students slowed down and waved him across. But the moment he \n     stepped in front of the car they gunned the engine, making \n     him scramble back and fall to his hands and knees in the \n     gutter. As the car sped away he heard mocking laughter and \n     the shouted taunt, ``Hey, missing link, why don't you walk on \n     your hind legs?''\n       His basement room was near the editorial offices of the Law \n     Review, a publication written and edited by 12 top honor \n     students of the senior class. He had heard of their \n     bitterness that he had to share their toilet. One afternoon \n     his door flew open, and he whirled around to catch in the \n     face a paper bag of urine. After this incident, he was \n     offered a key to the faculty toilet; he refused it. Instead, \n     he denied himself liquids during the day and used no toilet.\n       He began to worry that his passive acceptance of degrading \n     treatment might be destroying him, killing something of his \n     manhood. Wouldn't it be better for him to hate back, to fight \n     back? He took his problems to his father and brother in long, \n     agonized letters. His father answered, ``Always remember that \n     they act the way they do out of fear. They are afraid that \n     your presence at the university will somehow hurt it, and \n     thus their own education and chance in life. Be patient with \n     them. Give them a chance to know you and to understand that \n     you are no threat.''\n       The day after this letter arrived, George found a noose \n     dangling in the basement room.\n       His brother wrote, ``I know it is hard, but try to remember \n     that all our people are with you in thought and prayer.'' \n     George read this with a wry smile. He wondered what his \n     brother would say if he knew how the town Negroes uneasily \n     avoided him. They knew he walked the thin edge of violence, \n     and they didn't want to be near if an explosion occurred. \n     Only a few gave him encouragement. A church deacon proffered \n     a rumpled dollar bill to help with expenses, saying, ``I work \n     nights, son. Walkin' home I see your studyin' light.''\n       Despite his ``studyin' light,'' George barely passed the \n     first semester exams. His trouble was that in class he \n     couldn't really think; all his nerve endings were alert to \n     the hate that surrounded him. So the second semester, using a \n     semi-shorthand he had learned in the Army Air Forces, George \n     laboriously recorded every word his professors said. Then at \n     night he blotted out the day's harassments and studied the \n     lectures until he could almost recite them.\n       By the end of the year George had lost over 28 pounds, and \n     he went into the examinations exhausted, both physically and \n     emotionally. Somehow he finished them without collapsing, but \n     he had flunked, he thought. He had done his best, and now he \n     could honorably leave. Some other Negro would have to do what \n     he failed to do, some other man stronger and smarter.\n       The afternoon the marks were due, he went to his basement \n     room, dropped into the chair, and put his head on the table. \n     There was a knock on his door and he called, ``Come in!'' He \n     could hardly believe what he saw. Into the room filed four of \n     his classmates, smiling at him. One said, ``The marks were \n     just posted and you made the highest A. We thought you'd want \n     to know.'' Then, embarrassed, they backed out of the room.\n       For a moment he was stunned, but then a turmoil of emotion \n     flooded through him. Mostly he felt relief that he didn't \n     have to report failure to his father and friends.\n       When George Haley returned for his next semester at \n     Arkansas, there was a sharp decrease in the hate mail under \n     his door, and there was grudging respect for his scholastic \n     accomplishments. But still, wherever he went, eyes looked at \n     him as if he were a creature from a zoo.\n       One day a letter arrived: ``We are having a `Race-Relations \n     Sunday' and would enjoy having you join our discussion.'' It \n     was signed by the secretary of the Westminster Presbyterian \n     Student Foundation. His first reaction was anger. They wanted \n     to discuss, did they? Where had all these do-gooders been all \n     the time he'd been going through hell? Bitterly he tore up \n     the invitation and threw it in the wastebasket. But that \n     night he tossed restlessly. At last he got out of bed and \n     wrote an acceptance.\n       At the church, he was met by a group of young men and \n     women. There were the too-hasty handclasps and the too-bright \n     smiles. At last the chairman stood up to introduce George. He \n     said, ``We hope that Mr. Haley will tell us what we can do as \n     a Christian body.''\n       George got to his feet and moved stonily to the podium. \n     Those introductory words released something of a maelstrom of \n     emotions. He forgot his carefully prepared speech. ``What can \n     you do?'' he blurted out. ``You can speak to me!''\n       Suddenly, all that had been dammed up came pouring out. He \n     told them what it was like to be treated like an enemy in \n     your own country; what it did to the spirit to be hounded for \n     no crime save that of skin color; what it did to the soul to \n     begin to believe that Christ's teachings had no validity in \n     this world. ``I've begun to hate,'' he confessed. ``I've \n     drawn on every spiritual resource I have to fight off this \n     hatred, but I'm failing.'' His eyes flooded with tears of \n     anger, then of shame. He groped for his chair.\n       The silence vanished in a roar of applause and cheers. When \n     the chairman's gavel finally restored order, George was \n     unanimously voted a member of the group. Thereafter he spent \n     a part of each weekend at Westminster House, enjoying the \n     simple pleasure of human companionship.\n       A slight thaw also began to take place at the university. \n     George's classmates gingerly began moments of shoptalk with \n     him, discussing cases. One day he overheard a group \n     discussing a legal point, and one of them said, ``Let's go \n     down and ask Haley in the Noose Room.'' He knew only a moment \n     of indignation--then he smiled! It was an important change.\n       Toward the end of his second year a senior asked him, with \n     elaborate casualness, why he didn't write some articles for \n     the Law Review. It was traditional that only the best \n     students received such invitations, and he felt himself \n     flushing with pride.\n       It was only after he returned to school for the third and \n     final year that he decided to go to the cafeteria. He didn't \n     really want to go. In this last year he longed to relax, to \n     let down his guard. But he was in this school for more than \n     an education.\n       He went and stood in the cafeteria line. The other students \n     moved away from him in both directions so that he moved in \n     his own private air space. His tray was almost loaded when \n     three hulking students ahead shouted, ``Want to eat with us, \n     nigger?''\n       They jostled him, knocking his tray to the floor with a \n     clatter of breaking dishes. As George stooped to retrieve it, \n     his eyes blazed up at his tormentors and for the first time \n     he shouted back. ``You're adults!'' he said. ``Grow up!'' \n     They shrank from him in mock terror.\n       Shaking, George replaced the dumped food and made his way \n     over to a vacant table. He bent his head over the crockery. \n     Suddenly, a balding student stopped beside him with his tray \n     and drawled, ``My name is Miller Williams. Mind if I sit \n     here?'' George nodded. Now the two of them were the center of \n     all eyes. Now the taunts were directed at the white student, \n     the words ``nigger lover.''\n       Miller Williams was hardly that. ``I was born in Hoxie, \n     Arkansas,'' he said, ``and I have spent all my life in the \n     South. But what's happening here just isn't right, and I'm \n     taking my stand with you.''\n       Later that day, Williams brought several students to \n     George's room for a bull session, and they laid it on the \n     line. ``Don't all you niggers carry knives?'' George emptied \n     his pockets, no knife. ``How often do you bathe?'' Every day, \n     George told him. ``Don't most of you lust after white \n     girls?'' George showed him snapshots of a pretty Negro girl \n     he was dating in his hometown.\n       Following this session, he wrote his brother: ``Improving \n     race relations is at least 50 percent a matter of simple \n     communication. Now that I'm able to talk to a few whites, I \n     realize what terrible beliefs cause that prejudice. I can see \n     the emotional struggle they are going through just to see me \n     as an equal human being.''\n       Increasingly the last year became a time of triumph, not \n     only for George but for white students who were able to \n     discard their own preconceptions. When a student sidled up to \n     him and said, ``I wrote you a letter I'm sorry for,'' George \n     stuck out his hand and the student shook it. When another \n     silently offered him a cigarette, George, who didn't smoke, \n     puffed away, knowing it was far more than a gesture.\n       He was named to the Law Review staff, and his writing won \n     an award from the Arkansas Law Review Corp. His winning paper \n     represented the university in a national competition. The \n     faculty chose him as a moot-court defense attorney, and his \n     Law Review colleagues picked him as comments editor--the man \n     entrusted with the selection of articles to print.\n       School was drawing to a close, and he felt a deep \n     satisfaction in having accomplished most of his goals. But \n     then the old specter rose again. Each year, distinguished \n     alumni returned for a faculty banquet to salute the Law \n     Review staff. With a sinking feeling, George dreaded what \n     would happen. And that evening when George entered the hotel \n     banquet hall, the reaction was just what he feared. The \n     moment the alumni saw him, a pall fell on the room.\n       George felt sick. The food passed his lips untasted. It \n     came time for speeches. The law school dean, Robert A. \n     Leflar, welcomed the alumni and introduced the student \n     editors, one at a time. There seemed an eternity of names, \n     and George felt a frozen smile on his face.\n       Dean Leflar said, ``The next young man demands, and \n     receives, as much if not more respect than any other person \n     in our law school.''\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\n       Eleven chairs scraped back, and 11 men stood up. They were \n     the Law Review editors, and they were looking at George and \n     applauding vigorously. Then the faculty stood up and added \n     cheers to the applause. Finally the old grads got up, the \n     judges, lawyers and politicians from the Deep South, and the \n     ovation became thunderous. ``Speech! Speech!'' they shouted. \n     George Haley pushed himself to his feet. He could say no word \n     for he was unashamedly crying. But that was kind of a speech \n     too.\n       Today, ten years later, George is a respected lawyer in \n     Kansas City, Kansas. He has been deputy city attorney since \n     1955. He is a steward in his church, has helped found a \n     number of Negro business firms, and is vice president of the \n     state Young Republicans.\n       Dozens of old schoolmates are now George's close friends, \n     but perhaps the most touching acceptance of him as a man came \n     a few years ago when he received a telephone call from Miller \n     Williams, who had sat with him in the cafeteria. Williams, \n     now an instructor of English at Louisiana State University, \n     called to announce the birth of a daughter. ``Lucy and I were \n     wondering,'' he said, ``whether you'd care to be her \n     godfather?''\n       This simple request made forever real the love and respect \n     between two people. George knew that the long struggle and \n     pain had been worthwhile. He knew, too, that his father had \n     been right in saying, ``Be patient with them. Give them a \n     chance to know you.''\n       I know it too. For I am George's brother.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3308-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING SAINT ANSELM COLLEGE ON ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I honor a great institution \nof higher education in my home State of New Hampshire. This year Saint \nAnselm College will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding, \nand I am proud to recognize this historic event.\n  Founded in 1889 by Abbot Hilary Pfrangle, a member of the order of \nSaint Benedict, the world's oldest religious order, the college's \nmission is built on the credo of ``faith seeking understanding''--the \nguiding principle of its namesake, Saint Anselm of Canterbury.\n  Located in Goffstown, the college's picturesque campus is a perfect \nshowcase for all the natural beauty New Hampshire has to offer. Since \nits inception, Saint Anselm has continued in the proud tradition of a \nstrong Catholic education, which has prepared nurses, police chiefs, \nscientists, and politicians for successful careers for over a century. \nThe student body continues to be comprised of highly motivated and \ngifted learners who are committed to achieving a diverse and \nchallenging liberal arts education and are dedicated and enlightened \nmembers of the community.\n  The college is also home to the New Hampshire Institute of Politics \nand Political Library. As we prepare to celebrate the 100th anniversary \nof New Hampshire's first-in-the-Nation presidential primary, it is \nfitting that we also mark St. Anselm's longstanding tradition of \nfostering citizenship, engagement, and public service. Through the work \nof the institute, students have a front row seat to the political \nprocess. New Hampshire's well-deserved reputation as a proving ground \nfor Presidential hopefuls is due in large part to the hard work of \ninstitutions like Saint Anselm that encourage students to be active and \ninquisitive and provide forums for the community at large to \nparticipate in government.\n  Saint Anselm has also fostered a long history of service. Named one \nof the country's ``Colleges with a Conscience'' by The Princeton \nReview, Saint Anselm students, faculty, and staff log more than 16,000 \ncommunity service hours yearly. The school actively encourages its \nstudents to participate in service, both as a way to honor their faith \nand help those in need. Each year, over 200 students forego traditional \nspring-break activities to engage in service trips. From Costa Rica to \nOrland, ME, Anselmians spend their time and energy building homes, \nvolunteering in schools, and serving at soup kitchens.\n  For over 100 years, Saint Anselm College's continued success has been \ndriven by its clarity of vision and the hard work and dedication of its \nstudents, alumni, parents, and talented faculty and staff who share a \nsense of family and community.\n  I congratulate Saint Anselm College on 125 years of excellence in \neducation, and wish the entire college community best of luck on 125 \nmore years of providing high-quality education in the Granite \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3308-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING AMARI WILLIAM\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Mr. Amari Williams, a student from Camden Middle \nSchool in South Carolina, and his essay titled What Does Freedom Mean \nto My Family?\n  I ask that the essay be printed in the Record. The essay follows.\n\n                  What Does Freedom Mean to My Family?\n\n       Freedom has many meanings. For my family, freedom is living \n     without fear and restrictions. Being fearless gives courage \n     to make decisions that are not liked by everyone, but will \n     help everyone. With no boundaries, help can be given to the \n     less fortunate, those in bondage, and those in need of some \n     other assistance. Each day, my family practices freedom by \n     living in a neighborhood where we can fellowship with others \n     no matter what they look like, how they sound, or what they \n     believe. My parents work to make a difference in the world \n     for my sister and me. My sister and I are able to go to \n     school and learn so that one day we can help change the \n     world. Freedom allow my family to worship God, be thankful \n     for life, seek medical attention that helped save my life, \n     and to be kind and patient with others.\n       My family understands that freedom does not come without a \n     cost. Bravery is an important part of freedom. For freedom to \n     be achieved, men and women put their lives and personal \n     freedom at risk each day. Many of my family members have \n     served in the military and fought for this freedom. Facing \n     dangerous situations to help stop those who try to take away \n     the freedom and liberty of others, make the freedom we have \n     more special. As I have lived and began to learn more about \n     freedom, I know that no matter what someone does to me, my \n     family, or country, I can still have freedom in my heart. For \n     my family, freedom starts from within and goes outward. No \n     one can take our freedom away. Each day it is important to \n     try and help others get that same freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3308-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3308-S3309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING FRED CURLS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring the life and achievements of Fred Curls, who passed \naway on May 15, 2015. Fred was a dear friend and fought tirelessly to \npromote political and economic empowerment for African Americans. Fred \nwas one of a kind, and will be remembered as a man committed to \nimproving the lives of others and his community.\n  Fred was born in Kansas City, KS and grew up in both Kansas City and \nNorwata, OK. He was a member of the first class of graduates from \nLincoln High School in Kansas City. In 1952, Fred began a career in \nreal estate and opened his own business, Curls & Associates in 1954. He \nbecame the first African-American licensed real estate appraiser in \nKansas City.\n  Based on his own experiences with discrimination in the workplace, \nFred wanted something better for himself and his children. He became a \npioneer for civil and political rights and was the last surviving \nfounder of Freedom, Inc., one of the oldest and most active political \norganizations in the country. In 1962, he and four other influential \nleaders in Kansas City founded the organization with the belief that \nthe primary way to get equal treatment was through the ballot box and \nthe inception of a political party. The group helped give African \nAmericans in Kansas City and throughout Missouri political power and \nstrength by registering voters, backing civil rights efforts, and \nelevating candidates to elected office at the local, State and Federal \nlevel.\n  Throughout his life, Fred received numerous awards and commendations. \nHe most recently received the Legacy Award from Jackson County and was \ninducted into the Missouri Walk of Fame. Several of Fred's own children \nand grandchildren have been involved in State and local politics \nincluding his late son Phil, who was a Missouri State senator, his \ndaughter-in-law Melba who is a councilwoman in Kansas City, and his \ngranddaughter Kiki, who is a Missouri State senator.\n  Fred had seven children over two marriages to Velma Wagner Curls and \nBernice Curls Church. Three of his children preceded him in death. \nMillicent Curls Sillimon, Garland Michael Curls, and Senator Phillip \nBurnell Curls. He is survived by his children Janice Curls Parker, \nDarwin Lenard Curls, Dr. Karen Elaine Curls, Darrell Dwain Curls, 22 \ngrandchildren, 32 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great grandchildren.\n  To countless residents of my State and across the country, Fred Curls \nis a\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nhero. He witnessed first-hand the harsh consequences of racial \ninequality and chose to devote his life to ending that injustice. Fred \nis an inspiration to so many Americans, across all racial lines, and to \nme personally. Because of leaders like him, who fought and sacrificed \nbut ultimately believed in our country's ability to empathize and \nchange, we are all better off and our lives more enriched. Fred left an \nindelible and permanent mark on Kansas City and will be fondly \nremembered and dearly missed. Fred's life and commitment to empower \nblack voters serves as an inspiration to me and to all Missourians.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring the life and legacy of Fred \nCurls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/22/senate-section/article/S3309-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING GREEK-AMERICAN CULTURE\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I extend my congratulations to \nthe National Herald for 100 years of respected journalism celebrating \nGreek-American culture and chronicling every minute of it, bringing \nvital news and analysis on issues of concern to the Greek-American \ncommunity.\n  Socrates said, ``There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, \nignorance.'' For the last 100 years, the National Herald has provided \nthe ``one good'' and has proudly reflected the fundamental democratic \nprinciples that have become Greece's gift to the world.\n  The Greek-American community has had a profound effect on American \nculture. Greek-Americans have been instrumental in advancing medicine, \nbusiness, art, and academics. But the greatest impact has been on \ngovernance, and the continuation of the long history of democracy that \nbegan in Greece and continues today, as the gold-standard of governing \nprinciples.

TRADE FACILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As a land-locked least-developed country, Nepal has \n     severe challenges reaching markets and developing capacity to \n     export goods. As of 2015, exports from Nepal are \n     approximately $800,000,000 per year, with India the major \n     market at $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports \n     about $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of \n     the total goods exported from Nepal.\n       (2) The World Bank has found evidence that the overall \n     export competitiveness of\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\n     Nepal has been declining since 2005. Indices compiled by the \n     World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \n     Development found that export costs in Nepal are high with \n     respect to both air cargo and container shipments relative to \n     other low-income countries. Such indices also identify \n     particular weaknesses in Nepal with respect to automation of \n     customs and other trade functions, involvement of local \n     exporters and importers in preparing regulations and trade \n     rules, and export finance.\n       (3) Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly \n     address some of the weaknesses described in paragraph (2).\n       (b) Establishment of Trade Facilitation and Capacity \n     Building Program.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall, in \n     consultation with the Government of Nepal, establish a trade \n     facilitation and capacity building program for Nepal--\n       (1) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal \n     to support successful exporters and to build awareness among \n     potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and \n     ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the \n     United States and other countries;\n       (2) to provide export finance training for financial \n     institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;\n       (3) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining \n     publication of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and \n     importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation \n     relating to exporting goods on the Internet and developing a \n     robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade \n     Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for \n     implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for \n     under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade \n     Organization; and\n       (4) to increase access to guides for importers and \n     exporters on the Internet, including rules and documentation \n     for United States tariff preference programs.\n\n     SEC. 306. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall \n     monitor, review, and report to Congress on the implementation \n     of this title, the compliance of Nepal with section 303(a), \n     and the trade and investment policy of the United States with \n     respect to Nepal.\n\n     SEC. 307. TERMINATION OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.\n\n       No preferential treatment extended under this title shall \n     remain in effect after December 31, 2025.\n\n     SEC. 308. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this title shall take effect on January \n     1, 2016.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1439.
