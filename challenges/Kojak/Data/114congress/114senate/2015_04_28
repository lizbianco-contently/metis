Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, every Republican and every \nDemocrat on the Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act. That 19-to-0 vote cleared the way for its \nconsideration on the floor today.\n  This is an important debate in our country. At its heart, it turns on \na central proposition: Do the American people, through the Members of \nCongress they elect, deserve a say in one of the most important issues \nof our time? For a long time, the answer from the White House seemed to \nbe no. We have since seen a softening of that hard line, but that \ndoesn't mean the fight for this bipartisan legislation has been won. I \nstill expect to see a vigorous debate this week. I still expect to see \na robust amendment process. And then, at the end of the day, the \nAmerican people are right to expect their Senators--regardless of \nparty--to stand for them by supporting a bill that is as sensible as it \nis bipartisan.\n  Preventing the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism from \ngetting access to nuclear weapons should be the goal of our Senators no \nmatter what party they belong to. The price of a bad agreement with \nIran could be catastrophic.\n  Iran's nuclear program is only one aspect of its efforts to confront \nthe West across the full spectrum of warfare: through public diplomacy, \nthrough its support for terrorism and proxies, through its missile \ncapabilities, and through a modernization of its conventional forces. \nIran is on the move in all of those areas. Any sanctions relief from a \nnuclear agreement would give Iran, actually, more funds to conduct \nthese and other activities, so Congress needs to have a say.\n  Let's not forget that the American people were led to believe that \nthe point of the White House negotiations with Iran were to end Iran's \nnuclear program and to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons. \nCongress and the American people were not told that this would be an \nexercise in granting Iran international permission to become a nuclear \nthreshold state--just steps away from a nuclear weapon.\n  If that truly is how things have developed since, then the Members of \nthis body and the people we represent need to be heard. The American \npeople, through the representatives they elected, have a right to \nreview, analyze, and pass their judgment on any agreement reached to \nensure Americans are getting the kind of agreement they actually \ndeserve.\n  Giving the American people a real voice on a topic of such vital \nimportance should not be a partisan issue, and by passing the \nbipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, we can help ensure that \nit isn't.\n  Among other things, this bipartisan bill would require that any \nagreement reached with Iran be submitted for congressional review and \nfor public examination. It would also provide the Congress elected by \nthe people with the ability to approve or disapprove of any Iran deal \nbefore congressional sanctions are removed.\n  In short, the point of this bill is to give the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people the tools to assess any \nagreement reached by the administration before congressional sanctions \nare lifted. Those crippling sanctions--which include bipartisan \nsanctions authored by Senator Kirk that passed 100 to 0, over the White \nHouse's objections--are one of the most important reasons we even got \nIran to the table in the first place. So the United States should not \ngive up that leverage now if it means bringing home an agreement that \ndoes not meet American national security interests or one that simply \npasses on dealing with the Iranian nuclear program to the next \nadministration.\n  The point of these negotiations should be to secure an agreement \nstrong enough on its own merits to pass muster with Congress and with \nthe American people.\n  Congress had the correct judgment to impose bipartisan sanctions over \nWhite House objections a few years back.\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\nCongress would now have the correct judgment to insist that its Members \nand the Americans each of us represent be considered in this critically \nimportant conversation. Passing the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act is key to ensuring that happens, and in the process of doing \nso, we will ensure that the voices of all Americans are heard with the \nkind of robust amendment process I mentioned on the floor last week.\n  In that vein, we appreciate the Democratic leader's comments about an \nopen amendment process where, no matter how a person feels about this \nbill, they will have an opportunity to offer amendments. I appreciate \nhis supportive comments, and we encourage Senators to come to the floor \ntoday and to offer their amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2442-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I express my appreciation publicly--I have \ndone so privately--for the good work done by Senator Corker and Senator \nCardin, the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. They have done remarkably good work and exemplary work for \nus. Getting consensus on anything in the Senate is very hard. In spite \nof the monumental task they faced, the chair and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, were \nable to do just that with their Iran legislation. These two good \nSenators have worked very hard to find a middle ground that satisfies \nboth Congress and the administration. I think they have done that.\n  The Corker-Cardin bill allows Congress to vote on a final agreement. \nIt also provides for immediate reinstitution of the sanctions should \nIran breach the terms of the agreement. After weeks of bipartisan \nnegotiations, the Foreign Relations Committee reported the Corker-\nCardin legislation with a unanimous 19-to-0 vote.\n  I, along with many of my Senate Democratic colleagues, support this \nlegislation. In fact, I think all Democrats would support this \nlegislation. Senators Corker and Cardin worked very hard to strike a \nvery delicate balance. Now we must protect that delicate balance by \nworking together to avoid major changes that could imperil the success \nof the bill.\n  I hope we can move forward with the same spirit of bipartisanship \nthat got us here and bring the bill to a vote as quickly as possible. \nHowever, a number of my Republican colleagues stated publicly, in their \nefforts to be the Republican nominee for President, what they want to \ndo with this bill. I am concerned that they and others want to use this \ngood, bipartisan piece of legislation as a platform for their political \nambitions. This bill is too important to be a pawn in anyone's \npolitical game. I have told Senator Corker and Senator Cardin that I \nwill support their efforts to preserve their work.\n  As we move forward, I am hoping we can all work together in the \nbipartisan spirit in which this bill was crafted and keep our eyes on \nthe ultimate goal of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  Having said that, I am very concerned about some statements made by \nmy friend, the vote counter for the Senate Republicans, the senior \nSenator from Texas. He said in Politico--I am not going to state his \nfull quote but basically enough to get the idea:\n\n       Some of 'em might pass. I think it's going to be an \n     interesting dance. . . . There are some that are interesting, \n     that will be hard to vote against.\n\n  This is a bill which was brought to the Senate floor on a bipartisan \nbasis. We should continue on that basis. It shouldn't be up to \nDemocrats to kill these vexatious amendments; we should get some help \nfrom our Republican colleagues.\n  I look forward to this debate. It is important for the country. It is \nimportant for the world. I am grateful for the work done by those two \ngood Senators. I just hope it is not maligned, messed up, and \ndenigrated as a result of political posturing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2442-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate and when I \nserved in the House, conference committees were an important part of \nthe business we did here in Congress. But in recent years--very recent \nyears--going to conference hasn't been what it used to be.\n  Going to conference on a piece of legislation used to mean there \nwould be serious discussions and compromises that generally produced a \nproduct that could be supported by Members of both parties. It was a \nreal conference. Democrats sat down with Republicans and in a public \nforum determined what should happen on that bill.\n  I can remember going to those conferences. They were tough, they were \nlong, and there were a lot of compromises made. But that is what \nlegislation is--the art of compromise. When we finished, we had a \nproduct that was supported by both parties.\n  That is why we used to do appropriations bills like that. Why? As an \nexample, Senator Domenici and I for many years were the chairman and \nranking member of a very important subcommittee, energy and water. It \nwas very important, billions and billions of dollars. We did our work \nas a subcommittee, but then we were able to meet and work these out in \nconference. That is why we came to the floor. We did the bill in a few \nhours because everyone had had their input.\n  Sadly, under a Republican House and a Republican Senate, that is no \nlonger the case. Here is an example: the budget conference resolution. \nThere is all the chest-beating and flexing of muscles in the press. The \nRepublicans have a budget. They worked and worked and got it done. They \nfinished the conference.\n  The Republican majorities in the House and the Senate don't even \nbother to show that there is a bipartisan consensus building; they just \ndo it. Any meetings that have been had on this bill with Democrats have \nbeen strictly for show.\n  There is no discussion. There is no public debate. There is nothing \ndone. It is Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate \nmeeting together. I would bet that the conferences even between the \nHouse and the Senate were done mainly by the two chairs of the \ncommittees. Not a word of input on this bill--not a word of input on \nthis bill from Democrats. It is no conference. The party already knows \nwhat they want; they are not interested in our ideas.\n  Forbes magazine--I don't quote Forbes magazine very often for obvious \nreasons. It is a very conservative news outlet, but listen to what they \nsaid, and I quote verbatim:\n\n       This will not be the start of a period of bipartisanship \n     when it comes to budget issues. To the contrary, the budget \n     resolution conference report that will likely be voted on \n     this week will solely become a product of what the Republican \n     majorities in the House and Senate wanted to do. There was \n     little-to-no effort to involve Democrats in the negotiations \n     because the leadership would risk losing GOP votes in both \n     houses by doing so. They also would have risked alienating \n     the GOP base, much of which continues to believe a compromise \n     with congressional Democrats and the Obama administration is \n     the political equivalent of collaborating with the enemy.\n\n  How about that; every word of this is true. It is so sad for our \ncountry when working across party lines is considered collaborating \nwith the enemy.\n  I have said here on the floor many times, and I will say it again: \nWhen Obama was elected the first time, Republicans gathered here in \nWashington--a couple of days the meeting took, and it has been written \nup a lot of times--and they made two conclusions. They came to two \nconclusions: No. 1, we are not going to have Obama reelected. They \nfailed miserably with that. But on the second thing they have been \nsuccessful; that is, they would oppose anything and everything \nPresident Obama wanted. They have done that now for 6\\1/2\\ years.\n  What a sad day for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2442-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2442-S2443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on April 2, President Obama announced that \na framework had been reached for a nuclear agreement with Iran. If all \ngoes according to plan--which hasn't happened often during these \nrepeatedly prolonged negotiations--it means the White House would \nfinish negotiating an agreement sometime in June. But the question \nremains as to what type of agreement the negotiations will finally \nproduce.\n  Any deal with Iran needs to achieve one thing--one thing--and that is \nto prevent permanently Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. But the \nframework the President has unveiled seems unlikely to achieve that \ngoal.\n  Far from eliminating Iran's nuclear capabilities, the framework does \nnot shut down a single nuclear facility in the country. It doesn't \ndestroy a single centrifuge. It doesn't stop research and development \non existing centrifuges. It doesn't eliminate Iran's missile \ndevelopment programs. And it allows Iran to keep a substantial part of \nits existing stockpile of enriched uranium. It is no surprise that \nMembers of both parties are deeply concerned the final agreement will \nnot be effective in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  I don't need to tell anyone why Iran's possessing a nuclear weapon is \nsuch a dangerous prospect. First of all, Iran, as we all know, is a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. Practically speaking, that means Iran \nprovides support and funding to organizations that consider the \nslaughter of innocent civilians to be an acceptable negotiating tactic, \nwhich has kept millions of ordinary men, women, and children in the \nMiddle East from living in stability and peace.\n  Iran's plan for the Middle East includes its stated goal of wiping \nour ally Israel off the map, which should tell us all we need to know \nabout that country's commitment to peace in the region. Meanwhile, at \nhome, Iran embraces the same violence and oppression it spreads abroad. \nIran's Government is hostile to freedom of any kind. Thousands of \nIran's citizens have been tortured, imprisoned, and executed for daring \nto stand up for their human rights. This is not a regime that can be \ntrusted with a nuclear weapon.\n  In addition to the danger inherent in a regime such as Iran having \nnuclear weapons at its disposal, Iran's acquiring such a weapon could \nlikely start a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Right now, we are \nwitnessing a quasi-proxy war in Yemen, with Iran supporting the Houthis \nand a Saudi Arabia-led coalition bombing the Houthis and supporting the \nousted government. Imagine this scenario if both major powers had \nnuclear weapons at their disposal?\n  There is also the other great danger in Iran's acquiring nuclear \nweapons--a chance it could give a nuclear weapon to a terrorist \norganization. Imagine a situation in which a nuclear weapon fell into \nthe hands of such organizations. The consequences of that would be \nunthinkable.\n  This week the Senate is considering the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct negotiated by Senators Corker and Cardin. The Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act would ensure that the American people's concerns \nabout a nuclear deal are heard by providing for congressional review of \nany agreement the President reaches with Iran.\n  Specifically, the bill would require the President to submit the \nagreement to Congress and prevent him from waiving any congressional \nsanctions on Iran until Congress reviews the deal.\n  Congress passed sanctions that eventually brought the Iranian economy \nto its knees and drove the Iranian Government to the negotiating table. \nThe only reason--the only reason--Iran is cooperating at all on a \nnuclear agreement is because it wants to see those sanctions lifted. \nThis bill would ensure the sanctions could only be lifted after \ncongressional review.\n  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act would also make sure any \nagreement with Iran is verified and enforced. Under the terms of this \nlegislation, every 90 days the President would be required to provide \nCongress with confirmation that Iran is complying with the agreement.\n  The bill also includes reporting requirements on Iran's record on \nhuman rights and support for terrorism and any ballistic missile \ntesting it is conducting.\n  I plan to offer an amendment to this legislation to require the \nSecretary of State to investigate whether the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, which would be in charge of inspections under any \nagreement, would have access to military bases if they were deemed to \nbe suspicious sites.\n  Recent reports have indicated that the Iranian military is hostile to \nany inspection of military bases. General Hussein Salami, deputy head \nof Iran's Revolutionary Guard, told Iranian media, ``They [the \ninspectors] will not even be permitted to inspect the most normal \nmilitary site in their dreams.'' Well, given that attitude, are we \nreally supposed to trust Iran to fully comply with a nuclear agreement?\n  While I remain concerned about the framework the President has \nunveiled, one bright spot in this debate has been seeing Democrats and \nRepublicans working together to ensure that any deal with Iran is \nverifiable, enforceable, and accountable and promotes security and \nstability in the region and around the globe.\n  This kind of bipartisanship has been more the norm in the Senate \nlately. When Republicans were elected last November, we promised we \nwould get Washington working again for American families. That was not \na campaign slogan. That was a commitment, and we have been delivering \non our promise.\n  Since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, we have \npassed 13 bipartisan bills: legislation to approve the Keystone \nPipeline, a bill to prevent suicides among veterans, reauthorization of \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, legislation to give law \nenforcement new tools to fight human trafficking and provide support \nfor trafficking victims, and the first significant bipartisan reform of \nMedicare in years.\n  Even the media is paying attention. On April 26, CBS published an \narticle entitled ``Some Good News Out of Washington, For a Change.'' On \nApril 24, an NPR headline asked: ``Has the Senate Found It's More Fun \nto be Functional?'' And a USA TODAY headline from April 20 noted: ``New \nStudy Suggests a `Healthier' Congress.'' It argues that we are getting \nthings done again and working again and functioning here in the Senate.\n  The best way to solve the challenges facing our Nation is for \nDemocrats and Republicans to come together and to develop solutions. We \nhave been doing that for the past 4 months here in the Senate, and that \nis what we are doing on this crucial Iran legislation.\n  A nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to the safety, security, and \nstability of the globe, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nmy colleagues to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2443-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2443-S2452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up the Corker-Cardin amendment, \nwhich is at the desk.\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker], for himself and \n     Mr. Cardin, proposes an amendment numbered 1179 to amendment \n     No. 1140.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require submission of all Persian text included in the \n                               agreement)\n\n       On page 2, line 13, insert ``, and specifically including \n     any agreed Persian text of such agreement, related materials, \n     and annexes'' after ``and annexes''.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, this amendment simply requires that, \nalongside the English text of any final agreement, the President submit \nto Congress the official Persian text of any final agreement, including \nthe related materials and annexes.\n  We all have seen the controversy surrounding the discrepancies \nbetween the American factsheet and the Iranian factsheet. This \nagreement is too important to rely on secondhand interpretations of the \nSenate. In order for Congress to adequately evaluate any agreement, we \nhave to see what both sides believe this agreement is, and that \nrequires the Persian text of the agreement.\n\n  This is a commonsense amendment. I thank Senator Cardin for joining \nme in this amendment, and not unprecedented in any way. In fact, we \njust recently received a transmission of the China 123 agreement, which \nincluded the Chinese text.\n  I yield to my friend, Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corker on this first \namendment being offered. We have used the same process we used in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. There are several Members who have \nbrought this to our attention; that it is important, in reviewing the \nagreement--assuming agreement is reached by Congress--that we have at \nour disposal the documents being used. We expect we will have certainly \nan English version, but there could be information in other languages, \nincluding Farsi. So it is important we have the original documents \nbeing used so we can review and determine ourselves all the details of \nthe agreement.\n  So that is the purpose of this. This is a bipartisan amendment. We \nbelieve it strengthens the underlying purpose of this bill, which is to \nset up an orderly way for Congress to review a potential agreement \nreached between the United States and our negotiating partners and \nIran--have an opportunity to review and have the options of either \ntaking no action or dealing with an approval or disapproval or dealing \nwith the sanctions, since we imposed the sanctions. So I think it \nstrengthens the underlying bill, but more importantly it is a process \nwe should use.\n  If I might, the bill now is open for amendment, but I would urge my \ncolleagues to understand how the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \nbrought forward a bill that got a 19-to-0 vote in the committee--\nbecause we recognize stopping Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons \nstate is so important, we cannot be distracted by other issues. So we \nfocused on that issue.\n  As I said earlier, we have a lot of other problems with Iran. Iran \nsponsors terrorism. Iran has interfered with its neighbors and is \ncontinuing to do that. Iran has a horrible record on human rights.\n  So as I started to look through the amendments that were filed--they \nhaven't been made pending but have been filed--I see a whole host of \namendments that deal with issues that aren't really involved in this \nbill in stopping Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state. They would \nadd certification requirements on Iran not participating in terrorism \nor its ballistic missile program or its human rights record or its \ninterference with the sovereignty of other countries or the return of \nU.S. citizens who are improperly being held.\n  Every Member of this body agrees that Iran needs to respond to those \nissues, and we have tools available to deal with that. We have \nsanctions, regimes that deal with human rights violations, sponsoring \nterrorism, ballistic missile programs. This bill deals with stopping \nIran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\n  Now what would happen if any of those amendments were approved, if we \nhad to have a certification. The President could not make that \ncertification. So one of two things happens: It is a poison pill that \nkills this bill, so we lose our opportunity to review or it blows up \nnegotiations, and then the United States is alone, without any \ninternational support, because we blew it up in stopping Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear weapons state, making it much less likely that we \nwill stop Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state. That is why \nSenator Graham said the only people who will celebrate a poison pill \ngetting on this bill will be Iran.\n  So I urge my colleagues to understand what is at stake. This is a \nvery important bill.\n  What Senator Corker and I urge Senators to do is, if they have \namendments to file, talk to us. That is how we did it in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. Talk to us. Let's see whether we can work \nout an amendment, in an orderly way, to consider those amendments.\n  That is what we want to do, so we can use our time on the floor in \nconsideration of amendments in the most constructive way, that will \nlead to a bill being approved by the same large vote we had in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, so we use the process for \namendments similar to what this bill, S. 615, does for a congressional \nreview of an agreement and the way the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee did its work to get a 19-to-0 vote.\n  I thank my chairman for his extraordinary leadership. I thank the \nPresiding Officer who was very helpful in this process. I hope we will \nbe able to proceed in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Maryland.\n  I agree. We have reached out to numbers of people who have amendments \nand have asked them to come down to the floor and talk with us. I know \na number of our folks are traveling around the country focused on other \nthings at present. We have reached out to them to get back with us and \ntalk about some of the language.\n  I say to my friend from Maryland that I appreciate his openness to \nthe numbers of amendments we are now looking at. I know at lunch today \nhe will talk to his caucus a little bit about them and we will talk to \nours.\n  I look forward to a robust process. But, again, we have to have \npeople who, if they want to call up an amendment--they need to come \ndown, if they will, and talk with us and let us work through the \nprocess.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Welcoming Prime Minister Abe\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise to welcome the Prime Minister of \nJapan Shinzo Abe to Congress and to speak to the importance of United \nStates-Japan relations and the future of the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Tomorrow is a momentous occasion. For the first time ever, our \ncountry will welcome the leader of Japan to speak before a joint \nmeeting of Congress.\n  For over 2\\1/2\\ centuries, our Nations have been intimately linked by \ntrade and commerce. In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry waited with his \nships on Japanese shores to deliver a letter from President Millard \nFillmore to Japan's Emperor on November 13, 1852, which said in part:\n\n       I send you this public letter by Commodore Matthew C. \n     Perry, an officer of the highest rank in the navy of the \n     United States, and commander of the squadron now visiting \n     Your imperial majesty's dominions.\n       I have directed Commodore Perry to assure your imperial \n     majesty that I entertain the kindest feelings toward your \n     majesty's person and government, and that I have no other \n     object in sending him to Japan but to propose to your \n     imperial majesty that the United States and Japan should live \n     in friendship.\n\n  Thus, our Nations embarked on a path and relationship that would \nchange the course of world history. On July 29, 1858, the United States \nand\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\nJapan concluded the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, and in 1860 Japan \ndispatched its first diplomats to Washington, DC. They were the very \nfirst Japanese diplomats to visit a foreign power in 200 years.\n  Historians have often referred to our opening with Japan as an \nextension of our own Nation's Manifest Destiny which spread the \nAmerican people and values across the West, including my home State of \nColorado.\n  In 1911, President William Howard Taft further advanced our ties by \nconcluding the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan. In World \nWar I, Japan sided with the allies.\n  On March 26, 1912, a gift of 3,020 cherry blossom trees arrived in \nour Nation's Capital--a symbol of United States-Japanese friendship \nthat we witness every spring as we walk by or drive by the Tidal Basin \nand other landmarks in Washington. But we must never forget the dark \npages in our history. We must never forget Pearl Harbor, the day that \nwill live in infamy. We must never forget Iwo Jima, Saipan, \nGuadalcanal, and the bloody battles in Okinawa.\n  This war changed our Nation forever. Every day we must remember the \nsacrifice of the greatest generation that prevailed in that epic, great \ncivilizational conflict. Without them, this Nation would not be what it \nis today. Without them, this Nation may not have endured. We never lost \nsight of perspective of why we fought. As Imperial Japan surrendered \naboard the USS Missouri, GEN Douglas MacArthur offered the following:\n\n       It is my earnest hope and indeed the hope of all mankind \n     that from this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge \n     out of the blood and carnage of the past--a world founded \n     upon faith and understanding--a world dedicated to the \n     dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished \n     wish--for freedom, tolerance, and justice.\n\n  Japan's destruction following World War II was nearly complete. Out \nof that rubble of tragedy emerged the great partnership between our two \nnations. On April 19, 1951, General MacArthur went before Congress and \ndeclared in his farewell address:\n\n       The Japanese people, since the war, have undergone the \n     greatest reformation recorded in modern history. With a \n     commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to \n     understand, they have, from the ashes left in the war's wake, \n     erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of \n     individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuing \n     process there has been created a truly representative \n     government committed to the advance of political morality, \n     freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice.\n\n  As Japan took on the task of arduously rebuilding its society and \neconomy, our friendship and our relationship blossomed. Perhaps helping \nin that relationship, of course, is a shared national pastime, \nbaseball. It arrived in Japan in the 19th century and was already a \nthriving sport by the time the postwar recovery had begun.\n  Yogi Berra, the New York Yankees' great, visited Japan in 1953 in the \nmidst of this rebuilding process. His love of the game won the \naffection of millions, and he traveled the country demonstrating his \nskills behind the plate. Still, many of us may pause to wonder if this \nis the place--a nation haunted by such recent trials of war and a land \nstruggling to regain its footing in the world, a once powerful country \ndesperate to turn the page in history--where Yogi Berra first uttered \nhis memorable phrase: The future ain't what it used to be.\n  With the United States firmly at her side, Japan rose again. Japan \ntoday is the world's third largest economy and the fourth largest \ntrading partner for the United States. Millions of Americans for \ngenerations have bought iconic Japanese products, from Sony televisions \nto Toyota automobiles, to Toshiba laptops.\n  In the 1980s, former Senate majority leader and later Ambassador to \nJapan Mike Mansfield would describe the United States-Japan \nrelationship as the most important bilateral relationship in the world, \nbar none. The United States-Japan alliance remains the backbone of \nsecurity and stability in Asia. Approximately 53,000 U.S. military \npersonnel are now stationed in the Japanese islands, both onshore and \noffshore. Together, with our Japanese partners, we work daily to \nconfront the security challenges in the region and to ensure peace and \nstability.\n  As the challenges in the region are evolving, so, too, must the \nsecurity relationship between the United States and Japan. The Japanese \nleadership is currently taking necessary steps to change its post-World \nWar II defense posture in order to meet the traditional and emerging \nchallenges in the region. The revised United States-Japan defense \ncooperation guidelines, announced yesterday, signify a new phase in our \nrelationship and Japan's emergence as security leader in the region.\n  I want the American people to understand the importance of these \ndevelopments. It is due to U.S. military presence and the steadfast \ncommitment to our allies that we have avoided a land war in East Asia \nfor generations.\n  Distinguished political scientist Joseph Nye may have put it best \nwhen he said: Security is like oxygen--you tend not to notice it until \nyou begin to lose it, but once that occurs there is nothing else that \nyou will think about.\n  Our presence in the region has given our allies the breathing space \nto rebuild and stave off aggression, and now they are stepping up to \nthe plate by increasingly sharing that responsibility with the United \nStates.\n  This is also a historic economic moment for the Asia-Pacific region. \nThe United States and Japan are leading the way on concluding one of \nthe most ambitious trade deals ever undertaken, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Eleven Pacific nations from Malaysia to New Zealand and \nBrunei to Vietnam are actively working to tear down barriers to trade \nthat have stifled access to markets far too long. TPP's reach \nencompasses nearly 40 percent--nearly 40--percent of all global trade \nand trillions of dollars in economic activity.\n  TPP will set the standard for a new era of economic relationships \nwith Asia, and the United States and Japan are leading the way. We must \nconclude this landmark agreement as soon as possible, and I am \nencouraged by the progress we have made in Congress to advance this \nhistoric pact, but we must look at the TPP as just one step forward in \nour commitment to the region, not the final solution.\n  Despite the crises of the day in the Middle East or Europe, where the \nUnited States does and should play an important role, our Nation's \nstrategic future lies in Asia.\n  Consider the following estimates from the Asian Development Bank:\n  By 2050, Asia will account for over half of the population and over \nhalf of the world's gross domestic product.\n  Asia's middle class will rise and increase to a staggering 3 billion \npeople.\n  Per capita GDP income in the region will rise to around $40,000, \nmaking it similar to the Europe of today.\n  We cannot miss the opportunity to be a part of this important \nopportunity and transformation. Working with Japan and other regional \npartners, we must ensure that our policies strengthen existing \nfriendships and build new partnerships that will be critical to U.S. \nnational security and economic well-being for generations to come.\n  This administration's pivot to Asia or rebalance policy, which builds \non the work that began under previous administrations, is a sensible \napproach to realizing these goals. But I am concerned, however, with \nthe pace and focus and the consistency of the implementation of the \nrebalance. The administration, this administration and the next one, \nmust ensure that this important policy of engagement is pursued \nvigorously at all levels--whether that is the military, diplomacy or \ncivilian fronts--in order for the rebalance to actually achieve its \nstated and strategic objectives. Moving in fits and starts is not good \npolicy, whether that is for the economy or foreign relations. Every \nmoment of hesitation and idleness invites evermore challenges and \nmissed opportunities. Doubt is never the basis of a long-term, strong \nrelationship.\n  Our partners in the region must know each and every day that the \nUnited States is here to stay. We still face grave threats in the Asia-\nPacific region as North Korea marches on with their nuclear program and \nbelligerence toward the free world. The growing challenges of nuclear \nproliferation, cyber security threats, and the destabilizing \nterritorial disputes in the South and East Asian seas requires that now \nmore than ever the United States and Japan are vigilant and united with \nour allies in our efforts to maintain regional prosperity and security.\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\n  As the Prime Minister delivers his historic address tomorrow, it is \nmy hope that he delivers the message that the promise of the future in \nthe region, bolstered by an alliance with the United States, is a more \npowerful force than the painful history of the past.\n  We must never forget that colonialism and militarism caused untold \nanguish and destruction in the region in the 20th century. But as \ndemonstrated by the strength of the United States-Japan relations \nfollowing those dark pages of history, it is my sincerest wish that our \nfriends in the region can establish a viable path forward and overcome \nthis difficult past to focus on building a better future.\n  America's new century in the Asia-Pacific region has arrived. But as \nwe welcome Prime Minister Abe and celebrate our friendship, we must \nremember this is only the first inning of this ball game. We must \ncontinue to work toward the goal that General MacArthur had stated \naboard the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945:\n\n     . . . a better world shall emerge out of the blood and \n     carnage of the past--a world founded upon faith and \n     understanding--a world dedicated to the dignity of man and \n     the fulfillment of his most cherished wish--for freedom, \n     tolerance and justice.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gardner for his leadership \nas chair of the East Asia and Pacific subcommittee. I am still \ntechnically the ranking member of that subcommittee, but under my new \nresponsibilities I have not had the same amount of time. I want to \nthank the Senator for the work he is doing, for doing the rebalanced \nAsia. We know how important Asia is to the United States. With the \nPrime Minister of Japan, Mr. Abe, being here this week, it is an \nopportunity to underscore the important relationship between Japan and \nthe United States. I really wish to thank the Senator for the way he \nhas led the subcommittee and how he has worked to point out the \nimportant issues we have on maritime security and how we have to work \ntogether to make sure responsible action takes place and that we don't \nhave a circumstance that could get out of control and could affect not \nonly the security of some of our allies but also the maritime shipping \nareas.\n\n  There are so many issues we are working on with our ally Japan, and \nthis week we have a chance really to strengthen those relationships. We \nwill have an opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with the Senator from Colorado in this \nvery important part of the world, Japan.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Corinthian Colleges\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it has been nearly 1 year since \nCorinthian Colleges, Inc., began its death spiral--falling under the \nweight of its own wrongdoing. Corinthian Colleges defrauded students, \ndefrauded taxpayers, lied to accreditors, lied to the Federal \nGovernment, and on Sunday, this for-profit college, Corinthian \nColleges, announced it would close its remaining 28 campuses--campuses \nin California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, and New York. So, finally, \nCorinthian has collapsed.\n  We reflect on this disaster and ask a basic critical question: Why \ndid it take this long given the long litany of violations to finally \nstop the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars--Federal tax dollars--\nto Corinthian Colleges, and equally important, how many Corinthian \ndisasters lie ahead in the for-profit college and university industry?\n  There are certainly more questions we need to ask of the Department \nof Education about how it handled this case and how it must be more \naggressive in the future to stop violations earlier, especially to \nprevent the students at these for-profit education companies from \nsuffering an experience similar to Corinthian.\n  There will be more to come on that in the weeks and months ahead, but \ntoday I wish to focus on what is next for the students who attended \nthese Corinthian campuses. We know this for-profit college and \nuniversity industry pretty well. Ask any high school student in America \nto go online and to search a word, such as college or university, and \nwatch what happens. As soon as they get to any kind of directory of Web \nsites, they will start seeing the ads for the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. Some of the names are pretty obvious and well known. The \nlargest of all is University of Phoenix. The next largest is DeVry \nUniversity, out of the city of Chicago, and the next largest is Kaplan, \nan entity that was once owned by the Washington Post and now is on its \nown.\n  These for-profit colleges and universities descend on students, as \nwell as on those who graduated from high school, imploring them to sign \nup for an education online--to sign up for a for-profit college. It \nwill be so easy. They can do this online and get their degree. It will \nbe a snap. That is what Corinthian did for years.\n  I know that with the news of the closure, students who signed up for \nCorinthian and went to school there woke up wondering what is next. \nTheir college just disappeared, but their student debt didn't \ndisappear. They signed up for these loans to go to this worthless \nschool, and now the school has disappeared and the debt is still there.\n  There is a Federal law that can help these students. The Higher \nEducation Act gives students who attended a school such as Corinthian--\nwithin 120 days of its closure--the ability to discharge their Federal \nstudent loans. I am renewing my call to the Department of Education to \nreach out directly to the thousands of students who have been exploited \nby Corinthian Colleges and to provide discharge applications to these \nstudents and give them clear, upfront information about how \ntransferring their credits to another school may impact their ability \nto discharge their loans.\n  If a student transfers these Corinthian credits, which have limited \nvalue, to another school, they likely cannot discharge the loan they \ntook out at Corinthian. So a student has to make a choice. The notice \nthat the Department of Education sent to students yesterday is \nunacceptable. It leaves students to navigate through a series of links \nto get more information and it glosses over the most basic right of a \nstudent to discharge the student loans from bankrupt Corinthian \nColleges.\n  Federal regulations clearly state the Secretary of Education's \nresponsibility when a school such as Corinthian closes. According to \nthe law, it says: ``After confirming the date of a school's closure, \nthe Secretary identifies any Direct Loan borrower (or student on whose \nbehalf a parent borrowed) who appears to have enrolled at the school on \nthe school closure date or to have withdrawn not more than 120 days \nprior to the closure date.''\n  It goes on to say: ``If the borrower's current address is known, the \nSecretary mails the borrower a discharge application and an explanation \nof the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge.''\n  The law is pretty clear. It is up to the Secretary of Education--the \nsame agency that published an accreditation for this failed school, the \nsame agency which sent the loan forms for students to sign up for \nloans. That same agency now has an obligation under the law to tell \nthese students there is a way out.\n  Do you know what the average tuition is for a 2-year degree at the \nfailed Corinthian Colleges? About $40,000. Imagine if this were your \nson or daughter. They just went through 2 years of school and have \n$40,000 in debt, and the college they are attending, Corinthian \nColleges, just essentially went bankrupt, and now they find out people \nare laughing at them when they show their diploma from Corinthian \nColleges.\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nWhat is wrong with this picture? A young person, 2 or 3 years out of \nhigh school, now has $40,000 worth of debt or more and nothing to show \nfor it.\n  Now is not the time for the Department to be concerned with the cost \nto taxpayers of discharging this debt. That is an important issue, and \nwe will take it on later. The time for that was really over the last 12 \nmonths when the Department of Education kept Corinthian alive by \npumping in hundreds of millions of dollars to keep their doors open \nwhen they were headed for bankruptcy. Now is the time to focus on the \nstudents, particularly the students in the States I mentioned earlier. \nThey need the relief from this student debt.\n  The Department has also been doing something which I really want to \ncall them out on. You know what they are suggesting to the students who \nhave just gone through this miserable experience at the for-profit, \nfailed, bankrupt Corinthian Colleges? They are suggesting that they can \ntransfer to another for-profit college. What are they thinking?\n  Students should be warned if they use their Corinthian credits to \ntransfer to another institution, they will likely not be eligible for \ndischarge.\n  I have a few examples of the schools the U.S. Department of Education \nsuggested that the Corinthian Colleges students transfer their credits \nto and still keep their debt from Corinthian. ITT Tech is one example. \nWe see their ads everywhere, don't we? What we don't see in their ads \nis the fact that they are being sued by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. Sixteen different State attorneys general are \ninvestigating ITT Tech, and they are on the Department of Education's \nheightened cash monitoring list. Our Department is recommending that \nthese students transfer to this school? What are they thinking?\n  Here is another example: Le Cordon Bleu and International Academy of \nDesign and Technology--powerful names. What we don't see in all of \ntheir ads is that their parent company, Career Education Corporation, \nis under investigation by 17 different State attorneys general and on \nthe Department of Education's heightened cash monitoring list. And our \nDepartment of Education is suggesting that the students at the failed \nCorinthian Colleges--why don't you pick up a culinary degree from Le \nCordon Bleu. Maybe it will stay in business.\n  Here is another example: the Art Institutes and Argosy University. \nArgosy University--I ran into their signs in Chicago last week, and I \ncould not help but think how many students are lured into believing \nArgosy University is something more than it really is. It is a for-\nprofit college and university.\n  Incidentally, for the record, the parent company, Education \nManagement Corporation is being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice \nand investigated by 17 State attorneys general. They are also on the \nDepartment of Education's heightened cash monitoring list. This is \nanother school that the Department of Education suggested that \nCorinthian Colleges students transfer to.\n  Westwood College, one of the most infamous in the Chicagoland area, \nis being sued by the Illinois attorney general for deceptive recruiting \npractices. They were suggested to Corinthian Colleges students to \ntransfer to by the Department of Education.\n  DeVry is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and by \ntwo State attorneys general. The University of Phoenix's parent company \nis being investigated by two State attorneys general. Kaplan is under \ninvestigation by three State attorneys general.\n  Has the Department of Education learned nothing? How in good faith \ncan they tell these Corinthian students--who just had their college \ndisappear and are sitting on a pile of debt--that these are viable \ntransfer options for their students?\n  Last summer the Department assured me they would not sell Corinthian \ncampuses to companies being investigated. They didn't want the students \nto be placed in double jeopardy. Why now will the Department accept \nthat outcome for these students?\n  A move such as this leads me to the sad conclusion that the \nDepartment of Education is out of touch with the reality of the danger \nof students signing up at for-profit colleges and universities.\n  I want to say a word about the students who don't qualify for the \nclear relief I mentioned under the Federal law--the closed-school \ndischarge. I joined with Senator Elizabeth Warren and others to call on \nthe Department of Education to provide meaningful debt relief for all \nstudents wronged by Corinthian. We believe the fraud perpetrated by \nCorinthian should constitute a defense for repayment to students. The \nDepartment should provide clear guidelines on how students can assert \ntheir claims. These students need it and deserve it.\n  Senator Warren and I will meet with Secretary Duncan and \nUndersecretary Mitchell later this week.\n  While Corinthian's fraudulent behavior has left tens of thousands of \nstudents in financial desperate straits, the company's leaders have \nbeen cashing in for years.\n  The CEO of the failed Corinthian corporation, which received 80 to 90 \npercent of its revenue directly from the Federal Treasury through \nstudent loans, made over $3 million in 2013. The vice presidents didn't \ndo quite as well. They were only paid $1 million. The list goes on.\n  In September of last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nsued Corinthian. This goes back a few months. They sued them for \nillegal predatory lending schemes by luring students with false job \npromises, saddling them with high-cost debt, and harassing them when \nthey were unable to repay their loans. It turned out that only 25 \npercent of the students coming out of Corinthian Colleges were able to \nrepay their loans--25 percent. Why? Because the tuition is so high, the \ndiploma is so worthless.\n\n  Why are we complicit? Why is the U.S. Department of Education not \nblowing the whistle on this school and every other school that is \nexploiting students all across America?\n  At the end of the day, the losers are not only the students who have \nwasted their time and ended up with debt, the losers are the taxpayers \nof America--the taxpayers of America, who provide funds for the student \nloans and unfortunately do not have the protection they deserve in this \nsituation.\n  I call on the Department of Education to make their highest priority \nthe casualties and victims of this Corinthian College.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, the Senator from Indiana now has the \nfloor. I thank the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Indiana \nfor working with each other to go about this in a timely way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I rise to express my support for the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act--the only measure now before us that will \nprevent President Obama from having a free and independent hand to \nconclude a flawed agreement with the Government of Iran.\n  The White House and the Ayatollahs in Iran must know that the \nCongress will not tolerate a bad deal secretly struck behind our backs \nand without our approval. The Corker-Menendez bill now before us and \nbeing managed by Senator Corker and Senator Cardin on the floor needs \nour engagement and is the only vehicle we have to send that message. \nThus, the passage of this review act is absolutely essential. Its \npassage will send a message more important than any amendments, no \nmatter how correct or well-conceived, if those amendments would doom \nthe bill, mute the message, and deprive us of this vital role.\n  We have come to a moment of decision in this Chamber. It is clear at \nlast that we are finally close to imposing a vital congressional role \nin evaluating any deal--something President Obama previously had been \ndetermined to avoid.\n  I have long been concerned that the President is determined to \nimplement his version of a deal with Iran on his own, circumventing \nCongress. This is not acceptable. Resolving this issue with Iran is the \nmost significant foreign policy and security challenge of our age. It \ncannot be pursued simply by the President potentially overreaching his \nconstitutional authority, longing for a legacy and desperate for a \ndeal. If\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nhe fears that a supermajority in Congress would reject this deal if it \nis presented to us, then he has struck the wrong deal.\n  Fortunately, the right, statesmanlike Presidential support was \nfinally provided after the Foreign Relations Committee voted on an \nentirely bipartisan basis to give Congress a role in this matter. The \nquestion is whether the President will accept the decision made by the \nCongress as to whether the agreement with Iran achieves the goal of \ndenying Iran nuclear weapons capability.\n  The successful congressional strategy that brought us to that result \nin committee required the sponsors of this bill--the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act--to keep the focus on its core purpose. While \nthere were many amendments considered or offered in the committee that \ncould have improved the bill, the Corker-Menendez bill passed by the \nForeign Relations Committee is a necessary first step in achieving the \ngoal of congressional engagement in one of the issues, if not the most \nimportant issue of our time.\n  It is now clear that the most important goal at this stage of the \nmisguided and badly managed negotiations with the Iranian regime is \nthat Congress must have a determining voice in accepting or rejecting \nany deal that is presented to us. With passage of the Corker-Menendez \nlegislation, we will be able to spell out with precision what sort of \nan Iran deal might be acceptable, what concessions may be going too \nfar, and what the consequences would be if Iran backs away from \nacceptable conditions.\n  I wish to emphasize and define the worst possible outcome that could \nhappen. If our effort to impose a congressional role fails--if this \nbill is defeated or the promised veto is upheld--Congress will have \nbecome a spent force. Iran will see that Congress is no longer a matter \nof concern for them. The Iranians will have a green light to continue \nnegotiations with a weak administration desperate for a deal--any deal. \nThe Iranians can play their hand to maximum advantage without concern \nfor the views of Congress or even the views of the American people we \nrepresent. At the same time, the Administration would be free to give \nas much ground as necessary to secure a deal that apparently they so \ndesperately desire. They will be constrained by nothing coming from \nthis Chamber or an impotent Congress.\n  To avoid that outcome, we must focus on keeping the bipartisan \nmajority on this bill solid and robust. So I am cosponsoring, \nsupporting, and will be voting for the Corker-Menendez bill. This is a \nnecessary intermediate step, as I have said, toward a much more crucial \nvote on the Iran deal itself, where our focus needs to be.\n  Once we have secured a congressional role by passing this bill, we \nthen must use the next 2 months to analyze the outlined agreement that \ncame out of the negotiations in Switzerland a couple of weeks ago, \nidentify its weaknesses, and determine how we should best proceed.\n  As it now stands, as outlined by the so-called political framework, I \nam profoundly unhappy with what has been agreed to by the Obama \nAdministration. If this is what we see when the result of the final \nnegotiations is presented to us, I will vote against it and do my best \nto make sure others do as well. We in Congress must make sure the White \nHouse knows what we require if a deal is to be accepted.\n  This is not a recent or uninformed position on my part. I have been \ndeeply involved in this issue for the past several years, and I have \nbeen concerned about the growing threat of Iran since at least 2001. \nBack then, when I was our Ambassador in Berlin, the Embassy's biggest \nchallenge was to persuade Germany to support the invasion of Iraq. But \nthe Israeli Ambassador to Germany at the time, Shimon Stein, kept \ntalking to me about what they conceived to be the real, ultimate \nthreat. He convinced me that an even greater threat would be coming \nfrom Iran and that this threat would continue to grow until we took it \nseriously and dealt with it effectively.\n  After returning to the United States, I cochaired with Senator Chuck \nRobb the original Iran project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. We \nfocused deeply on the Iran nuclear issue and offered detailed analysis \nand recommendations on how we believed it should be dealt with. Our \ntask force members included such experts as Ash Carter, now Secretary \nof Defense; Ambassador Dennis Ross, one of the key and most experienced \nambassadors and foreign policy analysts--particularly in the Middle \nEast; a number of key generals who had served in the military on Middle \nEastern affairs; and a number of other names, including Jack Keane and \nothers.\n  Our reports covered all of the elements of a deal that is acceptable \nand could best meet, we thought, our national security needs. These \nincluded all aspects of fissile material production and how that \nactivity must be limited and controlled; activities at the various \nnuclear facilities and the type of research and development that must \nbe curtailed; the issue of Iranian stockpiles and their disposition; \nnuclear weapons design activities in the past that need to be revealed \nand stopped; missile development work; the critical need of adequate \ninspection regimes and compliance verification measures; and, \nimportantly, the duration of any future deal.\n  We also examined the requirements of a necessary and credible \nmilitary option that must back up any diplomatic efforts and sanctions \npressure to achieve the right result. It was a last resort, and it was \nthere to apply the pressure needed, along with ever-ratcheting \nsanctions, if Iran continued to defy the wishes of the United Nations, \nthe wishes of the United States, and the wishes of the free world and \nall of those who had spoken up about the deadly consequences of the \nIranian pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  Since that early involvement and throughout that period, I supported \nnegotiations as one of the essential tools to solve this problem. I \nwant to state that again. This is not a rush to war. This is doing \neverything we can to prevent a war, to prevent conflict. I have \nardently supported negotiations to try to achieve the necessary result \ncombined with sanctions, putting ever-increasing pressure on the \nIranian regime to achieve the desired result, with a backup--not taking \noff the table the use of force if necessary but only if necessary, only \nif everything else failed, because four Presidents, including our \ncurrent President, have stated that Iranian possession of nuclear \nweapons is simply unacceptable. The United Nations has passed numerous \nresolutions to that effect. Other nations have said the same. Yet, now, \nwe are looking at a framework that might allow Iran to break all of the \ncommitments it made and all of the assertions we made.\n  We need a solution that guarantees our security and assures that Iran \nwill never have nuclear weapons. If the White House cannot be persuaded \nto bring us a deal that does that, they should not bring us a deal at \nall.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear to me from the framework agreement and \nsubsequent developments that these negotiations are off track and have \nbeen for some time. They do not begin to meet the minimum criteria \noutlined in our several Bipartisan Policy Center reports. Let me name \nfive major problems that I see currently with the framework proposal \nthat has been agreed to.\n  First, the Obama Administration's negotiating tactics have been \nseriously flawed from the beginning, abandoning central principles at \nthe very outset of the negotiations. An agreement that builds on the \noutline emerging from the negotiations and trumpeted by the \nAdministration as a breakthrough will allow Iran to retain a robust, \nindustrial-capacity ability to enrich uranium--the core of nuclear \nweapons. This was never the intention of the international community \nuntil the Obama Administration negotiators took the helm and changed \ndirection. The original intent--to deprive Iran of this nuclear weapons \ninfrastructure--was deemed to be ``just too hard to achieve.''\n  The result is that Iran can now assume a guarantee that it will have \nthe right to enrich uranium--the regime's fundamental demand from the \nbeginning and one which the United Nations Security Council firmly and \nconsistently refused until the Obama Administration began these \nnegotiations. In the wake of that fundamental concession, we will have \nto rely on elaborate monitoring and compliance verification mechanisms \nto keep the uranium\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nenrichment enterprise within agreed bounds.\n  That directly leads to my second major problem with the outlined \nagreement. On the surface, there is a lot of reassurance that we would \nbe able to detect cheating, and the President has emphasized this point \nrepeatedly. Well, I have seen all of this before. I served here in this \nSenate when we were told our agreements with North Korea could be \nverified and would lead to a safer world. We were misled by that \nillusion. Today, 20 years after the nuclear agreement with North Korea, \nnegotiated by the Clinton Administration, that country now has an \nestimated 20 nuclear warheads and the Chinese experts tell us the North \nKoreans will have more than 40 by the end of next year and an effective \nICBM--intercontinental ballistic missile--to put those weapons on.\n  All that work developing such a huge, dangerous nuclear arsenal was \ndone after we concluded a negotiated agreement to end North Korea's \nnuclear program, confident that we would be able to detect cheating. \nLet me repeat that. All that North Korea has achieved in violation of \nthe agreement we made with them has occurred after that agreement, not \nbefore. And today they sit as a dangerous nuclear-armed nation, with \nover 20 nuclear warheads that can be easily--and have been--attached to \nICBMs.\n  Now I fear we are making the same mistake in negotiating with another \nrogue regime. In recent days, it has become difficult for anyone to \nmaintain that the agreement under consideration by this Administration \nwith Iran will provide the transparency we need. Senior Iranian \nofficials and authorities, including the Ayatollah himself and the \nchief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, have said repeatedly that \nthere will be no international inspections of Iranian military \nfacilities.\n  We know that much of the nefarious nuclear weapons development work \nhas gone on in such facilities. Barring access to them must simply be \nthe end of any deal if that holds. The White House has indicated that \nsuch hard-line statements by the regime are part of their negotiating \ntactics. I do not take comfort from that. If that is so, then it must \nbe proven at the negotiating table, not simply by declaration from our \nWhite House.\n  If the Administration brings us a deal that does not include complete \ntransparency and the total ability to monitor Iranian compliance \nanywhere in that country, then all Members of Congress must stand and \nreject it. Third, I find there are many other nearly sinister details \nburied within this outline that are hidden from those not steeped in \nthe technical details of this entire matter.\n  Many show that our negotiators caved on key issues, some at the last \nminute, to prevent Iran from walking out. In fact, the entire \nnegotiations process since it began 6 years ago has been a steady \nuninterrupted litany of concessions as we give ground on one issue \nafter another. The outline agreement confirms that pattern and hints at \nmore to come.\n  One of the many examples of this is the agreement to allow continuing \nresearch and development of the most advanced centrifuges within the \nFordow site that is safely buried deep beneath a mountain. Because \nthere will not be uranium enriched there for the first 10 years of the \nagreement, we are told to take comfort. In fact, the developments that \nwill occur in that sheltered bunker will make a nuclear ``break out'' \ncapability certain and rapid once the agreement expires in a decade.\n  Even President Obama recently admitted that in the final years of the \nperiod covered by the outline, ``the breakout time would have shrunk \nalmost to zero.'' That startling admission is a mortal blow to this \nagreement, in my view, and it comes from the chief advocate of the \ndeal.\n  A fourth problem with the outline is the essential issue of sanctions \nrelief. Initially, after the outline was released, the White House fact \nsheet emphasized that sanctions would be lifted gradually in stages as \nthe Iranians showed a pattern of compliance with the terms of an \nagreement. The Iranian negotiators and the Supreme Leader immediately \nrefuted that claim. They continue to say there is no such agreement and \nthat all sanctions must be lifted immediately upon signing. It remains \nfor them a nonnegotiable demand.\n  President Obama responded in a press conference last week that all of \na sudden he was not very concerned about the phasing or timing issue or \nthe way sanctions would be lifted. Instead, he said, and again I quote, \nthe so-called ``snap-back'' provisions that would reimpose sanctions in \nthe event of noncompliance were more important.\n  These Presidential comments signaled publicly that once again the \nAyatollah could have his way. Sadly, no one seriously gives any \ncredibility to these alleged ``snap-back'' provisions and their \nefficacy once the sanctions dam has burst.\n  Fifth, another mortal flaw in the outline is the issue of expiration \ndate--the ``sunset clauses''. The outline and the White House talking \npoints are designed to sell or confuse this issue. Various timeframes \nhave been mentioned--10 years, 15 years, 25 years, permanent. The fact \nis the core limitations on Iran's nuclear infrastructure, if they are \nactually implemented over time, expire in 10 years, others in 15. The \nsanctions against Iran will have long since disappeared and Iran will \nthen have the technical ability, the will, and the wealth to sprint \ntoward a nuclear arsenal, as the President has acknowledged.\n  Ten years or even fifteen years is tomorrow afternoon in this \ndangerous game for the world's future. Again, the President's own words \ntell us everything we need to know about the effectiveness of the deal \nhe is pressing on us. I quote again. ``What is a more relevant fear \nwould be that in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that \nenrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times \nwould have shrunk almost down to zero.''\n  This is, indeed, the most relevant fear presented by the negotiations \nwith the Iranian regime; namely, the fear that Iran will be given the \npath to nuclear weapons possession, resulting in consequences that are \nnot acceptable. We should all agree with President Obama that that is, \nindeed, the most relevant fear presented by his negotiations with the \nIranian regime.\n  But at this moment, it seems most probable that we will be called \nupon to consider a deeply flawed agreement, one that is worse than no \nagreement at all, but this is not entirely unavoidable. We still have \ntime to press the negotiators on both sides to change the outcome of \ntheir talks. The Iranians must know that with passage of the Iran \nNuclear Review Agreement Act, Congress has become an important player \nat the table. There will be no new constraints on their maximalist \npositions.\n  If they want a deal now, they must give ground; if not, they will \nface new, more painful, and more relentless sanctions pressure. This is \na profound moment in our history. A nuclear-armed Iran would present a \ndanger to the Middle East, to the United States, and to the world that \nis impossible to overstate. Preventing the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons always has been at the heart of our nuclear strategy. More than \nthat, it is at the heart of the future of the world.\n  Allowing Iran to develop the capacity to develop those weapons, \nigniting thereby a nuclear arms race among its neighbors and beyond \nmust be prevented at any cost. There is nothing whatsoever partisan \nabout this request. Neither I nor most of my Republican colleagues are \nattacking the President or trying to deny him a foreign policy triumph \nor wishing him ill in this important task.\n  Similarly, I trust our Democratic colleagues will not be blindly \nsupporting the President on this issue no matter what agreement might \nemerge from the Iran negotiations. In many ways, the future of these \nnegotiations is now in our hands. We must pass the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act with as much bipartisan support as we can achieve \nin order to play a significant or any role in this process.\n  We must not provoke a veto that can be sustained, thereby depriving \nCongress of our role and voice. We must all use the next 2 months to \npress the White House to demand an agreement that permanently halts \nIran's nuclear ambitions. We must then evaluate objectively and \nhonestly the agreement that emerges; accept it if we can, reject it if \nwe must. This is a solemn duty that the Constitution requires of the\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nSenate. I trust that each of us will be up to the task and the \nchallenge we are facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I first want to thank Senator Coats for \nthe manner in which he has presented his views. We may not agree on \nevery issue he raised in his remarks, but I fully agree that we have a \nresponsibility to continue to work in a bipartisan manner in order to \nachieve this review statute so Congress can have an orderly way to \nexpress its review. I thank him for the thoughtful presentation he has \nmade in regard to the legislation that is before us.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Events in Baltimore\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I know everyone in this body, this \ncountry, has been focused on the events in Baltimore. I live in \nBaltimore. It has affected all of us in our city. We love Baltimore. It \nis heartbreaking to see the violence that has taken place over the last \nseveral days, particularly yesterday. Baltimore is known for its \nneighborhoods. Neighborhoods are our strength. People take great pride \nin their neighborhood. There is a lot of ethnic pride in Baltimore. We \nhave a proud tradition. We have a proud tradition of blue-collar \nworkers who helped build this great country in steelmaking and \nshipbuilding and automaking.\n  We have government workers who have helped provide the services to \nthe people of this country. We have a high-tech workforce that is the \nfuture of Baltimore. Baltimore is a great destination for tourists--our \nInner Harbor. I could go on and on. But Baltimore is known for its \npeople, its friendliness, and its real pride in strong neighborhoods.\n  That was shaken very badly during the events of yesterday as we saw \nviolence. What happened to Freddie Gray is something that needs to be \nfully investigated. We want justice. All of us want justice. I was \npleased we will have that independent investigation done by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Thousands of protesters were out in the streets in Baltimore \nexercising their First Amendment rights, expressing their frustration. \nThey did it in an orderly way, in the way I would think we would want \nto see people express their views about matters of importance, \nincluding justice for Freddie Gray. There were a small number who \ndecided to take to the streets in violence. It was counterproductive to \nthe message. The family of Freddie Gray urged yesterday, particularly \nthe day of his funeral, to be a day without protests.\n  But these individuals decided they would take matters into their own \nhands. What they did was hurt their community, hurt the neighborhoods, \nand hurt the city I love. Senator Mikulski and Congressman Cummings, \nCongressman Sarbanes, and others have been in touch with the mayor of \nBaltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, with Governor Hogan, with the \nWhite House. We are taking all steps in order to preserve public safety \nin Baltimore and to make sure justice is provided in regard to the \ntragic death of Freddie Gray.\n  I would just urge all people to exercise restraint so we can provide \nsafe communities for the people of Baltimore, that we will rebuild from \nthis episode, and we will move forward. I thank many of my colleagues \nwho have contacted Senator Mikulski and myself to express their \nconcerns. We know these are very challenging times.\n  We urge all citizens of Baltimore to exercise restraint but to \ncontinue their passion for justice, as certainly Senator Mikulski and I \nand our congressional delegation will insist upon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I see Senator Coons on the floor, and he \nis prepared to speak with regard to S. 615.\n  First, I thank Senator Coons for his extraordinary leadership with \nregard to S. 615. He is one of those individuals who worked very \nclosely with Senator Corker and me to find a common way to resolve some \nextremely challenging issues we had. Let me take you back just a few \nweeks, where most people thought it was totally impossible for the \nSenate to get together on a bill that would provide an orderly way for \nus to review a potential agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had scheduled a vote, there \nwas a recess, and I think most of us felt that the bill would come out \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but that it would be a bill \non which the President would continue his veto threat, and its future \nwas anything but certain. Then the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nwent to work under Senator Corker's leadership, and we were able to \nresolve these issues.\n  But one of the key players was Senator Coons. Senator Coons was \ntraveling during the recess. He was in Africa doing important work on \nbehalf of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I doubt that he got \nany sleep because I was getting calls from him at times when it was the \nmiddle of the night in Africa giving us very constructive ways to deal \nwith some of the very difficult issues of congressional review, the \nlength of time necessary for congressional review, how we can make sure \nthat we had the information we needed, and that it gave the President \nthe strongest possible hand. I thank Senator Coons for his \nextraordinary leadership and work on behalf of the legislation we have \nbefore us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, first, I thank Senator Cardin for his \ngracious remarks and for his strong and capable leadership.\n  I come to the floor today to speak about the Iranian nuclear \nnegotiations and the need for Congress to play a constructive, \nmeaningful role in reviewing any potential deal.\n  This week, the full Senate will consider the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act of 2015 which would ensure that Congress has the ability to \nconsider any nuclear deal with Iran before any congressionally enacted \nsanctions on Iran's nuclear program are rolled back. This bill will \nalso ensure that Congress exercises its oversight over the \nimplementation of any agreement through imposing rigorous reporting \nrequirements and certifications on the administration.\n  This bill passed the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate \nunanimously after Senators Corker and Cardin--the chair and ranking \nmember--worked tirelessly together to ensure that it would receive \nbipartisan support. They carefully negotiated a deal that defeated \namendments that would have prevented the Obama administration from \ncontinuing to negotiate in good faith. In my view, it is a great \ntestament to their leadership that we were able to come together on a \nbipartisan bill that passed the committee unanimously and that the \nPresident has now said he would sign.\n  For the last 4 years, I have been hugely frustrated by the failure of \nRepublicans and Democrats to come together in this Senate to pass \nlegislation for the American people. The Republicans are now in the \nmajority and have a chance to move past obstructionism and into \nleadership and to show that in this Senate, we have an opportunity to \npass a bill, that this Senate plays a constructive role in protecting \nthe national interests of the United States.\n  Leader McConnell said that he wants a functioning Senate, that he \nwants regular order, that he wants the Senate to play its rightful role \nin foreign affairs. Well, here is the chance.\n  Let's review what has happened with this piece of legislation. The \nRepublican chair of the Foreign Relations Committee--working well with \nhis Democratic counterpart--crafted this bipartisan bill. Today, it has \n44 Republican cosponsors. It passed the committee, which fully and \nthoroughly debated the bill and many potential amendments. A committee \nwith views as broad as Republican Senators Johnson and Rubio and Paul \nto Democratic Senators Boxer and Murphy--a very broad range of views on \nour foreign policy--came together to pass this bill\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nunanimously. If that is not regular order, I don't know what is.\n  If Senator McConnell wants a functioning Senate, I believe we should \nrespect the committee process that Chairman Corker and Ranking Member \nCardin led to achieve this compromise. This bill gives Leader McConnell \nexactly the opportunity he wants to ensure that this Senate exercises \nits role in protecting America's national interest.\n  I particularly like what my Republican colleague from South Carolina, \nSenator Lindsey Graham, said recently:\n\n       Anybody who monkeys with this bill is going to run into a \n     buzz saw. Anybody who offers an amendment that will break \n     this agreement apart . . . the beneficiary will be the \n     Iranians.\n\n  That is why I stand here today to urge my colleagues to avoid \nattaching poison-pill amendments that are outside the scope of the \ncurrent ongoing negotiations and pass this bill as currently passed out \nof the Foreign Relations Committee and as currently supported by a \nmajority of Senate Republicans.\n  Over the last few years, Iran has responded to congressionally \nenacted sanctions by finally coming to the negotiating table to discuss \nand deal with its illicit nuclear weapons program. The Obama \nadministration and the other P5 + 1 countries have been engaged in \ndifficult, demanding negotiations with the Iranian theocratic regime. \nAfter a few extensions that have effectively frozen and in some ways \nrolled back certain parts of Iran's illicit nuclear program, the \nadministration is in the final phases of their negotiations. Earlier \ntheir month, the President released the parameters of a potential deal, \nwith the technical details and a few remaining critical gaps to be \nfinalized possibly by the end of June.\n  This bill is not a referendum on the President's decision to pursue a \npath of diplomacy with Iran. This bill is not a referendum on the \nparameters announced on April 2. The bill before us this week has a \nsimple, clear goal: It is about creating an orderly process that allows \nCongress to review any deal. As negotiations come to an end, it would \nensure that Congress can play a constructive role after an agreement is \nreached by considering whether the deal is strong enough to warrant \nrolling back congressionally enacted sanctions. Yet, some--a few of my \ncolleagues have insisted on making this bill a partisan exercise rather \nthan keeping it the responsible, bipartisan measure that is before us \nnow.\n  This bill is not about debating the merits of an ultimate deal now. \nWe will have that chance when or if a deal is reached over the summer. \nIt is not about, I hope, killing the negotiations before they have a \nchance to conclude. This bill is not about creating a list of \ncomplaints about Iran's destructive behavior in areas outside of its \nnuclear program. It could and should pass now, in its current form, \nwithout amendment.\n  I believe I have been as outspoken as anybody about Iran's \ndestructive behavior, but I am troubled by some of the amendments being \noffered to make Iran's human rights record, its support for terrorism, \nand its relationship with Israel a part of these negotiations. Yes, \nIran's human rights record is atrocious. Its support for terrorism \nthreatens the stability of its neighbors and has taken countless \ninnocent lives. Its continued threatening of Israel and its \nunwillingness to recognize the right of the Jewish State of Israel to \nexist is cowardly, dangerous, and just plain wrong. Iran must release \nthe four Americans it currently holds hostage. I think everyone in this \nbody would agree these are legitimate concerns for our consideration. \nYet, the truth remains that they are outside the scope of the current \nnegotiations around Iran's nuclear program. Congress must resist the \ntemptation to make them a sticking point in those negotiations by \nincluding them as amendments to this bill.\n  Let's be clear. There are already congressionally enacted sanctions \non Iran for its behavior in these areas. The deal's parameters, as \npublished April 2, said that ``U.S. sanctions on Iran for terrorism, \nhuman rights abuses, and ballistic missiles will remain in place under \nthe deal.'' No one is talking about removing those sanctions. The \nnegotiations are about Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program and the \ncritical importance of preventing Iran from ever building a nuclear \nweapon.\n  I have long believed a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat \nto the region, to Israel, and to the world. The nuclear arms race it \nwould set off throughout the Middle East would have horrible \nconsequences for global security. That is why throughout the \nnegotiating process I have remained adamant that no deal is better than \na bad deal, and I have closely consulted with the administration on \nthat point as well as many others. I have met with senior \nadministration officials to discuss these recently announced parameters \nand have been clear that I remain concerned about closing the remaining \ngaps and the need to maintain pressure on the Iranian regime to close \nany pathway to their development of a nuclear weapon capability.\n  I support this bill as it is. It is responsible and focused on the \nissue at hand. It ensures that Congress gets to weigh in if a deal is \nreached, and it strengthens this administration's ability to negotiate \nthe best deal it possibly can.\n  Every Republican in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted for \nthis bill, all 10 of them--from Senator Rand Paul and Senator Rubio to \nSenator Johnson and Senator Barrasso. All nine Democrats on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee supported this bill. All 19 Senators on \nthis Foreign Relations Committee represent as wide a range of foreign \npolicy views as could exist. So I urge my colleagues on both sides to \npause and reflect before supporting amendments that would make this a \npartisan exercise rather than a prudent use of congressional authority. \nIf we want Congress to play a responsible role overseeing any potential \ndeal, this bill gives us that chance. The alternative to this bill is \nnot a better bill; it is a deal without any meaningful congressional \ninput.\n  I have been as critical of Iran and distrusting of its intentions as \nanyone in this body, but if unrelated amendments become attached to \nthis bill, I will not support its final passage.\n  Because of the great leadership of these two Senators, we have here a \nrare moment for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate \nas a whole to demonstrate our ability to move past what have been \ndivisive and partisan fights over the last 4 years and come together \nand enact into law a measure that demonstrates our ability to give \nconstructive, timely input on one of the most important national \nsecurity challenges of our day and to restrain our sometimes extreme \nand divisive instincts in this body and instead demonstrate our ability \nto overcome those instincts and show our relevance. Let's not miss this \nopportunity to work together in the best interests of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator for his constructive comments and his \nwork on the committee.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  Early this month, Iran and the P5+1 countries agreed to a framework \ndeal to restrict Iran's nuclear program and to submit it to \ninternational inspections. Negotiators now have until June 30 to try to \nreach a final agreement.\n  At the same time, the Senate has been advancing legislation requiring \nthe President to submit any final agreement to Congress for review. \nThat is the legislation on the floor before us today.\n  Congress is divided along partisan lines on many issues, but we are \nunited in our conviction that Iran must not be allowed to acquire a \nnuclear weapon and that the people's elected representatives should \nhave the opportunity to review any final agreement with Iran.\n  This bipartisan consensus was reflected in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee's unanimous vote in favor\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\nof the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I thank Chairman Corker, who \nis on the floor here with me today, and Ranking Member Cardin, also on \nthe floor, for their statesmanship and the spirit of bipartisan \ncompromise that they exhibited in negotiating the act. They did a great \njob.\n  According to the legislation, the President must submit any final \nagreement to Congress. Congress would then have 30 days to hear from \nnegotiators and outside experts and to determine if additional action \nis warranted, including a resolution of approval or disapproval.\n  I believe congressional oversight is appropriate because the \nPresident, in order to implement any agreement with Iran, will need to \nset aside sanctions put in place by Congress. I also voted for this \nbill because it reasserts the proper role of Congress in providing \noversight of the President's execution of foreign policy.\n  As a member of the Senator Foreign Relations Committee, I believe the \nbest way to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear program is a \nhardnosed agreement that cuts off all paths Iran could take to pursue a \nnuclear weapon.\n  It was therefore crucial for me that the legislation considered by \nthe committee not hinder our negotiators' efforts to reach a strong \nagreement. I believe that standard should be maintained as the full \nSenate considers this legislation.\n  I believe it is also essential that the spirit of cooperation and \nbipartisanship that was demonstrated by Senators Corker and Cardin in \nforging a bipartisan bill continue this week as the full Senate takes \nup the Iran legislation. Amendments that undermine the administration's \nnegotiations or structurally alter this careful bipartisan compromise \nshould be rejected by the Senate.\n  While I supported this bill in the Foreign Relations Committee, if \nthe bipartisan nature of the legislation is eroded on the floor, the \nbill will no longer merit my support. This is a serious matter that \nwill require the Senate to rise above the desire of some to force votes \non poison-pill amendments that would destroy the bipartisan balance. We \nhave to rise above politics here because we are confronted by a \ndangerous and unacceptable status quo in Iran.\n  The benefits of a strong final deal could be significant. Such a deal \nwould stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and ensure that it \ncould not pursue destabilizing activities in the region with impunity. \nIt would prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and advance \ngreater long-term security for our regional allies. That is why, even \nas Congress reaffirms its role in reviewing any final agreement, we \nneed to give the administration and its international partners every \nopportunity to bring these difficult negotiations to a successful \nconclusion.\n  With so much at stake for the United States, for Israel, and for the \nentire world, it is more important than ever that the Senate rise above \npartisan politics and reaffirm bipartisan cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold the suggestion of the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Shaheen. She \ntalked about the bipartisan way the committee operated. She played a \nlarge part in bringing us together in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and working over the recess. I want to thank the Senator for \nher input and the manner in which we were able to strengthen our \nnegotiators and maintain the proper role for the Congress.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, if I could respond, I think one of the \nreasons for the success of the agreement was because of the efforts of \nSenator Cardin and Chairman Corker to solicit input from members of the \ncommittee to see what people could agree to and, where we had concerns, \nto respond to those in crafting the legislation. It truly was a \nbipartisan, very statesman-like effort, and I thank the Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2452-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor to the good Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today and for the next few days we will \nhave the opportunity to consider a very important piece of legislation, \nthe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015--a piece of legislation \nthat, like all the legislation we consider here, is important, but this \nparticular legislation is important to our national security and, \nindeed, it is important to the peace and security of our allies around \nthe world.\n  This bill represents a good, bipartisan effort. It passed unanimously \nout of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a vote of 19 to 0 \nearlier this month.\n  The reason this legislation is so important is because it would \nguarantee Congress the opportunity and the time necessary to scrutinize \nany agreement reached between the Obama administration and the P5+1 \nnations that are currently negotiating on the Iranian nuclear capacity. \nIt would also prohibit the President from lifting sanctions on Iran \nduring this period of review.\n  This is not important because we are U.S. Senators; this is important \nbecause we represent the American people, and the American people need \nto understand what is in this agreement and what it means to their \nsafety and security and to that of future generations.\n  I think it is critical that Congress have this opportunity to \nunderstand completely and thoroughly any deal that is cut between this \nadministration and Iran and, of course, its implications, particularly \non a matter that is so vital to our national security. If the Congress \ncan have a voice on ongoing trade negotiations--which we do--with many \nof our allies, how much more so should Congress have, at the very \nleast, a review of the final negotiated deal with one of our stated \nadversaries?\n  As I have made clear before, I have serious reservations about the \nframework that has been announced with Iran. This framework, as it is \ncalled, is right now very vague, and it strikes me as somewhat \nconvoluted. It also represents a significant departure from \nlongstanding U.S. policy to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon and \ninstead puts us on a path--a feeble path, at that--to try to contain an \nIranian nuclear weapon. Such an outcome is irresponsible, unacceptable, \nand dangerous. We simply cannot trust the Iranian leadership with \nthreshold nuclear capabilities, which is exactly what the President's \nframework would do at this point. The concept of good-faith \nnegotiations between us and Iran is a fantasy. Iran is a rogue regime \nand the world's foremost sponsor of international terrorism, and to \ntrust them--to trust them--would be laughable and also reckless.\n  Iran and its proxies have been attacking and killing Americans and \nattempting to undermine our national security interests for at least \nthe last three decades. Unfortunately, Iran's proxy war throughout the \nMiddle East is well documented. Right at this moment, Iran's regional \nadventurism continues to destabilize areas where American interests are \nat stake, including war-torn Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Even\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nmore worrisome, Iranian officials have publicly stated that even during \nthis period of ``understanding,'' while the details are being worked \nout, Iran has made clear that its true intentions are to destroy one of \nthe United States' most stalwart allies, Israel, and to further Iran's \naspiration as a regional hegemon and Iranian empire. This is the kind \nof country--a country that has been on our own State Department's \nsponsors of terrorism list since 1984. This is the administration that \nis being negotiated with by the Secretary of State and the Obama \nadministration's representatives. That is why this bill is so \nimportant, because we need a congressional backstop against an Iranian \nregime that is well known for being deceptive and, frankly, lying to \ninternational institutions and inspectors.\n  One thing this legislation does do, which I applaud, is it guarantees \nCongress the time and the opportunity for us to scrutinize, debate, and \njudge this deal if it is made by the summer. Many of our Senate \ncolleagues have ideas about how to further improve the bill, which is \nadmittedly not perfect. No piece of legislation ever is.\n  I look forward to a lively and healthy debate on the Senate floor. \nThis will be an important debate on a serious matter of national \nsecurity and one that has a clear ramification for generations yet to \ncome. That is what the United States--the Founders of our country--\ndesigned the Senate for. I expect the Senate will be doing what only it \ncan do--having a lively debate, having a fulsome review of this \nlegislation, and then voting on the outcome. But I am thankful to those \nwho produced this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I am glad that \nwe are united in our strong belief that robust congressional review of \nany potential Iranian deal is an absolute necessity.\n  On behalf of the American people, America's elected representatives \nshould be able to get any and every detail on this emerging deal. We \nshould have the time and the space to review it and make sure we \nunderstand its terms and its implications. We need to be able in this \ndebate to voice our concerns and ultimately have a timely opportunity \nto prevent this deal from being implemented if we conclude in the end \nthat it is not in America's best interests.\n  Going forward, I hope the spirit of bipartisanship that has brought \nus this far, so far, is evidenced in this Chamber over the debate that \nwill ensue. I look forward to discussing this legislation and providing \na clear path for congressional review of any potential deal President \nObama may make with Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the bill that is \nbefore us with regard to the Iran negotiations. I wish to address two \nfundamental and major segments of this process. One is the process and \nthe other is the substance of the agreement which, hopefully, will come \nbefore this body at the end of June or July.\n  First is the process. We are operating in a constitutional gray area. \nThere is no question that the Constitution assigns principal \nresponsibility for the conduct of foreign policy to the President, but \nit also assigns responsibility to the Congress--responsibility with \nregard to treaties, responsibility with regard to funding the foreign \npolicy of the United States, and responsibility with regard to \napproving foreign policy officials. So there is an opportunity here for \nus to break, in a sense, new ground to establish a rational, formal, \npredictable process for considering this important issue.\n  If we don't pass a bill, such as the one that is before us today, we \nwill be in a kind of disorganized, chaotic situation of what will be \nthe congressional reaction, what is Congress's role, how will it be \nplayed out, and how will it work. I believe that it is very important \nfor us to establish this process before the agreement is laid before \nthe world and the American people. It sets forth a process whereby \nCongress with can weigh in in a meaningful way and determine the merits \nand the quality of the arrangement that is being set before us.\n  I cannot imagine a more solemn responsibility for this body than the \nconsideration of this matter. This is a decision which will affect the \nUnited States, our ally Israel, and all the countries of the Middle \nEast for generations to come. This is a consideration that must be \ntaken on the merits, on the facts, on the data, on the actual \nalternatives--and I will talk about that in a minute--that we have to \nthe deal, or the arrangement, that we hope will ultimately be brought \nto us later this summer. Let's treat this issue on its merits, and, \nplease, to my colleagues, let's not treat it as simply another partisan \nissue.\n  We have a tendency around here for everything to become a partisan \nissue. A great Republican Senator of the 1950s said that ``politics \nshould stop at the water's edge.'' That means that this kind of issue, \nwhich involves war and peace and ridding or preventing a major country \nfrom obtaining nuclear weapons and thereby destabilizing the region and \npossibly the world, is the most solemn kind of issue that we can face.\n  I know that there are people in this body who are not supportive of \nthe President. They oppose the President. They don't like what he did \non health care or don't like what he did on immigration. This is not \nthe place for partisan politics. That does not mean I am saying we \nshould roll over and do whatever the President says. I don't mean that \nat all. What I mean is that this matter should be considered in the \ncontext of the facts and the merits. What will it actually do and what \nare the alternatives?\n  It is not about whether we agree with this President or whether we \nwant this President to have an international accomplishment on his \nresume. We have to try to separate ourselves from that kind of \nconsideration.\n  Let's talk a bit about the agreement itself. The first thing to say \nabout it is that it doesn't exist yet. It has not been finalized. We \ndon't know what it is. I am a little surprised, frankly, when I hear \nmany of my colleagues say that it is a terrible deal and won't work, \nwhen we don't even know what it is.\n  It is true that we have a framework. Interestingly enough, many of \nthe same people who are saying this is a terrible deal are the same \npeople who said that the joint plan of action 1\\1/2\\ years ago was \nterrible--a historic mistake. It turned out to be a very important step \ntoward an agreement and essentially froze Iran's nuclear program for \nthe past 18 months.\n  Let's take a deep breath and reserve judgment about whether this is a \ngood deal, a bad deal or something in between until we actually see \nwhat it is and see what is signed. Hopefully, there will be something \nsigned. We don't even know that for sure.\n  Clearly, the framework agreement that was announced a few weeks ago \nis an important step in this process. It gives us some information, but \nit does not give us the all-important detail.\n  First, let's do ``ready, aim, fire,'' not ``ready, fire, aim.'' Let's \nunderstand what it is we are debating and talking about before we fill \nthe airwaves with rhetoric about whether this is a good or bad deal.\n  Second, it has to be a good deal or we should not approve it. If the \ndeal is illusory and structured in such a way that Iran has a clear \npath to the bomb and it would not slow them down, and, in fact, would \nfacilitate it in some way, clearly we should not approve it and it \nshould not be before us.\n  I start with the premise that, A, we should hold our fire until we \nsee what it actually says, and, B, it has to say the right things. It \nhas to affirmatively stall, delay, and prohibit Iran's path to a \nnuclear weapon, and it must be totally verifiable. Ronald Reagan, of \ncourse, said ``Trust, but verify.'' In this case, it is don't trust and \nverify to the nth degree.\n  I will submit that verification is the heart of the agreement, and it \nhas to involve technology and people on the ground. It has to involve \nan openness to inspections that is unprecedented. We have experience \nfrom dealing with North Korea. We had a ``kind of'' agreement with \nNorth Korea which turned out not to be sufficient, and, in fact, they \nmoved toward nuclear weapons by cheating.\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\n  We cannot make that mistake again, and verification is the heart of \nit. It has to be as vigorous and as intrusive as is necessary in order \nto assure us and the world that Iran is not cheating and is not moving \nin any way, shape, or form toward a nuclear weapon.\n  In this regard, I think we are extraordinarily fortunate in this \nmoment of history when this particular negotiation is taking place, in \nthat one of the President's principal advisers, the Secretary of \nEnergy, happens to be a nuclear physicist. I don't know if we have ever \nhad a nuclear physicist in that position before, but he is uniquely \npositioned to understand the details and the implications and the \nalternatives that can help us to assure that this arrangement provides \nthe protection that we believe must be the case.\n  In assessing this arrangement--whatever it is--I start with the \npremise that it has to be solid, verifiable, and meaningful. It cannot \nbe just window dressing. It has to stop Iran's progress toward a bomb \nand create at least a 1-year breakout period so that the other \nalternatives can be exercised if they start moving in that direction. \nIn order to assess that deal, it is imperative that we also assess \nalternatives. We cannot just say: Well, this is good or bad. It has to \nbe, compared to what? There are really only two alternatives that I can \nsee. If we don't make this arrangement, one alternative is more severe \nsanctions--more sanctions. Some people throw that out as if it was \neasy. ``More severe sanctions'' comes ``trippingly on the tongue,'' as \nShakespeare would say.\n  What is missing in this discussion is that we are not the only player \nhere. This is not Barack Obama and the Supreme Leader. This is not the \nUnited States and Iran. This includes five other major countries, \nmembers of the Security Council of the United Nations, major countries \nthat are involved in this whole discussion and negotiation, but most \nimportantly, they are engaged in the sanctions.\n  There is no doubt that our sanctions are important, but it is not \nonly our unilateral sanctions that are necessarily providing all of the \npressure on Iran. In fact, an argument can be made that it is the \nparticipation in sanctions by other countries in the world, not only by \nthe P5+1, but by other countries as well that are not buying Iranian \noil. We have not bought Iranian oil for 35 or 40 years. But people not \nbuying Iranian oil include countries such as China, India, and Japan. \nTheir decisions are contributing to the pressure that has brought Iran \nto the negotiating table.\n  If the world decides this is a sufficient deal and sufficiently \nrestricts Iran and that the verification is as vigorous as it needs to \nbe--if the world decides that and we say, the heck with you, we are \nwalking away, they may say that we have taken that step unilaterally \nand against the best judgment of what this deal means for keeping Iran \nfrom a nuclear weapon. Then the sanctions regime starts to fray, and, \nindeed, it starts to unwind. We can do all we want. We can stomp our \nfeet and do more sanctions, but if the rest of the world is not with \nus, it is not going to be effective.\n  The idea that somehow in this body, in this Congress, in this city we \nunilaterally can make the decision to impose additional sanctions that \nwill bring Iran to its knees when the rest of the world doesn't agree \nwith us is not a valid observation. So it is not so easy to say, oh, \nwell, the alternative here is that if we don't like this deal, we will \njust go to more sanctions.\n\n  Now, if the other members of our negotiating group decide they agree \nwith us that it is not a good deal, then sanctions will continue and, \nindeed, probably strengthen. But I don't think we should feel that we \nhave this kind of unilateral ``the heck with the rest of the world, we \nare going to do this ourselves'' mentality. I think that is a very \nimportant point to understand, that we are part of an international \ncommunity that is negotiating this deal, and what other members of the \ncommunity are doing in the way of sanctions is important, as well as \nour sanctions.\n  Of course, the other alternative is military action. The other \nalternative is some kind of strike. There are various estimates I have \nheard in various forums and settings, but the most common estimate I \nhave heard is that we could destroy their entire atomic infrastructure. \nWe could level the buildings, destroy all the centrifuges, and we would \nset back their nuclear weapons program by 2 to 3 years. But what if we \ndid that? We set it back by 2 to 3 years. We can't erase the knowledge \nthey have. We have simply erased their infrastructure. The \ninfrastructure can be rebuilt, and three things will have changed: No. \n1, they will have the knowledge; No. 2, they will never ever negotiate; \nand No. 3, we will have created enemies of an entire new generation of \nIranian people. We will have alienated those people to the point where \nit will be impossible to negotiate, and we will be in a situation of \nsome kind of military intervention as far as the eye can see.\n  The military option has to be on the table. The President has to \nretain that option, and he has. But I think we have to be realistic \nabout what that option means and the commitment it entails both from us \nand our allies. I am not saying it is off the table. I am not saying it \nwould never happen. But what I am saying is we have to assess the \nnegotiated arrangement in light of the realities of either the \ndeterioration of the sanctions regime or the realities of facing \nmilitary action.\n  Finally, I know that as this debate continues there are going to be a \nseries of amendments and a lot of those amendments are going to be \nappealing. For example, as part of the condition of the deal, Iran \nshall recognize Israel's right to exist or as part of the negotiation \nof the deal, Iran must forswear terrorism or the President has to \ncertify that Iran forswears terrorism. Those are desirable, but they \nwill never happen. Iran will not agree to those. So when we propose an \namendment such as that, what we are really saying is we don't want an \nagreement, because that is never going to be an idea they are going to \naccept.\n  I would submit I think Iran is a mischievous--that is too light a \nword--a dangerous country in terms of exporting terrorism. We see it \nthroughout the region. There is only one scenario worse than an Iran \nthat is attempting to support terrorism and destabilize regimes in the \nregion, and that is an Iran that is supporting terrorism, destabilizing \nthe region, armed with nuclear weapons.\n  We can't solve all the problems in the region with this agreement. \nThe purpose of this agreement is to keep Iran from achieving a nuclear \nweapon. That is what we have to keep our eye on. And if amendments--no \nmatter how desirable, no matter how good they sound, no matter how \npolitically appealing, if those amendments will undercut or effectively \neliminate our ability to keep our eye on the main ball, which is to \nkeep them from having nuclear weapons, those amendments will not serve \nus, our interests, Israel's interests, the Middle East's interests, or \nthe world's interests.\n  We have to focus on what it is we are trying to achieve, and what it \nis we are trying to achieve is incredibly important. A nuclear-armed \nIran is a danger to the region, and it is a danger to the world. Right \nnow, I think it is a very pivotal moment as to whether we are going to \nbe able to achieve a realistic agreement that will make that less \nlikely.\n  Now, it may be that the agreement which we agree to and which goes \ninto place doesn't work. It may be that they cheat. I would submit that \nat that point, we will be right where we are now. We can then talk with \nthe rest of the world about additional sanctions. We do have the \nmilitary option. We are no worse off than we are if we at least try to \nachieve a resolution of this grave issue through diplomacy, \nnegotiation, and working with the rest of the world to try to eliminate \nthis one problem.\n  We are not going to eliminate all the world's problems with this one \narrangement or negotiation, but if we can keep Iran, through this \nprocess, from achieving a nuclear weapon, from aspiring to a nuclear \nweapon, then we will have achieved something important for ourselves, \nfor the future generations not only in the Middle East but in America \nand the world.\n  Before I close, I would like to share my thoughts on the role of \nChairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin in bringing this matter to us \nin a thoughtful, responsible, deliberative\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nway. This is the way the Senate is supposed to work--committee \nconsideration, debate, discussion, review of amendments, and bringing a \nbill to the floor for discussion and debate. I wish to acknowledge the \nwork of the Senator from Tennessee, who has taken this so seriously and \nwho is doing it in the best traditions of this body.\n  I think we are embarking upon an important and solemn project here \nthat can have enormous ramifications for ourselves and for our \nposterity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I think this is a very important \ndebate, very consequential. A nuclear Iran is a global threat to \neveryone everywhere. The world deserves our best effort at stopping \nIran's illicit nuclear program.\n  This does not mean we need to yield to Iran on important points just \nto win vague promises that they will give up their dreams of a nuclear \nweapon. I realize that. President Obama says he understands it would be \nbetter to have no deal than to have a bad deal. I agree with the \nPresident. This legislation is about making sure that any agreement the \nadministration reaches with Iran is truly a good deal.\n  President Obama made it clear that he did not want this bill. He \nfought tooth and nail to make sure this legislation would not succeed, \neven threatened to veto it. The President wanted members of his \nadministration to do all of the negotiating in private. He wanted to \ndecide for himself what is best. Well, that is not how things this \nimportant to our Nation are supposed to work.\n  When the stakes are high, the American people deserve a say. The Vice \nPresident knows that. Back in 2008, Joe Biden was the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. I served under him. He said, ``I \nhave often stated that no foreign policy can be sustained without the \ninformed consent of the American people.'' Well, that informed consent \nincludes allowing Congress to review important foreign policy decisions \nlike any agreement over Iran's nuclear program.\n  Now, I have my concerns about the parts of this deal that have been \nmade public so far. I am also concerned about some of the confusion \nthere seems to be between the White House and the Iranians. There is a \nclear disagreement about the lifting of economic sanctions against \nIran. Iran has said a final deal must remove all of the economic \nsanctions on day No. 1. The administration has said sanctions will be \nlifted in phases and only if Iran complies with different steps along \nthe way.\n  So if a final deal is ever reached, it is going to be very important \nthat we, the American people, have a very clear airing of all of the \nterms and an understanding of really what is in the deal. We need to \nmake sure everyone agrees on what the deal actually says. I believe \nIran is simply not trustworthy and we cannot afford to take chances \nwith something this important.\n  Any agreement must be enforceable, any agreement must be verifiable, \nand any agreement must be accountable. The President has now accepted \nthat he needs to come to Congress and to get the support of the \nAmerican people before he goes to the United Nations. Under the bill, \nthe President must certify a few things every 90 days: He has to \ncertify that Iran is fully implementing the agreement. He has to \ncertify that Iran has not committed a material breach. He needs to \ncertify that Iran has not engaged in any covert action to advance its \nown nuclear weapons program. The President has to confirm to Congress \nthat Iran is playing by the rules.\n  Now, if the President cannot do that, the bill creates an expedited \nprocess for Congress to take action. The way this bill was originally \nwritten, by Republicans and Democrats together, the bill also said \nsomething that many Americans believe is vitally important: It said the \nPresident must certify that Iran was not directly supporting or \ncarrying out an act of terrorism against the United States or against \nan American citizen anywhere in the world.\n  To me, this was a very important part of the original bipartisan \nbill, a bill which had bipartisan support and bipartisan sponsorship. \nDuring the negotiations in the committee, this consequential part of \nthe original bill was removed.\n  Congressional sanctions, I think, have been devastating to Iran's \neconomy. It is what brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first \nplace. Once the sanctions are lifted, Iran will have a lot of money \nthat it did not have before. Now, I do not believe Iran is going to use \nthat money to build schools or hospitals or roads or to improve the \nlives of the people in their country. Iran is going to have access to \ntens of billions if not over $100 billion that it can use to finance \ngroups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\n  Will there be any meaningful part of the final deal that guarantees \nthat they will not use that money to support terrorists? Congress and \nthe American people need to know if Iran is directly supporting acts of \nterrorism against our country and our people. The Iranian nuclear issue \nis absolutely intertwined, in my opinion, with terrorism. The two \ncannot be separated. So during the process of negotiating this bill, \nthis was the only certification requirement that was left out. All the \nother parts stayed in. The critical part about making sure Iran was not \nsupporting terrorism against our country came out. The President didn't \nwant it there. Why wouldn't the President want to tell the American \npeople about the terrorist threats facing our country and our citizens? \nIf Iran is supporting terrorist attacks on Americans, then why would we \ntrust them to keep their word on the nuclear program? So I have \nproposed an amendment that would restore the terrorism certification \nthat was in the original bipartisan bill. That is all.\n  I think it is very important that the American people hear from the \nPresident on this important point. Now, I understand some Senators do \nnot like the idea of the President having to certify something like \nthis. Some people have said that this requirement would compromise the \nability of the United States to continue its negotiations. I disagree. \nMy amendment simply says that if Iran is supporting acts of terrorism \nagainst our Nation and our people, then Congress will have a more \nstreamlined process to address it. It is all very simple.\n  That same process applies to all of the other things that the \nPresident has to certify. Would those other things compromise our \nability to negotiate? This amendment would not get rid of the rest of \nour agreement on Iran's nuclear program, it would just allow a clear \npicture of whom we are dealing with. It would make it easier for \nCongress to act. It does not make it automatic. Congress still has to \ndecide what to do. This just makes it easier.\n  That is what my amendment does. It is not the only thing I would like \nto change in the bill. I hope we can have other amendments as well. It \nis important for Congress and the American people to have their say on \nany final deal. It is just as important that the oversight we provide \nbe meaningful and that Congress state clearly that we will not tolerate \nIran's support of terrorism. If our negotiators reach a final agreement \nwith Iran, I will be giving it very close scrutiny in the Foreign \nRelations Committee and on the floor of the Senate. This is a \nconsequential piece of legislation. It is an important bill, and there \nare ways we can make it even stronger. My amendment is a start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Barrasso for \nhis help in bringing this bill forward. He made valuable contributions \nduring the committee's consideration and the managers' amendment. I \nknow how strongly he feels about the certification issue.\n  I want to point out--I know Senator Barrasso is aware of this--with \nhis help and Senator Corker's help and all of the members' of the \ncommittee, we have added very strong language in this bill that \nrequires the President to\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\nreport to Congress periodically on the status of Iranian activity in \nthe areas he is concerned about.\n  For example, the President must make an assessment of whether any \nIranian financial institutions are engaged in money laundering or \nterrorist finance activity, including names of specific financial \ninstitutions if applicable; Iran's advancements in the ballistic \nprogram, including developments related to its long-range and \nintercontinental ballistic missile program; an assessment of whether \nIran directly supported, financed, planned or carried out an act of \nterrorism against the United States or United States persons anywhere \nin the world; whether and the extent to which Iran supported acts of \nterrorism, including acts of terrorism against the United States or \nUnited States persons anywhere in the world; all actions, including in \ninternational fora, being taken by the United States to stop, counter, \nand condemn acts by Iran to directly or indirectly carry out acts of \nterrorism against the United States and United States persons; the \nimpact on the national security of the United States and the safety of \nU.S. citizens as a result of any Iranian actions reported in this \nparagraph.\n  Then, we require an assessment of whether violations of \ninternationally recognized human rights in Iran have changed, increased \nor decreased, as compared to the prior period.\n  I just point that out because Senator Barrasso raises a very valid \npoint about Congress having information in order to carry out its \nresponsibilities. We made this bill very clear that our interest in \nIran goes well beyond its nuclear weapons program. We are concerned \nabout Iran's sponsorship of terrorism. We are concerned about Iran's \nhuman rights violations. We are concerned about Iran's ballistic \nmissile program. As the framework in the April 2 agreement points out, \nnothing will affect the sanctions that are currently in place as it \nrelates to terrorism, human rights violations or the ballistic missile \nprogram.\n  So I understand the Senator's concerns. I thank him for helping us \ndevelop a bill that I think is well balanced in the area of his \nconcerns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I, too, want to thank the Senator from \nWyoming for his continually constructive role and just the tone in \nwhich he talked about this last issue. I will say that in negotiations \nwith Senator Cardin, we added all kinds of reporting mechanisms. It is \ntrue that the negotiations that are underway have nothing to do with \nalleviating any kinds of terrorist sanctions, human rights sanctions or \nballistic missile testing sanctions. I will just say that should Iran \ncommit an act of terrorism against an American, sanctions would be the \nminimum, I think, they would have to be worried about. I would think \nbombs and missiles on heads would be what they would be concerned \nabout.\n\n  I think we have in place mechanisms that allow us to know these \nthings. I have a feeling that if Iran, again, commits any kind of act \nof terrorism against Americans--which is what is being talked about \nhere--significant kinetic activity would be taking place. Sanctions, to \nme, would be the least of their worries.\n  But I am pleased that we were glad to clear up all of the reporting \nrequirements but also to stipulate, again, that in this particular bill \nwe are talking about the nuclear file, not alleviating sanctions on any \nof the other components.\n  Let me just say, if there is a deal--and this is something I have \ntried to make clear from day one--I hope it is a good deal. I know the \nSenator from Wyoming does too. We know the best route for us is to have \na negotiated good deal.\n  But in the event we end up with a negotiated good deal and sanctions \nare relieved, these four tranches of sanctions that we put in place \nsince 2010 are then available to us to reapply in the event we find \nhuman rights violations, we find ballistic testing is getting out of \nhand or we have terrorist activity, to add again an additional crushing \nblow to the Iranian economy.\n  I thank the Senator for his steadfast concern in this regard. I thank \nhim for the way he works with all of us. I hope we are going to be in a \nprocess very soon to be voting on some amendments. I know we think we \nhave agreed to some language, and hopefully that will begin very soon.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 1109 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. 1112 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Education Reforms\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the ranking \nmember on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on the \noutstanding occurrence last week where the committee, on a 22-to-0 \nvote, voted out the education reforms that are going to affect young \npeople throughout our country. It was a great undertaking, and I think \nit speaks to her willingness to reach across the aisle and to solve \nproblems that matter so much to all of our constituents. I wanted to \nthank her for being here today and for being a part of this debate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If I could just thank the Senator. I was very impressed \nwith the work of Senator Alexander on the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions. He worked with all our members to make \nsure we replace the No Child Left Behind Act--which I think most \nAmericans agree is not working today--with a bipartisan approach. I am \nhopeful we can bring it to the Senate floor and move it through quickly \nbecause this is a law that does need to be fixed.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1150 to Amendment No. 1140\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1150.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just want \nto know which amendment the Senator is calling up. Is this the \namendment that would change this into a treaty obligation?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Johnson], for himself, Mr. \n     Risch, Mr. Toomey, and Mr. Cruz, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1150 to amendment No. 1140.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To declare that any agreement reached by the President \n  relating to the nuclear program of Iran is deemed a treaty that is \n            subject to the advice and consent of the Senate)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATY SUBJECT TO ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE \n                   SENATE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any agreement \n     reached by the President\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\n     with Iran relating to the nuclear program of Iran is deemed \n     to be a treaty that is subject to the requirements of article \n     II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States requiring that the treaty is subject to the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, with two-thirds of Senators \n     concurring.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON SANCTIONS RELIEF.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President \n     may not waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or \n     otherwise limit the application of sanctions under any other \n     provision of law or refrain from applying any such sanctions \n     pursuant to an agreement related to the nuclear program of \n     Iran that includes the United States, commits the United \n     States to take action, or pursuant to which the United States \n     commits or otherwise agrees to take action, regardless of the \n     form it takes, whether a political commitment or otherwise, \n     and regardless of whether it is legally binding or not, \n     including any joint comprehensive plan of action entered into \n     or made between Iran and any other parties, and any \n     additional materials related thereto, including annexes, \n     appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing \n     materials, documents, and guidance, technical or other \n     understandings, and any related agreements, whether entered \n     into or implemented prior to the agreement or to be entered \n     into or implemented in the future, subject to the advice and \n     consent of the Senate as a treaty, receives the concurrence \n     of two thirds of the Senators.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this deal the administration is involved \nin making with Iran has serious implications not only for America's \nlong-term national security but for really the peace and security of \nthe world.\n  It is true that at this point in time, nobody knows what is really in \nthe deal. We certainly have been given a framework in terms of what the \ndeal is supposed to be. But what we do know is that even within that \nframework as has been described to the American public, there are some \nserious discrepancies in terms of the way this administration has \ntypified that framework of the deal and what the Ayatollah in Iran--how \nthey have described that deal.\n  For example, according to our President, the sanctions will only be \nlifted once Iran has complied with major components of the agreement. \nAccording to the Ayatollah, those sanctions will be lifted immediately. \nThat is a big discrepancy.\n  According to this administration, we will have the right to inspect \nto ensure verification and accountability of any agreement. The \nAyatollah disagrees with that. The Ayatollah certainly says there will \nbe no inspections on military sites. If we want to enter into this \nagreement to prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon, surely we \nshould have the right to inspect the military sites.\n  Another pretty serious discrepancy in terms of the administration's \nunderstanding of what this framework is versus the Ayatollah's \nunderstanding, what is going to happen with the 10,000 kilograms of \nenriched uranium? According to this administration, it is going to be \nshipped out of the country, not available for any kind of nuclear \nprogram. According to the Ayatollah, no way; it is going to stay in \nIran.\n  So those are major discrepancies in terms of what this agreement is \nall about, the types of discrepancies that certainly need to be fully \nvetted, and the American people need to understand what that is.\n  There have also been some real deceptions about this agreement. For \nexample, we have heard repeatedly in hearings that this administration \nwill insist that any agreement will ensure that the nuclear program \nwithin Iran will be for peaceful purposes.\n  I have to point out that there is no peaceful purpose for Iran to \nhave nuclear enrichment. If they want peaceful nuclear power, they can \ncertainly do what a number of other countries that have peaceful \nnuclear power have done: They can purchase that uranium fuel, that \nnuclear fuel from outside countries. The only reason Iran would subject \nitself to the sanctions, to the isolation, to the economic harm to its \neconomy and its people, is because it wants nuclear weapons to \nblackmail the region and the world.\n  Of course, this administration talks about snapback of sanctions. \nThat is deceptive because once these sanctions are relaxed, once these \nsanctions are lifted, it will be virtually impossible--once tens of \nbillions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars of investment from the \nWest and from other countries start flowing to Iran, it will be \nimpossible or almost virtually impossible to put those sanctions back \nin place.\n  We have had a sanctions regime going back to--U.N. resolutions dating \nback to 2006. It took years for those sanctions to really take hold, to \nhave the teeth that brought Iran to the bargaining table. \nUnfortunately, in its negotiations, this administration relaxed those \nsanctions and basically acknowledged Iran's right to enrich uranium \nand, in that event, basically lost these negotiations before they ever \nbegan.\n  So there are an awful lot of deceptive typifications about what this \ndeal is and what it won't be and what it will be. The purpose of my \namendments is to bring clarity to what the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act would be and what it is not.\n  I give the chairman and the ranking member of our Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee a great deal of credit for trying to come up with \nsome sort of deal, some sort of law that will give Congress some kind \nof role in this incredibly important deal. But this is not Congress's \nrightful role. This is not what the Framers felt, in article II, \nsection 2 of the Constitution, would be advice and consent. It is far \nfrom it.\n  There are basically three forms of international agreements: There is \na treaty, there is a congressional executive agreement, and then there \nis just an executive agreement. There is really no set criteria of what \nmakes one international agreement a treaty, a congressional executive \nagreement, or an executive agreement. They are considerations. There is \nprecedent. What, in fact, basically is the final determination is how \nthat particular agreement is ratified or approved by Congress or not \napproved by Congress.\n  I believe when we take a look at the considerations in the State \nDepartment's own foreign policy manual, consideration No. 1 is ``the \nextent to which this agreement involves commitments or risks affecting \nthe nation as a whole.'' I would say this agreement with Iran certainly \ninvolves risks that affect our entire Nation.\n  Consideration No. 3 is whether the agreement ``can be given effect \nwithout the enactment of subsequent legislation by the Congress.'' The \nwhole point of this particular act is that we have put sanctions in \nplace by passing laws in Congress, and Congress does realize that we \nhave a role in any lifting of those sanctions.\n  Consideration No. 5 is ``the preference of Congress as to a \nparticular type of agreement.'' Well, there can be some dispute, and \nthat is really at the heart of what my amendments would do, is involve \nCongress in determining what exactly this deal is. Is it a treaty? Is \nit a congressional executive agreement? Is it simply an executive \nagreement that really does not have long-lasting effects?\n  Now, that is really the point of my first amendment. I believe that \nthis is of such importance, that this deal is so important to the \nsecurity of this Nation and to world peace that it rises to the level \nof a treaty. So my amendment simply strikes the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act and replaces it with a simple statement that this Congress \ndeems this agreement with Iran as a treaty.\n  The other thing my amendment does is it removes the waiver authority \nthis Congress granted this President as relates to those sanctions. \nThat would then require this President, upon completion of the deal \nwith Iran, to come to this Congress--as was contemplated by article II, \nsection 2 of the Constitution--for the advice and consent of this body, \nso that 67 Senators would have to vote affirmatively that this is a \ngood deal, that basically the American public would be involved in the \ndecision through their elected representatives. We are not being given \nthat opportunity. The American public is not being given that \nopportunity right now. What is happening right now under this Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act is we have turned advice and consent on \nits head. We have lowered the threshold to what advice and consent \nmeans as relates to this Iran deal.\n  Hopefully we are going to vote--and it sounds as if we will--on this \namendment.\n  I have a second amendment. In case this one does not succeed, I have \na second amendment. If this Congress, this Senate doesn't want to treat \nthis as a treaty, we should at a minimum treat it as a congressional \nexecutive agreement. I am willing to lower that\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\nthreshold under expedited procedures to a simple majority vote of both \nHouses, 50 percent.\n  I contemplated and I had actually written an amendment to really \ndetail what this review act really is--a low-threshold congressional \nexecutive agreement. And when I say ``low threshold,'' I mean that what \nis going to happen here if we pass the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct is we will get a vote of disapproval. If 60 Senators agree this is \na bad deal for America and they disapprove of it, we can pass that \ndisapproval, and then that goes to the President for signature. He can \nveto that. Of course, if he vetoes that, it would take two-thirds of \nthis body to override that veto and two-thirds of the House to override \nthat veto. That requires 67 Senators. If we are unable to muster those \n67 votes to override the veto of our vote of disapproval on a bad deal \nbetween Iran and America, what we, in fact, have done is we have given \n34 Senators the ability to approve that bad deal.\n  When I offered that amendment to the Parliamentarian--that would \nbasically show with real clarity that what this Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act really is, is a very low threshold approval by this body--\nthe Parliamentarian I think very appropriately ruled that amendment out \nof order, unconstitutional. You can't approve something with just 34 \nvotes in the Congress, in the Senate. I think that is my point.\n  I appreciate the fact that we will be able to vote on my amendment \ndeeming this deal between America and Iran a treaty so that the \nAmerican people have the ability to weigh in, to have a say in whether \nthis is important enough to be affirmatively approved--as our \nConstitution contemplated with an international agreement of this \nimportance--be affirmatively approved by 67 Senators, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator for his active \ninvolvement on our Foreign Relations Committee. He is a valuable \nmember, and I appreciate his concern about this issue. I know he \nunderstands that this is an amendment that is likely not to pass. Let \nme tell you why.\n  Four times since 2010, Congress has put in sanctions that most people \nbelieve is what brought Iran to the table--four different tranches. \nThey began in 2010. In almost every one of these cases they have had \nhuge bipartisan support. I know the Senator knows this. But what \nhappened was when those were done--as a matter of fact, this Senator \nthree of those four times voted to give the President a national \nsecurity waiver on the congressionally mandated sanctions. I know the \nSenator knows this as well. We talked about it extensively. I know he \nhas had conversations with the Secretary of State--former Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice, as I have multiple times, and she agrees this \nis an executive agreement. Let me tell you why.\n  The reason it is an executive agreement is right now the President \nhas the ability to go straight to the U.N. Security Council, working \nwith the other members, and alleviate the U.N. Security Council's \nsanctions. Obviously, he has the ability to do that with the Executive \nsanctions that he himself put in place.\n  What Congress has done--and I know the Senator participated because \nhe, too, wanted to make sure we sanctioned Iran to bring them to the \ntable, as we have. But I know this Senator has been here long enough \nthat in three of those times, he gave--he gave--the President the \nunilateral ability to waive these sanctions.\n  I was very concerned about this and wrote a letter to the President \nabout 2 months ago asking how he planned to do this. The President--\nobviously, I got a response from the Chief of Staff, and they made it \nvery clear. They plan to go straight to the U.N. Security Council, and \nit is my understanding that what they plan to do is use something \ncalled a nonbinding political commitment--that is what they plan to do \nwith Iran if they come to an agreement--and then have that endorsed by \nthe U.N. Security Council.\n  While I very much appreciate the sentiment of the Senator--whom I \nlove working with and I am glad we have a businessman of his caliber \nhere--I think he knows that what we are actually doing here is \nsomething that is unprecedented; that is, that we are taking back from \nthe President authority that has already been given to him, causing him \nto have to bring this agreement to us. I know it is not to the level he \nwould like--candidly, not to the level I would like. I agree with that.\n  Let me say this: We know that in the event that this amendment were \nto pass, it would be vetoed and, therefore, it is a substitute for the \nbill that is before us. So what that would mean is no limitation would \nbe on the President's use of waivers to suspend sanctions that we put \nin place, no requirement that Congress receive the deal at all, never \nmind the classified annexes that we all know are a big part of this \nand, by the way, the American people are never going to see.\n  Without the bill that is on the floor, the American people will never \nsee it. We will see it on their behalf because we believe that on \nbehalf of the American people, somebody should go through this bill and \nthis deal in detail, if there is a deal reached. There will be no \nreview period for Congress to see the deal and vote before it is \nimplemented, no requirement that the President certify that Iran is \ncomplying, no mechanism for Congress to rapidly reimpose the sanctions, \nand no reporting on Iran's support for terrorism, ballistic missile \ndevelopment, and human rights violations.\n  Now, look, if I could wave a magic wand or all of a sudden donkeys \nflew around the Capitol, I would love for us to have the ability to \ndeem this a treaty. I really would. I think the Senator knows I mean \nthat. I would love for us to have to affirmatively approve this. But \nunfortunately, a lot of us are article II folks, and we think the \nPresident has the ability to negotiate things. We had no idea this \nPresident would consider suspending these sanctions ad infinitum \nforever--no idea. I think even people on this side of the aisle were \nshocked. As a matter of fact, Tim Kaine, thankfully, in a meeting where \nSecretary Kerry--I am sorry, was being one tick too cute at one of our \nhearings--said: You are going to have the right to vote on it. Of \ncourse, what he meant was 5 years down the road, 6 years down the road, \nafter the sanctions regime has been eliminated.\n  Look, I have strong agreement with the sentiment of our Senator from \nWisconsin, somebody I love serving with, but let's not let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good. Let's ensure that we have the ability to see \nthe details of this deal that it lays before us, that the clock doesn't \nstart until we get all of the classified annexes on behalf of the \nAmerican people, some of whom are here in the Gallery watching this. On \ntheir behalf, we have the ability to see what is in this.\n  By the way, if we don't like it, yes, there is a large hurdle in the \nSenate. We know the way the Senate operates. We have to have a 60-vote \nthreshold. In the House, it is a simple majority. It is a simple \nmajority in the House.\n  Look, I agree with the sentiment. This is one of the biggest \ngeopolitical issues that will potentially happen if an agreement is \nreached in our lifetime here in the Senate. I hope people, in spite of \nthe fact that I agree with the sentiment, will vote against the Johnson \namendment when it comes to the floor and make sure we can pass the bill \nthat is before us so that on behalf of the American people, we have the \nopportunity to see it, to weigh in. By the way, one of the things that \nis very important, that lives beyond--lives beyond--is that every 90 \ndays the President is having to comply that Iran is--or is having to \ncertify that Iran is complying with the agreement.\n  Again, I thank the Senator. I appreciate his sentiments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I see that the distinguished minority leader is here on the floor. My \nsense is he has something to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said on a number of occasions, and I \nhave told the Senators, but not with both of them present, how much I \nadmire their legislative skills. What they have brought to the Senate \nis a work of art. I will always be amazed at how they were able to \naccomplish this 19 to 0 coming out of that committee.\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\n  As I said earlier today, I hope we can preserve the structure of this \ngreat piece of legislation that the two fine Senators were able to come \nup with.\n\n\n                          Opportunity and Hope\n\n  Mr. President, on another subject, we are all saddened by what we \nhave witnessed unfold in the streets of Baltimore. A man is dead who \nshould not be dead. His name was Freddie Gray. Freddie Gray's name will \nnot be forgotten.\n  This young man's death is the latest in a series of disturbing and \nunnecessary deaths of young men of color at the hands of police and \nvigilantes. To be clear, violence is never acceptable in any regard. It \nis never an acceptable response, even in tragedies such as these.\n  The rioting and looting we are seeing on the streets of Baltimore \nwill only further damage a community in a great American city that is \nalready hurting. We should not let the violence perpetrated by a few \nbecome an excuse to ignore the underlying problem: that millions of \nAmericans feel powerless in the face of a system that is rigged against \nthem.\n  It is easy to feel powerless when you see the rich getting richer, \nthe poor getting poorer. The opportunities to build a better life for \nyourself and your family are nonexistent, nonexistent in your \ncommunity. It is easy to feel devalued when schools in your community \nare failing. It is easy to believe the system is rigged against you \nwhen you spend years watching what President Obama called ``a slow-\nrolling crisis'' of troubling police interactions with people of color.\n  No American should ever feel powerless--no American. No American \nshould ever feel their life is not valued, but that is what our system \nsays to many of our fellow citizens. No American should be denied the \nopportunity to better their lives through their own hard work, but that \nis a reality too many face.\n  In a nation that prides itself on being a land of opportunity, \nmillions--not thousands, millions--of our fellow citizens live every \nday with little hope of building a better future no matter how hard \nthey try.\n  We cannot condone the violence we see in Baltimore, but we must not \nignore the despair and hopelessness that gives rise to the claim of \nviolence. This is not just about inner cities. This is about the deep, \ncrushing poverty that infects rural and suburban communities across our \ngreat country.\n  It does not matter if you live in Searchlight, NV, or the \nmetropolitan Las Vegas area--which is now more than 2 million people--\nor in Baltimore, rural America, when there is no hope, anger and \ndespair move in. That is the way it is. We cannot ignore that. So let's \ncondemn the violence, but let's not ignore the underlying problem.\n  Let's not pretend the system is fair. Let's not pretend everything is \nOK. Let's not pretend the path from poverty--like the one I traveled--\nis still available to everyone out there as long as they work hard \nbecause it is not.\n  For hard work to bear fruit, there must be opportunity and there must \nbe hope.\n  I cannot imagine what direction my life would have taken without the \nhope of the American dream. As a little boy I had that. As a teenager I \nhad it. I had it in college. So instead of turning a blind eye, let's \nwork together and take the problem seriously.\n  There is bipartisan work being done on criminal justice, and that is \na good start. We need criminal justice reform. That is a good start, \nbut it is only a start. Ensuring that populations are not unfairly \ntargeted for incarceration will be a positive step, a real positive \nstep. But we also need to be investing in inner cities and rural areas \nand ensuring that jobs and training and educational opportunities are \navailable where they are needed the most.\n  Looking out at the year ahead, the only piece of legislation I see on \nthe agenda that does anything to create jobs is the surface \ntransportation bill. There is nothing else. Look around. That is not \nenough. We need to do more. It is up to us in this Capitol to create \nthese jobs. Democrats and Republicans must work together to make sure \nAmericans have a right to succeed and America continues to be a land of \nopportunity for all of our citizens, not some of our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first thank Leader Reid for his \ncomments about the circumstances in Baltimore. I spoke a little bit \nearlier today about Baltimore. It is my home city, the city I love. It \nis a people I love. We are really hurting from what happened. I \nappreciate the leader's comments about it.\n  We are going to get through this, we are going to restore order in \nBaltimore, and there will be justice for Freddie Gray. We are all going \nto work together. I appreciate the outreach we have received from the \nWhite House and from the Federal and State in helping Baltimore restore \nthe order in our city.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to respond very briefly. I see Senator \nIsakson is here. I will not take too much more of his time. Let me \nrespond briefly in support of Senator Corker's concerns concerning \nSenator Johnson's amendment. I oppose that amendment.\n  The determination of a treaty is an Executive decision. The \nratification of a treaty is a legislative decision. When we go through \ntreaty negotiations and ratification, we delegate legislative \nauthority. It would then be up to a different entity to make decisions.\n  I know my colleagues are very concerned about treaty obligations and \nthe ratification of treaties. This clearly would raise some \nconstitutional issues with this type of legislation.\n  Let me just give you the practical problem we have here. In 2012, we \nentered into a treaty for disabilities. I don't believe it is \ncontroversial at all. It does not change any of our laws. We have not \nacted on that yet.\n  In 1994, the United States entered into a treaty with the Law of the \nSeas. Most countries have ratified that treaty, not the United States. \nThat was 1994. So now if Senator Johnson's amendment became law, the \nPresident would have no authority to implement this agreement because \nthe waiver authorities will be gone and it would require ratification \nto move forward. We cannot pass a disability treaty in this body. We \ncan't even pass a tax treaty in this body.\n  It would be beyond belief that this really would allow us to move \nforward with a negotiation with Iran. This is what we call a poison \npill. It would prevent this bill--one of a couple of things. This bill \nwould not become law. It would not pass or it would be vetoed by the \nPresident, and he would not override the veto. If it became law, it \nwould kill negotiations. There would be no negotiations. The United \nStates would be isolated because our negotiating partners would be \nwondering why we are withdrawing from the negotiations, not Iran. The \nUnited States would be isolated.\n  And the final line, it would make it more likely, not less likely, \nthat Iran will become a nuclear weapon state. That is why Senator \nCorker and I strongly oppose Senator Johnson's amendment. At the \nappropriate time, we will be asking our colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n            Thoughts and Prayers for the People of Baltimore\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. First, Mr. President, to Senator Cardin, the people of \nMaryland and Senator Mikulski, on behalf of the people of Georgia, our \nprayers and sympathy go to your great State in a time of trouble. \nAnytime there is violence in a city in America, whether it is Atlanta \nor whether it is Baltimore, whether it is Washington, whether it is Los \nAngeles, it is a problem for all of us. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith the people of Baltimore, and we hope that peace returns as quickly \nas possible.\n\n  My purpose in rising is to first talk about the deal that is before \nus in terms of the congressional review act, in terms of the Iranian \ndeal that is being negotiated by the President.\n  I thank the ranking member, Senator Cardin, and the previous ranking \nmember, Senator Menendez, for their hard work, and I thank Senator \nCorker for his leadership as chairman.\n  This is a most important deal. As a politician, when I travel in my \nState, I have two great tests that I use to understand the veracity of \na deal. The first is the tear test, and second is the nod test.\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\n  Sunday night, I attended a celebration of the 67th anniversary of the \nindependence of the State of Israel, which was at a synagogue in \nAtlanta, GA. I was asked to speak. In my speech I said: One thing you \ncan count on for sure is that I thank God for the nation of Israel and \nfor the fact that in 1948 it found a home. Equally, I thank God for the \nfact that I serve in the Senate.\n  I will have a vote over the congressional review of any deal made \nwith Iran, and I promise the people of Israel that no deal with the \nIranians will be mentioned or agreed to as long as I have anything to \nsay about it as long as the people of Israel are not respected, \nprotected, and honored not only by us but the people of Iran as well. \nThat is essential to me, and I think this congressional review act \ngives us the opportunity to do that. A tear came out of Rabbi Bortz's \neye. She thanked me for looking out for the people of Israel and \nthanked me for the United States being their friend.\n  The nod factor happened to me on the previous Sunday when I spoke to \nthe Association of County Commissioners in Savannah, GA. When I stood \nup for that speech, it was supposed to be about local government, \ntrade, zoning, and land use. Instead, I opened up by saying: I want \neverybody in the audience to know whether you have an interest or not \nin the Iranian nuclear deal that is being negotiated by the President, \nI, as your Senator, promise that there will be no deal unless there is \ncongressional oversight, congressional review, and a congressional \nvote. The nods went all through the audience.\n  There were farmers and county commissioners from all over the State. \nThis is an issue you would think would be removed from them, but it is \nnot. For the people of Georgia this is a primary issue for our country \nand our security, and it is so for a very good reason. The Iranians \nhave not proven to be very trustworthy with their negotiations in the \npast.\n  I thank Senator Cardin and Senator Corker for their agreement to put \nlanguage in this bill that reports the sense of the Senate in terms of \nthe value of the hostages that were held by the Iranian Government in \n1979 and 1980.\n  A lot of people have forgotten what happened in 1979. In 1979, the \nIranian troops jumped on the American Embassy in downtown Tehran. They \ncaptured 52 American diplomats, held them for 444 days, beat them, \ntortured them, and harassed them. They finally let them go shortly \nbefore the swearing in of Ronald Reagan as President of the United \nStates. When they did, President Carter negotiated the Algerian \nAccords, which said that the Iranians would release these hostages but \nthey would not be held accountable to pay those hostages any \nreparations. We negotiated away from them what almost every other \nhostage has ever received; and that is reparations from their captives.\n  In the committee, I introduced sense of the Senate legislation that \nsays the Iranians should pay and the sanctions money that was paid \nunder the previous sanctions bill that is now in place should be used \nto pay those hostages and their families and the survivors. Forty-four \nof them are left. Some have committed suicide and some have died of \nnatural causes. But all of them were tortured, beaten, and badly abused \nin 1979 and 1980. We owe it to those Americans to look out for them and \nto make sure they are compensated, and it should come from the money \nthat would have gone to the Iranians that was taken in the penalties \nfor doing business with Iran under the sanctions legislation.\n  Senator Corker and Senator Cardin have done an outstanding job. They \nhave crafted legislation that not only represents the best interest of \nthe country of the United States but also the best interest of our \npeople. I want everybody to understand one thing loud and clear. You \ncan call it an Executive order, you can call it a treaty, you can call \nit a wink and nod. It is the single most important vote that any Member \nof this Senate is going to take in a long, long time because this one \nis for all the marbles.\n  A nuclear-armed Iran is a danger not just to the Middle East but to \nthe peace and security of the entire world. Giving the Senate and House \noversight on this agreement is absolutely essential to the American \npeople so they know that they have oversight. We are the eyes, we are \nthe ears, and we are the conscience of the people we represent.\n  I can tell you from the winking and nodding theory that I have, and \nfrom the tears that I saw shed by the people of Israel Sunday night, \nthis treaty is important to the United States of America, it is \nimportant to the world, and it is important to see to it that the \ncongressional review action takes place and this bill passes.\n  I commend Senator Corker for his leadership, and I commend Senator \nCardin and Senator Menendez, the previous ranking member, for the work \nthey did to see to it that this happens.\n\n\n                       Trade Promotion Authority\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee met until about 11 p.m. \nlast Thursday night. We passed TPA, trade promotion authority. Get \nthis, the President of the United States has asked for it. The Senate \nCommittee on Finance voted 20 to 6 to pass it, and it is coming to the \nSenate floor soon. It will promote trade and give the President the \nauthority to negotiate trade deals. And the Senate has the authority to \napprove them up or down. It will send a signal to the rest of the world \nthat we are open for business in America.\n  When I first came to the Congress in 1999, one of my first votes was \nfast-track for President Clinton, a Democratic President. As I served \nin the House, I later voted for President Bush to have TPA. I will vote \nfor TPA for President Obama because it is in America's best interest.\n  Trade should not be, nor is it ever intended to be, a partisan issue. \nIt is about the well-being and the jobs of the American people.\n  A lot of us talk about managing expenses through cutting expenses and \na lot of us talk about raising our revenue to pay for expenses. Raising \nprosperity for the American people is the best way to raise their \nrevenue and raise their hope and opportunity. This bill does exactly \nthat. Fast-track promotes American agriculture, American manufacturing, \nand American innovation.\n  In 2007, I went to the nation of India with Mike Enzi and Lamar \nAlexander, two members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. We went to follow up on a book written by Tom Friedman \ncalled ``The World is Flat.'' It was all about the jobs that were being \ntaken away from America by the Indian people because of the ability to \nuse the computer, the change in time zones, and to fill American \nemployment and put help desks overseas in India.\n  A lot of people rose up against the jobs going to India, and they \nsent us over there to find what was happening. One of the things we did \nin India was visit Mr. Murthy, the president of Infosys. Infosys is the \nlargest market cap from India on the NASDAQ in America. It is a \ntremendous success story. It is a high-tech engineering and technology \ncompany.\n  In the boardroom of Infosys, we asked this question: Mr. Murthy, the \nAmerican people ask us, as Members of the Senate, why is it that all of \nour jobs are going to India? He answered very quickly. He said: Mr. \nIsakson, I will tell you this. When I started my company 20 years ago, \nI drove an Indian car, drank an Indian soft drink, and banked with the \nBank of India. Today, I drink Coca-Cola, I drive a Ford, and I bank \nwith the Bank of America.\n  That is what doing business with the world does. It opens up \nopportunities. That is what trade promotion authority is going to do \nfor America. It will open up opportunities for the American people. It \nwill expand trade and opportunity. It will empower us through jobs and \nwork.\n  We should make sure that trade never becomes a partisan issue, and \nthat when we vote, we have a bipartisan vote to pass trade promotion \nauthority for the President and for the best interest of our people.\n  We should remember this. We should never choose isolation over \ninnovation. Trade promotion is innovation. We should never fear \ncompetition. We should always see that competition is rewarded by hard \nwork, and we should never cower in fear of those who compete with us. \nWe should always be the leader we have always been in terms of American \ntechnology, ingenuity, and trade.\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\n  Trade promotion authority is good for America, good for the world, \ngood for this country, good for the economy of the United States, and \ngood for middle-class America. It promotes manufacturing and jobs \naround this country.\n  Lastly, there are those who fear it might prompt immigration \nincreases. This bill gives the Congress the authority to override any \nchange in the law that is current in the United States made by the \nPresident in any trade deal. So immigration will not be expanded, and \nit will not be broadened. The President will be given no more \nauthority, but instead, America will be going to the trade table, \nmaking deals, raising prosperity, not through higher taxes but through \nhigher engagement, more jobs, and better work.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I commend Senator Isakson for always \nplaying such a constructive role. I know he played a big role on the \nTPA issue, which is, as he mentioned, very important. I know from a \ngeopolitical balance standpoint, it is very, very important for us to \nbe able to consummate the TPA arrangement.\n  I also thank him for the constructive role he always plays on foreign \nrelations. For a couple of year he was off the committee, and we missed \nhim greatly. We are glad to have him back and very much appreciate his \nsupport of not only the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act but his \nconstant and vigilant effort to ensure that people who have not been \ncompensated properly end up being compensated properly.\n  I look forward to the markup of his bill in the committee. I thank \nhim for consistently and steadfastly pursuing this issue and, again, \nfor the many constructive ways in which he works to cause this body to \nfunction in a productive manner.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1155 to amendment No. 1140\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1155.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, is this \nthe amendment that deals with the report date?\n  Mr. BLUNT. It is.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Blunt] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1155 to amendment No. 1140.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To extend the requirement for annual Department of Defense \n                 reports on the military power of Iran)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF ANNUAL DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE REPORTS ON \n                   THE MILITARY POWER OF IRAN.\n\n       Section 1245(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2542), as \n     amended by section 1277 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \n     ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291), is further amended by \n     striking ``December 31, 2016'' and inserting ``December 31, \n     2026''.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am pleased to call up this amendment. \nThis amendment extends what would now be a sunset on the Department of \nDefense annual report on the military power of Iran and adds another 10 \nyears to that annual reporting date. Currently, the law would end that \nannual report in December of 2016. This amendment would extend the \nreporting time until December 2026.\n  I think this amendment sends a message to the American people that \nCongress understands the lengths that Iran's military is willing to go \nto promote instability around the world. Pentagon officials today \nreported that the United States is monitoring the seizure by Iran of a \nMarshall Islands-flagged cargo ship which was reportedly moving through \nthe Straits of Hormuz. Iranian patrol vessels fired warning shots \nacross the bow of the boat.\n  Just yesterday, it was reported by Politico that the commander of \nIran's ground forces was of the opinion that America was behind the \nattacks on \n9/11. We currently see Iran's deadly influence in a negative way into \nother countries, including Yemen, Iraq, and other countries. I think we \nneed to continue to monitor the military strength and the military \ncapacity of Iran. This annual Department of Defense assessment of \nIran's increasingly destabilizing military is possibly more important \neven now than it was when these reports started.\n  Every year, the Department of Defense provides Congress with a review \nof Iran's military. There is no reason this report should expire at the \nend of 2016. This commonsense amendment extends the sunset on this \nannual report we have been having through December of 2026.\n  I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I see the Senator from Pennsylvania, my \nold friend Mr. Toomey, standing up like he wants to offer something. \nThere are a couple of us who want to have a colloquy for a few minutes, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Blumenthal and myself, on an issue involving \nveterans and veterans' financial assistance for school.\n  I do not want to get in the way of Senator Toomey if he has something \nhe wants to offer, just as long as it does not take forever. May I ask \na question through the Presiding Officer? What do you think he has to \noffer and for how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would direct the question to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I would assure the Presiding Officer, \nfor the purpose of passing on to any interested Senators, that I, in \nfact, would not take forever. In fact, I think I can do this in--it \nprobably will take 15 or 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would just ask the Senator, if he could take closer to \n15, that would be great.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to address two issues this \nafternoon. The first is amendment No. 1190. I will be as quick as I can \non this because I want to spend more time dealing with the Johnson \namendment, which I also will address.\n  Amendment No. 1190 arises because of the very unusual procedural \ncircumstances we find ourselves in. As the Presiding Officer probably \nknows very well, for technical procedural reasons, the Senate has \nchosen to conduct a debate about the Corker-Cardin bill, the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act, on a House legislative vehicle that was \nsent over to us. But in order to do this, all of the language from the \nHouse bill gets stripped out and it goes away.\n  That original House bill, H.R. 1191, was the Protecting Volunteer \nFirefighters and Emergency Responders Act. I want to talk a little bit \nabout it. But here is my amendment. It is pretty simple. I just want to \nrestore the language from that House-passed vehicle. It is pretty \nsimple. I do not think it is controversial.\n  Let me just sum up what this is about. This is a bill that was \noffered in the House by Congressman Lou Barletta from Pennsylvania. It \nis a bill that would protect volunteer firefighters from some \nunintended consequences of ObamaCare. More specifically, it exempts \nvolunteer firefighters from counting toward the trigger for the \nemployer mandate.\n  I do not think it was ever intended that volunteer firefighters would \nbe counted this way, but nonetheless the danger arises because of an \nIRS ruling.\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nSo the IRS issued a guidance back in 2013 that suggested that volunteer \nfirefighters would have to count any benefits they got as income.\n  It raises the question of whether they would be counted toward the \nObamaCare limit. They have gone back and forth. They have issued a \nruling that says volunteer firefighters would not be counted toward \ntriggering the number of employees that invokes ObamaCare, but that is \njust an administrative ruling at this point. It could change at any \npoint in time.\n  If it were to change, and if every volunteer fire department in \nAmerica that had 50 or more volunteer firefighters had to be deemed to \nbe an employer requiring full ObamaCare coverage, I dare say it would \nput out of business virtually every volunteer fire department in \nAmerica because none of these volunteer fire departments have the kind \nof money it would take to go out and buy health care for those \nvolunteer firefighters, nor was ObamaCare ever intended to cover these \nfolks.\n  This would be a huge problem, particularly in Pennsylvania where we \nhave 2,400 volunteer fire departments, more than any other State in the \nUnion, and we have over 50,000 volunteers in Pennsylvania alone, but \nthere are over 750,000 nationally. So, as I said, the IRS did give us a \nruling that, for now, they will not deem volunteer firefighters to be \nemployees for the purpose of triggering ObamaCare mandates.\n  But I would like--and I am not the only one who would like to have \nthis codified in law so this danger goes away so volunteer fire \ndepartments can continue to thrive. This passed the House unanimously. \nThere is bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. My \nunderstanding is there is no opposition from either of them to this \namendment, which is very straightforward.\n  I would be delighted with a voice vote when the time is appropriate \nfor that. I would be very grateful. I have said my piece about the \nvolunteer firefighters, but I do think it is a great opportunity to get \nthis taken care of.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1150\n\n  What I would like to address, though, is the incredibly important \ndebate that we are having now about the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct. Now, let me state very clearly, I think the underlying bill that \nSenators Corker and Cardin have produced is a very important good-faith \neffort to give Congress some say in something Congress absolutely \nshould have a say in.\n  But I do think there is an underlying problem with the bill. The \nunderlying problem with the bill is that the reality is, at the end of \nthe day, an agreement announced by the President with Iran, should that \ncome to pass, could be opposed by a majority of Senators--it could be \nopposed by a big majority of Senators and it would still go into \neffect, despite the provisions in this underlying bill.\n  Specifically, why I say that is, in the first place, in order to \nprevent the congressionally authorized sanctions from being waived, we \nwould need to pass a resolution of disapproval. That takes 60 votes in \nthe Senate. So any 41 Senators could prevent that from taking place and \nthen the deal goes forward, the sanctions get lifted.\n  If we have a supermajority, more than 60, and we could pass this \nlegislation and send to it the President, he could veto it. Then it \nwould take 67 votes to override the President's veto. So the math is \npretty clear. Any 34 Senators in support of the agreement could permit \nthe agreement to go ahead, while 66 Senators could oppose the agreement \nand yet it would take place. It seems to me that this turns an \nimportant part of the Constitution on its head, and that is article II, \nsection 2 that says: The President ``shall have Power, by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds \nof the Senators present concur.''\n  So, in my view, this certainly ought to be deemed to be a treaty \nbecause it rises to that level of importance. A treaty, generally \ndefined, is an agreement through negotiations signed by nations. I \nthink that is what we are talking about here. Certainly something of \nthis enormous importance as arguably the most dangerous regime in the \nworld on a path that might very well enable them to obtain the most \ndangerous weapon in the world, it is hard to imagine things that are \nmuch more important than that.\n  So I think it certainly ought to rise to the level of a treaty. We \nroutinely treat matters of much lesser import as treaties. This is not \njust sort of an abstract, theoretical question of Presidential \nauthority. There are very specific, very real consequences. It is my \nview that we are on a path toward a very bad, very dangerous deal. The \nonly way I can think of that we change the path we are on is if there \nis a plausible, credible possibility for Congress to stop this, which \nwould then cause these negotiations to change their course, which is \nwhat I think has to happen to avoid a very dangerous outcome.\n  Let me be clear. My goal is not to kill any deal, my goal is to get a \ngood deal, one that provides for the security and safety our country \nneeds.\n  I do not think that is the direction we are on right now. Let me \nexplain a few of the reasons why. I guess the simple summary was very \naptly put by the Prime Minister of Israel when he spoke to the joint \nsession of Congress and he said: The problem with this deal is that it \nwould not block Iran's path to a bomb, it paves it. That is exactly \nwhat I am concerned about, ultimately.\n  Let me explain why I am concerned about that. I see three big \ncategories of reasons; first, the administration has already made too \nmany concessions; second, the Iranian regime is a regime we cannot \ntrust; third, while the administration says don't worry, you don't need \nto trust them because we can verify and enforce this agreement and, \nboy, if they step out of line, we will snap those sanctions back in a \nheartbeat, that is a fantasy. I do not see that working. Let me explain \nthese three categories.\n  With respect to the concessions, first, we ought to be concerned, I \nthink, about the concessions that were made before the negotiations \neven began--the concessions that we wouldn't even address, the ongoing \nballistic missile program that the Iranians continued to pursue and \nmake ever more sophisticated.\n  We wouldn't address their active, ongoing support for terrorist \norganizations throughout the Middle East and around the world. That \nwouldn't be on the table.\n  We wouldn't address their open declarations that they want to wipe \nIsrael off of planet Earth.\n  These things were permitted just to be set aside. That is a very \nmajor round of concessions before we ever got to the table.\n  My next concern is the way the administration has been moving the \ngoalpost throughout these discussions. The initial goal stated by the \nPresident in the fall of 2013 was to ensure that Iran would not have a \nnuclear bomb. That was the right goal. The only problem is that is not \nthe goal anymore.\n  Now the goal is, according to the administration, that we would have \nabout 12 month's notice if the Iranians decide to develop and deploy \nnuclear weapons. That is a huge, huge concession, and, I think, a very \ndangerous one.\n  Finally--and maybe the most disturbing concession--it seems to me \nthat the framework of this deal, as it has been described by the \nadministration, allows Iran to retain a nuclear infrastructure--\nactually, an industrial-scale nuclear infrastructure, with the \nunderground facility at Fordow and the plutonium reactor Arak--\nthousands of centrifuges for a country that doesn't need a single \ncentrifuge.\n  If their intended purpose really is just to have peaceful nuclear \nenergy, they don't need a single centrifuge. They can buy enriched \nuranium. They don't need to have the domestic capability of enriching \ncentrifuges. But it has already been conceded that they will have \nthousands.\n  None of this, by the way, is going to be destroyed. Anything that is \ndeactivated is locked away, but it is still there.\n  Frankly, I am worried about the next round of concessions. If you \nlistened, as I have, to the way the administration has described the \nframework of this agreement, and then you listened to how the Iranians \nhave described it, there are some huge divergencies there. For \ninstance, with respect to the sanctions, the administration has said \nthat the sanctions would be lifted gradually, only as and when the \nIranians comply with the terms of agreement.\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\n  The Iranians have said: Absolutely not. The sanctions get lifted \nimmediately upon execution of the agreement.\n  And on inspections, this essential part of the enforcement mechanism, \nthe administration has said: We will have the ability to inspect \nanytime, anywhere.\n  The Iranians have said: No, you won't. You will only do inspections \nby permission, and military sites are off limits all together.\n  I think this is a very disturbing range of concessions that have \nalready been made, and the deal is not finished yet.\n  The second point I make is that we can't trust this regime. I just \nthink that is abundantly obvious. I think it is very clear that they \nhave not reached the decision as a nation that they want to abandon \ntheir quest for a nuclear weapon. I don't think they have.\n  And, if you look at their behavior, they have been killing Americans \nsince 1979, including nearly 1,500 U.S. soldiers in Iraq with the \nsophisticated IEDs they make.\n  Iran is the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. They are \npromoting radical Islam in many places in the Middle East. They \nrecently were plotting to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador by a bomb \nplanted in a DC restaurant.\n  They have repeatedly declared their intention to wipe Israel off the \nmap, and they have a history of cheating on agreements and violating \nU.N. resolutions. Why do we think this time would be different?\n  Well, as I said, the administration says: Don't worry. You don't have \nto trust. We will have verification, enforcement, and snapback \nsanctions.\n  Well, I don't think that is realistic at all. But it is not only my \nview. Henry Kissinger and George Shultz wrote, I thought, a very \nimportant essay about this. They mention, among other things, the \ndifficulty we are probably going to have in even discovering that \ncheating is going on. I quote from the Kissinger-Shultz article. They \nsay: ``In a large country with multiple facilities and ample experience \nin nuclear concealment, violations will be inherently difficult to \ndetect.''\n  Not only that, it looks like we are, in a way, subbing out the \nendorsement to the U.N.--populated, I might remind my colleagues, by \ncountries that are often not terribly friendly to the United States. \nThere we will have the challenge of proving violations that we do \ndiscover, proving that they are, in fact, violations. Again, Kissinger \nand Shultz point out that when cheating or a breakout occurs, it is \nunlikely to be a ``clear-cut event.'' Rather, it is likely to be ``the \ngradual accumulation of ambiguous evasions.''\n  So we discover these ambiguous evasions, and what do we do? We have \nto go to the U.N. and convince them. I suspect the Iranians will deny \nthem. And how long will this process go on while this is adjudicated \nand while the Iranians remain in violation? And what are our chances \nthat we will eventually convince the people we need to convince at the \nU.N. that we are right and they are wrong?\n  But even if we are successful in all of this, the administration \nsays: Well, that is when we will just snap the sanctions right back in \nplace.\n  How can that even be a serious notion when the sanctions regime is \ncrumbling right now? I mean, it is already crumbling. The Russians are \nselling air defense systems now to the Iranians.\n  Why is the President so reluctant to have Congress have a role in \nthis, in any case? If the President can make the case that America will \nbe more secure as a result of this agreement, he should be able to \nconvince the American public and the Senate, get the votes, and then he \nwould have a much more enduring agreement.\n  A treaty is binding indefinitely, and it would have the approval of \nCongress. It wouldn't have the temporary nature of the executive \nagreement.\n  I think it is our responsibility that we have to uphold the \nConstitution. It is our responsibility that we have to maximize the \nsafety of the American people to the extent we can. So I hope my \ncolleagues will support the Johnson amendment, which will simply deem \nthis agreement to be a treaty and require the two-thirds vote for \nratification that a treaty requires.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, if I could respond, just briefly, I know \nthere are speakers who would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his amendment. \nMy sense is that over the course this debate, there will be a pathway \nforward.\n  Secondly, I thank him for cosponsoring the legislation that is before \nus.\n  As to deeming it a treaty, I wish to point out that the Senator has \nbeen in the Senate almost 6 years, which leads me to believe that at on \nat least three occasions, the Senator has already voted to give the \nPresident unilateral ability to implement this by a national security \nwaiver. That is why this now is an executive agreement. And I think \neveryone here knows that what the President plans to do is to take what \nSenator Toomey and others have granted to him--a national security \nwaiver--and go directly to the U.N. Security Council and, therefore--as \na matter of fact, if we had not granted that security waiver, it would \ntake a majority of people here to lift that. However, in putting these \nsanctions in place, all of us who put these four tranches of sanctions \nin place since 2000 have granted the President a national security \nwaiver.\n  In a letter in response to me, the Chief of Staff made it clear that \nthey plan to go straight to the U.N. Security Council with this waiver \nin hand. They plan to waive these sanctions ad infinitum way down the \nroad. Secretary Kerry has testified to us that maybe 5 years down the \nroad, after the sanctions regime has totally dissipated, we would have \nthe ability to vote. So my sense is that I agree with the sentiment \nthat is being laid out.\n  I just wish to say again, if the Johnson amendment were to pass, \nultimately this bill would not pass. Let me just say there would be no \nlimitation on the President's use of waivers to suspend sanctions that \nwe put in place, which brought them to the table, and no requirement \nthat Congress receive the deal at all--never mind the classified \nannexes that go with it--no review period for Congress to seal the deal \nand vote before it is implemented, no requirement that the President \ncertify Iran is complying, no mechanism for Congress to rapidly \nreimpose sanctions, and no reporting on Iran support for terrorism, \nballistic missile development, and human rights violations.\n  So my sentiment is with the Senator. I hope his amendment will very \nsoon become law, and I appreciate his diligence there.\n  I think he understands that this body, in putting the sanctions in \nplace, gave the President the ability to do this unilaterally. What \nthis bill does is to take back some of that authority. I hope we will \nbe able to do that collectively.\n  I appreciate the ranking member's efforts in this regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to join \nSenators Carper and Blumenthal on a subject we would like to speak to \nby way of colloquy, without objection by my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        For-Profit Colleges and Our Veterans and Servicemembers\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Senator Carper, Senator Blumenthal, and \nI have come to the floor to discuss a terrible loophole in Federal law. \nIt is the Federal 90-10 rule that limits the amount of Department of \nEducation title IV dollars for for-profit colleges. They can receive 90 \npercent of their revenue from the title IV. The intent was to make sure \nfor-profit colleges were not totally reliant on Federal taxpayers for \noperations and that they could survive without taxpayer dollars.\n  Well, I think 90 percent is way too high to accomplish that goal. \nWhat is more, the law doesn't count non-title IV Federal programs as \nrevenue when they calculate the 90 percent. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs Post-9/11 GI bill and Department of Defense tuition assistance \nand MyCAA dollars are some of the biggest examples of Federal revenue \nnot counted in the 90 percent calculation.\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\n  It means that some for-profit colleges get vastly more than 90 \npercent from the Federal Government. These are supposed to be private \ninstitutions in the private sector? No way. If they were standing alone \nas an industry, the for-profit colleges and universities would be the \nninth largest Federal agency in Washington. They get that much money.\n  Who are some of these schools that get more than 90 percent of their \nrevenue from federal taxpayers? Well, names you might have heard: \nEverest College in Newport News, VA; Everest College in Portland, OR; \nHeald College campuses in Fresno, San Francisco, and Stockton, CA. If \nthe names sound familiar, it is because they are part of the now \nbankrupt and out-of-business Corinthian Colleges system that defrauded \nstudents, lied to the Federal Government, and raked in $1.4 billion \nannually in title IV dollars and another $186 million from GI bill \nbenefits.\n  Ashford University in Clinton, IA, is another notorious story of a \nfor-profit school that received more than 90 percent of their revenue \nfrom Federal dollars when the Department of Defense and VA funds are \nincluded. I know that one very well.\n  A past Bloomberg news article really demonstrated the depths these \ncompanies will sink to in order to ensnare or enroll veterans and \nservicemembers who qualify for Federal benefits.\n  James Long was reported to have suffered a brain injury when \nartillery shells hit his humvee in Iraq. The Ashford recruiter came to \na barracks for wounded marines at Camp Lejeune while Long was \nrecovering from his brain injury and pitched to him to go to Ashford \nUniversity, this for-profit school. Their parent company, Bridgepoint \nEducation, is under investigation by at least three State attorneys \ngeneral.\n  I could go through the list, but I will yield the floor for my friend \nfrom the State of Delaware, Senator Carper, to say a few words as well.\n  Westwood College, based out of Colorado, in my State of Illinois, is \nunder investigation by the Illinois attorney general. I have been \ncontacted by their students, including veterans, who have been lured \ninto their worthless degree programs and use up their GI bills as a \nresult of it.\n  There are many other schools included on this list of schools that \nreceive more than 90 percent of their revenue from federal taxpayers. \nVatterott College and Coyne College are in my home State. There are \nschools owned by Apollo, the largest for-profit college and university \nin the United States, which is currently under investigation by two \nState attorneys general.\n  Career Education Corporation--which is another notorious for-profit \nschool--is under investigation by 17 different State attorneys general. \nAnd there are schools owned by Kaplan, which used to be owned by the \nWashington Post, which now is on its own, and is under investigation by \nthree different States attorneys general.\n  Why do we allow this to happen? These schools are targeting our \nveterans and our servicemembers and members of their family.\n  I was listening to Pandora the other day and I heard American \nMilitary University advertising. Well, they know it is Washington, DC. \nThere are a lot of people in uniform in Washington, DC.\n  The American Military University is not part of any official part of \nour military. They just picked up the name. It is a for-profit school \nraising questions, again, about whether they are providing our veterans \nand servicemembers with any value for their GI benefits.\n  So I have joined with a number of my colleagues, Senator Carper, and \n18 other colleagues, in writing to the Secretary of the Department of \nEducation to publish its annual 90-10 data with all the Federal \neducation benefits, including the Department of Defense and VA \nbenefits.\n  According to documents obtained by the Center for Investigative \nReporting, the Department of Education has produced data internally. So \nit is there, and it is time that it be shared with the public.\n  I thank Senator Carper. Many people have heard me come to the floor \nand talk about for-profit colleges and universities and probably think: \nWell, there goes Durbin again.\n  Well, this time I am joined by a couple of my outstanding colleagues, \nand one of them is the Senator from Delaware, who helped me to bring \ntogether 20 Senators to sign this letter.\n  I yield to Senator Carper.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding.\n  Madam President, I don't know about your family, but my dad and his \nbrother served in World War II. They were both combat veterans, one in \nthe Navy and one in the Army. On my mom's side of the family, two of \nher brothers ended up serving in the Navy. One was killed in a kamikaze \nattack on an aircraft carrier out in the Pacific. He never had a chance \nto participate in the GI bill, but my dad did. Later, in the Korean \nwar, my uncle Ed, who married my mom's sister, had a chance to \nparticipate in the GI bill. It was a great benefit. It is one of the \nthings--when we look back in time, we know this is one of the wonderful \nthings that happened in our country. It helped lift us up and prepare a \nworkforce to make us a preeminent nation in the second half of the 20th \ncentury.\n\n  But as it turned out, as the benefits were offered and taken \nadvantage of by veterans, scam artists emerged on the heels of World \nWar II. The same thing happened again after the Korean war. It seems as \nif every time we have renewed and extended the GI bill for a new \ngeneration of veterans, the same thing has happened.\n  I served on Active Duty from 1968 to 1973 in the Vietnam war--as a \nnaval flight officer--served 5 years on Active and another 18 years \nbeyond that as a P-3 aircraft mission commander, a retired Navy \ncaptain. I had a chance to get a master's degree near the end of the \nVietnam war, and I moved from California to Delaware and got an MBA on \nthe GI bill. I think we got $250 a month.\n  The GI bill today--men and women who have served 3 years of Active \nDuty, including some time in Iraq or Afghanistan, get tuition free to \npretty much any college or university--public--in their State. They get \ntuition assistance. They not only get tuition, they get book fees, and \nif they need tutoring, they get that free. They also get about a \n$1,500-a-month housing allowance. Vietnam veterans got 250 bucks a \nmonth. This is a lucrative GI benefit. And if the GI doesn't use it \ntoday, their spouse can use it. If their spouse doesn't use it, it is \ntransferrable to their dependent children. It is a great benefit.\n  Not surprisingly, just as scam artists emerged at the end of World \nWar II, at the end of the Korean war, and at other times, they have \nemerged again this time as well. Some of them are private colleges; \nsome of them are not. Some of the private colleges actually do a good \njob, but too many of them do not. They are in this for money. They see \na rich benefit, and one of their goals is to try to make sure they cash \nin. In some cases, it is at the expense of the veteran and the \ntaxpayers.\n  Congress put in place in I want to say 1992 a rule that said we want \nto combat this by injecting some market forces. So since the beginning \nof 1992, no university, college, whatever, could get more than 85 \npercent of their revenues from the Federal Government--no more than 85 \npercent from the Federal Government. We changed that in 1998 and said \nthat no college or university--private, for profit, whatever--could get \nmore than 90 percent of their revenues from the Federal Government. \nThey had to raise 10 percent from other sources, such as people who \npaid their own money or who got private loans or whatever to go to \ncollege.\n  Somewhere along the line, though, we changed the rules to say that 90 \npercent did not include the GI bill, that 90 percent did not include \nsomething called tuition assistance for people on Active Duty. So 90 \npercent today is not a full picture. It is student loans and it is Pell \ngrants. It is not the GI bill. It is not tuition assistance from people \non Active Duty. So if we put it all together, we find out that today \nthere are over 100 colleges and universities--again, almost all \nprivate--that are getting way more than 90 percent of their revenue \nfrom the Federal Government. I don't think that is a good thing. It is \nnot a healthy thing. What was meant to be an approach that provided \nsome market correction doesn't work anymore.\n  For years, Senator Durbin and I have introduced legislation designed \nto restore the integrity of the original 85-15\n\n[[Page S2465]]\n\nrule or the 90-10 rule, which says, look, if you are a college or \nuniversity, if you are a for-profit, private, public, the 90 percent \nshould be included all in. It is college loans, it is student loans, it \nis Pell grants, it is the GI bill, it is tuition assistance--the whole \ndeal. If you are a college or university, you can get up to 90 percent \nof your revenues from those sources but not 100 percent--as too many of \nthem are doing today.\n  We have talked about Corinthian, which has gone down. Corinthian has \ncost taxpayers probably billions of dollars. A lot of men and women who \nrisked their lives and served our country in sometimes very dangerous \nsituations have now gotten out of the military and they have literally \nbeen put at risk again. They have been put in a position where they \nhave squandered their GI bill benefits.\n  We ask sometimes why there is bad morale in some cases, low morale, \nwhy some Veterans take their own lives. Well, sometimes it is because \nthey get sucked into these scams. Sometimes that is what happens.\n  We can fix this. It is the right thing to do for our veterans. It is \nthe right thing to do for our taxpayers.\n  I know Senator Blumenthal is here. He is also a distinguished veteran \nand the father of a distinguished veteran, and I am happy to yield to \nhim.\n  (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carper and Senator \nDurbin, two of our most distinguished colleagues who have fought \nceaselessly for the interests of students and veterans. I am very proud \nto be here with them today. I do have a very personal interest as the \ndad of a veteran and also of a currently serving young man whom I hope \nwill be a veteran one day.\n  Nothing is more important than this issue of making sure we keep \nfaith with our veterans and protect them because the phenomena we have \ndescribed today often create incentives for schools to lure veterans \ninto education deals, and they are often education deals that fail \nthem, that don't make sense for them, that don't give them the \neducation and the qualifications they think they are going to receive. \nSo very often they are failed by these programs, and they fail to \ncomplete their courses and leave with mountains of debt but no degree.\n  These kinds of abuses that bring us here today involve some for-\nprofit schools in effect scamming our Nation's veterans.\n  We all know that for-profit schools are prohibited from receiving \nmore than 90 percent of their total revenue from Federal student aid, \nbut, as my colleagues have so well stated, the Department of Defense \nand Veterans' Administration education benefits are not counted toward \nthat 90 percent. That loophole causes the for-profits to target those \nservicemembers and veterans, often with predatory marketing practices \nthat lure them into those deals that make no sense for them.\n  We need to change that law. We need to change the law so that DOD and \nVA benefits count under the 90-percent cap on Federal revenue. That is \nreally our ultimate goal.\n  I thank the President for including such a provision in his budget \nrequest for fiscal year 2016. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and with the President in moving that legislative effort \nforward.\n  In the meantime, we need a more accurate picture of this problem \nbecause when it comes to for-profit schools and veterans, there are \nsome things we definitely need to know and our veterans need to know.\n  Here is what we do know. We know there are a large number of for-\nprofit schools that would be in violation of the 90-10 rule if we made \nthis change today. In fact, a 2013 Department of Education analysis \nidentified 133 for-profit schools that would be in violation. We also \nknow that the current loophole in that 90-10 rule creates those \nincentives for certain institutions to conduct aggressive, relentless, \noften predatory recruitment of veterans.\n  What we lack and what we need is comprehensive, complete information \non the exact scope of the problem. That part should be easy. The \nDepartment of Education already collects the information we are asking \nthem to publish. It is a simple task of publishing how much revenue \nschools receive from all Federal education programs, including the DOD \nand the VA. That would bring accuracy and transparency to the debate \nover the 90-10 rule. Disclosure and transparency are part of the \nbattle. Most importantly, this information and these statistics would \nprovide veterans themselves and servicemembers better data and \ninformation to make informed choices about higher education.\n  Let me briefly mention another tool that I think is very important \nbecause it encourages veterans to make informed higher education \nchoices, and that is the VA's GI bill comparison tool. I am glad--and I \nthank Secretary McDonald--the VA has launched this vitally important \nresource for veterans in response to the President's Executive order, \nwhich established principles of excellence for schools that serve \nveterans. I also think Secretary McDonald can take steps to improve \nthis tool, specifically by adding a risk index that would highlight \nunscrupulous bad actors in the industry.\n  As our Nation's veterans decide where to spend their taxpayer-funded \neducation benefits--their money but taxpayer funded--they deserve to \nknow if the school they are considering is under investigation for \ndeceptive practices, what its record is on this score, what its \ngraduates do, what the value is of education and courses there. They \ndeserve to know if the school they are considering has been placed on \nheightened cash monitoring status, a specific status from the \nDepartment of Education. They deserve to have this information. It is \nvital not only to them but to their smart use of taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me finish by saying that for-profit schools have been problematic \nin many ways. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \non which I served during my first 2 years, conducted an investigation. \nI was very proud to be a part of the effort to reform for-profit \nschools. Our former colleague Tom Harkin worked very hard on this \nissue.\n  We should not tar every for-profit school with too broad a brush. We \nshould note improvements that have been made. This problem is discrete, \nidentifiable, critically important, and I thank my colleagues for \ngiving me the opportunity to talk about it and work with them on it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Blumenthal and Senator Carper, and I also \nthank Senator Lee, who has waited patiently for the last 15 minutes or \nso. I will conclude my part of this by first saying that I thank my \ncolleagues for joining me.\n  If I said we were dealing with an industry--the for-profit colleges \nand universities--that has 10 percent of the high school graduates in \nAmerica attending and 44 percent of all the student loan defaults, it \nmight raise some question. If I said that at least 90 percent of the \nrevenue these for-profit colleges and universities receive is often \nfrom the Federal Treasury, a Federal subsidy--sometimes more than 90 \npercent, which is the point we are making here--and if I said that many \nof these schools are literally exploiting our veterans and \nservicemembers, I think that is a clarion call for Members of Congress \nto stand up and first do something to protect the men and women in \nuniform and the veterans and second to make sure taxpayers' dollars are \nwell spent.\n  This Corinthian College collapse is an indication of how we can lose \n$1.4 billion a year for a worthless college system, for-profit college \nsystem.\n  If I said at the end of the day that I don't know what the term \n``crony capitalism'' means--I will go and look it up after this speech, \nbut it looks to me as if they are calling themselves private schools. \nThey might as well be Federal agencies and, as such, should be held \naccountable.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me.\n  Mr. CARPER. If I can add just one thing, Mr. President, 5 years ago, \n6 years ago, our Federal budget deficit hit $1.4 trillion. It has come \ndown since, bit by bit. Now it is down by about two-thirds. But it is \nstill a lot--like $400 billion or so. That is a lot of money.\n  I think the key to further reducing deficits is threefold: No. 1, tax \nreform that broadens the base and lowers the corporate rates so we are \ncompetitive with the rest of the world but also generates some revenues \nfor deficit reduction.\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\n  No. 2, entitlement reform that saves money and saves programs for our \nchildren and grandchildren and doesn't savage old people or poor \npeople.\n  No. 3, look at everything we do in the Federal Government and say: \nHow do we get a better result with less money? This is one of those \nthings we need to look at and put under a microscope.\n  Again, are all for-profit schools bad? No, they are not all bad. Some \ndo a very good job. But we have millions of jobs out here in this \ncountry waiting to be filled. We have a lot of people who would like to \nhave a job and don't have the skills. We are spending a ton of money \nthrough the GI bill and tuition assistance, and we need to better \nensure that the folks--particularly who are veterans--are getting their \nmoney's worth and that we are getting our money's worth and that we are \ngetting the workforce we need to fill up those millions of jobs.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I would add one last note. My \ncolleague Senator Durbin has very appropriately mentioned the \nCorinthian debacle. We should note that this debacle is not an innocent \nfailure. It is not a victimless debacle. Behind that staggering number \nof $1.2 billion are thousands of real people with huge debt and no \nvalue in the courses they have taken in terms of a degree that can give \nthem marketable qualifications. There are real-life stories of huge \ndebt, no degrees, and people who are tragically trapped in financial \nsituations really beyond their own fault because of this situation.\n  So that, too, is a phenomenon we need to keep in mind when we talk \nabout this 90-10 rule. Those veterans who are failed, who are marketed \nto, who are lured into this system are often left in tragic situations \nthat they don't deserve and that they wouldn't have undertaken if they \nhad been well-informed, which is what ultimately this Nation owes them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments and call up amendments Nos. 1141, 1145, and 1148 on \nbehalf of Senator Rubio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Senator Corker and I have been working \nvery hard to get amendments considered in a very orderly way. We have \nthree amendments that are pending. We are attempting to get to those \namendments in a way that we can have votes. We do not want a lot of \namendments pending while we are debating certain amendments. For that \nreason, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to speak on the legislation \nbefore the Senate, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, and I \nspecifically want to create a focus for our colleagues on the essential \nquestion before the Senate. The essential question before the Senate \nis, Does the Senate want to have a role in opining upon any agreement \nthat may be concluded between the United States and the P5+1 and Iran? \nRight now, there is no clear mechanism for the Senate and the Congress \nof the United States to have a say about that potential final \nagreement.\n  The reality is that an Iran that does not have nuclear weapons \ncapability is an Iran that at the end of the day enures to a status in \nwhich the national security of the United States is better preserved \nand in which our ally the State of Israel's security is better \npreserved. But, in fact, an Iran that does have nuclear weapons \ncapability is a national security threat to the United States and to \nthe State of Israel, our ally, which clearly would face an existential \nthreat.\n  The problem is that many of us, myself included--personally, I abhor \nthe Iranian regime. I abhor its human rights abuses. I abhor its \npromotion of terrorism in the world. I abhor that they are holding U.S. \ncitizens hostage and so much more. But as much as I abhor all of that \nreality, what I really have a concern about is the Senate not having a \nsay over any final agreement, particularly when I have some serious \nreservations about where this framework agreement to this date takes \nus; the questions of the differences in views between the P5+1 and Iran \nabout what the framework agreement says and doesn't say; the reality, \nit seems to me from what I read, that Iran can advance in its research \nand development in a way that ultimately allows them to have, for \nexample, centrifuges that can spin more efficiently, more quickly, and \ntherefore reduce the breakout time; my concern about the question of \nwhat happens after 10 years--are we, in essence, relegated to a \nnuclear-armed Iran; my concern about what I understood was a threshold \nredline issue in which the International Atomic Energy Administration \nwas going to have anytime, anyplace, anywhere inspections based upon \nany agreement; and many other elements.\n  But all of those concerns--and we will see whether a final agreement, \nif there is a final agreement, ultimately addresses those concerns--\nwill be for naught in terms of having a way to express my concerns if, \nin fact, there is no process that ultimately creates the potential for \na judgment on any final agreement and an action in response to that \njudgment and a continuing oversight obligation and opportunity for the \nSenate.\n  So while I abhor all of the things on which many of my colleagues \noffer amendments, this is not necessarily the only Iran piece of \nlegislation we have to consider. But if we want to have a say on the \nfundamental question of any potential agreement, then don't load up \nthis legislation that came out of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee unanimously. And God knows we don't get too many unanimous \nvotes in this Chamber, much less in committees. And the good work of \nSenator Corker as the chairman and the work of Senator Cardin in the \nnegotiations and, I would like to believe, many of us who were on this \nlegislation before we got to this point and some of us who have been \nfollowing Iran since my days in the House of Representatives--\nultimately, that was the type of structured process that creates a say \nfor the Senate and for the Congress in a meaningful way.\n  Could we seek other legislation to deal with Iran's terrorism? The \nanswer is yes, even though this legislation has reporting requirements \nto ensure that we have senses of that and, most importantly, doesn't \nrepeal any other sanctions that may be related to terrorism, which was \nmy original concern when we had language as it related to the question \nof terrorism.\n  Do we have the opportunity to look at Iran's missile capacity and \nprogram and what that means to the national security of the United \nStates and our allies and the State of Israel? Yes.\n  Do we have the opportunity to continue to express ourselves about \nIran's use of its resources not for its people but to promote terrorism \nin the world? Yes.\n  Does it all have to be in this legislation? No. Because what we are \ngoing to do is sink the legislation, and there will be no say, there \nwill be no opportunity to deal with any potential final agreement.\n  As the author, along with others, of the sanctions regime that \nbrought Iran to the table in the first place to discuss it--I always \nfind it interesting because I hear the administration at times talk in \ntwo ways about the sanctions regime: Either the sanctions regime cannot \nbe enhanced because to do so would break the coalition, and by the same \ntoken--and don't expect that Iran would respond to any further \nsanctions--by the same token, I hear that the reason Iran is at the \nnegotiating table and wants to strike a deal as an expression of their \nsincerity is because of the sanctions. So you can't have it both ways.\n  By the way, I have often heard that any enhancing of the sanctions \nregime would ultimately lead to a breaking of the coalition. I heard \nthat many times before, and that sanctions regime didn't create that.\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\n  But I am willing to forgo enhanced sanctions at this time to get the \nfundamental opportunity of the Senate having a say on any final \nagreement because that is the threshold question--whether we will have \na say on the most important nuclear nonproliferation national security \nissue, I would say, of our time.\n  So I hope my colleagues, as earnest as I believe they are in some of \ntheir amendments, understand that at the end of the day, pursuit of \nsuch an amendment, however worthy it might be, would sink the very \nopportunity to have a law in place that would give us a process and a \nsay, because there is none right now.\n  So whether you want to change this to a treaty, which has all types \nof other legal consequences to it far beyond--I don't think people have \nthought that through because far beyond, a treaty has legal \nrequirements on both sides or multiple sides when you enter into a \ntreaty. I don't know that I want Iran having that legal precedent or \nability to use against the United States at any given time if things \ndon't go the way we want them to. I don't know that, in fact, I want to \nhave a set of circumstances in which Iran can ultimately rear its ugly \nhead by the use of our own very same purposes in legislation, which I \nthink people haven't thought about fully, the unintended consequence of \nsome of their legitimate goals, haven't thought it fully through. But \nmost of all, I don't think they have thought about the consequences of \nthe Senate not having a say on any final agreement. That, to me, is \nparamount.\n  So I hope very much that as our colleagues are considering this--I am \nsure the chairman and the ranking member will try to work, when \nappropriate, with individual Members who ultimately may have language \nthat doesn't strike at the heart of the legislation, that may be able \nto be accommodated, that may enhance it. By the same token, we have to \ndecide whether we want a political victory or a national security \nvictory.\n  If we want a national security victory, then we will try to keep the \nlegislation that came out on a unanimous bipartisan version from the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee pretty much intact. If we want a \npolitical victory to say that someone is stronger than someone else or \none group is stronger than someone else about national security or \nabout our support of the State of Israel--for which I take a backseat \nto no one in this Chamber--then we can have that opportunity, but that \nwill mean not having a final say on any agreement, and that, I think, \nwould be of historical proportion a huge mistake.\n  So I look forward to the debate that continues. I hope we can keep a \nmeasured look. I am happy to work with other colleagues who want to \nfurther advance issues which I think are legitimate as it relates to \nIran but not necessarily as it relates to the determinative factor as \nto whether we will have a say on any potential final agreement as it \nrelates to a nuclear agreement with Iran. I think that is paramount. I \nhope we don't lose sight of it. I hope we can have the same strong, \nincredibly bipartisan votes that we have had on Iran because that sends \na clear message to our allies as to our expectations, it sends a clear \nmessage to Iran of what we will expect and the standard that we will \nhold them up to. Anything short of that will only create the \nopportunity for those who have a different vision about what we seek to \nachieve to try to accomplish it. I do not think we want that. I do not \nthink that is anybody's intention. I do not judge anyone in terms of \ntheir intent. I only ask to think about the consequences to our greater \ngoal.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent in a \nmoment.\n  First, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, who has been as much as anybody in this entire congressional \nbody, both House and Senate--actually he and Senator Kirk have been \nstalwarts on Iran. Without his efforts, we would not even be in a \nnegotiation right now. I cannot thank him enough for his positive \ncontributions, for his leadership as ranking member and chairman. I \nwant to thank him.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1150\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 6:10 p.m. \ntoday be equally divided in the usual form and that following the use \nor yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the following \namendment: Johnson amendment No. 1150; further, that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the amendment and that it require \na 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I could follow up, I have been in \nextensive conversations with former Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice, who I know has tremendous respect on this side of the aisle. She \nsent out a release today in response to this amendment that is coming \nbefore us today that the proposed Iranian nuclear agreement is \nclassically an executive agreement and does not need to be a treaty \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate--this is our former Secretary \nof State under George W. Bush--but Congress should be able to opine, \ngiven the congressionally mandated sanctions would have to be lifted. I \nthink everybody on our side of the aisle understands that with four \ntranches of sanctions that Congress put in place--we brought them to \nthe table with Senator Menendez leading that effort, and in each of \nthose cases, which is traditionally done, we gave a national security \nwaiver. No one ever thought the President would use the national \nsecurity waiver to kick the can down the road for years on the \ncongressionally mandated sanctions without our approval. But everybody \nin this body who has been here in recent times participated in giving \nthe President--if you voted for these sanctions and in some cases they \nwere unanimous--the unilateral ability to waive the sanctions.\n  If we pass this underlying bill, on which we now have 67 cosponsors, \nwe are taking back that authority. But to try to deem this as a treaty \nis a losing effort. In essence, it will destroy our ability--it will \ndestroy our ability to have any say-so, as the Senator just mentioned, \nin one of the biggest geopolitical events of our time.\n  If this amendment were to pass, the outcome would be no limitation on \nthe President's use of waivers to suspend the sanctions we put in \nplace, none--no requirement that Congress receive the deal at all, \nnever mind the classified annexes that go with it but which, by the \nway, the American people will never see--will never see, but on their \nbehalf we would like to see--no review period for Congress to seal the \ndeal and vote before it is implemented, no requirement that the \nPresident certify Iran is complying, no mechanism for Congress to \nrapidly reimpose sanctions, and no reporting on Iran's support for \nterrorism, ballistic missile development, and human rights violations.\n  I just want to say to my friends, voting for this treaty is, in \nessence, saying that we are willing to throw what has been put together \naside, even though we have 67 cosponsors. Look, I wish we had the \nability to vote affirmatively, but we gave that away. Almost everybody \nin this body was a part of giving that national security waiver away.\n  This is an executive agreement. Our former Secretary of State, whom \nwe love and cherish, says this is an executive agreement. We can wish \nit was a treaty or we can try to deem it as a treaty, but the effect is \nwe will have no role if we were to pass this amendment by Johnson, a \nfriend of mine. We will have no role in this.\n  I urge people to vote no. I know there will be debate between now and \n6:10. I appreciate the ranking member being here with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I want to join Senator Corker in \nthanking Senator Menendez for his leadership on this issue--I said that \non previous occasions on the floor--clearly, his leadership, working \nwith Senator Corker and working with Senator Kaine, who developed the \nbill for the appropriate review for Congress. I wish to thank Senator \nMenendez very much for all of his hard work on this bill.\n  I want to identify myself with the comments of Senator Corker in \nopposition to the Johnson amendment. But\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\nlet me give you one more reason. I respect the intent of those who \nsupport this amendment, but let me tell you what it means. It means \nthat if this were, in fact, a treaty, we would be saying that we would \nbe delegating to other entities the decision on whether to eliminate \nthe sanction regime we in Congress imposed.\n  I have listened to my colleagues, particularly on the Republican \nside, who say they do not want to delegate that authority, that \nCongress should keep its legislative authority.\n  If you believe Congress should keep its legislative authority, that \nit is up to us to determine whether we are going to change or eliminate \nor modify the sanction regime, then you cannot be for a treaty because \na treaty would give away that power. I do not think you really mean to \ndo that, but that is the intent, if this were to be turned into a \ntreaty, that we would be giving up our power.\n  Secondly, I don't know how we are going to explain it to our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives. The Presiding Officer \nserved in the House. I served in the House. Senator Menendez served in \nthe House. The last time I checked, we imposed these sanctions because \na bill passed both the Senate and the House, and now we are saying that \nthe approval process is going to ignore the House of Representatives, \nsolely going to be a matter for the U.S. Senate on a ratification of a \ntreaty? That does not seem like a workable solution.\n  My point is to concur in the observations of Senator Corker. This is \nclearly an amendment that if it were adopted would say we are not going \nto have an orderly review process for Congress to be able to weigh in. \nWe are not going to be able to get the material to set up the logical \nreview by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that we are going to \nlose all the benefits of this bipartisan bill if this amendment were to \nbe approved.\n  For all those reasons, I would urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment. I think I have about 1 minute remaining. I will be glad to \nyield that to Senator Johnson, if he would like to have a minute and a \nhalf to try to rehabilitate his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Maryland \nyielding time.\n  If I could ask a question, if this amendment fails in terms of \ninvolving the House, I have another amendment that if the Senate \ndecides not to deem this a treaty--and I believe it should be deemed a \ntreaty--we can also deem this a congressional executive agreement \nwhich, of course, would have to be voted on by both Houses.\n  I think the fact is this does rise to the level of a treaty. Again, \nthere is no specific criteria in terms of what creates a treaty or \ncomprises a treaty and what doesn't. In the end, what determines \nwhether something is a treaty is how it is approved by Congress.\n  From my standpoint, when we take a look at the considerations in the \nForeign Affairs Manual, in terms of what actually causes something to \nbecome a treaty, the extent to which the agreement involves commitments \nor risks affects the Nation as a whole. I think this deal between Iran \nand America and the world affects and risks--certainly affects the \nNation as a whole.\n  Another consideration is whether the agreement can be given effect \nwithout the enactment of subsequent legislation by the Congress. I \nthink the fact that we are even debating this bill lends credence to \nthe fact that Congress needs to be involved.\n  In the end, though, it is not about involving Congress. This is about \ninvolving the American people. I think the American people should have \na say through their elected officials as to whether this is a good deal \nor a bad deal. The fact that this bill does allow some involvement, \nsome role, forces the administration to, for example, provide us the \ndetails of the bill. Can you imagine the arrogance that they would not \neven provide the details without this bill?\n  Again, I appreciate the Senator yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the evidence of climate disruption \ncaused by carbon pollution is clear and overwhelming. Yet the Senate is \nsleepwalking through this history. I am here today for the 97th time to \nsay that we must wake up. Climate disruptions are felt in every corner \nof the globe, from the ocean floor to the reaches of the atmosphere and \nfrom pole to pole.\n  Indeed, the United States is an Arctic Nation. We have been so since \nSecretary of State Seward negotiated the purchase of Alaska from Russia \nin 1878 for about $7 million. From our vantage point at the Arctic \nCircle, we are witnessing some of the direst climate disruptions.\n  The Arctic region has been warming now for decades, twice as fast as \nthe rest of the planet. Alaska's warmest year on record was 2014, going \nback to at least 1918. Here I am talking about measurements, not a \ntheory. This year the Alaskan winter was so mild that the start of the \nfamous Iditarod race had to be moved from Anchorage to Fairbanks, more \nthan 300 miles to the north, so that the mushers could find snow and \nhard, frozen rivers to sled on.\n  The Arctic Biodiversity Assessment, a project drawing on more than \n250 scientists from 15 countries, detailed the risk to the iconic \nwildlife and landscape of the Arctic. The report's chief scientist \nsaid:\n\n       Polar bears and other highly adapted organisms cannot move \n     further north, so they may go extinct. We risk losing several \n     species forever.\n\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\n\n  The report is clear. Climate change is the most serious threat to \nArctic biodiversity and to its fisheries and tourism. Arctic warming \nhas wreaked havoc on the ice cover of the Arctic terrain and ocean.\n  Look at the Greenland ice sheet. In 2012, the National Snow and Ice \nData Center recorded melting over a larger area than ever in more than \n30 years of satellite observation.\n  Here is a map of the average annual days of melting across the \nGreenland ice sheet from 1979 to 2007. That is the average. Here is \n2012. Some areas, such as along here, the southwestern coast, saw more \nthan 120 days of melting in 2012. Scientists estimate that the water \npouring out of this ice sheet accounts for 30 percent of current global \nsea level rise. If the entire Greenland ice sheet were to melt, the \nseas would rise 6 meters.\n  Here is what 20 feet of sea level rise would look like for the east \ncoast. Much of Rhode Island's coastline here would be lost. Florida, \nground zero for climate change, would lose the entire southern region \nof the State. Here is Miami, completely underwater. Here is \nTallahassee's new oceanfront.\n  Sea ice in the Arctic, not just land ice, is also in full retreat. \nOur scientists at NASA track disappearing sea ice using satellites. \nSince NASA started measurements in 1979, Arctic ice coverage has \ndiminished in almost all regions and seasons. The winter record low \never--ever--was this March.\n  The ice is not just a feature of the Arctic landscape. It supports \nthe way of life of Native people. Thinning ice, dangerous to traverse, \nthreatens traditional sustenance such as quail hunting. Sea ice \nprotects the shoreline from powerful ocean storms and waves. As that \nice barrier fades away, land and infrastructure flood and wash away. \nEntire villages are facing wholesale relocation, as Senator Murkowski \nfrom Alaska has indicated on the floor. It is the climate that has \nsustained them for generations that is being disrupted.\n  A new national security theater has opened in the Arctic as melting \nice frees up the Northwest Passage for transportation and shipping, for \nnew fishing grounds, and for its natural resources. The Departments of \nHomeland Security and Defense need new strategies and equipment to \nprotect American interests in this new theater.\n  In 2013, the Pentagon released its ``Arctic Strategy.'' Then \nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, the former Republican Senator, said:\n\n       Climate change is shifting the landscape in the Arctic more \n     rapidly than anywhere else in the world. While the Arctic \n     temperature rise is relatively small in absolute terms, its \n     effects are significant--transforming what was a frozen \n     desert into an evolving navigable ocean, giving rise to an \n     unprecedented level of human activity.\n\n  His words are echoed by former Coast Guard Commandant ADM Robert \nPapp, Jr., who is now the U.S. Special Representative to the Arctic \nRegion. It is his job to help manage risk in this remote but \nincreasingly accessible region of the world. He had this to say about \nthe disruptions of the Arctic climate:\n\n       I am not a scientist. I can read what scientists say, but I \n     am in the world of consequence management. My first turn in \n     Alaska was thirty-nine years ago, and during the summertime \n     we had to break ice to get up to the Bering Strait and to get \n     to Kotzebue. Thirty-five years later, going up there as \n     commandant, we flew into Kotzebue at the same time of year; I \n     could not see ice anywhere. So it is clear to me there are \n     changes happening, but I have to deal with the consequences \n     of that.\n\n  Last weekend, Secretary Kerry headed to the Canadian city of Iqaluit \nto assume the chair of the Arctic Council on behalf of the United \nStates. The Arctic Council is the international forum for Arctic \nnations to work together to ensure a secure and sustainable Arctic \nfuture. Secretary Kerry made it clear that climate disruption would be \na focus for America's chairmanship, saying plainly:\n\n       The ability of future generations to be able to adapt, \n     live, and prosper in the Arctic the way people have for \n     thousands of years is tragically but actually in jeopardy. . \n     . . So if we want to know where the problem begins, all we \n     have to do is look in the mirror.\n\n  Secretary Kerry sees this problem for what it is and knows we need to \nlead in addressing climate change. Congress, too, should seize the \nopportunity to do big things, to understand the changes that are \noccurring, and to protect against these climate disruptions. Our \nexecutive homeland and national security leaders must deal in real \nworld consequences. So should we. They do not have the privilege of \nshrugging off serious risk analysis; neither should we.\n  But the big polluters and their front organizations ignore the \nconsequences of carbon pollution, cherry pick the evidence, and traffic \nin denial, doubt, and delay. Deniers are quick to point out that \nAntarctic sea ice is increasing while Arctic sea ice is melting. But \nthe fact is that, overall, the globe is losing sea ice at a rapid \npeace. Since satellite measurements began, the planet has been losing \nsea ice at an average rate of 13,500 square miles per year.\n  The deniers usually also leave out the melting of the great ice \nsheets of Antarctica. Remember, see ice floats on the sea and its \nmelting does not much raise the sea level. Ice sheets rest on land. \nTheir melting adds to the seas. Scientists now warn that the melting of \nsome of those massive Antarctic ice sheets may have ``passed the point \nof no return.''\n  Rhode Island has already experienced nearly 10 inches of sea level \nrise. The implications of an Arctic ice sheet melting are measured in \nfeet, not inches. Many thought that the Alaska Purchase was a mistake. \nSome called it ``Seward's folly.'' But Secretary Seward had vision when \nhe secured Alaska for the United States, and now it is a treasured part \nof this great Nation.\n  We in Congress, in the Senate, should try to see through the haze of \npolluter influence and muster some vision ourselves on what scientists \nand world leaders alike call the greatest challenge of our time. The \nUnited States should be leading--not stalled by special-interest \npolitics. Secretary Kerry knows we should lead. He has made fighting \ncarbon pollution a priority for the State Department in the lead-up to \nthe global climate talks in Paris this fall. More than 100 Democratic \nMembers of Congress sent a letter last month to the President, \nsupporting U.S. leadership in these talks. We told the President: ``We \nstand ready to help you seize this opportunity to strengthen the global \nresponse to climate change.''\n  But what do our Republican colleagues try to do? They try to \nundermine American leadership. The majority leader openly warned other \ncountries that the United States would not be able to meet its climate \nplan and that they should proceed with caution before entering into a \nbinding, unattainable deal. It is past time to take action. The price \nof being wrong on this will be very high, particularly if the reason \nturns out, in the eyes of history and of our fellow nations, to have \nbeen partisan politics and special-interest influence.\n  One of America's great powers is the power of our example. What a \nsickening example we are setting now. Our inaction is our folly. It is, \nindeed, time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I honor a longtime champion of \nArkansas, Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt, who passed away earlier \nthis month at the age of 92 after a long life as a dedicated public \nservant.\n  As a member of the ``greatest generation,'' John Paul served as a \ncombat pilot during World War II and was a decorated war hero. As a \nCongressman from the Third District of Arkansas for 26 years and the \nonly Republican member of the delegation at the time, he worked across \nthe aisle to provide infrastructure and various improvements to \nArkansas, paving the way for the growth in the northwest corner of the \nState.\n  Even following his retirement more than 20 years ago, John Paul \ncontinued to serve the people, who fondly referred to him as ``JPH.'' \nHe always put Arkansas first. His vision for a two-party system in \nArkansas led him to seek elected office. He paved the way for the\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nRepublican Party in the State, and his vision continues to be realized \nas the party continues its growth in the State.\n  ``John Paul'' is a name that is just as familiar in Arkansas as it is \nto my colleagues in the Senate who served with him before serving in \nthis Chamber as well as the many Members in the House who worked \nalongside him during his years of elected service and through decades \nmore of providing assistance to his beloved Arkansas.\n  You would have been hard-pressed to find a kinder, gentler man than \nJohn Paul Hammerschmidt. As a mentor and friend, John Paul's wisdom and \ncounsel have shaped my Washington experience more than anyone else. \nWhen I ran for Congress in 2001, I sought John Paul out for advice. I \nquickly learned, as a newly elected Member of Congress for the Third \nDistrict of Arkansas, how fond his former colleagues were of him. \nSenior Members of the House of Representatives had so much respect for \nhim that they welcomed me into their inner circle because he had given \nhis approval.\n  It was John Paul who taught me that after the election is over, there \nare no more Republicans, no more Democrats, there are only the people \nof Arkansas. His dedication to his constituents during his career of \npublic service was unmatched and is a marker we should all strive to \nmeet. During his time in Congress, he served in the minority, but he \nwould disagree without being disagreeable.\n  I always valued John Paul's friendship and his continued advice.\n  John Paul set the standard for helping Arkansans. That bar is \nsomething members of the Arkansas congressional delegation continue to \nstrive toward today.\n  His vision to improve life for Arkansans led him to serve on the \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee as well as the House Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee. By the time he retired, he served as the \nlatter's ranking member.\n  Using his position on the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, he helped secure funds for roads and infrastructure \nprojects, including Interstate 540, which now bears his name, the \nNorthwest Arkansas Regional Airport, as well as protecting the Buffalo \nRiver and getting a designation as the first national river.\n  John Paul left big shoes to fill. He believed he could make a \ndifference in the lives of Arkansans because he believed in loving his \nfellow man. We are capitalizing on the benefits he helped provide--a \ntestament to his time in Washington.\n  From all Arkansans, I thank John Paul for his devotion to public \nservice, his leadership, and his dedication to Arkansas. His example is \nsomething we should continue to strive for in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2470-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SERGEANT EDWARD GOBEL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SGT Edward \nGobel, a long-time resident of Las Vegas, NV, who passed away on April \n1, 2015. Ed Gobel was a man whose strong sense of duty to his Nation \ndrove him to continuously seek new ways to help others and improve his \ncommunity, and I am grateful for his years of service. He will truly be \nmissed.\n  Sergeant Gobel proudly served in the 101st Airborne Division during \nthe Vietnam war. After his military service left him confined to a \nwheelchair, he drew from his personal experiences to help enact \npositive change in Las Vegas. He became a leading advocate for military \nveterans and the disabled in Nevada. Recognizing the importance of \nbeing involved in his community, Sergeant Gobel took on numerous roles, \nfrom director of the Council of Nevada Veterans Organizations to State \ncommander of the Veterans of the Vietnam War. His tireless efforts to \npush key bills through the Nevada Legislature, such as a bill to create \nNevada's first veterans home, earned him the Jefferson Award for Public \nService in 2003. And in 2014, he was honored with the Chapel of Four \nChaplains Legion of Honor Gold Medallion for his giving nature and \ncommitment to service. I am impressed by Sergeant Gobel's investment in \nthe people and issues that mattered most to him and by his continuous \nbelief that change was possible.\n  Sergeant Gobel is survived by his wife of nearly 40 years, Caryl \nGobel, along with his sister, children, and grandchildren.

Mr. President, this morning, the U.S. Supreme Court heard \noral arguments on the marriage equality cases. The legal principle at \nstake is whether the 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects \nmarriages between individuals of the same sex. But at the heart, these \ncases represent something more fundamental. They are about the right of \nevery American to marry the person they love and to have their \nrelationships treated with the respect and dignity to which every \nAmerican is entitled.\n  I am proud that my home State of Vermont has embraced love, equality, \nand freedom in its active and leading role on marriage equality. In \n2000, Vermont was the first in the Nation to provide for civil unions. \nAs the years went by, Vermont came to see that civil unions were \ninsufficient to provide the protections all American couples are \nentitled to, and in 2009, the Vermont Legislature on a bipartisan vote \nwas the first State legislature to enact marriage equality into law. \nVermont, which has led by example, is now one of 37 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia that recognizes marriage equality.\n  While the arguments in the cases today analyzed legal principles and \nprecedent, we should remember that they are ultimately about love and \nrecognizing the extraordinary commitment between two people. Jim \nObergefell had been with his partner, John Arthur, for over 20 years. \nThey wanted to marry, but the marriage laws in their home State of Ohio \nwould not allow it. Bedridden and incapacitated with ALS, John could \nneither drive nor fly commercially to get married in another State. It \ntook the generosity of friends and family, along with the kindness of \ncoworkers and others, to cover the cost of a $12,700 chartered, \nmedically equipped private plane.\n  After more than 20 years together, Jim and John finally married \nduring a seven and one-half minute ceremony in an airplane at a \nBaltimore airport. Upon their return to Ohio, the State refused to \nrecognize their marriage. And John passed away just a few months later. \nJim, now a widower, should not have to live in a State like Vermont to \nbe able to have his 20-year relationship validated and recognized by \nthe State. He should not have had to fly to another State to say his \nvows and pledge his commitment to his partner. Jim's current fight--and \nour current fight--is to show that relationships like his should be \ntreated with the same respect and dignity that has been accorded to all \nother Americans. It is to persuade the Supreme Court to live up to the \nmotto engraved in Vermont marble above its own building, which declares \n``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  Nearly five decades ago when the Supreme Court decided Loving v. \nVirginia, the Court recognized that:\n\n       Marriage is one of the `basic civil rights of man,' \n     fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this \n     fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as [] racial \n     classifications . . . is surely to deprive all the State's \n     citizens of liberty without due process of law. The \n     Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to \n     marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. \n     Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a \n     person of another race resides with the individual, and \n     cannot be infringed by the State.\n\n  In the marriage equality cases heard today, the Court has a simple \njob to do. It need only apply these same constitutional principles to \nhold that the same principle applies equally regardless of sexual \norientation or gender identity.\n  When the Supreme Court issues its decision this summer, I am hopeful \nthat it will be another landmark moment demonstrating that ours is a \nmore perfect union when it is a more inclusive union. And that the name \nObergefell will come to signify love, equality, and freedom the same \nway it does when Loving and Windsor are invoked.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2471-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE CALENDAR OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am objecting to consideration of the \nnomination of Brodi Fontenot to be Chief Financial Officer of the \nTreasury Department.\n  In May 2014, I found out about questionable hiring practices at the \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN. The problem \noccurred after the agency posted job requirements for openings in the \nenforcement division. Eligible candidates were disqualified for a \ncriterion that was never in the original job posting: a law degree. \nThis is illegal under Federal hiring guidelines.\n  In the process, FinCEN rejected qualified veterans who applied for \nthe positions. Instead, FinCEN hired three former Federal prosecutors \nfor the positions. Veterans preference doesn't guarantee veterans a \njob, but it does give them extra consideration for jobs for which they \nare qualified. The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans is \nsignificantly higher than the rate for the general population. These \nmen and women are extremely capable. They have an array of job skills \nto offer in the workplace. It is inexcusable for FinCEN or any other \nFederal agency to reject qualified veterans who faithfully served our \ncountry. Our veterans deserve better from the Obama administration.\n  As part of my investigation, I requested all emails sent between the \nTreasury Department and FinCEN pertaining to this issue. To date, I \nhave received a total of four emails. The Treasury Department has tried \nto convince me that no other relevant emails exist, but I am still not \nconvinced. Their search was limited to only the 8 months when the \nvacancy announcements were open. This excluded any email communications \nthat took place in preparation for posting the announcements or during \n2014 when problems with the announcements were found.\n  As a result, I placed a hold on the former Assistant Secretary for \nManagement at the Treasury Department who was nominated to be Deputy \nSecretary at HUD. Instead of simply providing the requested documents \nso that I could release the hold, former Majority Leader Reid ignored \nwhat was done to veterans and pushed through the nomination over my \nobjections.\n  In January 2015, I requested any emails sent between FinCEN and main \nTreasury using alternate email and handheld devices, as well as any \nemail messages that were printed and saved by FinCEN but no longer \nretained in the electronic email system. The response from the Treasury \nDepartment outlined the Federal Government's records retention \nregulations but did not include any of the requested documents.\n  This is unacceptable. Therefore, I am objecting to consideration of \nMr. Fontenot's nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2471-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote on the \nnomination of Dr. Dava Newman to be the Deputy Administrator of the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. I missed the vote \nyesterday because I was meeting with turkey growers in Minnesota who \nare struggling with the avian influenza outbreak, and I attended the \nfuneral services for my long-time friend, colleague and mentor, John \nMooty. My vote would not have changed the outcome and had I been \npresent I would have voted in support of Dr. Newman's nomination.\n  The work being done at NASA pushes the boundaries of innovation, \nscience, and exploration, and it is critical we have strong leaders \nlike Dr. Newman in place to lead those initiatives. Dr. Newman is well \nknown for her cutting-edge work in developing the next generation of \nspace suits. As a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and \nengineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. \nNewman will bring a strong academic, research, and technical background \nto this position. As a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, I supported Dr. Newman's nomination when it \nwas considered by the committee earlier this year. I am pleased that \nDr. Newman was confirmed by the Senate to be the Deputy Administrator \nof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2471-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEVE GLEASON ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I support the Steve Gleason Act, which \npassed the Senate last week. I would especially like to thank Senator \nVitter for championing this important legislation that will ensure \npatients on Medicare have access to critical speech-generating devices.\n  I am so glad that we were able to come together to pass this \nbipartisan bill and take an important step toward giving patients their \nvoices back.\n  For Americans affected by debilitating diseases, speech-generating \ndevices aren't a luxury--they are a lifeline. Without these devices, \nmany people who are suffering from diseases like ALS and Parkinson's \ncan't communicate with their family members, caregivers and friends. \nMany patients use their devices in conjunction with eye gaze technology \nbecause they no longer have use of their hands, arms, and other parts \nof their body. And these new technologies allow patients to use the \nInternet and email--technologies most us take for granted but are \ncrucial to help keep patients connected with their communities.\n  Unfortunately, recent policy changes have threatened patients' access \nto these important devices and associated technologies.\n  Under the new policy, Medicare will stop paying for speech-generating \ndevices if a patient is admitted to a hospital, nursing facility, or \nhospice. It is at this time that patients are most vulnerable and most \nin need of being able to communicate with their doctors, caregivers, \nand loved ones.\n  I have heard heartbreaking stories of patients who have lost their \nability to communicate when they enter a care facility. One person told \nof having to put her mother in hospice care. When her mother entered \nhospice, Medicare would no longer cover her mother's device. The \ndaughter was devastated that she could no longer understand what her \nmother was saying. She could tell how frustrated her mother was by this \nnew isolation, but she was helpless to do anything about it.\n  I have also heard from people who have decided to forego treatment in \nhospice or a nursing home because they would rather suffer at home than \nlose their voice. This is simply unacceptable.\n  That is why I have worked with Senator Vitter to restore full access \nto speech-generating devices for those who need them.\n  The Steve Gleason Act will ensure that patients have continuous \naccess to their speech-generating devices, no matter where they are \nreceiving treatment. And the bill will allow patients to use eye-\ntracking technology with their devices--technology that is vital for \npatients who can no longer use their arms or hands.\n  Ultimately, these changes will ensure that Americans who have been \nrobbed of their ability to speak by diseases like ALS aren't also \nrobbed of relationships with their caregivers and loved ones.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues in the Senate for passing this important \nbill and I urge the House to pass this legislation and give patients \ntheir voices back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2471-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2471-S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SHAWN PHILLIP SOMITS\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

Shawn was a 1994 graduate of \nMuncy High School and attended both Penn College and Bucknell \nUniversity. In 2003, Shawn married his wife, Daisy, and welcomed the \nbirth of his first child, Faith. At this time, Shawn was dutifully \nserving his country in OIF/OEF in the U.S. Army, where he was deployed \nto both Iraq and Kuwait from February 2003 until April of 2004. Upon \nhis return from deployment in 2004, Shawn entered into Federal service \nwith the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Prisons \nas a corrections officer at USP Allenwood,\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nwhere he would serve for nearly 11 years.\n  Shawn Somits' life ended suddenly and tragically on April 2, 2015, \nfollowing a long battle with post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, \nsuffered as a result from his combat service. He is survived by his \nwife, Daisy, and their two children, Faith and Wesley.\n  Today I express my condolences to the family of Shawn Somits and \nhonor Shawn's service to his country both as a combat veteran and a \nFederal law enforcement officer. Tragic losses such as this provide us \na chance to reflect on the sacrifices dedicated public servants like \nShawn make in order to keep us all safe from harm.

Mr. President, today I honor Monroe County, OH, as it \ncelebrates its bicentennial anniversary. On January 29, 1813, an act to \nform the County of Monroe made up of parts of Belmont, Washington, and \nGuernsey Counties was passed by the Ohio Legislature.\n  Although Monroe County had already been established, it did not \nfunction as a county until it was officially organized in 1815. On \nFebruary 3, 1815, an act was passed by the Ohio Legislature to attach \nanother part of Washington County to Monroe County and to organize \nMonroe into a separate county. The act went into effect on March 1, \n1815, which was when Monroe began to formally function as a county. \nResidents named the county in honor of James Monroe, who at the time \nwas U.S. Secretary of State and eventually became the fourth President \nof the United States.

Mr. President, the construction industry plays a \nmajor role in promoting economic growth, employing workers across a \nvariety of trades, and literally building communities. It is a noble \nprofession, yet today it remains one of the most dangerous occupations. \nBuilding codes and workplace safety regulations have made great strides \nbut there is more to be done. We all share a responsibility to ensure \nthat men and women who offer their most valuable asset--their labor--\nnot only earn fair wages but also work in safe environments so they can \nsafely return home after every shift.\n  I am proud that in my hometown of Portland, OR, various public, \nprivate and nonprofit stakeholders have formed the SafeBuild Alliance \nto promote and share best practices for worksite safety. This \ncollaboration is so important because we know that with proper \nplanning, communication and controls, reducing workplace injuries and \nfatalities is not only possible, it is already happening.\n  The SafeBuild Alliance is leading the way with its Zero Incidents \nThrough Collaboration initiative, which facilitates safe performance by \npromoting the sharing of best practices among industry professionals. \nFrom general contractors to property owners, public and private \nentities, architects and engineers, to building and construction trade \nassociations, industry vendors and insurers--everyone has a role in \npromoting safe worksites.\n  It is my great privilege to recognize the Safebuild Alliance for \ntheir work and advocacy for safe workplaces on behalf of all our \nworkers engaged in the construction industry. Safety must be priority \nNo. 1, every job, every day. And to further heighten awareness, I am \npleased to offer my support in the official observance of May 3 to 9, \n2015 as Construction Industry Safety Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2472-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DICK GINSBURG\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Dick \nGinsburg was a long-time resident of the small Washington County \ncommunity of Cornelius, and a founding member of the Oregon chapter of \nthe American Immigration Lawyers Association, AILA. Dick was one of \nthose rare human beings who brought both reason and compassion to every \nissue on which he worked. And I know everyone who met Dick will always \nremember his engaging smile, his joyful enthusiasm and that infectious \nlaughter--regardless of the issue.\n  Dick often referred to the lifelong impact he felt from his \nexperience in the Peace Corps in Paraguay, surely much of it \nattributable to his loving wife of 40 years who he met there, Rosalia. \nAlong with their wonderful children, Brian and Laura, the Ginsburg \nfamily was always exceptionally generous and created an extended \nfamily, not only in Oregon, but everywhere he went.\n  As a friend during my early days at Legal Aid, Dick showed himself to \nbe a thoughtful, compassionate, and dedicated lawyer. He understood the \nintricacies of immigration law and devoted his life to making it work \nwith equal justice for businesses and people alike.\n  While Dick will be remembered by all whose lives he touched, I will \nespecially remember my friend as a mentor, a guiding force, and one of \nthose people who made the world a better place just for being \nhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2472-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2472-5", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2472-6", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ALEXANDER, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions, without amendment:\n       S. 1124.

 By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 1108. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to include court security officers in the public safety \nofficers' death benefits program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require adequate information regarding the tax \ntreatment of payments under settlement agreements entered into by \nFederal agencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Truth in \nSettlements Act. This bipartisan legislation, which I introduced \nearlier today with my colleague from Oklahoma Senator Lankford, the \nPresiding Officer, will help the public hold Federal agencies \naccountable for settlements they make with corporate wrongdoers.\n  When companies break the law, Federal enforcement agencies are \nresponsible for holding them accountable. In nearly every instance, \nagencies choose to resolve cases through settlements rather than a \npublic trial. They defend this practice by arguing that settlements are \nin the best interest of the American people. That sounds good, but \ntheir actions paint a very different picture.\n  If agencies were truly confident that these settlements were good \ndeals for the public, they would be willing to publicly disclose all of \nthe key details of those agreements. Instead, time after time, agencies \ndo the opposite, hiding critical details about their settlements in the \nfine print--or worse, hiding them entirely from public view.\n  Consider that copies of these agreements or even basic facts about \nthem are not easily accessible online. Many agencies regularly deem \nagreements confidential without any public explanation of why the \npublic cannot see what has been done in their name. When agencies do \nmake public statements about these agreements, they often trumpet large \ndollar amounts of money recovered for taxpayers while failing to \ndisclose that this sticker price isn't what the companies will actually \npay, since the number that is listed includes credits for engaging in \nroutine activities and doesn't reflect massive tax deductions that many \nof these companies get.\n  Add all of these tricks, and you will end with a predictable result. \nToo often the American people learn only what the agencies want them to \nlearn about these agreements. That is not good enough.\n  These hidden details can make a huge difference. Below the surface, \nsettlements that seem tough and fair don't always look so impressive.\n  For example, 2 years ago, Federal regulators entered into a \nsettlement with 10 mortgage servicers accused of illegal foreclosure \npractices. The sticker price on the settlement was $8.5 billion. Now, \nthat is a big number. But $5.2 billion was in the form of credits, or \nwhat the agencies described in their press release as ``loan \nmodifications and forgiveness of deficiency judgments.''\n  That vague public statement left out a key detail: Servicers could \nrack up those credits by forgiving mere fractions of large, unpaid \nloans. For example, a servicer that wrote down $15,000 of a $500,000 \nunpaid loan balance would get a credit for $500,000--not the $15,000 \nthat was actually written down. That\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\nundisclosed method of calculating credits could end up cutting the \noverall value of the $8.5 billion settlement by billions and billions \nof dollars.\n  Failure to disclose possible tax deductions is another way agencies \ncan hide the ball. Two years ago, a Federal court found that a company \nthat allegedly defrauded Medicare and other Federal health programs--\nfor years--was entitled to a $50 million tax deduction for government \nsettlements that it had made. That deduction came on top of earlier tax \ndeductions the company had already taken in their settlement payment.\n  The end result? A $385 million settlement that was touted at the time \nas the largest civil recovery to date in a health care fraud case was, \nin fact, $100 million smaller once taxpayers had picked up part of the \nsettlement.\n  At least in these two cases, the text of the settlements was public, \nallowing the American people the chance to dig into the fine print and \nuncover these unflattering details. But for settlements that are kept \nconfidential, the public is kept entirely in this the dark.\n  Recently, Wells Fargo agreed to pay the Federal Housing Finance \nAgency $335 million for allegedly fraudulent sales of mortgage-backed \nsecurities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That is about 6 percent of \nwhat JPMorgan Chase paid in a public settlement with FHFA to address \nvery similar claims. Now, in what ways did the actions of Wells Fargo \ndiffer from those of JPMorgan? We will never know, because while the \nJPMorgan settlement is public, the much smaller Wells Fargo settlement \nis held confidential.\n  The American people deserve better. These enforcement agencies don't \nwork for the companies they investigate; they work for us. Agencies \nshould not be able to cut bad deals and then hide the embarrassing \ndetails. The public deserves transparency.\n  The Truth in Settlements Act requires that transparency. It requires \nagencies making public statements about their settlements to include \nexplanations of how those settlements are categorized for tax purposes \nand what specific conduct will generate credits that apply toward the \nsticker price. The bill also requires agencies to post text and basic \ninformation about their settlements online. And while the legislation \ndoes not prohibit agencies from deeming settlements confidential, it \nrequires agencies to disclose additional information about how \nfrequently they are invoking confidentiality and their reasons for \ndoing so.\n  If we expect agencies to hold companies accountable for breaking the \nlaw, then we should be able to hold agencies accountable for enforcing \nthe law. We cannot do that if we are being held in the dark. The Truth \nin Settlements Act shines a light on these agency decisions and gives \nthe American people a chance to hold agencies accountable for enforcing \nour laws.\n  I introduced this bill in the last Congress with Senator Lankford's \npredecessor, Senator Coburn. The bill advanced through the Senate's \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee by voice vote but \nwas blocked on the Senate floor.\n  I hope that in this Congress we can finally make this commonsense \nlegislation law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1112. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to expand coverage under the Act, to increase protections for \nwhistleblowers, to increase penalties for high gravity violations, to \nadjust penalties for inflation, to provide rights for victims or their \nfamily members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe need for a safer and healthier workplace and to urge my colleagues \nto join me and Senator Murray in supporting the Protecting America's \nWorkers Act, which I am proud to introduce today.\n  Today, April 28, is Workers' Memorial Day--a day for our Nation to \nremember and focus on those workers who have died or been injured on \nthe job. Today is also a day to acknowledge the significant suffering \nexperienced by families and communities when workers die or are injured \nand to recommit ourselves to maintaining safe and healthy workplaces \nfor all of our workers.\n  April 28 is also the anniversary of the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970, the OSH Act, which created the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration. When the bill was passed on a bipartisan \nbasis and signed into law by President Nixon 45 years ago, 14,000 \nworkers were dying on the job each year. Now the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics estimates that there were 4,405 worker fatalities in 2013. \nThat is a huge improvement, and it would not have happened without the \nOSH Act. But it also means that far too many workers are still getting \nhurt and dying on the job.\n  Our workforce and workplaces have changed significantly in 45 years, \nbut our laws have not kept pace. We have made no real updates to our \nworkplace safety laws even though thousands of workers die every year \non the job, many in large industrial disasters that could be prevented.\n  Unfortunately, too often, we are told that we cannot afford to \nstrengthen our workplace safety laws. But I believe our country cannot \nafford the economic and emotional costs incurred by middle-class \nfamilies when workers lose their lives or their livelihoods on the job. \nAnd it is not just those families; law-abiding businesses that invest \nin safe workplaces cannot afford to subsidize the corporations that cut \ncorners on workplace safety and then leave the American public to pick \nup the tab.\n  Let me remind you of a few of the tragedies that have happened in \njust the past decade that show the cost to our country.\n  On March 23, 2005, fire and an explosion at BP's Texas City Refinery \nkilled 15 workers and injured more than 170 others. On February 7, \n2008, 13 people were killed and 42 people were injured in a dust \nexplosion at a sugar refinery in Port Wentworth, GA.\n  On April 17, 2014, 15 people were killed--13 of them volunteer first \nresponders--and another 200 people were injured after a fertilizer \ncompany in West Texas exploded. The explosion leveled roughly 80 homes \nand a middle school. Mr. President, 133 residents of a nearby nursing \nhome were trapped in the ruins.\n  And just last week, we recognized the 5-year anniversary of the \nexplosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of \nMexico in 2010. That accident killed 11 workers and is considered the \nlargest accidental marine oilspill in the history of the petroleum \nindustry, costing millions to the local economy and causing \nunprecedented damage to the environment.\n  All of the reports following these accidents cited weak compliance \nand gaps in our safety laws. They all point to the fact that our \nworkplace safety laws are too weak. They are so weak that they cannot \nensure the safety of American workers, and they do not level the \nplaying field for law-abiding businesses that make sure their workers \nare safe.\n  These are not isolated incidents. Since the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics began collecting data on worker fatalities on the job in \n1992, over 124,000 workers have died on the job. To put that in \nperspective, on average, in the United States, about six times as many \npeople die on the job each year as died in airplane crashes last year \nworldwide. The fact is that many of these accidents could have been \nprevented. Many of these workers could still be with their families \ntoday. But, unfortunately, even after the reports outlining the details \nof these accidents and recommending commonsense updates to our laws to \nprotect workers from these types of incidents, there have been no \nsignificant updates made to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\n  We all rely on the sacrifice of American workers who are employed in \ndifficult and often dangerous industries. We all depend on \nconstruction, manufacturing, natural gas production, and agriculture to \nhelp build and heat our homes and put food on the table. The Americans \nwho work in those fields should not have to choose between their health \nand safety and providing for their families.\n  We can do something about that. That is why today I am proud to \nreintroduce the Protecting America's Workers Act with Senator Patty \nMurray, who has long been a champion of workers' rights. After 45 \nyears, this legislation will modernize the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act for the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\n  This legislation will expand the number of workers in safe workplaces \nand make it harder to violate workplace safety laws. It will also \nprotect whistleblowers who bravely speak out about unsafe work \nconditions for themselves, their coworkers, and their families. This \nlegislation protects the public's right to know about safety violations \nand about OSHA investigations. It will also help us track and respond \nto workplace safety issues by requiring tracking of worker injuries.\n  Nothing can bring back the workers lost in Texas City; Port \nWentworth, GA; West Texas; the Deepwater Horizon disaster; or the many \ntens of thousands of other workers who have lost their lives on the \njob. But we owe it to those who have died and to their surviving \nfamilies to learn from those accidents and to try to stop them from \nhappening so that other families do not have to suffer the same loss.\n  Good jobs are safe jobs, and I believe this bill will help us create \nsafer workplaces. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Murray in \nsupporting the Protecting America's Workers Act.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe that we in Congress should be \nworking to grow the economy from the middle out, not from the top down, \nand we should make sure that our government is working for all of our \nfamilies, not just the wealthiest few. An important part of this is \nmaking sure that workers have access to a safe and healthy workplace \nand the basic protection of earning a living without fearing for their \nsafety.\n  That effort takes on special meaning today. April 28, today, is \nWorkers' Memorial Day, the day when we remember those who lost their \nlives just for doing their job. When a worker is injured or is killed \non the job, it has devastating impacts for their families and their \ncommunities. In 2014, more than 4,500 workers were killed on the job. \nThat is more than 12 deaths every single day.\n  So we need to do everything we can to make sure employers are taking \nthe necessary precautions to keep their workers safe.\n  So today, let's keep the families and communities that have suffered \nfrom these losses in our thoughts, and let's make sure this Workers' \nMemorial Day is about recommitting ourselves to improving safety \nprotections at workplaces across the country. Every worker in every \nindustry should have basic worker protections. While workers are doing \ntheir jobs, employers should be doing everything they can to protect \nthem.\n\n  In 1970, Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act to \nprotect workers from unsafe working conditions. Back in 1970, that law \nfinally gave workers some much needed protection so they could earn a \nliving without sacrificing their health or safety.\n  Since then, of course, American industry has changed significantly. \nBusinesses have become more complex. Workers are performing 21st-\ncentury tasks, but we are still using a 1970s approach to protect \nemployees. That doesn't make sense, and it is time for it to change.\n  I support the bill Senator Franken introduced today called Protecting \nAmerica's Workers Act. I want to note that Senator Franken is the new \nranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nSubcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety. In that role, he will \nbring a focus and a passion for moving this legislation forward, and I \nlook forward to working with him to that end.\n  The Protecting America's Workers Act is a long overdue update to the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act and is a good step toward making \nworkplaces across America safer and healthier. The legislation will \nincrease protections for workers who report unsafe working conditions, \nand adding these whistleblower protections will protect workers from \nretaliation. The bill will make sure workers have the option to appeal \nto Federal courts if they are being mistreated for telling the truth \nabout dangerous practices. This bill will also improve reporting, \ninspection, and enforcement of workplace health and safety violations. \nIt expands the rights of victims of unsafe workplaces and makes sure \nemployers quickly improve unsafe workplaces to avoid further \nendangering worker health and safety because we owe it to all workers \nto make sure they are truly protected on the job.\n  Our economy is finally recovering after the worst downturn since the \nGreat Depression. We are not all the way back yet, and there is a lot \nmore that needs to be done to create jobs and help our middle class and \nworking families. But while we continue that work, we must also \nrecommit to our bedrock responsibilities to workers and their safety. \nWorkers should be able to go to work confident their employers are \ndoing their part to provide safe and healthy workplaces, and they \nshould know their government is looking out for them, their families, \nand their economic security.\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to reflect on the workers who lost their \nlives this past year. I am hopeful we can honor their legacy by working \ntogether to pass the Protecting America's Workers Act and make these \ncommonsense updates to meet our obligations to the best workforce in \nthe world and continue our work growing the economy from the middle \nout, not the top down.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Reed) (by request):\n  S. 1118. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense and for military \nconstruction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Reed and I are introducing, by \nrequest, the administration's proposed National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2016. As is the case with any bill that is \nintroduced by request, we introduce this bill for the purpose of \nplacing the administration's proposals before Congress and the public \nwithout expressing our own views on the substance of these proposals. \nAs Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, we look \nforward to giving the administration's requested legislation our most \ncareful review and thoughtful consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Tillis, and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 1120. A bill to make aliens associated with a criminal gang \ninadmissable, deportable, and ineligible for various forms of relief; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a bill I am \nintroducing today with my colleagues from North Carolina, Senators \nTillis and Burr, related to criminal gangs. Our bill would reform our \nimmigration laws to protect the homeland and the public's safety by \nensuring that criminal gang members are not eligible for deportation \nrelief and are swiftly removed from the country.\n  Under current immigration laws, alien gang members are generally not \ndeportable or inadmissible based on their gang membership, and they are \neligible for various benefits and forms of relief.\n  Just this month, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, \nadmitted it erred in granting deferred deportation to a known gang \nmember who is now charged with four counts of 1st degree murder in \nNorth Carolina. In response to a letter Senator Tillis and I sent them, \nUSCIS stated that Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez's request for \ndeferred deportation under President Obama's Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals, DACA, executive order ``should not have been \napproved'' based on its procedures and protocols. This individual was \nplaced in the removal process in March 2012, following drug charges, \nbut was shielded from removal by USCIS even though the agency knew of \nhis gang membership. After having received DACA, Mr. Rangel-Hernandez \nallegedly murdered four people.\n  Secretary Johnson testified today before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and said, ``If you are a member of a gang, a known member of \na criminal gang, you should not receive DACA. You should be considered \npriority for removal.'' The Secretary said that Rangel-Hernandez should \nnot have been approved for DACA, and that there was a lapse in the \nbackground checks for this applicant.\n  The Rangel-Hernandez case shows that USCIS is not doing a thorough \njob reviewing the individuals who it allows\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\nto stay in this country under the President's deferred action program. \nIt remains unclear whether USCIS has a zero tolerance policy for \ncriminals and criminal gang members applying for DACA, or any other \nimmigration benefit or form of relief from removal. It is unclear how \nmany individuals have received DACA that shouldn't have. So far, since \n2013, 282 individuals who are known gang members or criminals have had \ntheir DACA benefit terminated. The review of all cases, as ordered by \nSecretary Johnson, is ongoing, so that number could climb.\n  In April 2015, nearly 1,000 gang members and associates from 239 \ndifferent gangs were arrested in 282 cities across the U.S. during \nProject Wildfire, a 6-week operation led by U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement's, ICE, Homeland Security Investigations. Of those \narrested, 199 were foreign nationals from 18 countries in South and \nCentral America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Caribbean.\n  The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director expressed concern \nabout criminal gangs and said, ``Criminal gangs inflict violence and \nfear upon our communities, and without the attention of law \nenforcement, these groups can spread like a cancer.''\n  Despite the concern about violent criminal gangs, ICE arrests are \ndown. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, ``arrests peaked \nin 2012, then dropped by more than 25 percent in 2013, and continued to \ndecline in 2014.''\n  Furthermore, under the Fourth Circuit's decision in Holder v. \nMartinez, former gang members may argue that their status as a former \ngang member similarly entitles them to remain in the United States. \nThis ruling has opened the door to violent gang members renouncing \ntheir membership as a ruse to stay in the country. Unfortunately, the \nDepartment of Justice didn't appeal the ruling, signaling support for \ngang members to remain in the country.\n  The Grassley-Tillis-Burr bill seeks to ensure that alien gang members \nare not provided a safe haven in the United States. It defines a \ncriminal alien gang, renders them inadmissible and deportable, and \nrequires the government to detain them while awaiting deportation. The \nbill also prohibits criminal alien gang members from gaining U.S. \nimmigration benefits such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status, \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile visas, deferred action or parole, with \nlimited exceptions for law enforcement purposes. Lastly, the bill \nprovides an expedited removal process for terrorists, criminal aliens \nand gang members.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that our immigration laws, and the \nadministration's policies, must be reformed so that those who pose a \nthreat to the public are not allowed to remain in the United States and \ntake advantage of the benefits we provide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Franken):\n  S. 1122. A bill to provide that chapter 1 of title 9 of the United \nStates Code, relating to the enforcement of arbitration agreements, \nshall not apply to enrollment agreements made between students and \ncertain institutions of higher education, and to prohibit limitations \non the ability of students to pursue claims against certain \ninstitutions of higher education; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

A bill to reform the authorities of the Federal Government \nto require the production of certain business records, conduct \nelectronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, \nand use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, \ncounterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, almost 2 years ago, Vermonters and the \nAmerican people learned for the first time the shocking details of the \nNational Security Agency's dragnet collection program. Relying on a \ndeeply flawed interpretation of section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, the \nNSA has been indiscriminately sweeping up Americans' private telephone \nrecords for years.\n  It is long past time to end this bulk collection program. Americans \nhave made clear that they will not tolerate such intrusion into their \nprivate lives. The President has called for an end to bulk collection \nunder section 215. The Director of National Intelligence and the \nAttorney General supported legislation last year that would have shut \nthis program down. National security experts have testified that the \nprogram is not necessary, and the American technology industry has \ncalled for meaningful reform of this program because it has lost \nbillions to competitors in the international marketplace due to a \ndecline in the public's trust.\n  Yet in the face of this overwhelming consensus, Congress has failed \nto act. Last year, when we had an opportunity to pass my bipartisan \nlegislation to end this program and reform other surveillance \nauthorities, some Members of this body chose to play political games \nrather than engage in constructive debate.\n  The time for posturing and theatrics is over. It is time for Congress \nto answer to the American people.\n  Today, I--along with Senator Mike Lee--introduce the USA FREEDOM Act \nof 2015. This bipartisan bill is also being introduced in the House \ntoday by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, House Judiciary Committee \nchairman Bob Goodlatte, ranking member John Conyers, and a large \nbipartisan group of House Judiciary Committee members.\n  If enacted, our bill will be the most significant reform to \ngovernment surveillance authorities since the USA PATRIOT Act was \npassed nearly 14 years ago. Most importantly, our bill will \ndefinitively end the NSA's bulk collection program under section 215. \nIt also guarantees unprecedented transparency about government \nsurveillance programs, allows the FISA Court to appoint an amicus to \nassist it in significant cases, and brings the national security letter \nstatutes in line with the First Amendment.\n  The bipartisan, bicameral bill we introduce today is the product of \nintense and careful negotiations. It enacts strong, meaningful reforms \nwhile ensuring that the intelligence community has the tools it needs \nto keep this country safe.\n  Some will say that this bill does not go far enough. I agree. But in \norder to secure broader support for reform legislation that can pass \nboth the House and Senate and be signed into law, changes had to be \nmade to the bill that I introduced last year. This new bill\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\ndoes not contain all the reforms that I want. It contains some \nprovisions I believe are unnecessary but that were added to secure \nsupport from the House Intelligence Committee. But we should pass it \nand continue fighting for more reform.\n  I have been in the Senate for more than 40 years--and I have learned \nthat when there is a chance to make real progress, we have to seize it. \nThis is not my first fight and certainly will not be my last. I have a \nresponsibility to Vermonters and the American people to do everything I \ncan to end the dragnet collection of their phone records under section \n215. And I know for a fact that the upcoming June 1 sunset of section \n215 is our best opportunity for real reform. We cannot squander it.\n  Last year, a broad and bipartisan coalition worked together to craft \nreasonable and responsible legislation. Critics resorted to scare \ntactics. They would not even agree to debate the bill. I hope that we \ndo not see a repeat of that ill-fated strategy again this year. The \nAmerican people have had enough of delay and brinksmanship. Congress \nnow has an opportunity to show leadership and govern responsibly.\n  The intelligence community is deeply concerned about the possibility \nof a legislative standoff that could result in the expiration of \nsection 215 altogether. The USA FREEDOM Act is a path forward that has \nthe support of the administration, privacy groups, the technology \nindustry--and most importantly, the American people. I urge \ncongressional leaders to take up and swiftly pass the USA FREEDOM Act \nof 2015--because I will not vote for reauthorization of section 215 \nwithout meaningful reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/28/senate-section/article/S2480-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 152--RECOGNIZING THREATS TO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND \n EXPRESSION AROUND THE WORLD AND REAFFIRMING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AS A \n    PRIORITY IN EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE \n                     DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

combat the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction; prevent piracy; improve global \n     health; promote human rights; contribute to economic \n     development around the world; and assist the victims of \n     conflict and disaster worldwide;\n       Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and \n     Japan share a commitment to free and open markets, high \n     standards for the free flow of commerce and trade, and the \n     establishment of an inclusive architecture for regional and \n     global trade and development;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also reiterated that \n     his cabinet will uphold the stance on the recognition of \n     history of previous prime ministers, including the Murayama \n     statement;\n       Whereas the United States-Japan security alliance has \n     evolved considerably over many decades and will continue to \n     transform as a partnership, sharing greater responsibilities, \n     dedicated to ensuring a secure and prosperous region and \n     world;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan has reinterpreted its \n     constitution to allow for the collective self-defense of its \n     allies, including the United States, an action that \n     strengthens the alliance's ability to defend Japan and to \n     continue to safeguard regional security;\n       Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is essential for \n     ensuring maritime security and freedom of navigation, \n     commerce, and overflight in the waters of the East China Sea;\n       Whereas Japan stands as a strong partner of the United \n     States in efforts to uphold respect for the rule of law and \n     to oppose the use of coercion, intimidation, or force to \n     change the regional or global status quo, including in the \n     East and South China Seas, which are among the busiest \n     waterways in the world;\n       Whereas the United States and Japan are committed to \n     working together towards a world where the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) does not threaten global \n     peace and security with its weapons of mass destruction and \n     illicit activities, and where the DPRK respects human rights \n     and people can live in freedom;\n       Whereas the United States and Japan have a long history of \n     successful technical cooperation and joint scientific \n     research and development;\n       Whereas, on May 7, 1843, the first Japanese immigrants \n     arrived in the United States, and Japanese-Americans have \n     made significant contributions to the advancement, including \n     our former colleague, the late Senator Daniel Inouye, of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas people-to-people ties between the United States and \n     Japan are long-standing and deep, as exemplified by the gift \n     of the beautiful cherry trees which dot our nation's capital \n     from the People of Japan to the People of the United States \n     in 1912, signifying an unbreakable bond between the two \n     nations; and\n       Whereas, on April 29, 2015, Prime Minister Abe will address \n     a Joint Meeting of Congress at the invitation of the Speaker \n     of the House: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.
