Mr. President, it has been 164 days--164 very long, long \ndays, especially for a woman by the name of Loretta Lynch. Her \nnomination is languishing here in the Republican limbo that they have \ncreated. For 6 months Senate Republicans have looked for any and every \nreason to push back confirmation of this good woman to be Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Does anyone know why? Can a single Republican Senator tell us why? \nThe answer is no. Her qualifications are impeccable. She has some \nbipartisan support. But again, for unknown reasons, Republican support \nseems to be disappearing. Is there a single Republican Senator who can \ncome here to the Senate floor and give an explanation that does not \nabsolutely smack of political foolishness?\n  Republicans do not know why Loretta Lynch has not yet been \nconfirmed--just listen to what Congressman Peter King said. By the way, \nPeter King is a Republican from New York.\n\n       All you've heard from our party for a very long time is how \n     much contempt they have for Holder. Now they're presented \n     with Loretta Lynch, who is by far the best attorney general \n     they could ever have expected this President to appoint, and \n     they still hold the thing up. . . . And for what? Because \n     they think it scores them a few political points? With whom?\n\n  That is the irony of it all. Republicans have held Ms. Lynch's \nnomination hostage for nothing more than political purposes. Here is \nsomething I will read to the people within the sound of my voice, which \nis a direct quote from the New York Daily News editorial.\n\n       The Republicans in the Senate, the meanest and most narrow-\n     minded among them occasionally acting as if they want the \n     Democrats to have the White House into the next century, need \n     to free Loretta Lynch this week.\n       They need to stop using abortion language in an anti-\n     trafficking bill for cover, they need to stop using Lynch's \n     support for President Obama on immigration as cover, they \n     need to stop insulting Lynch the way they have for months as \n     they have delayed a vote on confirming her as our next \n     attorney general for the simple reason that they can.\n       The issue here was never Loretta Lynch's policies, always \n     about President Obama's. They have used her to get at him, \n     because to the end they remain obsessed with getting at him. \n     No wonder Jeb Bush stood up for Lynch in New Hampshire. Bush \n     didn't just show grace in doing that, he also showed more \n     common sense than his brother showed in eight years as \n     President.\n       Jeb Bush has to know that Sen. Mitch McConnell hijacking \n     this process does him absolutely no good, the way it does him \n     no good to have McConnell as an important voice and face of \n     the Republican Party. As long as McConnell is, too many \n     voters completely wide-open about the upcoming Presidential \n     campaign will continue to think the party is still owned and \n     operated by scrubs who think they can push around Loretta \n     Lynch for sport.\n\n  ``Pushing around Loretta Lynch for sport'' is certainly how it seems. \nHow else can you explain the Republicans changing the subject every \ntime her name comes up? Every time Ms. Lynch's confirmation is \ndiscussed, they change the subject. Every time when asked, Republicans \ndeflect: ``next Congress'' or ``after Keystone'' or ``after we try and \nshut down Homeland Security,'' and, of course, the newest, ``after \ntrafficking.''\n  President Obama put it best last Friday when he said:\n\n       Nobody can describe a reason for it beyond political \n     gamesmanship in the Senate. I have\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\n     to say that there are times where the dysfunction in the \n     Senate just goes too far. This is an example of it.\n\n  He said: ``This is embarrassing.''\n  It is embarrassing. It is embarrassing for the Senate and for our \nNation. Even Republicans--I should say some Republicans--are \nembarrassed. They know there is no rationale for delaying a vote for \nAmerica's chief law enforcement officer. There is no reason that we \ncannot confirm Loretta Lynch today--right now, even. There is nothing \npreventing the majority leader from coming to the Senate floor \nimmediately and moving the Senate into executive session for \nconsideration of Ms. Lynch's nomination.\n  Why then is the majority leader determined to make her wait until \nafter the trafficking legislation is approved? Why? We are now spending \nthe first 2 weeks of this current work period finishing two matters--\nhuman trafficking and her nomination. These two matters could have been \ncompleted months ago. Everyone is aware of what has transpired with the \nhuman trafficking bill.\n  It is sufficient to say that Republicans tried to pull a fast one on \nthe American people. Republicans attempted to broaden a precedent that \ntraditionally prevents Federal funds for paying for abortion, except in \ncases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk. This \nis commonly known as the Hyde language. The Hyde language has applied \nto taxpayer dollars. Republicans want to change that to apply to \nnontaxpayer dollars.\n  It was a failed political ploy, and it is no surprise, then, that the \nRepublicans are scrambling to save their necks after trying to dupe \nAmerican women. My Republican colleagues appear to be close to seeing \nthe light on human trafficking, and there seems to be a path forward. \nBut there is no guarantee that we can do it. As of right now, we do not \nhave an agreement in place to put the finishing touches on our work on \nthe bill. But we are working on that goal. The progress we have made is \ndue almost entirely to the good-faith efforts of Senators Murray, \nLeahy, and Amy Klobuchar.\n  When are Republicans going to see the light on Loretta Lynch? When \nwill the majority leader realize he continues to obstruct a qualified \nnominee for absolutely no reason? The Senate should turn to a vote on \nMs. Lynch's nomination immediately. Every day that passes without a \nnewly confirmed Attorney General proves once and again that Republicans \ncannot lead and they certainly cannot govern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2260-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as we all know, a vote of confirmation \nfor Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General has now been delayed \n164 days, or 5 months. We have seen this qualified woman waiting for a \nconfirmation vote, and we have had at least 51 Members--a majority--\nindicating they will support her confirmation.\n  I remember coming to the floor listening to colleagues during the \nBush administration state over and over again that elections have \nconsequences, that Presidents have a right to have their nominees voted \non, and that it is our responsibility to make sure, if something comes \nout of committee, that we vote on a final confirmation.\n  When we look at the fact that we have seen Loretta Lynch wait for a \nvote on the floor for a combined length of time that equals more than \nthe last seven Attorneys General, I really do believe, as the President \nhas said, enough is enough.\n  I remember a time when we had a controversial nominee--John \nAshcroft--and many of us did not support that nomination. I did not \nsupport that nomination. But we brought it to the floor for a vote. He \nwaited 42 days. At the time, people said that was a long time. He was \nnot blocked. We did not filibuster. We did not require a supermajority. \nIn fact, there were 42 of us who voted no, so we could have stopped it \non a procedural vote. But we allowed the nomination of John Ashcroft to \ncome to the floor for a vote.\n  So we fast-forward. And we have seen this, of course, over and over \nagain, as we look at the President's nominees in the last 6\\1/2\\ years. \nNow we see this eminently qualified woman, who has been held up as of \ntoday 164 days, waiting and waiting to have the opportunity to have a \nvote up or down on confirmation. If people want to vote no, they have \nthat right, but she deserves a vote.\n  Today, we are going to vote on the confirmation of a district court \njudge in Texas. I think it is good that the Southern District of Texas \nwill have a Federal court judge, but the entire country needs a \npermanent Attorney General. In fact, the Attorney General's office is \nthe one that actually brings the cases to Federal courts and tries them \non behalf of all the American people. So it is really ridiculous that \nwe stand at this point where we are having to ask, after more than 5 \nmonths, that there be a vote for Loretta Lynch.\n  After she was reported out, we saw a very distinguished nominee for \nSecretary of Defense come out of committee and immediately come to the \nfloor and be confirmed, but Loretta Lynch has waited and waited. We \ncontinue to vote on district judges, and Loretta Lynch is waiting and \nwaiting.\n  We hear all kinds of excuses, all kinds of reasons. We are hearing \nthat Loretta Lynch's nomination to be Attorney General cannot be voted \non until we complete another very important bill--the human trafficking \nbill--that we all want to get done. It has, unfortunately, had a curve \nball added because of the politics around choice and abortion that has \nbeen interjected into this, and we are having to work our way through \nthat. I have been involved in a lot of discussions, as my colleagues \nhave. I am confident we can address those if people want to get this \ndone on behalf of girls and women in our country. But that has nothing \nto do with the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General, other \nthan one thing, which is that as U.S. attorney of the Eastern District \nof New York, she presided over a very effective antitrafficking \nprogram, investigating and prosecuting scores of defendants.\n\n  In that sense, again, we need Loretta Lynch--her talent, her \nexpertise, and her experience--to be able to tackle what is a horrible \nsituation that way too many of our girls and women find themselves in. \nWe somehow for too long have thought this was something that was \nhappening someplace else. Yet we saw it in Lansing, MI--where I live, \nthe capital of Michigan--where there was a case in the trafficking \nsituation that the FBI and local officials addressed. What we are \nfinding right now is that as we proceed with confirming other people \nfor other positions--Monday nights we are voting on other positions, we \nare voting on district judges, and we voted on other people for other \npositions not held up by human trafficking, not held up by trying to \nget that bill resolved, but for some reason the Attorney General \nposition has somehow been held up.\n  I don't buy it. It makes no sense that we would pick one person--one \nperson--not others but one person and decide that this person and this \nnomination, this confirmation vote will be held hostage to another \nissue. It is time to stop it. Now, 164 days is long enough; 164 days is \nlong enough. It is time to give Loretta Lynch the respect and the vote \nshe has been waiting for and she deserves.\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n  I yield back the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this body--the Senate--continues to rush \nthrough one of the most consequential changes to U.S. economic policy \nthis decade with little media attention, little scrutiny by committees, \nand little discussion from leadership of this Senate. Last week, we \nwere called into a rushed legislative hearing on fast-track and a trade \npackage with little notice and no bill to see. We had less than 13 \nhours' notice for a committee meeting--the standard here is 1 week, and \nI believe that is the Senate rule--on one of the most secretive \ndocuments we have seen in front of us. Senators and their staffs, \nCongress men and women and their staffs, have limited access to this \ndocument--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--and no access to legislation \nupon which we had a hearing on Thursday. It was only after the hearing \nthat they finally decided to introduce the bill. Yet, this affects more \nthan 50 percent of the world's GDP. Fifty percent of the world's GDP \ncould be affected by this package. Millions of American jobs are on the \nline. Yet, Congress is rushing this bill through.\n  We cannot fast-track fast-track legislation. We know what so-called \nfree trade has done to this country. It may not affect too many people \nwho dress like this in this town, people who wear expensive suits, but \nfor those in the heartland and in places such as Des Moines and Iowa \nCity and Columbus and Cleveland, we know bad trade deals have \ndevastated towns.\n  I grew up in Mansfield, OH. When I was a kid, we had thousands of \njobs at Westinghouse, Ohio Brass, Mansfield Tire, Fisher Body, Goreman-\nRupp, and so many other companies. Almost all of those companies have \nshut down--not just because of globalization and bad trade deals, but \ncertainly that contributed to it. Every one of those companies that \nhasn't shut down has laid off, in most cases, thousands of its workers.\n  On Friday, I was in Dayton, where I spoke with Jimmy Allen. Jimmy \nworked at Appleton Paper for 45 years. He was a union officer for 43 of \nthose years. He was one of 400 workers laid off due to unfair trade in \n2012 when China cheated on currency, undermining the U.S. paper \nindustry.\n  I hear all the time from workers like Jimmy. George Rossi of Warren, \nOH--at the other end of the State--wrote to me to share his story. He \nwrote:\n\n       My wife lost her job of 15 years at GE in Ravenna, OH \n     because of foreign trade. The plant that once employed 600 is \n     now closed. My brother-in-law lost his [job] at Ohio Lamp in \n     Warren, which is now closed. My plant, WCI Steel, is now \n     closed. At one time the plant employed 1,800 people.\n\n  George wrote: I could go on and on. There have been many friends and \nfamily, so many who have worked in numerous plants that are now \nclosed--in large part because of bad foreign trade deals.\n  Jamie Vaughan wrote to me saying that Jamie's father and Jamie's \ngrandfather worked at Ford in Canton, OH, until it shut down. Jamie's \nfather was able to transfer to Indianapolis, where Jamie and Jamie's \nbrother also worked, until that Ford plant shut down too. Jamie wrote:\n\n       They built a plant exactly like Indy's in Brazil. My \n     brother and I transferred to California. A few years later, \n     that plant shut down.\n\n  I got a letter from Gary Ordway of Continental, OH, about how factory \nclosures have ripple effects across entire communities. He wrote:\n\n       In 1995 I was employed with General Motors Powertrain \n     Foundry in Defiance, OH, where we were working 12 hours a \n     day, 6 to 7 days a week, and then along came the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement. There were over 5,000 \n     employees working at that time, and after NAFTA there was a \n     constant loss of jobs, so today, there are about 1,000 \n     employees left. We are looking at a weekly loss of $4.8 \n     million in wages to the local economy and around $1.2 million \n     in weekly taxes lost due to the 4,000 jobs exported because \n     of NAFTA. Within the next couple of years the foundry will be \n     losing all of its iron castings and another 350 jobs will be \n     eliminated, and Plant One is scheduled to be torn town. So \n     NAFTA wasn't good for our community and foundry because our \n     iron casting business went to Mexico.\n\n  That was Gary Ordway of northwest Ohio. We have seen it in the \nnorthwest and we have seen it in the southwest.\n  Joseph Hicks from Elyria, OH, wrote:\n\n       I am a member of Local 1104 in Lorain. I work at U.S. Steel \n     tubular division. As of the 22nd of March, me and 600 of my \n     brothers and sisters have been placed on indefinite layoff, \n     some departments idled, due to lack of work. This is mainly \n     [because of] the illegal dumping of cheaply-made steel.\n\n  I would add, subsidized steel.\n\n       Foreign countries cut corners on safety, pay workers next \n     to nothing, and don't care about quality. With these \n     ingredients, they are able to sell their steel products for a \n     lot less than we at U.S. steel can.\n       There used to be a time when ``Made in America'' meant \n     something. I long to see that be the attitude again.\n\n  Joseph goes on:\n\n       I am suffering greatly now because of the trickle-down \n     effect. I am laid off, I have lost my job, my career, my way \n     of life to support my growing and deserving family. I have a \n     wife, Megan, [who] cannot work because she has to care for \n     our 2-year-old disabled daughter.\n       I ask, beg, our public officials . . . do what needs to be \n     done to get American workers back to work.\n\n  That is Joseph from U.S. Steel in Lorain.\n  We owe these workers more than rushed hearings. We owe them more than \nto rubberstamp a deal we have barely been able to read. Keep in mind \nthat we didn't see this bill until Thursday night. We have still not \nhad one hearing on this bill to discuss the bill. The chairman of the \ncommittee wants to do the markup the day after tomorrow, and this bill \nwill govern potentially 60 percent of the world's GDP. So they want to \nfast-track this fast-track legislation so they can pass more trade \nagreements that outsource jobs.\n  Trade done right can create jobs, but our current trade deals amount \nto corporate handouts and worker sellouts.\n  The Economic Policy Institute found that the wage loss to workers on \nthe wrong end of expanded trade is almost certainly larger than the \nestimated net national gains from the TPP. They write that there is no \nsuch thing as an all-gain, no-pain treaty. We know that is true because \nworkers such as Joseph and Jamie and George and Gary and Jimmy feel \nthat pain.\n  I urge my colleagues over the next couple of days to ask the tough \nquestions and demand answers from the U.S. Trade Representative, who \nhas told us little and who has given us even less access to these trade \nagreements, and to say no to a trade deal that will end up fast-\ntracking more jobs overseas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to solemnly observe the 5-\nyear anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, also known as the \nBP disaster. It was a major and deeply tragic incident that resulted in \nthe loss of 11 lives in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond that really \ndevastated the gulf region.\n  I wish to start where we should always start--by remembering in a \nsolemn and prayerful way the 11 men who lost their lives in the \nincident. They were Donald ``Duck'' Clark, 49, of Newellton, LA; \nStephen Ray Curtis, 40, of Georgetown, LA; Gordon Jones, 28, of Baton \nRouge, LA; Roy Wyatt Kemp, 27, of Jonesville, LA; Keith Blair Manuel, \n56, of Gonzalez, LA; Jason Anderson, 35, of Midfield, TX; Adam Weise, \n24, of Yorktown, TX; Aaron Dale Durkeen, 37, of Philadelphia, MS; Karl \nKleppinger, Jr., 38, of Natchez, MS; Dewey Revette, 48, of State Line, \nMS; and Shane Roshto, 22, of Liberty, MS. We lift up those men and \ntheir families in our prayers, and we will continue to keep those men \nwhose lives were lost and continue to keep their families in our \nfervent thoughts and prayers.\n  While 5 years have passed, the effects of the Deepwater Horizon \ntragedy are still felt today in communities all along the gulf coast. \nThe terrible and unnecessary loss of life, the harming of our precious \ncoastal ecosystems, and the persisting economic burdens serve as a \nconstant reminder of the failures that led to the spill, as well as the \nlessons learned in the 5 years since.\n  Poor industry and government oversight and the failure by many \ninvolved to enforce safety regulations were largely responsible for \nmultiple mistakes leading up to the tragedy. As a result, we have \nlearned many lessons on how to prevent future accidents such as this. \nThe first is that the lives and safety of the men and women who work in \nthis field are absolutely paramount and need to be kept so, and the \nFederal and State safety standards overseeing them should reflect that \nas a priority.\n  Changes are needed, and the Federal agencies that oversee and \nregulate the offshore energy industry must communicate clearly with \nState and local governments and impacted industries. They must also do \na better job of enforcing strong, necessary safety and environmental \nstandards.\n  It is also important that we prevent the administration or any future \nadministration from having knee-jerk reactions to incidents such as \nthis. Each gulf coast community remembers the devastating effects of \nthe offshore drilling moratorium that followed the disaster--something \nthat was completely unnecessary, including in the opinion of so many \nexperts. Once the Obama administration imposed this unnecessary \ndrilling moratorium, that decision had crippling results for Louisiana \nand Gulf State economies. When accidents such as this spill happen, \nthere needs to be a calculated, logical, and immediate response in \norder to replace ineffective regulations with rules that focus on \npreserving lives and protecting the environment. It is imperative that \nwe prevent shortsighted Federal mandates and thoughtless regulations \nthat hinder regional recovery and destroy local economies instead.\n  We also learned that there needs to be a clear and specific judicial \npenalty process in place in order to ensure that claims can be \nefficiently filed and finalized in order to let those who are affected \nby such disasters return to some sense of normalcy, day-to-day \nnormalcy, and economic normalcy as quickly as possible. This should \ninclude insuring responsible parties such as BP are timely in paying \ntheir judicially and statutorily mandated fines and penalties. There is \nabsolutely no excuse that 5 years later gulf residents, in many cases, \nare still waiting for the responsible parties to fulfill their legal \nobligations, including under the RESTORE Act.\n  As we remember the Deepwater Horizon tragedy today, let us renew our \ncommitment to work on all of these matters and to finish the work that \nis left to do as our gulf coastlines and economies continue to recover.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, 5 years ago today, 11 Americans were \nlost when the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the gulf coast. I would \nlike to name them. This is hard. These were the people we grew up with. \nI apologize for being emotional, but these are our neighbors, and so to \nremember them--Jason Anderson 35, Midfield, TX. Jason had two kids, and \nhis wife Shelley said that Thanksgiving was his favorite holiday.\n  Aaron Dale ``Bubba'' Burkeen, 37, of Philadelphia, MS. He passed on \nhis wedding anniversary and 4 days before his birthday. He was married \nwith two children.\n  Donald Clark, 49, of Newellton, LA. Husband to Sheila with four kids. \nHe was a fisherman. To honor him on the anniversary of his death, his \nfamily says a prayer and releases balloons over a lake in his favorite \ncolor, which is sky blue.\n  Stephen Ray Curtis, 40, of Georgetown, LA. Stephen was married and \nthe father of two teenagers.\n  Gordon Jones of Baton Rouge, LA. Gordon was 28. His wife was \nMichelle. His son Max was born 3 weeks after Gordon passed. An oak tree \nwas planted on the LSU campus on the path where he ran.\n  Roy Wyatt Kemp, 27, of Jonesville, LA. He was married to Courtney and \nfather of one child.\n  Karl Kleppinger, Jr., 38, of Natchez, MS. He was a veteran of the \nfirst gulf war and the father of one.\n  Keith Blair Manuel, 56, of Gonzales, LA. Keith had three daughters, \nwas a big fan of LSU sports, and had football and basketball season \ntickets.\n  Dewey A. Revette, 48, of State Line, MS. His wife was Sherri. They \nhad been married for 26 years.\n  Shane M. Roshto, 22, of Liberty, MS. He was the youngest of the men \nwho died. His wife was Natalie, and his son is Blaine.\n  Adam Weise, 24, of Yorktown, TX. Adam drove 10 hours to Louisiana \nevery 3 weeks to work on the rig. He was a high school football star \nand spent his off time hunting and fishing.\n  We pray that the families find peace in the memories of their sons, \nhusbands, and fathers.\n  The spill was the worst in our Nations's history, and while the \nconsequences of this spill are still seen, it is our task to live \nforward and, in so doing, honor the memory of these men and provide a \nbetter future for their families.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a moment of \nsilence to honor their memory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is 5 in the afternoon. Exactly 5 \nyears ago, at 5 p.m., the crew of the Deepwater Horizon mobile oil \ndrilling unit began what is called a negative pressure test of the \nMacondo prospect oil formation. A cascade of menacing events followed \nthe first failed test.\n  At around 9:40 that evening, drilling mud began gushing out onto the \nrig. The well had kicked. The crew activated the rig's blowout \npreventer 1 mile below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, down at the \nbottom of the gulf.\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nTragically, the blowout preventer failed. At 9:49 p.m., there was an \nexplosion on the rig floor. The Deepwater Horizon rig quickly became an \ninferno. Eleven men died. Eleven families were changed forever.\n  As morning came the next day, an oil sheen 2 miles long and a half \nmile wide shone on the surface of the waters of the gulf as the blaze \non the rig continued. Those images are seared into our collective \nmind's eyes. So the owner of the well, BP, and the owner and operator \nof the rig, Transocean, tried and failed again to close the blowout \npreventer that evening. Then days later, on Earth Day, April 22, at \n10:22 a.m., the rig on the surface of the gulf sank.\n  If we can remember, we were first told the sheen that was 2 miles \nlong and a half mile wide came from the drums of diesel onboard the \nrig. Then later, a revision was made that 1,000 barrels of oil a day \nwere leaking from the well a mile below the surface of the gulf. Then \nthat was changed to 5,000 barrels of oil per day and then to 25,000 \nbarrels of oil a day. But none of those estimates were true. Scientists \nlooking at the sheen from aerial observations started to grow very \nskeptical about what BP engineers were telling them.\n  On the environment committee, Chairman Boxer and I started to turn up \nthe public pressure to get BP to turn over live footage of 1 mile below \nthe surface of the gulf, where the oil was escaping. We wanted to see \nhow much oil the cameras were showing was escaping from the well. The \nspill was not out of mind; it was out of sight. As it turned out, \nunbelievably, 62,000 barrels of oil a day were gushing into the gulf \ninto what is one of our most productive ecosystems on the planet. But \nwe would never have gotten that had scientists not been able to make \ntheir estimates by virtue of the live-streaming video that Senator \nBoxer and I put up on our Web sites so people--unencumbered, around the \nglobe--could make their estimates. This is a prime example of why we \nmust independently verify what oil companies tell us about a spill.\n  As we got into the summer, the prime of the summer beach season, \nespecially at our beaches in Florida, that was devastating. Nearly 37 \npercent of gulf waters were closed to fishing. BP and its contractors \nhad no control of the runaway well. On July 15, in the middle of the \nsummer--87 days after the explosion--BP finally stopped the oil flow.\n  Today is the anniversary. Our hearts collectively go out to the \nfamilies that lost the 11 men.\n  If we don't learn from this experience, shame on us. It will come \nback to haunt us, and in many ways it already has.\n  If we start at the bottom of the food chain, there are impacts to the \ngulf environment. Bull minnows, or killifish--little fish about that \nsize--root around in the sediment of the bays of Louisiana. In those \noiled Louisiana marshes, these little killifish are showing grotesquely \ndeformed gill tissue. And when the killifish embryos were exposed to \noil sediment, they showed heart defects, and many failed to hatch.\n  Two LSU professors told me shortly after they had done the research \nabout a year after the spill that they found that the killifish in \ntheir reproductive cycle were mutated. They compared them to the \nkillifish in the bays that did not have the oil come in, and there was \na distinct difference between the two.\n  As we go up the food chain, the top predators face threats from the \noil. Scientists have found unusual lung damage, hormone abnormalities, \nand low blood cell counts up the food chain in dolphins that were \nexposed to the oil. And we are not going to know the full extent of the \nimpact for years, even decades.\n  As a matter of fact, somebody said a few months after the BP spill \nhad been contained that there was no more oil in the gulf. There is a \nlot of oil in the gulf. We just can't see it. It is down there a mile \nbelow the surface. And what are the effects on the health, the future \nhealth of the gulf? We don't know, but we are going to have to research \nit.\n  But even with all we learned back in 2010, to this very day, oil \ninfrastructure in the gulf--this is just unbelievable--operated by the \nTaylor Energy Company continues to leak crude oil since one of the \nhurricanes years ago. In 2004, a hurricane caused an underwater \nmudslide that damaged a cluster of oil wells off of Louisiana. Need I \nremind the Senate, June 1 is the beginning of hurricane season. So if \nwe are visited by another hurricane, and if it does as it did in 2004, \n11 years ago, having a cluster of Taylor wells that got buried in an \nundersea mudslide from the hurricane--but the wells are still leaking \n11 years later--what is going to happen to other oil structures in the \ngulf if the big one comes?\n  According to the Associated Press investigation, the actual flow rate \nof those Taylor wells may be 20 times higher than originally reported. \nWe have seen this episode before. I don't think we want to repeat this.\n  It is so frightening. I asked the Secretary of Homeland Security and \nthe Secretary of the Interior to provide any and all images of the \nTaylor spill. The Congress, in our oversight responsibility, has the \nright to that information. We have to know how much oil is escaping, \nand then we have to figure out how to stop it from underneath the \nundersea mudslide that covered up that cluster of wells.\n  In the coming weeks in the Senate commerce committee we are going to \nexamine what we have learned in 5 years since the Deepwater Horizon \nexplosion. In 2012, our bipartisan RESTORE Act got overwhelming votes \nin both the House and the Senate. The RESTORE Act is a formula with \nwhich to send the money that ultimately Judge Barbier of the Federal \ndistrict court in New Orleans will decide as a result of the number of \nbarrels spilled and the culpability of the company. As a result of \nthat, money will flow. It will flow back to the local governments, it \nwill flow back to help the economies of the gulf, and it will flow back \nin order to try to protect our environment. There is more to be done. I \nintend to introduce legislation to make sure we prevent, prepare for, \nand effectively respond to the next oil spill.\n  As we reflect on the tragic events of April 20, 2010, I hope the \nSenate will be mindful of this tragedy in the gulf, which riveted the \nattention of the Nation, that seemed out of control for 3 months, and \nof which we will have the very infernal consequences for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. NELSON. Of course.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2263-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2263-S2265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF GEORGE C. HANKS, JR., TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                   FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of George C. Hanks, Jr., of \nTexas, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 16 minutes \nof debate remaining on the nomination.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do I have 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, tonight, the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of George Hanks to be a district judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas. If confirmed, Judge Hanks will be the President's \n309th judicial nominee confirmed since this President took office. By \ncomparison, at the same point in his Presidency, President Bush had \nonly 273 judicial nominees confirmed.\n  Despite some of the complaints that we are hearing from my colleagues \non the other side, we are moving judicial nominees at about the same \npace as we did at this point in President Bush's Presidency. One \ndifference, of course, is how the Senate handled the judicial nominees \nthat were reported out of the committee during the lameduck session.\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\n  Historically, the Senate doesn't confirm judges at the end of a \nCongress if those judges are reported out of committee during a \nlameduck. The reason for this, of course, is so the newly elected \nMembers have an opportunity for their voices to be heard. For instance, \nthat is what happened in 2006 when the Senate returned 13 judicial \nnominees to the President. Those nominees were then renominated in 2007 \nand eventually confirmed in the new Congress, but the Senate Democrats \ndid not follow tradition last year. Instead of following standard \npractice, Senate Democrats confirmed 11 judicial nominees who were \nreported out of committee during the lameduck session. Had they \nfollowed standard practice, we would have voted on those nominees at \nthe beginning of this year, just as the committee did with the nominees \nthat were resubmitted in 2007.\n  At the end of the day, when we include the 11 district court nominees \nwho were confirmed at the end of last year, we are at about the same \npace that the Democratically led Senate was in 2007 during the Bush \nadministration. This is further confirmed when you compare the \ncommittee's work this year to 2007. In 2007, at this point in the \nCongress, the committee had held three nominee hearings for a total of \n10 judges.\n  As of right now, the Judiciary Committee has already held 4 \nnomination hearings for a total of 10 nominees. These nominees include \nsix judges and four executive nominees, including both the Attorney \nGeneral and Deputy Attorney General nominees.\n  The bottom line is the Senate Judiciary Committee is treating the \nPresident's nominees extremely fairly. He has had dozens more nominees \nconfirmed than President Bush did at this point in his Presidency. I \nexpect another one will be confirmed tonight, and I congratulate Judge \nHanks on his pending nomination and urge my colleagues to vote \naccordingly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will be voting to confirm Judge \nGeorge Hanks, who has been nominated to be a Federal district judge in \nthe Southern District of Texas. Judge Hanks is just the second judicial \nnominee that we have voted to confirm more than 3 months into the 114th \nCongress. The slow trickle of confirmations that the new majority has \nallowed is undermining the functioning of our Federal courts and is \nhurting the American people. This past month, the Wall Street Journal \nwrote an alarming article about the backlog of civil cases in our \nFederal courts. One man interviewed for the article filed a Federal law \nsuit in 2007 and is still waiting for his case to be heard. It is \nunconscionable that an American would have to wait 8 years and still \nnot have his day in court. Unfortunately, it is not surprising given \nthat at last count, there were more than 330,000 civil cases pending in \nour Federal courts. This is a record high and an increase of nearly 20 \npercent since 2004.\n  There are steps the Republican majority should take to help our \nFederal courts better serve the American people. First, the Senate \nshould confirm every single one of the nine judicial nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar without further delay. Besides Judge Hanks, there \nare two other Federal district court nominees pending on the Executive \nCalendar, both from States with two Republican home State Senators. \nBoth of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously by voice vote. One of the nominees will fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy in Texas that has remained unfilled for more than 2 \nyears. This type of neglect is unacceptable. In addition, there are \nfive other nominees to the Court of Federal Claims and a nominee for \nthe Court of International Trade. None of these nominees are \ncontroversial and they could easily be confirmed by a simple voice vote \nif Republicans would allow.\n  After today's confirmation vote, there will be 53 vacancies on our \nFederal courts. But even if we filled every one of these vacancies, we \nstill would have to address the growing needs of our co-equal branch of \ngovernment that is struggling with heavy caseloads. Last month, the \nJudicial Conference of the United States, led by Chief Justice John \nRoberts, identified the need for adding 73 permanent judgeships, as \nwell as converting 9 temporary district court judgeships to permanent \nstatus. The Senate should be working in a bipartisan manner to provide \nthe Federal Judiciary with the resources it needs, including the \naddition of woefully-needed additional judgeships.\n  The fact that today we are only voting on the second judicial nominee \nof this Congress shows that the delay and obstruction that we saw from \nRepublicans in the first 6 years of the Obama administration has \ncontinued now that they control the Senate's agenda. One simply needs \nto look at the nomination of Loretta Lynch to understand how \nRepublicans approach our constitutional role of advice and consent. Ms. \nLynch is an eminently qualified nominee and enjoys broad support, yet \nher nomination has now been pending before the full Senate for 53 days. \nThat is more than twice as long as all of the past seven Attorneys \nGeneral combined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; William Barr, 5 days; \nJanet Reno, 1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days, Alberto Gonzales, 8 days; \nMichael Mukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. This delay is an \nembarrassment for the United States Senate. I agree with President \nObama, who said last week that ``there are times where the dysfunction \nin the Senate just goes too far.'' The obstruction of this historic \nnominee has gone on far too long. It is long past time for the Senate \nRepublican leader to allow Ms. Lynch a vote and allow the American \npeople to be served by this outstanding public servant.\n  The judicial nominee we are voting on today, Judge George Hanks, will \nfill a Federal district court vacancy in the Southern District of \nTexas. Since 2010, Judge Hanks has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge \nfor the U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Texas. \nPrior to joining the Federal bench, Judge Hanks was a Court of Appeals \nJustice for the First District of Texas from 2002 to 2010, and a judge \non the 157th Civil District Court of Texas from 2001 to 2002. Before \nbecoming a judge, he was in private practice for nearly a decade. The \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \n``Well Qualified,'' its highest rating. Judge Hanks is supported by his \ntwo Republican home State Senators and his nomination was unanimously \napproved by voice vote by the Judiciary Committee on February 26. He \nhas strong qualifications and should be confirmed without further \ndelay.\n  I urge the Republican Leader to schedule votes to confirm the \nremaining judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar. None of \nthe nominees are controversial. We should do our jobs and vote on their \nnominations so that they can start doing their jobs working for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of George C. Hanks, Jr., of Texas, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I stand with great pleasure and pride, along \nwith Senator Whitehouse, to congratulate the Providence College men's \nhockey team in winning the 2015 NCAA Division I National Championship, \nand I am pleased to have worked with my colleague Senator Whitehouse in \nadopting a resolution last week to honor this great accomplishment.\n  This is the first national championship in the history of PC's men's \nhockey club, and I am sure this season will be long remembered by \nProvidence College players, coaches, staff, and fans.\n  The championship game featured phenomenal plays and contributions \nfrom many Friars players, including a career-high 49 saves by \ngoaltender Jon Gillies, and one goal each from Anthony Florentino, Mark \nJankowski, Tom Parisi, and Brandon Tanev.\n  I would like to congratulate all of the Friars players whose season-\nlong hard work and dedication made this successful season possible. The \n2015 PC men's hockey team consisted of: Rhode Island's own Noel \nAcciari, Mark Adams, Brooks Behling, Alex Cromwell, Logan Day, Stefan \nDemopoulos, Nick Ellis, Anthony Florentino, Jon Gillies, John Gilmour, \nRobbie Hennessey, Mark Jankowski, Brendan Leahy, Shane Luke, Conor \nMacPhee, Ross Mauermann, Kyle McKenzie, Steven McParland, Trevor \nMingoia, Josh Monk, Tom Perisi, Brian Pinho, Truman Reed, Kevin Rooney, \nNiko Rufo, Nick Saracino, Brandon Tanev, and Jake Walman. I will \napologize for my Rhode Island accent.\n  I would also like to extend my best wishes to PC player Drew Brown, \nwho missed this season while battling a rare form of bone cancer and is \nthankfully now reported to be cancer-free. But he contributed in many \nways to the success of the team.\n  Additionally, I want to recognize the coaches and staff whose \ncommitment and preparation was essential to winning this national \nchampionship, especially head coach Nate Leaman, who won the \nchampionship in only his fourth season at PC. The other coaches and \nstaff of the 2015 PC men's hockey team were: associate head coach Steve \nMiller, assistant coach Kris Mayotte, coordinator of Men's Hockey \noperations Kyle Murphy, and goaltending coach Jim McNiff.\n  I also commend Providence College President Father Brian Shanley and \nathletic director Robert Driscoll on their accomplishments and \nextraordinary dedication to the school and to the community of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Again, I join many in the State of Rhode Island and around the hockey \nworld in congratulating the Providence College men's ice hockey team on \ntheir incredible national championship season and wish them continued \nsuccess in the future.\n  I am proud to yield the floor to my colleague Senator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very pleased and also very proud \nto follow the senior Senator and my colleague and to join Senator Reed \nin congratulating our Providence College men's ice hockey team on \nwinning its first-ever national championship. The Friars edged out \nBoston University 4 to 3 a week ago Saturday night in PC's first trip \nto the Frozen Four in 30 years. The BU-PC event was a southern New \nEngland showdown that brought more than 18,000 hockey fans to Boston's \nTD Garden. Playing so close to home, PC had plenty of support from the \nstands. They also had a little bit of good luck, but it was more than \nluck that put Providence College over the top.\n  Those kids played their hearts out, and forward Brandon Tanev's go-\nahead score in the third period to seal the win was no fluke. The \nFriars earned that victory, and Rhode Islanders couldn't be more proud \nof them.\n  Head coach Nate Leaman said that when it gets to be that late in the \nseason and when there is that kind of championship pressure, ``You \nwin,'' he said, ``with guys that are gritty. . . . ''\n  Well, Senator Reed and I are excited to join Providence College \npresident Father Brian Shanley and the entire PC community in \ncelebrating this historic win. Congratulations to Coach Leaman and his \nstaff, to goalie Jon Gillies, who was named Frozen Four Most \nOutstanding Player, and to all the PC players who fought so hard all \nseason to this wonderful result.\n  As junior forward Noel Acciari, a native of Johnston, RI, put it, \n``We might be a small State, but we're hard workers.''\n  Well done, Friars. You are, indeed, hard workers and your hard work \npaid off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2265-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2265-S2266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INSPECTORS GENERAL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the ability of Congress to be a check on \nthe actions of the executive branch is being endangered. One of the \ntools that we in Congress have created to help the government identify \nand correct its mistakes is being obstructed. That tool is the vital \nwork of inspectors general.\n  Inspectors general work in nearly 80 Federal agencies. They perform \naudits, conduct investigations, and issue public reports of their \nfindings and recommendations. They combat waste, fraud, and abuse. \nTheir work is being frustrated, and that is why I am here. To keep an \neye on what is happening inside a government agency, the inspector \ngeneral must be able to access the agency's records. This is exactly \nwhat the law calls for.\n  The Inspector General Act of 1978 directs that all inspectors general \nhave a right to access all records, documents, and other materials. \n``All'' is not the same as ``some.'' If the inspector general deems a \ndocument necessary to do his job, then the agency should turn it over \nimmediately--immediately. But\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nthe clear command of that law is being ignored far too often.\n  Agencies partially comply or refuse to turn over materials after a \nlengthy review and screening process by lawyers for the agency. That is \na step not included in the IG law. The examples range from the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to the FBI, and can you believe it, \neven to the Peace Corps.\n  The excuses vary, but the pattern is very clear. For example, the \nDepartment of Justice Office of Inspector General is reviewing the \nDepartment's use of the material witness statute. That statute \nauthorizes detaining certain witnesses for testimony before a grand \njury.\n  The inspector general was looking into allegations that the civil \nrights and the civil liberties of certain material witnesses may have \nbeen abused. This is just the kind of issue that Congress relies on \ninspectors general to investigate. If the problems are found, the \ninspector general helps our government identify the problem and helps \nDepartment leadership fix these problems.\n  Naturally, the inspector general needed to review the grand jury \ntestimony to decide if the value of that testimony was reasonable, \ngiven the burden imposed on the witnesses. Three U.S. attorneys offices \nand the Department's National Security Division provided the inspector \ngeneral with the grand jury information concerning material witnesses, \nbut the FBI refused to cooperate. The FBI claimed the grand jury \ntestimony could not be shared with the inspector general.\n  This FBI decision to withhold information was a brandnew practice, \nbeginning sometime in 2010. The law was not changed in 2010 so the FBI \ncould do it. The FBI claimed it had the right to refuse to provide the \ninspector general information in over a dozen other categories as well.\n  Remember, the law says the inspector general shall have access to \nall--not some--records, documents, and other materials that they deem \nnecessary to conduct their investigations. Yet the FBI says its \nattorneys will review material first and then decide what it would and \nwould not release to the inspector general.\n  It even gets worse. The FBI claimed it needed the approval of the \nAttorney General or the Deputy Attorney General to provide the \ninformation to the inspector general. This is exactly upside down. \nUnder the law, an inspector general must be independent. Agencies \ncannot be trusted to investigate themselves. If an inspector general \nhad to ask for permission from senior leadership, he would not be truly \nindependent.\n  The Inspector General Act of 1978 does allow the Attorney General, \nnot the FBI, to prohibit the inspector general from carrying out or \ncompleting an investigation but only in certain limited circumstances.\n  When that extraordinary step is taken, it must be done in writing to \nthe inspector general, and the inspector general must forward that \nwritten notice to the Congress. The FBI would have us believe that \ninstead of written notice being required to block an IG investigation, \nit needs written permission to comply with an investigation. This is \nsimply not how the law is designed to work.\n  After this controversy took place, Congress took action. We \nessentially bolded and underlined the provision in the Inspector \nGeneral Act that ensures access to documents. We didn't literally do \nthat, but this year's Justice Department appropriation declares that no \nfunds shall be used to deny the inspector general timely access to all \nrecords.\n  The new law also directed the inspector general to report to Congress \nwithin 5 days whenever there was a failure to comply with this \nrequirement. Since February of this year, we have already received four \nof those reports that the FBI is still refusing to comply, regardless \nof the actions Congress took on the appropriations bill last year.\n  One notice said the FBI was withholding evidence in two whistleblower \ncases. I have written to the FBI twice about these notices and just \nreceived a reply from the FBI Wednesday. Unfortunately, the FBI ignores \nmost of the questions I asked and simply reasserts their original \nposition.\n  That tells me the FBI thinks they are above the law. It has an \nobligation to comply not only with the Inspector General Act but also \nwith restrictions Congress placed on its appropriations. That means FBI \nemployees cannot legally be spending their time withholding and \nreviewing documents before providing those same documents to the \ninspector general. We must stay vigilant and we must insist all \ngovernment agencies, including the FBI, work with the inspectors \ngeneral, not against them.\n  I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for standing \nup for inspectors general. I also urge them to follow through and help \nmake sure the funding restrictions they put in place are obeyed.\n  As I noted earlier, the problem is not confined to the FBI or to the \nDepartment of Justice, similar attempts to limit the work of an \ninspector general have occurred at the EPA and the Peace Corps. Just \nlast year, 47 inspectors general signed a letter to the Congress \nwarning of these problems across government. We all lose when \ninspectors general are delayed or prevented in doing their work. In \nevery agency where IG's work, they help agency management become aware \nof problems and opportunities to improve government service. We must \nsupport the work of inspectors general and remind government agencies \nthat blocking their investigations is not acceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2266-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2266-S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMPREHENSIVE JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nlegislation offered by Senators Cornyn and Franken, the Comprehensive \nJustice and Mental Health Act. This critical piece of bipartisan \nlegislation would promote alternatives to incarceration by helping \nidentify and treat Americans suffering from mental illness. For far too \nlong our criminal justice system has been a substitute for a mental \nhealth system. That practice is costly, wastes limited resources, and \nis contrary to evidence-based practices proven to make our communities \nsafer. I thank Senators Cornyn and Franken for their hard work on this \nimportant criminal justice reform bill.\n  Today, law enforcement is ill-equipped and not properly trained to \ndeal with individuals suffering from severe mental disorders whose \nconditions can cause them to commit crimes. The mentally ill are too \noften treated as common criminals and are not given access to the \ncritical treatment they need.\n  The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act would save taxpayers' \nmoney and effectively use limited resources by ensuring our prisons \ncontain violent offenders as opposed to those who suffer from mental \nillnesses. When more than four of five inmates with a mental illness \nare not treated in jail, we waste resources by incarcerating them. This \nbill would make the public safer and save taxpayers' money by ensuring \nthat we continue to support vital programs, such as mental health \ncourts, veterans' courts, and crisis intervention teams.\n  The bill would also improve public safety. Persons with complicated \npsychiatric problems that are thrown in jail can have their mental \nstate deteriorate even further. If incarcerated without treatment, some \nmental illnesses can lead people to be a danger to the public once \nreleased. But with proper treatment, they can lead ordinary, law-\nabiding lives even absent incarceration.\n  The bill would help to reduce jail overcrowding caused by warehousing \npeople for low-level crimes, which often includes the mentally ill. For \nexample, from 2009 to 2013 in New York City, about 400 people were sent \nto jail on at least 18 occasions each. That amounts to more than 10,000 \njail admissions and 300,000 days in jail. In Chicago, from 2007 to \n2011, 21 percent of the people sent to jails accounted for 50 percent \nof jail admissions. Because a significant number of people in jail are \nmentally ill, reducing recidivism for this population is critical. By \nsupporting state and local efforts to identify and direct them to the \nappropriate mental health services, this bill would reduce recidivism \nand, in turn, help reduce jail over-crowding.\n  The bill would also encourage the development of curricula on mental \nhealth conditions for police academies\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nand orientations. Finally, the legislation would include new grant \naccountability measures and emphasize the implantation of evidence-\nbased practices.\n  It is time we address mental illness in our country through \ntreatment, not incarceration. Passing this common-sense bill would \nreduce recidivism, save taxpayer money, and make our communities safer. \nThat is why I support this bill and I urge its speedy passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2267-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ROBERT GRIFFIN\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a towering figure \nfrom Michigan's political past: former Senator Robert Griffin, who died \nFriday at the age of 91.\n  Senator Griffin was born in Detroit and was educated in the Wayne \nCounty Public Schools. By the time he graduated high school, the United \nStates was embroiled in World War II. And in 1943--a year when so many \nAmerican families came to fully comprehend the horrors of modern \nwarfare--young Bob Griffin enlisted in the U.S. Army, joining the 71st \nInfantry Division.\n  For 3 years, Bob Griffin served our country in a time of war \nunmatched in its intensity, including 14 months fighting Nazis in \nEurope. After returning from war, like so many of our surviving \nsoldiers, he turned his attention to his education, attending Central \nMichigan University, then getting his law degree at the University of \nMichigan.\n  Bob Griffin decided to begin his legal career in Traverse City.\n  After practicing law for several years, Bob Griffin felt compelled to \npractice public service, so in 1956 he ran and won office to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. He distinguished himself in Congress over the \nnext decade, and following the death of Michigan Senator Patrick \nMcNamara, then-Governor George Romney appointed Bob Griffin to finish \nthe 7 months remaining in McNamara's term.\n  It did not take Senator Griffin long to earn the support of Michigan \nvoters: They elected him to a full 6-year term that fall of 1966. \nSenator Griffin served the people of Michigan loyally for the next 12 \nyears.\n  He authored major pieces of legislation during his career in this \nChamber, and he was a member of the Republican leadership from 1969 to \n1977. But he is being remembered most for the role he played in helping \nour Nation overcome the shock of the Watergate scandal.\n  In August 1974, as that scandal worsened, it became clear that \nPresident Nixon was in danger of being impeached. The impeachment \nprocess would be an embarrassing spectacle, not just for President \nNixon, but for the institution of the President and for our Nation's \npolitical system.\n  Senator Griffin was a close friend of President Nixon, but it was the \nSenator's devotion to the country that led him to write a letter \nstrongly suggesting that the President resign and spare the Nation from \nhaving to endure impeachment. That letter is said to have played a \nmajor role in Nixon's decision to finally step aside.\n  At a time when our Nation's political system was teetering, it was \nSenator Griffin who helped it to recover its balance by doing what was \nbest for the country.\n  That is the mark of true leadership. Even those who disagreed with \nSenator Griffin's policies never found fault with his integrity or his \ncharacter.\n  Although Senator Griffin left office in 1979, he still had a desire \nto serve the people of Michigan, and for 8 years he applied his wisdom \nand judgment on Michigan's Supreme Court, retiring in 1994. Today the \nGrand Traverse County courthouse bears his name.\n  Senator Griffin's devotion to our State was rivaled only by the \ndevotion he had for his wife, Marjorie, with whom he spent nearly 68 \nyears, and their four children: Paul, Richard, James, and Jill. The \ncouple has 13 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.\n  Senator Griffin's loss will be felt not only by his loving family, \nbut in his home of Traverse City and in every corner of the State he \nserved during his career. Senator Griffin will be remembered for his \nleadership, his fierce integrity, and his unwavering allegiance to the \nState of Michigan and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2267-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MICHAEL G. VICKERS\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the tremendous \ncontributions of Dr. Michael G. Vickers, the Under Secretary of Defense \nfor Intelligence. Secretary Vickers is retiring this month from the \nFederal Government having served with distinction in two critical \nleadership positions in the Department of Defense: Assistant Secretary \nof Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict and \nInterdependent Capabilities, ASD SO/LIC, from 2007 to 2011, and \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, USD(I), since 2011. His \ndedicated service has spanned the administrations of both President \nGeorge W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Moreover, he has helped \nshape national security for three decades.\n  Secretary Vickers is the Department's longest serving USD(I). During \nhis tenure he has led a comprehensive, mission-focused transformation \nof defense intelligence, and has provided policy and operational \noversight for numerous sensitive intelligence and counterterrorism \noperations. He played a critical policy and planning role in the \noperation that brought justice to Osama bin Ladin. Of note, we are only \ndays away from the fourth anniversary of that successful operation, \nwhich occurred on May 2, 2011.\n  As ASD SO/LIC, Secretary Vickers served as the ``Service'' \nSecretary for all Special Operations Forces, and as the senior civilian \nadvisor to the Secretary of Defense on all counterterrorism, irregular \nwarfare, and special activities. He played a central role in shaping \nU.S. strategy for the war with Al Qaeda and the war in Afghanistan, and \nconceived of and led the largest expansion of SOF capabilities and \ncapacity in history.\n  From 1973 to 1986, Secretary Vickers served as an Army Special Forces \nnoncommissioned officer, Special Forces officer, and Central \nIntelligence Agency operations officer. He had operational and combat \nexperience in Central America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and \nCentral and South Asia. His operational experience spans covert action \nand espionage, unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, \ncounterinsurgency, and foreign internal defense. During the mid-1980s, \nSecretary Vickers was the principal strategist for the largest covert \naction program in the CIA's history: the paramilitary operation that \ndrove the Soviet Army out of Afghanistan.\n  Because of Dr. Vickers' selfless service, hard work and tireless \ndedication, our Nation is a safer place. I want to thank him for his \nservice and wish him and his family all the best as he begins his next \nadventure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2267-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2267-S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BETH THOMASSON\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the life and \nachievements of Beth Thomasson following her passing last month. Beth \nwas a dear friend and a tireless advocate of housing and homeownership \nin her position as executive officer at the Home Builders Association \nof West Virginia. Beth's commitment to her work, her community, and her \nfamily embodied the values that we as West Virginian's hold dear.\n  A graduate of Texas A, Beth was a ``Kelly Girl'' when she started \nat the Home Builders Association in 1978. In just ten years, Beth \nbecame executive officer and during this time the organization \nexperienced a period of exceptional growth. A prodigious advocate for \nher cause, Beth also advanced initiatives of the Home Builder's \nAssociation at the statehouse on issues relating to business \ndevelopment, homeownership, and consumer education. Her strong work \nethic was recognized numerous times when she received the HBA Eastern \nPanhandle's Appreciation Award, the HBAWV Meritorious Service Award, \nand the HBAWV Presidential Award.\n  In addition to her role at the Homebuilders Association, Beth also \nserved in various capacities at the West Virginia Business & Industry \nCouncil, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, the West Virginia \nHousing Policy Framework, and the West Virginia Housing Trust.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to Officer Michael Johnson, a 14-year veteran of \nthe San Jose Police Department who was tragically killed in the line of \nduty while responding to a call for help on March 24, 2015.\n  Michael Johnson was born in Herlong, CA, where his father served as a \nmilitary police officer before becoming a deputy for the Calaveras \nCounty Sheriff's Department. After moving to San Jose as a teenager, \nOfficer Johnson graduated from Gunderson High School in 1995 and joined \nthe San Jose Police Department in 2001, continuing his family's \ncommitment to law enforcement.\n  Those who knew Officer Johnson fondly remember him as a caring and \ntrustworthy colleague who was passionate about his work and loved the \ncommunity he served. An experienced patrol officer, he was recently \npromoted to serve as a field training officer and advise new members of \nthe police force. Outside of work, Officer Johnson found joy in hobbies \nranging from jujitsu and baking to scuba diving and world travel. He \nwas also an outstanding marksman, winning several awards from the \nPolice and Fire Games.\n  Above all else, Office Johnson is remembered as a loving husband and \ndevoted family man. In 2013, he married the love of his life, Nicole, \nand they planned to celebrate their marriage this summer with a large \nformal ceremony in Santa Cruz before starting a family. My heart goes \nout to Nicole and Officer Johnson's parents Daniel Johnson and \nKatherine Decker, his step-parents Dann Decker and Penny Johnson, his \nsister Jamie Radack, his brother-in-law Steve, and his niece Ami and \nnephew Eli.\n  Officer Johnson's dedicated and courageous service will not be \nforgotten. On behalf of the people of California and San Jose, whom he \nserved so bravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to his \nfamily, friends, and colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2268-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING GALENA HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate \nGalena High School on its team of students selected as a national \nwinner in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest. The high school \ncompetition was judged based upon how well teams applied science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math, STEM, in helping the local \ncommunity. Seventeen students competed on the core team; however, 85 \nstudents from Galena High School contributed to 21 projects that \ncontinue to develop as a result of the contest. The team competed with \n3,100 other applicants, winning a total of $138,000 for its achievement \nin being selected as a national winner. This money will be used to \npurchase new technology for the high school, a contribution that will \nhelp future students for years to come.\n  Galena High School students chose to address difficulties faced by \nfellow peers with disabilities. Specifically, they worked alongside two \nstudents with disabilities to bring firsthand experience and realistic \napplication to the project. The students utilized their STEM knowledge \nto create innovative equipment capable of adapting to difficult \nscenarios relating to those with disabilities and motor skill \nrestrictions. The students spent hours researching current technology \nand worked tirelessly, brainstorming and creating solutions to \ndifferent scenarios and ultimately chose two successful projects. The \nfirst, a tool to help special-needs students with typing, and the \nsecond, a portable table space making it easier for students with \ndisabilities to carry lunch. These are only 2 of 21 projects that \ncontinue to develop and will be distributed to the local community. The \nstudents are shining examples of how compassion and hard work can make \na difference in the lives of others and stand as role models for future \nGalena Grizzlies.\n  I am excited to see local students bringing recognition to both \nNevada and to Galena High School for their advancement in a national \ncompetition. These students should be proud to call themselves top \ncontenders in a competitive environment. I ask my colleagues to join me \nand all Nevadans in congratulating Galena High School for its success \nand honorable representation of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2268-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIE CARL MARTIN\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Coach \nWillie Carl Martin of the University of Alabama. After 42 years of \ncoaching football in the Alabama public school system and at the \nUniversity of Alabama, Coach Willie Carl Martin is retiring. During his \nhigh school playing days, he was such an outstanding athlete that the \nlate Coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant offered him a full scholarship to \nAlabama. He was the first African-American to be offered an athletic \nscholarship to the university. He declined the offer and went to \ncollege at Northeastern State University, where he was a second team \nAll-American. He then played professional football in Canada for 6 \nyears. He returned to his hometown, Alexander City, AL; where he began \nhis coaching career as an assistant coach, and then as head football \ncoach at Benjamin Russell High School. In 2001, he led Benjamin Russell \nHigh School to their first and only State Championship. After 25 years \nof a truly outstanding and impressive career in high school coaching, \nCoach Martin was hired as an assistant coach and for player development \nby Alabama's new coach, Nick Saban, in 2007. During his 8 years at \nAlabama, he had an instrumental part in Alabama winning three SEC \nchampionships and three national championships.\n  Willie Carl has demonstrated exceptional academic and professional \ncareers both in teaching and coaching young students. He is a loyal, \ndedicated individual who has always had time for his students and \nplayers. He is generous with his time with others, regardless of their \nstation in life. He is fortunate enough to have a wife, Leslie, as well \nas two lovely daughters and grandchildren, who have stood by him in all \nof his endeavors. I know they, along with his other numerous friends \nand family, will join me in proclaiming May 12, 2015, as Willie Carl \nMartin Day in Alexander City, AL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2268-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING HUNTSVILLE UTILITIES 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to \n     facilitate the payment of contractors who completed hazardous \n     fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to \n     contracts with the Nevada Fire Safe Council; to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, In 1999, Northern Nevada experienced one of the \n     worst wildfire years on record, with more than 1.6 million \n     acres burned and significant economic and environmental \n     impacts; and\n       Whereas, In the spring of 1999, a resolution was approved \n     at Nevada's first comprehensive fire conference, known as the \n     ``Living With Fire Forum,'' which urged the establishment of \n     a statewide council to provide support to make homes, \n     neighborhoods and communities in Nevada safe from fire; and\n       Whereas, The Nevada Fire Safe Council was formed as a \n     domestic nonprofit corporation on December 10, 1999, and \n     received appropriations from the Nevada Legislature in 2005 \n     and 2007 to administer a community-based wildfire threat \n     reduction program; and\n       Whereas, By March 2007, the Council had grown to include 60 \n     affiliated chapters and 3,515 members; and\n       Whereas, The Angora Fire in the summer of 2007 burned more \n     than 250 structures on private property and more than 3,000 \n     acres in the Lake Tahoe Basin, and further amplified the \n     existing need for mitigation work to reduce the threat of \n     wildfire in communities; and\n       Whereas, Between 2008 and 2012, the Council was awarded \n     over $21 million in federal reimbursement grants to be used \n     to pay public and private entities for the completion of \n     hazardous fuels treatment projects; and\n       Whereas, In July 2011, the Office of Inspector General of \n     the United States Department of Agriculture initiated an \n     audit of the Council's records after receiving a complaint on \n     its hotline alleging that the Council was awarding certain \n     contracts in a noncompetitive manner; and\n       Whereas, The audit report issued by the Inspector General \n     in January 2012 indicated various accounting irregularities \n     in the Council's administration of the federal reimbursement \n     grant money and resulted in the freezing of reimbursement \n     payments of that grant money for completed projects until the \n     accounting deficiencies were corrected; and\n       Whereas, In November 2012, the Council filed for bankruptcy \n     and ceased operations; and\n       Whereas, As a result of the freezing of reimbursement \n     payments and the Council's bankruptcy, various public and \n     private entities that had completed hazardous fuels treatment \n     projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to agreements with \n     the Council have not been paid for their services, which has \n     caused significant economic hardship to those entities; and\n       Whereas, On March 20, 2014, California Assemblyman Brian \n     Dahle and his staff were joined by staff from the offices of \n     United States Representatives Doug LaMalfa and Tom McClintock \n     to share their concerns about the outstanding debts of the \n     Council and to explore solutions with Nevada's Legislative \n     Committee for the Review and Oversight of the Tahoe Regional \n     Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature hereby urge Congress to facilitate the payment of \n     contractors who completed hazardous fuels treatment projects \n     in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to contracts with the Nevada \n     Fire Safe Council and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Attorney General of \n     the United States, the Chief of the United States Forest \n     Service, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, the \n     Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and each member of the Nevada Congressional \n     Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-12. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     provide full long-term funding for the Payment in Lieu of \n     Taxes program and to reauthorize Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act funding; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1010\n\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona is composed of 113,417 square \n     miles of land, of which 17% is managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management 15% is managed by the United States Forest \n     Service, 2% is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service, 4% is managed by the National Park Service, 4% is \n     military land and 28% is tribal land. Thus, much of the land \n     in Arizona is unavailable for economic development and is not \n     part of the property tax base; and\n       Whereas, counties are required to provide law enforcement, \n     search and rescue, emergency services, road building and \n     maintenance, and other community services on, or associated \n     with, tax-exempt federally managed public lands; and\n       Whereas, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was \n     established in 1976 to offset costs incurred by counties for \n     services provided to the federal government and to the users \n     of federally managed lands located within a county; and\n       Whereas, the national average PILT payment in fiscal year \n     2014 was $0.72 per acre, which is far below the amount that \n     federally managed lands would return through both value-based \n     taxation and economic development; and\n       Whereas, Congress has been unable to pass a long-term \n     funding solution for the PILT program since 2008 and has \n     instead passed last-minute one-year extensions, causing great \n     uncertainty about county finances and services as well as \n     rural school funding; and\n       Whereas, funding for fiscal year 2015 PILT was included in \n     the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act \n     and the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National \n     Defense Authorization Act, totaling $442 million, but the \n     fate of fiscal year 2016 and future years is still unknown; \n     and\n       Whereas, a lack of certainty for PILT funding places the \n     large, unsustainable burden of providing services on \n     federally managed lands squarely on the backs of local county \n     taxpayers, while the presence of that federally managed land \n     creates barriers to economic opportunities; and\n       Whereas, rural communities and schools in and around \n     national forests have historically relied on a share of \n     receipts from timber harvests to support education services \n     and roads; and\n       Whereas, in the 1980s, federal restrictions substantially \n     diminished the revenue-generating timber harvests permitted \n     in these forests; and\n       Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act (SRS) was passed in 2000 to stabilize and \n     transition payments to counties and schools away from the \n     declining and unreliable share of timber sales; and\n       Whereas, the failure of Congress to honor the more than \n     100-year-old contract between the federal government and \n     heavily forested communities by not reauthorizing SRS funding \n     for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 will create budgetary \n     shortfalls for rural counties and school districts; and\n       Whereas, failure to immediately secure SRS funding for \n     fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and PILT funding for fiscal year \n     2016 and into the future for Arizona counties will critically \n     impact the local budget process and structural solvency of \n     counties and the public school systems and will substantially \n     compromise their ability to provide essential services, such \n     as health, safety and welfare; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has the duty to reimburse \n     local jurisdictions for the presence of federally managed \n     public lands in a reliable and consistent manner.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress provide full long-term \n     funding for the PILT program to help create financial \n     stability within Arizona's counties.\n       2. That the United States Congress immediately reauthorize \n     SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and work toward a \n     long-term solution.\n       3. That the United States Congress work with the State of \n     Arizona and county governments to identify and implement \n     policies to promote economic development on, or associated \n     with, federally managed lands.\n       4. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-13. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     enact legislation exempting United States military bases from \n     the regulations and restrictions of the Endangered Species \n     Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1009\n\n       Whereas, the mission of the United States Department of \n     Defense is ``to provide the military forces needed to deter \n     war and to protect the security of our country''; and\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Defense and the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO), a fundamental \n     principle of military readiness is that the military must \n     train as it intends to fight; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense has established military \n     training facilities in Arizona, including Fort Huachuca, \n     Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Luke Air Force Base and the \n     Barry M. Goldwater range, among others, to accomplish this \n     goal; and\n       Whereas, Department of Defense officials indicate that \n     heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes \n     has affected the use of its training areas; and\n       Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, \n     especially the Endangered Species Act (ESA), has caused some \n     training activities to be canceled, postponed or modified; \n     and\n       Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, \n     particularly the ESA, has forced military officials to make \n     adjustments to training regimens, including requiring units\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n     in training to avoid areas with ESA restrictions; and\n       Whereas, since 2003, the Department of Defense has obtained \n     exemptions from three environmental laws and sought \n     exemptions from three others; and\n       Whereas, these exemptions allow the military to maintain \n     its high state of readiness and help to ensure its ability to \n     meet unexpected threats; and\n       Whereas, these exemptions are under increased scrutiny by \n     environmental groups and federal officials who would rather \n     protect wildlife than allow the military to maintain its \n     readiness; and\n       Whereas, a GAO report found no instances in which the \n     Department of Defense's use of exemptions from the ESA or the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act has adversely affected the \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, the United States military has proven itself to be \n     a responsible and effective steward of the land and \n     environment.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress enact legislation \n     exempting United States military bases and training \n     facilities from the regulations and restrictions of the \n     Endangered Species Act.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-14. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     enact the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act; \n     to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1012\n\n       Whereas, when the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was \n     originally enacted in 1973, the framers and supporters of the \n     ESA envisioned a law that would protect species believed to \n     be on the brink of extinction; and\n       Whereas, at that time, 109 species were listed for \n     protection; and\n       Whereas, today, over 1,500 species in the United States are \n     designated as threatened or endangered under the ESA; and\n       Whereas, as a result of a 2011 mega-settlement between the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service and environmental \n     litigants, hundreds more species could be added within the \n     next two years; and\n       Whereas, the ESA is failing to achieve its primary purpose \n     of species recovery as it has only a 2% recovery rate; and\n       Whereas, the ESA was last amended in 1988, which means 27 \n     years have passed since any improvements have been made; and\n       Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency \n     Act would require that data used by federal agencies for ESA \n     listing decisions be made publicly available and accessible \n     through the Internet, while respecting state data privacy \n     laws and private property; and\n       Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency \n     Act would require the federal government to disclose to \n     affected states data used prior to an ESA listing decision \n     and require the ``best available scientific and commercial \n     data'' used by the federal government to incorporate data \n     provided by states, tribes and local county governments; and\n       Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency \n     Act would require the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \n     to track, report to Congress and make available online the \n     federal taxpayer funds used to respond to ESA lawsuits, the \n     number of employees dedicated to ESA litigation and the \n     amount of attorney fees awarded in the course of ESA \n     litigation and settlement agreements; and\n       Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency \n     Act would prioritize species protection and protect taxpayer \n     dollars by placing reasonable caps on attorney fees to make \n     the ESA consistent with existing federal law; and\n       Whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of \n     our local communities, as well as important historic and \n     cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, \n     which adversely affects the lives and jobs of the people of \n     the United States and devastates local and state economies; \n     and\n       Whereas, a cost-benefit analysis should be required on any \n     ESA action; and\n       Whereas, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the \n     American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rural Electric \n     Cooperative Association and many others support the 21st \n     Century Endangered Species Transparency Act.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representative concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States enact the 21st \n     Century Endangered Species Transparency Act.\n       2.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     oppose the implementation of certain technology and emissions \n     reduction rules for new and existing electric generating \n     units; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1013\n\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act (CAA) is a federal law designed \n     to protect air quality nationwide; and\n       Whereas, jurisdiction to implement the CAA lies primarily \n     with the states; and\n       Whereas, in 1970, Congress enacted the CAA, mandating \n     comprehensive state and federal regulations for both \n     stationary and nonstationary sources of pollution; and\n       Whereas, while Americans support efforts to improve air \n     quality, such efforts should be carefully balanced to ensure \n     that the costs of new regulations to the economy do not \n     exceed potential benefits; and\n       Whereas, on June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rules in the Federal \n     Register that will require Arizona to reduce carbon emissions \n     at existing generating facilities by 51.7% by 2030; and\n       Whereas, the carbon reduction targets for Arizona are the \n     second highest in the nation; and\n       Whereas, the interim goal proposed for Arizona would \n     require nearly 90% of the final goal to be achieved by the \n     year 2020: and\n       Whereas, concentrations of greenhouse gases are the result \n     of global emissions and do not pose an immediate risk to \n     public health and safety as do other criteria pollutants; and\n       Whereas, the EPA's proposed rules exceed its legal \n     authority to require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions \n     from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under \n     Section 111(d) of the CAA and interfere with the electric \n     system of Arizona; and\n       Whereas, addressing greenhouse gas emissions under Section \n     111(d) is a discretionary duty of the EPA as outlined in the \n     CAA; and\n       Whereas, devoting resources to discretionary duties such as \n     regulating greenhouse gas emissions takes away resources from \n     nondiscretionary duties that are better suited to protect the \n     public health in the near term; and\n       Whereas, it is important to Arizona's economy to have a \n     diverse energy portfolio that provides reliable and \n     affordable electric service to Arizona residents and \n     businesses while protecting the public health and welfare; \n     and\n       Whereas, fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, \n     provide an abundant, domestic and affordable energy source \n     that is important to Arizona's economy and the availability \n     and reliability of electric service; and\n       Whereas, the EPA ignores the customs, cultures and economic \n     well-being of our local communities as well as important \n     historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage; and\n       Whereas, the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan will cause \n     significant disruptions in Arizona's electricity supply and \n     transmission system, causing reliability in the system to \n     decrease.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress oppose the \n     implementation of rules for existing electric generating \n     units that exceed the EPA's legal authority under Section 111 \n     of the CAA and interfere with the prerogative of Arizona to \n     regulate electricity and ensure an affordable and reliable \n     supply of electricity for its citizens.\n       2. That the United States Congress oppose the \n     implementation of rules for new or existing electric \n     generating units that do not recognize the primary role of \n     states in establishing and implementing plans to achieve \n     emissions reductions for existing units under Section 111 of \n     the CAA.\n       3. That the United States Congress exercise oversight over \n     the EPA to ensure that the primary role of States in \n     establishing and implementing rules under Section 111 of the \n     CAA is respected.\n       4. That the Governor and the Attorney General of the State \n     of Arizona take appropriate actions to uphold this state's \n     responsibilities with respect to the CAA and defend the state \n     against overreaching regulations.\n       5.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1014. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nensure the safety of cosmetics; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the use of personal care products is \nvirtually universal in this country. These products include everything \nfrom shampoo and hair dye to deodorant and lotion.\n  Troubling examples of negative health effects call into question the \nsafety of some of the chemicals used in these products.\n  For example, methylene glycol, which turns into formaldehyde when \nheated, is a chemical in the popular hair smoothing treatment known as \nthe ``Brazilian Blowout''. Short term exposure has been reported to \ncause hair loss, rashes, blistered scalps, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, \nshortness of breath and vomiting. Over the long term, exposure is \nassociated with an increased risk of cancer.\n  Some ingredients in cosmetics may only be safe for use in certain \nconcentrations. Propyl paraben, a widely used preservative, is found in \nmany products and mimics the hormone estrogen. This has the potential \nto disrupt the endocrine system, which can lead to a variety of health \nconcerns such as reproductive system disorders.\n  In light of this and other examples, consumers deserve to know that \nthe products they use every day are safe. To do this, Federal oversight \nof the personal care products industry needs to be strengthened.\n  Europe has a robust system of oversight for personal care products, \nincluding consumer protections like product registration and ingredient \nreviews, but in the United States, the industry is regulated largely on \na voluntary basis, with a sparse patchwork of state regulations. The \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, has little authority, operating \nunder a Federal law from the 1930s that has seen little change since. \nConsumers rightly expect that basic protective measures to ensure the \nsafety of personal care product ingredients are in place, but the \nreality is that FDA doesn't even have mandatory recall authority for \nproducts that pose significant harm to human health.\n  I have been working with consumer groups, companies and FDA to put \ntogether a bipartisan, middle of the road bill to update the regulatory \nstructure for personal care products, provide a streamlined national \nsystem of oversight and accountability, and review the safety of \nspecific chemicals in these products. I am grateful to my colleague, \nSenator Collins, for working with me in this effort.\n  Today we are introducing the Personal Care Products Safety Act, a \ncomprehensive step forward. The bill, which is the result of feedback \nwe received from a wide range of stakeholders, addresses consumer \nsafety concerns and provides a modernized, predictable and \nstraightforward system of compliance for companies.\n  The Personal Care Products Safety Act will, for the first time, \nenable the public to know which companies, whether they are American or \nforeign, are producing and distributing personal care products through \na registration system operated by FDA. Companies will provide \ninformation about the ingredients in their products and attest to their \nsafety. This updated system will be supported by user fees paid by the \nindustry.\n  Under this legislation, FDA will review at least five chemical \ningredients per year for their safety and appropriate use in personal \ncare products. In determining which ingredients to evaluate and their \nsafety, many factors must be considered, including how prevalent the \ningredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and \nscientific studies from a wide range of sources.\n  The first set of chemicals for review includes: diazolidinyl urea, \nwhich is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including \ndeodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion; lead acetate, \nwhich is used as a color additive in hair dyes; methylene glycol/\nformaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments; propyl paraben, which \nis used as a preservative in a wide range of products including \nshampoo, conditioner and lotion; quaternium-15, which is used as a \npreservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving \ncream, skin creams and cleansers.\n  FDA may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses \nor conditions. FDA will also be empowered to require warning labels on \nproducts with certain ingredients, as appropriate, and limit the amount \nof an ingredient that may be used in certain products. For example, \nsome ingredients may only be safe when used by professionals in a salon \nor spa setting.\n  The structure of the legislation encourages, and relies on, public \ninput. There are many opportunities built in for consumer groups, \ncompanies, medical professionals, scientists and the public to weigh in \nwith feedback on the ingredients that should be prioritized for review \nand scientific information that FDA should consider regarding the \nsafety of those ingredients. FDA is required to provide a yearly update \nto Congress and the public on its progress in reviewing these \ningredients and the new oversight system.\n  Many companies follow strict voluntary standards for manufacturing \nunder proper conditions, but the current lack of a Federal standard \nleaves this to chance. Under this legislation, FDA sets Good \nManufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure companies meet a minimum \nstandard. Companies will also need to report adverse health events \nrelated to their products to FDA.\n  As more consumers choose to shop online, it is of growing importance \nthat they have access to the same product information they would see in \na store. This bill requires all personal care products sold online to \ninclude information that is on the label. Consumers will be able to see \nall ingredients listed, along with any product warnings and other \nimportant information on use.\n  We also take steps to reduce animal testing in personal care \nproducts, and direct FDA to encourage the use of alternatives and \nprovide specific guidance to companies on non-animal testing methods \nthat are seen as acceptable.\n  This legislation is the product of many different groups working \ntogether. I am pleased to have the support of the Personal Care \nProducts Council, which represents over 600 companies, Environmental \nWorking Group, Society for Women's Health Research, HealthyWomen, and \nNational Alliance for Hispanic Health. These individual companies have \nalso stepped forward to independently support the bill: Johnson & \nJohnson, brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, Lubriderm, \nJohnson's baby products; Procter & Gamble, brands include\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\nPantene, Head & Shoulders, Clairol, Herbal Essences, Secret, Dolce & \nGabbana, Gucci, Ivory, CoverGirl, Olay, Sebastian Professional, Vidal \nSassoon; Revlon, brands include Revlon, Almay, Mitchum; Esteee Lauder, \nbrands include Esteee Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Tommy Hilfiger, MAC, \nLa Mer, Bobbi Brown, Donna Karan, Aveda, Michael Kors; Unilever, brands \ninclude Dove, Tresemme, Lever, St. Ives, Noxzema, Nexxus, Pond's, \nSuave, Sunsilk, Vaseline, Degree; L'Oreeal, brands include L'Oreeal \nParis, Lancome, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Kiehl's, Essie, \nGarnier, Maybelline-New York, Vichy, La Roche-Posay, The Body Shop, \nRedken.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting \nthis effort to modernize our outdated regulatory system for personal \ncare products, and to cosponsor the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2275-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 140--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Gardner, and Mr. \nMarkey) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 140\n\n       Whereas the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out \n     by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the \n     deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed and 500,000 survivors \n     were expelled from their homes, and the elimination of the \n     over 2,500-year presence of Armenians in their historic \n     homeland;\n       Whereas, on May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers of England, \n     France, and Russia jointly issued a statement explicitly \n     charging for the first time ever another government of \n     committing crimes ``against humanity and civilization'';\n       Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'', \n     and whose draft resolution for a genocide convention treaty \n     became the framework for the United Nations Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \n     recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of crime the \n     United Nations should prevent and punish through the setting \n     of international standards;\n       Whereas Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress, \n     agreed to February 9, 1916, resolved that ``the President of \n     the United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on \n     which the citizens of this country may give expression to \n     their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the \n     relief of the Armenians'', who at the time were enduring \n     ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering'';\n       Whereas Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May \n     11, 1920, stated that ``the testimony adduced at the hearings \n     conducted by the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on \n     Foreign Relations have clearly established the truth of the \n     reported massacres and other atrocities from which the \n     Armenian people have suffered'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, agreed \n     to April 8, 1975, resolved, ``That April 24, 1975, is hereby \n     designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     those of Armenian ancestry. . .'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, agreed \n     to September 10, 1984, resolved, ``That April 24, 1985, is \n     hereby designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     the one and one-half million people of Armenian ancestry. . \n     .'';\n       Whereas, on April 11, 2014, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate reported favorably Senate Resolution \n     410, 113th Congress, expressing the sense of the Senate \n     regarding the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, and \n     calling on the President to ``ensure that the foreign policy \n     of the Unites States reflects appropriate understanding and \n     sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights crimes \n     against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented \n     in the United States record relating to the Armenian \n     Genocide'';\n       Whereas, on April 12, 2015, Pope Francis described the \n     atrocities perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks against the \n     Armenians as the first genocide of the 20th century;\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an \n     independent Federal agency, unanimously resolved on April 30, \n     1981, that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum would \n     document the Armenian Genocide in the Museum, and has done so \n     through a public examination of the historic record, \n     including lectures and the maintenance of books, records, and \n     photographs about the Genocide;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Turkey has \n     continued its international campaign of Armenian Genocide \n     denial, maintained a blockade of Armenia, and continues to \n     pressure the small but growing Turkish civil society movement \n     for acknowledging the Armenian Genocide;\n       Whereas, in April 2011, the month of remembrance of the \n     Armenian Genocide, the Government of the Republic of Turkey \n     demolished a 100-foot-high statue in the city of Kars which \n     was erected to promote reconciliation with Armenia;\n       Whereas the denial of the Armenian Genocide by the \n     Government of the Republic of Turkey has prevented the \n     meaningful advancement of a constructive political, economic, \n     and security relationship between Armenia and Turkey; and\n       Whereas the teaching, recognition, and commemoration of \n     acts of genocide and other crimes against humanity is \n     essential to preventing the re-occurrence of similar \n     atrocities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to remember and commemorate the 100th anniversary of \n     the Armenian Genocide on April 24, 2015;\n       (2) that the President should work toward an equitable, \n     constructive, stable, and durable Armenian-Turkish \n     relationship that includes the full acknowledgment by the \n     Government of the Republic of Turkey of the facts about the \n     Armenian Genocide; and\n       (3) that the President should ensure that the foreign \n     policy of the United States reflects appropriate \n     understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \n     human rights, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and \n     genocide documented in the United States record relating to \n     the Armenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url":

Res. 141\n\n       Whereas the Take Our Daughters To Work program was created \n     in New York City as a response to research that showed that, \n     by the 8th grade, many girls were dropping out of school, had \n     low self-esteem, and lacked confidence;\n       Whereas in 2003, the name of the program was changed to \n     ``Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work'' so that boys who face \n     many of the same challenges as girls could also be involved \n     in the program;\n       Whereas in 2015, the mission of the program, to develop \n     ``innovative strategies that empower girls and boys to \n     overcome societal barriers to reach their full potential'', \n     fully reflects the addition of boys;\n       Whereas the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation, \n     a nonprofit organization, has grown to be one of the largest \n     public awareness campaigns, with more than 39,000,000 \n     participants annually in more than 3,000,000 organizations \n     and workplaces representing each State;\n       Whereas in 2007, the Take Our Daughters To Work program \n     transitioned to Elizabeth City, North Carolina, became known \n     as the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation, and \n     received national recognition for its dedication to future \n     generations;\n       Whereas every year, mayors, governors, and other private \n     and public officials sign proclamations and lend support to \n     Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day;\n       Whereas the fame of the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work \n     program has spread overseas, with requests and inquiries \n     being made from around the world on how to operate the \n     program;\n       Whereas 2015 marks the 22nd anniversary of the Take Our \n     Daughters And Sons To Work program;\n       Whereas Take Our Daughters And Sons to Work Day will be \n     observed on Thursday, April 23, 2015; and\n       Whereas by offering opportunities for children to \n     experience activities and events, Take Our Daughters And Sons \n     To Work Day is intended to continue helping millions of girls \n     and boys on an annual basis to examine their opportunities \n     and strive to reach their fullest potential: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the goals of introducing our daughters and \n     sons to the workplace; and\n       (2) commends all participants of Take Our Daughters And \n     Sons To Work Day for their ongoing contributions to \n     education, and for the vital role the participants play in \n     promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the \n     United States.\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/20/senate-section/article/S2276-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 13--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF EMANCIPATION \n   HALL IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER FOR A CEREMONY TO PRESENT THE \n         CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO THE AMERICAN FIGHTER ACES\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S.
