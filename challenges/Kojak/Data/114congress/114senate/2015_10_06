I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  National Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Henry Kissinger recently said our \ncountry faces the most ``diverse and complex array of crises'' since \nWorld War II. It is really hard to disagree with that.\n  Consider the daily situation reports received by the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs: Taliban forces overrunning Kunduz in Afghanistan, \nretaking their first provincial capital in 14 years; Beijing exerting \ngreater will in its aggressive military expansion, even deploying ships \nto patrol off the coast of Alaska; Russia deepening its aggression in \nUkraine and in Syria deploying the largest number of troops outside the \nformer Soviet Union since the U.S.S.R.'s collapse; Tehran showing its \ndetermination to expand the Iranian sphere of influence as it deploys \nadditional forces to the Syrian battlefield; and in the tribal areas of \nPakistan, Al Qaeda terrorists reminding us of their continued resolve \nto attack the homeland.\n  There is all this, Mr. President, to say nothing of the resilient, \nversatile threat posed by ISIL, to say nothing of ISIL's consolidation \nof gains inside Iraq and Syria.\n  We stand here 1 year after the President described a strategy for \ndegrading and destroying ISIL. So far, this strategy has resulted in a \nseeming stalemate. We know from nearly daily news stories the \nadministration is reconsidering that plan and crafting a new strategy \nto combat ISIL. We also know the war against the terrorist group will \nbe protracted. That is one reason the President sought $585 billion in \ndefense funding in his budget request.\n  So today the Senate has the capability to provide the level of \nfunding authority the President actually asked for. Today the Senate \nhas the power to help America navigate a treacherous world. Today the \nSenate has the opportunity to help the Defense Department begin the \nhard work of rebuilding America's combat capability as we seek to \nprotect America's interests across the globe.\n  That is why I am calling on every colleague to join me in voting to \nadvance the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act. The last \ntime the Senate considered this legislation 84 Senators--84 Senators--\nincluding a large majority of Democrats, voted to advance this bill. \nThat was just this summer--a couple of months ago.\n  I would urge Democrats to vote the same way now, because we have \nheard\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\nsome worrying rhetoric from across the aisle. We have even heard a \nsuggestion that this bipartisan reform bill is just ``a waste of \ntime.'' I strongly disagree.\n  Is it a waste of time to transform bureaucratic waste into crucial \ninvestments for our troops and their families, such as the raises they \nhave earned and the quality of life programs they deserve? Is it a \nwaste of time to provide hope for wounded warriors and extend a hand of \ncompassion to heroes who struggle with mental health challenges?\n  The bipartisan bill before us is hardly--hardly--a waste of time. \nThat is why it passed the Senate once already with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. Our troops should be able to count on that \noverwhelming bipartisan support again today. This is not the time to \nflip-flop on the men and women who protect us. This is not the time to \nflip-flop on America's defense, certainly not in this age of daunting \nglobal threats.\n  Secretary Kerry called the situation in the Middle East ``a \ncatastrophe, a human catastrophe really unparalleled in modern times.'' \nHe is right. It is tragic. It is dangerous. And it only underlines the \nduty each of us has now to meet our responsibilities--meet our \nresponsibilities--not filibuster the bipartisan legislation that \nensures our troops have the tools and equipment they need in this time \nof global crisis.\n  This bipartisan bill will support our troops, help our military to \nrebuild and face the challenges of both the present and the future, and \nprovide President Obama the level of funding authorization he actually \nasked for in his budget request. We passed this bipartisan defense bill \nonce already. We need to pass it again now.\n\n\nMeasures Placed on the Calendar--S. 2129, S. 2130, S. 2131, and S. 2132\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there are four bills at \nthe desk due a second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The clerk will read the bills by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2129) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Energy and \n     Water Development, and Departments of Transportation, and \n     Housing and Urban Development, and related programs for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \n     purposes.\n       A bill (S. 2130) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense, energy and water development, Department of \n     Homeland Security, military construction, Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, and Department of State, foreign \n     operations, and related programs for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.\n       A bill (S. 2131) making appropriations for Departments of \n     Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related Agencies and \n     Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.\n       A bill (S. 2132) making appropriations for financial \n     services and general government, Department of the Interior, \n     environment, and Departments of Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education, and related programs for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the \nprovisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bills will be placed on the calendar en bloc.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           The Koch Brothers\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Charles and David Koch are trying to buy \nAmerica. They have the money to try and do just that. Because of the \nSupreme Court's wrong and disastrous Citizens United ruling, the Koch \nbrothers' dark political money has infected our democracy.\n  One need only look at our national politics to see how the Kochs are \ninfluencing our government. Even now, these two billionaires are \ncommitted to spending $900 million to advance a radical agenda during \nthis election cycle. It is no surprise, then, that virtually every \nRepublican Presidential candidate kowtows to these two oil, tar sands, \nand coal barons from Kansas. Republican Presidential hopefuls all kiss \nthe rings of the Kochs, hoping that some of their filthy money finds \nits way into their campaign coffers. It is disgusting, and it is wrong.\n  But the Koch brothers aren't just trying to buy the highest office in \nthe land. They are not just trying to help themselves at the Federal \nlevel. They are also trying to buy our democracy from the bottom up. In \nstatehouses and city halls all across our great country, the Koch \nbrothers and their vast spending network are turning local governments \ninto agencies of the Koch empire. They are trying to turn America into \na Koch-financed oligarchy.\n  It seems there is no issue too local nor policy matter too small to \nescape the Koch brothers' wrath. They want to impose their radical \nagenda on the American people on every issue, no matter the cost to \nfamilies and communities.\n  Just look at what they are doing in Colorado Springs, CO. ``The \nPotholes of Colorado Springs draw the attention of Koch brothers' \ngroup.'' This is a headline from last weekend's Washington Post. The \nKoch brothers are fighting the city's efforts to fix its crumbling \nroads. Reading from the article:\n\n       This much everyone can agree on: The streets of this large \n     city on the Rocky Mountain Front Range are a wreck. Sixty \n     percent are in disrepair, cracked and rutted; driving on them \n     is often a game of vehicular Minesweeper. One local TV news \n     channel runs a segment called ``Pothole Patrol.''\n\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       But when this city's newly elected conservative mayor urged \n     voters to approve an increase in the sales tax to pay to \n     improve the roads, he drew fire from an unexpected source: a \n     branch of Americans for Prosperity, a powerful conservative \n     advocacy group backed by the billionaire industrialists \n     Charles and David Koch.\n\n  The Koch brothers aren't interested in advancing solutions. They are \ninterested in sending a message. They are willing to attack everyone, \neven conservative Republicans who cross their extreme agenda.\n  This is the basic work of government the Koch brothers want to \ndestroy. All Colorado Springs and its Republican mayor want to do is to \ndetermine their own fate, fund their own roads, and make their own \nlaws. But in March, Americans for Prosperity, beholden to Charles and \nDavid Koch's pocketbook, simply shut down the entire process of local, \ncommunity-based government. It is unbelievable they would do this.\n  The Koch brothers don't want the people of Colorado Springs to find \ntheir own solutions to fix potholes in Colorado Springs, and they are \nwilling to pay to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  That is only one city, and I don't have time to mention all. The \nKochs are doing this all over America. Here is another headline from \nthe Nashville Tennessean. ``Koch brothers group works to stop Nashville \nAmp.'' Here is the quote:\n\n       The movement to stop a Nashville mass transit plan has \n     gotten an extra boost of horsepower from an unexpected \n     source: the Koch brothers, out-of-state billionaires.\n\n  But there are many more examples. ``Americans for Prosperity spent \n$62,795 to defeat zoo levy.'' Think about that. They are so focused on \ndoing everything they can to run this great Nation not from the top \ndown but the bottom up. This was the headline from the Columbus \nDispatch last year.\n  The Koch brothers' main political arm in Ohio fought against the \nColumbus Zoo and Aquarium tax levy. Why? Because the Kochs have a \nGeorgia-Pacific plant nearby and they did not want to pay their fair \nshare of taxes. Think about that. These are multibillionaires. It is \nestimated to be worth $150 to $200 billion. They are afraid their \ncompany, Georgia-Pacific, may have to pay a few extra dollars in taxes \nin Ohio.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times: ``Koch brothers, big utilities attack solar, \ngreen energy policies.''\n  This is a headline from the L.A. Times, as we can see, and it reads:\n\n       The Koch brothers, anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and \n     some of the nation's largest power companies have backed \n     efforts in recent months to roll back state policies that \n     favor green energy. The conservative luminaries have pushed \n     campaigns in Kansas, North Carolina and Arizona, with the \n     battle rapidly spreading to other states. . . . Both sides \n     say the fight is growing more intense as new states, \n     including Ohio, South Carolina and Washington, enter the \n     fray.\n\n  Potholes in Colorado--they want to stop anything to do with renewable \nenergy in Tennessee. They are going to stop a zoo and aquarium in \nColumbus, OH, or nearby. They want to stop any\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\ntype of renewable energy because it slows down their tar sands \nbusiness, their oil business, and their coal business.\n  In Nevada, the Koch brothers and their foot soldiers are meddling in \nmany issues--really, too many to count. They have been trying to upend \nNevada's open primary process. They have encouraged young Nevadans to \nstay out of the State's health exchanges. They fought attempts to raise \nNevada's cigarette tax. They have used the State legislature to \nundermine labor unions. These are only a few examples of the Kochs' \n``Buy America'' plan.\n  What the Koch brothers are doing in Nevada and all of the States that \nwe talked about this morning is shameful. They are using their deep \npockets and their shadowy organizations to try and buy a government \nthat serves them, not the American people. They aren't even trying to \nhide it anymore. As one radical activist happily noted to the \nWashington Post, ``the Koch brothers, they may write a check'' to \npromote their ultraconservative ideology. They are writing more than a \ncheck or two. Charles and David and their allies are writing $900 \nmillion worth of checks--$900 million spent against rebuilding our \nNation's roads and bridges, against a fair shot for all Americans, \nagainst raising the minimum wage, and against the hundreds of thousands \nof American jobs supported by the Export-Import Bank.\n  The Kochs have a lot of money to spend. They are using a tiny bit of \nit, which is huge amounts of money--about $1 billion this election \ncycle--to do other kinds of things. They want to promote criminal \njustice reform. That is nice. I am glad they are on the right side of \nsomething--finally. That could be one reason they are interested in \nthis--because they have been in the past prosecuted for doing things \nthat have been illegal and criminal in the nature of prosecutors. They \nhave fought back against these things.\n  We have been talking about the criminal justice system long before \nthe Kochs got involved. That is well and nice that they are embracing \nreform now, but it does not negate the many bad things they are doing \nto hurt American families.\n  The Koch brothers' priorities are wrong for the middle class and they \nare wrong for all America. It is time that we let the Koch brothers \nknow that our country isn't for sale. It is time that we let every \npower-hungry billionaire know they can't buy our government. Whether it \nis the city hall of Colorado Springs or the halls of Congress, you \nshould not be able to buy America's democracy. The question is this: \nAre the Kochs going to buy America, because they are certainly trying \nto? It is up to every American to say no.\n  Mr. President, I note that there is no one else on the floor. So \nwould the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/senate-section/article/S7131-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1735, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 1735, a bill to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military \n     activities of the Department of Defense, for military \n     construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \n     Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such \n     fiscal year, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 1 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our ranking member on the Armed Services \nCommittee is here on the floor. He has done an exemplary job working \nwith Senator John McCain to move legislation forward. I have followed \nhis lead, and I am not going to vote for this conference report, as he \nis not going to vote for this conference report. I would say that the \nHouse had a vote similar to this one a few days ago, where they had \nmore than enough votes to sustain a veto if the President does veto \nthis, which he says he is going to do. I want everyone to know that as \nto Democrats who voted for this in the past, not all of them will vote \nthe same way they did last time. But our Democrats have stated, without \nany question, if it comes time to sustain a Presidential veto, that \nwill be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the conference report of \nthe fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which we will \nbe voting on in the next hour. This conference report is the product of \nmonths of negotiation and compromise between the House and the Senate. \nI want to commend Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, and Ranking \nMember Smith for a thoughtful, inclusive and cordial process.\n  There are many provisions in this bill that provide the support we \nowe to our servicemembers and their families--the funding, authorities, \nand equipment necessary for our troops to succeed in combat; and \nsignificant and critical reforms to the military retirement, \ncompensation, and acquisition systems--many of which I will talk about \nin further debate on this bill in the days and hours ahead.\n  However, I regret that I am unable to support this conference report \nbecause it shifts $38 billion requested by the President for enduring \nor base military requirements--the base budget, if you will--to the \noverseas contingency operations, or OCO, account, essentially, skirting \nthe law known as the Budget Control Act, or BCA.\n  Again, this is a maneuver to get around a statute that was signed by \nthe President, voted for by Congress, and which has imposed budget caps \non every department. Central to that agreement was the significant \nconsensus that domestic and defense discretionary spending would be \ncapped. What this conference report does is violate that consensus by \nusing OCO in a way that it was not originally intended to be so used.\n  This budget gimmick allows the majority to fully fund the Defense \nDepartment without breaking caps imposed by the BCA on both defense and \nnondefense spending. However, the OCO account provides no relief for \nnondefense departments and agencies, and that includes many agencies \nthat are critical to our national security. Because of this device, I \nand nearly all of the Democratic conferees on the bill did not sign the \nconference report.\n  Abusing OCO, as this bill would do, is counter to the intent of the \nBudget Control Act. The BCA imposed proportionally equal cuts to \ndefense and nondefense discretionary spending to force a bipartisan \ncompromise to our ongoing budget difficulties. OCO and emergency \nfunding are outside budget caps for a reason. They finance the cost of \nongoing military operations or they respond to other unforeseen events \nsuch as national disasters. In my view, to suddenly ignore the true \npurpose of OCO and treat it as a budgetary gambit in order to skirt the \nBCA caps is an unacceptable use of this important tool for our \nwarfighters in the field.\n  Adding funds to OCO does not solve--and actually complicates--DOD's \nbudgetary problems. Defense budgeting needs to be based on our long-\nterm military strategy, which requires the Department of Defense to \nfocus at least 5 years into the future. A 1-year plus-up to OCO does \nnot provide DOD with the certainty and stability it needs when building \nits 5-year budget.\n  Just to highlight how this OCO gimmick skews defense spending, \nconsider the amount of OCO in relation to the number of troops \ndeployed. Again, I think it is a useful metric because OCO evolved when \nwe were deploying troops overseas--first in response to Afghanistan \nduring Operation Enduring Freedom and then with respect to Iraq. And \nthere is a correlation, at least in the minds of most people, between \nour efforts overseas with troops engaged and the size of OCO.\n  In 2008, at the height of our Nation's troop commitment in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and with approximately 187,000 total troops deployed, we \nspent approximately $1 million in OCO for every servicemember deployed \nto those countries. Under this bill, we will spend approximately $9 \nmillion in OCO\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\nfor every servicemember deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan--roughly about \n9,930 people, in DOD projections. So this increase has gone some place. \nIt hasn't gone overseas, directly to the men and women who are \nfighting, but it has gone to other accounts within the Department of \nDefense.\n  In addition to this phenomenon, within the next few years the \nservices will begin procuring new weapons systems while modernizing and \nmaintaining legacy weapons systems. For example, in the Future Years \nDefense Program, or FYDP, the Department will spend $48 billion to \nprocure the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; $10.6 billion for the Ohio-class \nreplacement program; $13.9 billion for the Long Range Strike Bomber; \nand $29.7 billion for the Virginia-class submarine program.\n  Each of these programs is critically important to our national \ndefense, and we must ensure they are robustly funded. But if the BCA \ncaps remain in place, it is likely tough budget choices will need to be \nmade. As a result, if we decide to stay within the stringent budge \ncaps, we may be forced to fund these programs at the expense of other, \nequally meritorious programs. We will have a choice of not investing \nfully in these necessary strategic improvements or using legacy \nsystems, which are still important, to pay for them--tough choices.\n  Alternatively, and what I think is more likely to happen, these \nprograms will be funded in the base budget. However, in order to ensure \nthe budget caps are not breached, funding will be shifted from the \noperations and maintenance accounts to the OCO account in order to \naccommodate increased procurement for new weapons systems. In many \nrespects, that is what is happening with this $38.3 billion that \nshifted from the traditional base budget into the OCO budget account \nfor O requirements.\n  What you have here is a sense of budgetary sleight of hand. We know \nwe have these increased demands coming to us because we do have to \nrecapitalize on strategic systems, in particular. If we have the BCA \ncaps in place, we have to find money some place, and that is likely to \nbe the OCO account. We will see a fund, OCO, which was designed to \nsupport ongoing operations overseas suddenly be used to pay for long-\nterm base budget items, i.e., recapitalization of our strategic \ndeterrent forces.\n  If we use this scheme this year--maybe with good intentions and the \nonly honest intention of 1 year to get us ahead--it will be easier to \ndo it next year and the year after that, ensuring that this imbalance \nbetween security and domestic spending continues. As we all recognize, \neffective national security requires that non-DOD departments and \nagencies also receive relief from the BCA caps. The Pentagon simply \ncannot meet the complex set of national security challenges without the \nhelp of other government departments and agencies--including State, \nJustice, and Homeland Security.\n  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Christine Wormuth made this \npoint when she was before the Armed Services Committee a few weeks ago \nto testify on our strategy to counter ISIL, which many Americans \nbelieve to be the top national security threat facing our country. The \nDepartment of Defense is only one part of a whole-of- government \napproach to defeating ISIL. Secretary Wormuth said:\n\n       ``It will take more than just the military campaign to be \n     successful [against ISIL]. We also will need to dry up ISIL's \n     finances, stop the flows of foreign fighters into Iraq and \n     Syria in particular, protect the United States from potential \n     ISIL attacks, provide humanitarian assistance to rebuild \n     areas cleared of ISIL forces, and find ways to more \n     effectively counter ISIL's very successful messaging \n     campaign.''\n\n  Unfortunately, we will effectively diminish our national capabilities \nto do all these things by underfunding non-DOD departments and agencies \nthat are critical to our national security. Use of the OCO gimmick--it \nhas been referred to that by many people--in this bill facilitates \nunderfunding those departments, and it should not be supported. We need \nan all-out governmental effort to provide for our national security. \nUnderfunding State, Treasury, and other departments is not going to get \nus that all-out effort. And when it no longer becomes easy to underfund \nnondefense agencies, my suspicion is that nondefense programs will \nbegin appearing in OCO. There is some precedent to this. For example, \nin fiscal year 1992, Congress added funds to the defense bill for \nbreast cancer research. At the time, discretionary spending was subject \nto statutory caps under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990--the follow-\non legislation to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985. That was a \nsituation where they were capping discretionary domestic spending, but \ndefense spending was uncapped, and this is a situation that I think we \nare recreating in this conference report. That initial funding led to \nthe establishment of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research \nProgram, and I think every Senator is familiar with this important \nprogram. It has strong bipartisan support, and each fiscal year \nCongress authorizes and appropriates hundreds of millions of dollars to \nthe program for cutting-edge and critically essential medical research.\n\n  In fact, since 1992, this program has received over $13 billion in \nfunding. While this program is funded through the annual Defense bill \nand the program is managed by the Army, the Department of Defense does \nnot execute any of the money itself. It is a competitive grant process, \nand proposals are subject to stringent peer and programmatic review \ncriteria. Essentially, the money goes out to medical research \nfacilities throughout the United States. For all intents and purposes, \nit is a medical research program much like we fund through NIH.\n  I am a strong supporter of medical research and a strong supporter of \nthis program, and indeed this program has, through its research and \nthrough its efforts, saved countless lives, but my concern is that \nunder the aegis of OCO, approaches and budgetary maneuvers like this \nwill become common. It will be a way to skirt the budget caps. If we do \nit this year, we have set a precedent for next year and the following \nyear, and 10 years from now the Defense bill could authorize billions \nof dollars of funding for programs that may be meritorious but will \nhave little or nothing to do with national defense and should be \nproperly budgeted within our base budget from other departments. \nIndeed, some programs should be properly funded within the Department \nof Defense's base budget.\n  Simply put, this approach, which circumvents the Budget Control Act, \nis not fiscally responsible or honest accounting. It is time we come \ntogether as a Congress--before the short-term continuing resolution \nexpires--to fulfill our responsibilities to the American people, \nespecially our troops and their families, to fully fund our government \nby revising or eliminating the budget caps proposed by the BCA on both \ndefense and nondefense spending.\n  In fact and indeed, if it were not for the OCO issue, I would have \nlikely signed the conference report and voted for this bill. However, I \nbelieve this OCO issue is too important. The Secretary of Defense \nbelieves it is too important, the President believes it is too \nimportant, and he said he will veto this bill and any other bill that \nrelies on this OCO gimmick. As Secretary of Defense Carter said last \nweek:\n\n       ``Without a negotiated budget solution in which everyone \n     comes together at last, we will again return to \n     sequestration-level funding, reducing discretionary funding \n     to its lowest real level in a decade despite the fact that \n     members of both parties agree this result will harm national \n     security. . . . Making these kinds of indiscriminate cuts is \n     managerially inefficient, and therefore wasteful, to \n     taxpayers and industry. It's dangerous to our strategy, and \n     frankly, it's embarrassing in front of the world.''\n\n  These are the words of the Secretary of Defense, echoing the comments \nthat we have heard from uniformed military leaders about the inherent \ndangers of sequestration if it is allowed to continue forward.\n  The BCA was created by Congress to address the immediate threat of \nwhat would have been a catastrophic national default and to compel \nCongress to come together and reach a balanced compromise on the \nbudget. It is time for Congress to make the hard choices, modify or \neliminate the caps in the BCA, and end the threat of sequestration. It \nis not just an appropriations issue. It is affecting everything we do. \nUnfortunately, it affects the Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense \nAuthorization Act and therefore I will not be prepared to support this \nlegislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                      Passing Appropriations Bills\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Democrats have spent a lot of time lately \ntalking about the importance of keeping the government open. Well, the \nSenate Republicans couldn't agree more. We know Congress has a \nresponsibility to ensure that our Nation's priorities are funded, and \nwe spent a lot of time this year working on that.\n  In May, we passed the first joint House-Senate balanced budget \nresolution in more than a decade, and by the end of July the Senate \nAppropriations Committee had approved all 12 appropriations bills for \nthe first time since 2009. It was the first time in 6 years that the \nSenate Appropriations Committee approved all 12 of the appropriations \nbills, but there is one problem. For all their talk about providing for \nthe government, apparently Democrats are reluctant to take any action \nwhen it comes to actually passing these bills through the Senate. \nRepublicans tried to bring up the Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs appropriations bill last week, but Democrats refused to allow \nthe Senate to even consider it. We couldn't get on the bill. They \nblocked the motion to proceed to even get to debate that bill.\n  That is right. Senate Democrats, who spent weeks talking about \nfunding the government, refused to allow the Senate to even debate a \nbill that would fund military construction, protect our homeland, and \nkeep the promises we made to our veterans.\n  I might be able to understand Democrats' position if they had been \nshut out of the process on this legislation, but they weren't. The \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill was \ndebated in the Appropriations Committee, where Members of both parties \nwere given an opportunity to offer amendments and to help shape the \nbill's contents. The bill passed out of the committee with an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority. If Democrats had allowed the bill to \nreach the floor, they would have had yet another opportunity to debate \nand amend the legislation, but the Senate Democrats wouldn't even let \nthe bill come to the floor to be debated. They blocked the motion to \nproceed to the bill that would even allow us and allow them an \nopportunity to be heard and an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Some Democrats have threatened to block the bill that we are \ncurrently considering this week, which is the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which again is a bicameral agreement that authorizes \nfunding for our Nation's military and our national defense. This is the \nbill that ensures our soldiers receive the bonuses and the pay they \nhave earned, that their equipment and training will be funded, and that \nour commanders will have the resources they need to confront the \nthreats that are facing our Nation. Like the bill Democrats blocked \nlast week, this legislation is the product of a bipartisan committee \nprocess, and it received bipartisan support when it came out of the \ncommittee. More than that, it received strong bipartisan support on the \nSenate floor when it first came up for consideration in June.\n  This bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds our \nmilitary's priorities, was reported out of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--a big vote--it came to the floor of the Senate, received a \nbig bipartisan vote in the Senate, but now some of the very same \nDemocrats who supported this bill a little more than 3 months ago are \nplanning to vote against it. On top of that, President Obama has \nthreatened to veto this bill when it gets to his desk.\n  The question is, Why are Democrats opposing a bill that would \nauthorize the funding our troops need to operate?\n  Historically the National Defense Authorization Act has received \nstrong bipartisan support, and there is a good reason for that. \nHistorically both Democrats and Republicans have known that we have a \ngreat responsibility to the men and women who keep us safe, and we have \nmade a habit of working together to try and meet that responsibility.\n  Why are things different this year?\n  Well, basically Democrats have decided that since they can't get \neverything they want, they are going to take their ball and go home. \nRepublicans knew Democrats were considering this, of course, but we had \nhoped that after months of successful collaboration, they would rethink \nthat strategy because, as I said, all 12 appropriations bills were \nreported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee with bipartisan \nmajorities, collaboration, input from both sides, amendments offered \nand amendments voted on, but unfortunately it has been clear over the \npast week that Senate Democrats and the President are committed to \nfollowing through on their plans to obstruct these bills.\n  Their argument is that they want more money for this or for that, and \nthey are not going to fund the military until they get more money for \nwhatever their domestic priority is--whether it is more funding for the \nEPA or the IRS or some other agency of government. That is what this is \nabout. It is somewhat staggering to think that some Senate Democrats \nwould think of blocking the National Defense Authorization Act after \nsupporting this bill in June. It is pretty hard to explain why one \nwould think a bill is good one day and not the next. Let's just remind \nourselves what they are voting to block and what the President is \nthreatening to veto. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes \nfunding for our Nation's military and our national defense--from \nequipment and training for our soldiers to critical national security \npriorities, such as supporting our allies against Russian aggression \noverseas.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we are proud to host the 28th Bomb Wing \nat Ellsworth Air Force Base, one of the Nation's two B-1 bomber bases. \nThe B-1s are a critical part of the U.S. bomber fleet, and bombers from \nthe 28th Bomb Wing have played a key role in armed conflicts that the \nUnited States has engaged in over the past 20 years.\n  During Operation Odyssey Dawn, B-1s from Ellsworth launched from \nSouth Dakota, flew halfway around the world to Libya, dropped their \nbombs and returned home all in a single mission. This marked the first \ntime in history that B-1s launched combat missions from the United \nStates to strike targets overseas.\n  Without the National Defense Authorization Act, however, the funding \nlevels needed in 2016 to maintain these bombers and the readiness of \nour airmen at Ellsworth will not be authorized. It is that simple. That \nis what is at stake with this bill.\n  If the President chooses to veto this legislation, he is vetoing the \nbill that authorizes benefits for our troops and the funding our \nmilitary needs to operate. He is also vetoing authorization for the \nweapons, vehicles, and planes our military needs to defend our country \nagainst future threats, such as the Long Range Strike Bomber, which is \none of the Air Force's top acquisition priorities, and it also \nrepresents the future of our bomber fleet.\n  By vetoing this bill, the President would also be vetoing a number of \ncritical reforms that will expand the resources available to our \nmilitary men and women and strengthen our national security.\n  For instance, this year's National Defense Authorization Act tackles \nwaste and inefficiency at the Department of Defense. It targets $10 \nbillion in unnecessary spending and redirects those funds to military \npriorities like funding for aircraft, weapons systems, and \nmodernization of Navy vessels.\n  The bill also implements sweeping reforms to the military's outdated \nacquisitions process by removing bureaucracy and expediting \ndecisionmaking which will significantly improve the military's ability \nto access the technology and equipment it needs.\n  The act also implements a number of reforms to the Pentagon's \nadministrative functions. Over the past decade, Army headquarters staff \nhas increased by 60 percent. Yet in recent years the Army has been \ncutting brigade combat teams. From 2001 to 2012, the Department of \nDefense's civilian workforce grew at five times the rate of our Active-\nDuty military personnel.\n  The Defense authorization bill we are considering changes the \nemphasis of the Department of Defense from administration to \noperations, which will help ensure that our military personnel receive \nthe training they need and are ready to meet any threats that arise.\n  This bill also overhauls our military retirement system. The current \nmilitary retirement system limits retirement benefits to soldiers who \nserved for 20 years or more, which does not\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\napply to 83 percent of those who have served, including many veterans \nof the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The National Defense Authorization \nAct replaces that system with a modern retirement system that would \nextend retirement benefits to 75 percent of our servicemembers.\n  No time is a good time to veto funding for our Nation's troops. But \nwith tensions in the world where they are, the decision by Senate \nDemocrats and the President to block this funding authorization is \nparticularly unconscionable.\n\n  As we speak, ISIS is carving a trail of slaughter across the Middle \nEast, Russia is becoming increasingly aggressive, and Iran is \ncontinuing to fund terrorism. Thanks to Iran's nuclear deal, Iran will \nsoon have access to increased funds and the ability to purchase more \nconventional weapons. That is right. While President Obama is \nthreatening to veto a bill that funds our Armed Forces, he has agreed \nto a deal with Iran that gives Iran access to over $100 billion to fund \nterrorism and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. That same flawed Iran \ndeal waives the sanctions on Iranian leaders, including General \nSoleimani, who is responsible for the deaths of American soldiers in \nIraq, yet the President is threatening to veto pay bonuses and improved \nmilitary retirement benefits for our soldiers here at home.\n  The President's Iran deal also gives Hezbollah and Hamas more funding \nto spread terrorism, yet the President is threatening to veto \nadditional resources for our allies to defeat ISIS as well as missile \ndefense systems for our allies, including Israel. Right now, President \nObama is threatening to veto funding for our advanced weapons systems \nfor U.S. military forces, yet his nuclear agreement gives Iran access \nto conventional weapons, ballistic missiles, and advanced nuclear \ncentrifuges.\n  Now, above all, in the wake of this flawed Iran deal and growing \nchaos in the Middle East, holding up funding for our troops by blocking \nthis authorization bill is unacceptable.\n  While Senate Democrats and the President may have decided to pursue a \nstrategy of obstruction, it is not too late for them to change their \nminds. They can still cast a vote in favor of funding for our military \nand our national security priorities. I hope that before this vote \nhappens today, they will rethink their opposition and join Republicans \nin supporting this critical bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Senate took up the fiscal year \n2016 National Defense Authorization Act, I opposed it. I did not \nbelieve that the Senate had fully debated some of the most \nconsequential provisions of the bill. But a majority of the Senate \nallowed that bill to move forward, and now we have a compromise before \nus that is a step even further backward.\n  The biggest but by no means only problem with this bill is, of \ncourse, the overseas contingency operations account, which has been \nturned into an escape hatch for defense spending over Budget Control \nAct caps. Those caps imposed by the Budget Control Act--across defense \nand nondefense spending--were intended to force Congress to the table \nto realistically address fiscal concerns. Today, those caps are hurting \ndefense spending, though not nearly as much as they are devastating \ndomestic spending.\n  Other problematic sections are related to Bush-era detainees kept at \nGuantanamo Bay. The new Guantanamo restrictions contained in this \nconference report are a needless barrier to efforts to finally shutter \nthat detention facility. The bill would continue the unnecessary ban on \nconstructing facilities within the United States to house Guantanamo \ndetainees and the counterproductive prohibition on transferring \ndetainees to the United States for detention or trial. Even more \ntroubling, this year's NDAA would undo the important step taken by \nCongress in 2013 to streamline procedures for transferring detainees to \nforeign countries. Section 1034 of this year's bill would reimpose \nonerous, unnecessary, and unrealistic certification requirements that \nmust be satisfied before transferring detainees to third countries--a \nstep in exactly the wrong direction. Transfers should be accelerating, \nnot slowing down.\n  As long as Guantanamo remains open, it will continue to serve as a \nrecruitment tool for terrorists and tarnish America's historic role as \na champion of human rights. Maintaining the detention facility at \nGuantanamo is also a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars. We spend an \nastonishing amount at Guantanamo--a single detainee costs approximately \n$3.4 million per year to maintain--at a time when budgets are tight and \nthat money is needed elsewhere; yet this conference report does not \neven include the cost-saving measure from the Senate bill that would \nallow detainees to be brought to the U.S. on a temporary basis for \nmedical treatment. Closing Guantanamo is the morally and fiscally \nresponsible thing to do, and I strongly oppose the unnecessary \nstatutory restrictions in this conference report.\n  The concerns with this conference report do not end with Guantanamo \nBay. Massive changes to our procurement system that will recreate \nstovepipes we eliminated with the Goldwater-Nichols reforms and \nadjustments to benefits given to men and women who serve and have \nserved in order to pay our bills are just two examples. But what's not \nincluded is significant, too. There are several provisions related to \nthe National Guard that enjoyed strong Senate support and yet were \nstripped in this so-called compromise, most inexplicably a provision I \nauthored to better account for the requirements placed on the Guard. A \nsimilar provision was included in the House-passed bill. Rather than \ncompromising between the two as the rules call for, both were simply \ndropped from the bill.\n  It is too bad that, in exchange for these controversial provisions, \ngood policy will be left behind. This NDAA would have promoted the \nbipartisan National Guard State Partnership Program Enhancement Act to \nstrengthen the State Partnership Program, which leverages unique \nNational Guard capabilities and relationships to bolster our national \nsecurity agenda around the world, at pennies on the dollar. This would \nhave been a considerable improvement.\n  I want to recognize Senator McCain's efforts to ensure that the \nconference report includes the McCain-Feinstein antitorture amendment. \nThat provision would codify in statute the interrogation standards in \nthe Army Field Manual--not just for military personnel, but for \nintelligence agents as well. Last year, Senator Feinstein and the \nSenate Intelligence Committee exposed the CIA's horrific practices \nunder the Bush administration. The McCain-Feinstein amendment is the \nnext step toward ensuring that America never tortures again. If this \nbill does not become law, the Senate should take action to make the \nMcCain-Feinstein amendment law this year.\n  Every year, the National Defense Authorization Act provides an \nopportunity for Congress to support our men and women in uniform and \nalign our national security priorities with our fiscal obligations. \nThis bill falls far short, and I cannot give it my support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The issue before us is a conference committee report on the House \nDefense authorization bill. It is not the spending bill; it is the \nauthorizing of spending. It is a bill that largely is bipartisan. There \nis no argument on either side of the aisle to support our troops, no \nargument against providing the technology and weaponry they need to \nkeep themselves and Americans safe. The issue before us is a larger \nbudget issue that goes even beyond the Department of Defense but \ncertainly includes it, and that is, how are we going to fund our \ngovernment?\n  The Republican approach is to put in $37 billion to $38 billion of \nmade-up money. In other words, they take $37 billion or $38 billion of \nwhat is known as OCO funds, or war funds, and just assume it is there \nand put it in the budget for the Department of Defense only, but they \ndon't put money in for nondefense agencies. So they adequately fund the \nDepartment of Defense--in fact, some say generously fund it--and\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nthen cut back in the rest of government. What is the difference? What \ndifference does it make?\n  The cutbacks include, on the nondefense side, medical research at the \nNational Institutes of Health. The cuts include adequate resources for \nthe Veterans' Administration to keep our promise to the men and women \nwho have served us in the military. The cuts include keeping America \nsafe when it comes to homeland security and the FBI. So they make cuts \nin all of these agencies but provide the funding for the Department of \nDefense.\n  We argue: Let's have some balance. We want to give our troops the \nvery best treatment, but we certainly don't want to shortchange the \nother side of government--the nondefense side--and that is what the \nbudget negotiations are all about.\n  So Republican after Republican comes to the floor and says the \nDemocrats don't care about the military. That is not true; both sides \ncare about the military. But there are other parts of our government \nthat are important as well for the safety of the United States and the \nfuture of the United States. Whether it is education or medical \nresearch or caring for our veterans, let's have a balance in our budget \nthat acknowledges that reality, and let's look at a couple other things \nthat are realistic too.\n  How many people in America think we are suffering from not enough \nhandguns on the streets of America? There are some who do. There is a \nprovision in this bill which is no surprise to people who follow \nlegislation on Capitol Hill. The gun lobby is always looking for a way \nto expand their universe of more guns in America. So they proposed, in \nthe House of Representatives--the Congressman from Alabama proposed--\nthat the military sell 100,000 .45-caliber semiautomatic handguns \nwithout any background checks on the purchasers. That was the proposal \nin the House--100,000 semiautomatic handguns without any background \nchecks on the purchasers. Did they really do that? They did. It was in \nthe bill. Jack Reed, the Senator from Rhode Island who is the ranking \nDemocrat, changed that provision and limited it from 100,000 to \n10,000--10,000 handguns--and said they have to go through dealers so \nthere will be a background check.\n  I raise that point because guns are in the news again. Guns are in \nthe news every day. Each day 297 Americans are shot with firearms, and \n89 lose their lives. We saw the terrible tragedy last week. I was \nstunned to hear on NPR over the weekend that what happened at Roseburg, \nOR, was the 45th school shooting in America this year--the 45th this \nyear.\n  We have to do something about it. It is not going to be solved with \nthis bill alone, but it will be solved if Democrats and Republicans \nstart looking for reasonable ways to limit the access of guns from \nthose who have a history of committing criminal felonies or a history \nof mental instability. I am glad the Senate conferees cleaned up the \nHouse provision that would have dumped 100,000 handguns into the hands \nof purchasers without any kind of background check. I still believe \nthis bill goes too far when it comes to that gun issue.\n  I will close by saying this: We are all committed to the military and \nthe defense of the United States. Many of us believe the agreement with \nIran that precludes their development of a nuclear weapon will lead to \na safer world. We are going to carefully monitor it, as we promised we \nwould, for the sake not only of Israel but for all of the nations in \nthe region, as well as the United States. We want to make this a safer \nworld. We want to turn to diplomacy before we turn to a military \nresponse. I supported it, and I will continue to support it.\n  I hope, in the closing minutes of debate, that Members will reflect \non the fact that we can have a better deal not only to help our \nmilitary but to help those others who are funded by the nondefense side \nof the budget, to have some balance too, to make sure it isn't lopsided \nwith the money all going to the Department of Defense without \nacknowledging precious needs of America in many other nondefense \nsubjects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say with respect to the Senator from \nIllinois, he just authenticated an old saying: ``Talk is cheap.'' This \nis really one of the more remarkable performances by the other side.\n  We are talking about legislation that is vital to the welfare of the \nmen and women who are serving in uniform, yet the Senator from Illinois \nsays we shouldn't take care of them because he has another problem. \nThat is a logic which defies anything I have observed in a long time.\n  This is an authorization bill. It has nothing to do with the \nappropriations process and the money that needs to be spent or not \nspent on any kind of mechanism.\n  The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Nevada, the Democratic \nleader, keep talking about the fact that the budget passed by the \nBudget Committee by a majority vote here in the U.S. Senate calls for \nadditional funding for defense. So now, in direct contravention to \nthat, my friends on the other side of the aisle object to that \nprovision in the Budget Act and will now oppose legislation that \nauthorizes a pay raise for our troops, authorizes special pay and \nbonuses to support recruitment and retention, makes health care more \naffordable, increases access to urgent care for families, and knocks \ndown bureaucratic obstacles to ensure servicemembers maintain access to \nthe medicines they need as they transition from Active Duty.\n  There are literally tens if not hundreds of provisions that take care \nof the men and women who are serving in our military. So what do my \nfriends on the other side say? Turn this down because they don't like \nthe way it is funded. The fight is on the appropriations, my friends, \nnot on the authorization that defends this Nation.\n  To do this kind of disservice to the men and women who are serving in \nuniform is a disgrace. Please don't say that you support the men and \nwomen in the military, come to this floor and say that, and then vote \nno on this legislation. Don't do it. Any objective observer will tell \nus that the provisions in this bill are for the benefit of the men and \nwomen who are serving in an all-volunteer force.\n  The Senator from Illinois wants a ``better deal.'' I want a better \ndeal. I am tired of our providing funds for the military on a year-to-\nyear ad hoc basis. I don't like it. I hate sequestration. I think \nsequestration risks doing permanent damage to our ability to face this \nNation at a time when there are more crises in the world than at any \ntime since World War II--when there is a flood of refugees, when the \nChinese are moving into the Spratly Islands, endangering the world's \nmost important avenue of commerce, while Vladimir Putin dismembers \nRussia. And my colleagues from the other side of the aisle are now \ncomplaining that they didn't like the way it was funded.\n  I will tell my colleagues, this is a remarkable time. So apparently \nthe President of the United States--and we will talk about it later--\nwho has just shown his remarkable leadership with the insertion of \nRussia into Syria, which he did not find out about from his meeting \nwith Vladimir Putin of 90 minutes, and which his Secretary of State has \nsaid is an opportunity, and which his Secretary of Defense said was \n``unprofessional''--they are now slaughtering--slaughtering--young men \nwhom we trained outside of Syria and sent into Syria to fight against \nISIS and Bashar Assad, and the Russians are dropping bombs on them. It \nis an incredible situation.\n  There has never been a greater need to authorize and fund our \nmilitary--which is facing more challenges since the end of World War \nII--than today, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nurge a ``no'' vote. They will urge a ``no'' vote for the first time in \n53 years on an overall--not a specific issue but on a broad issue of \nthe budget. My friends want to turn down our authorization and our \nresponsibilities to the men and women who are serving in the military.\n  I urge my colleagues to rethink their misguided logic. Attack the \nappropriations bill. Let's all sit down and try to negotiate an \nagreement that takes care of all of these other aspects of our \ngovernment, but let's not do this to the men and women who are serving. \nLet's not prevent us from improving their quality of life. Let's not \nprevent them\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nfrom having a pay raise. Let's not prevent them from having the medical \ncare they need. Let's not do these things in the name of a budgetary \nfight.\n  Mr. President, I urge an ``aye'' vote on the motion to invoke cloture \nand on adoption of the conference report when the time comes. I will be \nspeaking a lot more about it between now, if we approve the cloture \nmotion, and when we vote on the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 1735, a bill to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n         John McCain, Bob Corker, John Hoeven, Ron Johnson, Dan \n           Sullivan, Steve Daines, Richard Burr, Joni Ernst, Deb \n           Fischer, Tim Scott, Orrin G.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes speaking \nabout a topic we should all be able to agree on, even in this polarized \nenvironment in which we live and work, and that is the idea that \ntransparency and accountability are key to good governance. \nTransparency and accountability are key to good governance.\n  Open government is a prerequisite for a free society, one in which \nthe legitimacy of government itself depends upon consent of the \ngoverned. In fact, we can't consent on something we don't know anything \nabout. My colleagues get my point.\n  As our Founding Fathers recognized, a truly democratic system depends \non an informed citizenry so they can hold their leaders accountable at \nelections and between elections. But the American people cannot do that \nwithout transparency. Justice Brandeis famously said that sunlight is \nthe best disinfectant, and he is right. That is why Congress has \nenacted numerous pieces of legislation that have promoted \naccountability and transparency in government so that good governance \ncan hopefully flourish.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. When I came to the Senate, I found a \nwilling partner in Senator Patrick Leahy from Vermont. Senator Leahy \nand I are polar opposites when it comes to our politics, but on matters \nof open government and freedom of information, we have worked closely \ntogether on a number of pieces of legislation. As we both have said, \nwhen a Democratic President is in charge or a Republican President is \nin charge, the first instinct is to try to hide or minimize bad news \nand to maximize the good news. That is human nature. We all get that. \nBut the American people are entitled to know what their government is \ndoing on their behalf, whether it is good, bad, or ugly.\n  So I have made transparency a priority of mine, and I have pressed \nfor more openness in the Federal Government through commonsense \nlegislation. One of those bills was the Freedom of Information \nImprovement Act, which would strengthen existing measures found in the \nFreedom of Information Act that was first signed by a Texas President, \nLyndon Baines Johnson. The Judiciary Committee passed that bill in \nFebruary by a voice vote, and I look forward to it passing in the \nSenate soon.\n  But even the very best laws with the very best intentions can be \nundermined by those who are willing to ignore or even abuse them. More \nthan 6 years ago, President Obama promised the American people that \ntransparency and the rule of law will be the touchstone of this \nPresidency. He said, ``Transparency and the rule of law will be the \ntouchstones of this presidency.'' Needless to say, his record has been \na disappointment because it certainly doesn't meet the description of \ntransparency and adherence to and fidelity to the rule of law.\n  For example, when an estimated 1,400 weapons were somehow lost by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in Mexico, with one of them--\nactually two of them--eventually linked to the murder of a U.S. Border \nPatrol agent, the Obama administration stonewalled congressional \ninvestigations. This was the Fast and Furious debacle. As a matter of \nfact, the Attorney General--then Eric Holder--refused to comply with a \nvalid subpoena issued by Congress so we could find out about it, so we \ncould figure out where things went wrong and how we could fix them so \nthey didn't happen again. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, rather \nthan comply with Congress's legitimate oversight request, refused and \nwas thus the first Attorney General, to my knowledge, to be held in \ncontempt of Congress--in contempt of Congress. Then, of course, there \nare the IRS and ObamaCare--instances in which this administration has \neither refused to testify to Congress or failed to answer our most \nbasic questions.\n  This administration has been equally dismissive of the press, who are \nalso protected--freedom of the press under the First Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution--leading dozens of journalists to send a letter to \nthe President asking him to end this administration's ``politically \ndriven suppression of news and information about Federal agencies.'' \nThat is really remarkable.\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\n  So we can see the American people have been stiff-armed by this \nadministration, and they have become increasingly distrustful of their \nown government. That is because secrecy provides an environment in \nwhich corruption can and does fester. In fact, according to a recent \npoll, 75 percent of Americans who responded believe there is widespread \ncorruption in the U.S. Government. Seventy-five percent believe that. \nThat is a shocking statistic and one that ought to shock us back to \nreality to try to understand what their concerns are and what we can do \nto address them because that is simply inconsistent with this idea of \nself-government, where 75 percent of the respondents to a poll think \nthe fix is in, and the government is neither accountable nor adhering \nto the rule of law.\n  It was back in March that the public first learned that a former \nmember of this administration, Secretary Clinton, used a private, \nunsecured server during her tenure as Secretary of State. It was just \nlast Wednesday that the State Department announced the release of even \nmore documents from Secretary Clinton's private email server. This \nongoing scandal has been but the latest example of this \nadministration's pattern of avoiding accountability and skirting the \nlaw. I will explain in just a few minutes why this is so significant \nand why this isn't something that ought to be just brushed under the \nrug and ignored.\n  Secretary Clinton's unprecedented scheme was intentional. It wasn't \nan accident. It wasn't negligence. She did it on purpose. It was by \ndesign. Her design was to shield her official communications--\ncommunications that under Federal law belong to the government and to \nthe people, not her. I can't see any other way to explain it. It was \ndeliberate. It was intentional. It was designed to avoid the kind of \naccountability I have been talking about today. There is just no other \nway to look at it.\n  Because her emails were held on this private server, the State \nDepartment was in violation of the legal mandates of the Freedom of \nInformation Act for 6 years, and it is only now, through Freedom of \nInformation Act litigation and more than 30 different lawsuits, that \nthe public is finally learning what it was always entitled to know, or \nat least part of it. By the way, that is the power of the Freedom of \nInformation Act and why it is so important. You can go to court and \nseek a court order to force people to do what they should have done in \nthe first instance so the public can be informed about what their \ngovernment is doing.\n  Secretary Clinton's use of a private, unsecured server as a member of \nthe Obama Cabinet is also a major national security concern. We have \nlearned that classified information was kept on and transmitted through \nthis server. According to the latest reports, the newest batch of \ndocuments released just last week have doubled the amount of emails \nthat contain classified information. News outlets are reporting that \nthere are more than 400 classified emails on the server, and that is \njust the report so far.\n  It is no coincidence that along with this news, the media has also \nreported that Russian-linked hackers attempted at least five times to \nbreak into Secretary Clinton's email account. That should make obvious \nto her and to everyone else the vulnerabilities that exist for a \nprivate, unsecured email server, one used by a Cabinet member in \ncommunicating with other high-level government officials, including \npeople in the intelligence community. This is absolutely reckless.\n  This Chamber is aware--we are painfully aware from the news--that \ncyber threats are all too prevalent today. It seems every week we read \na new story about different cyber attacks, cyber theft, cyber espionage \nagainst our own country. This last summer we discussed at length the \ndata breaches that occurred at the Office of Personnel Management. \nPeople who had actually sought and obtained security clearances so they \ncould handle and learn classified material--that information was hacked \nand made available to some of our adversaries. Then, of course, there \nis the information we all learned about the IRS being hacked as well. \nThe personal information contained in those two hacks alone covered \nmillions of Americans.\n  At a time when our adversaries are trying to steal sensitive national \nsecurity information, especially classified information, I find it \nincredibly irresponsible for Secretary Clinton or anyone else to invite \nthis kind of risk and to conduct routine, daily business on behalf of \nour Nation over a private, unsecured email server. I find it even more \negregious that she or her senior aides would send classified \ninformation over this same server.\n  I am not the only one who believes Secretary Clinton compromised our \nnational security by doing this. Just last month, before the Senate \nSelect Intelligence Committee, the current Director of the National \nSecurity Agency, ADM Mike Rogers, who also serves as commander of U.S. \nCyber Command, said conducting official business on a private server \nwould ``represent an opportunity'' for foreign intelligence operatives. \nIn other words, foreign intelligence services would relish the \nopportunity to penetrate the private server of a high-profile leader \nsuch as Secretary Clinton or any other Secretary of State who, once \nagain, is a member of the President's Cabinet, his closest advisers.\n  Some hackers clearly noticed this opportunity and tried to take \nadvantage of it, and we don't know--perhaps we never will know--the \nextent to which that national security information, that classified \ninformation was compromised.\n  We need to come to terms with the fact that due to Secretary \nClinton's bad judgment, it is probable that every email she sent or \nreceived while Secretary of State, including highly classified \ninformation, has been read by intelligence agents of nations such as \nChina and Russia who we know are regularly trying to hack into our \nsecure data and to learn our secrets or to steal our designs and to \nreplicate those by violating our commercial laws. So this email scandal \nis more than just bad judgment; it represents a real danger to our \nNation.\n  I am sorry to say, but it is true, that Secretary Clinton's actions \nmay well have violated a number of criminal laws. Under the \ncircumstances, the appointment of a special counsel by the Justice \nDepartment is necessary to supervise the investigation and ensure the \nAmerican people that investigation gets down to the bottom line and we \nfollow the facts wherever they may lead.\n\n  As I made clear in a recent letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, \nthe Department of Justice regulations themselves provide for the \nappointment of a special counsel if there is potential for criminal \nwrongdoing and if there is a conflict of interest at the Department of \nJustice or if extraordinary circumstances warrant the appointment.\n  Let me start by explaining which criminal statutes Secretary Clinton \nmay have violated.\n  Federal law makes it a crime to retain classified information without \nauthorization.\n\n       Whoever, being an officer . . . of the United States . . . \n     knowingly removes [classified] documents or materials without \n     authority and with the intent to retain such documents or \n     materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under \n     this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\n  That is 18 USC, section 1924.\n  We know from media reports that Secretary Clinton retained classified \ndocuments on her server. According to those reports, more than 5 \npercent of the latest emails released by the State Department contained \nclassified information. So we need a thorough, unbiased, impartial \ninvestigation to determine how those documents made it to Secretary \nClinton's unsecured server and whether she knew that was happening. A \nspecial counsel would be the best person and in the best position to do \njust that.\n  While Secretary Clinton may argue--which I heard her argue on news \nreports--that none of this information was marked ``classified'' when \nit was emailed to her, under the Espionage Act, that is irrelevant even \nif true, and I certainly doubt that is the case. According to the act, \nit is a crime to deliver national defense information to unauthorized \nindividuals. At 18 USC, subsection 793(d), it states that ``whoever, \nlawfully having possession of . . . any document . . . or note relating \nto the national defense . . . willfully communicates, delivers, \ntransmits . . . the same to any person not entitled\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nto receive it . . . [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not \nmore than ten years, or both.''\n  So you can see this is serious. This is serious stuff and deserves to \nbe treated with that same requisite seriousness, and that is again why \nit is so important to have an impartial investigation.\n  We know, for example, that information on North Korea's nuclear \nprogram was in Secretary Clinton's emails. I was recently with some of \nmy colleagues at Pacific Command, and Admiral Harris, a four-star \nadmiral, the head of Pacific Command, said that on his list of security \nthreats confronting his region of the world, North Korea is at the top. \nIt has nuclear weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and it has \na leader who is capable of doing just about anything he could imagine. \nIt is a very dangerous situation and a very serious national security \nissue. Yet Secretary Clinton was communicating information or had \ncommunicated to her on her private email server information about North \nKorea's threat. We don't know whether that information was among the \n200 classified emails released by the State Department last week. We \nknow her lawyers and perhaps others reviewed every email on her server \nbefore turning them over to the State Department. We don't know who \nreviewed them, whether they had a proper clearance, whether they were \nactually entitled to see classified information, and that is why a \nspecial counsel would be important to answer that question too.\n  Under the Espionage Act, we see that it is a crime to remove national \ndefense documents or permit them to be stolen. Here is a summary of the \nstatute: ``Whoever, being entrusted with . . . any document . . . \nrelating to the national defense . . . through gross negligence permits \nthe same to be removed from its proper place of custody . . . or to be \nlost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed . . . shall be fined under this \ntitle or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.''\n  Now we know that the server was not held in a proper place of \ncustody, and we know from the testimony of experts in the intelligence \ncommunity that the likelihood that something was removed from Secretary \nClinton's server by foreign hackers is high. Last week, as I said \nmoments ago, news outlets reported that they were certainly trying. So \na special counsel could answer this question and determine whether this \nstatute was violated and how it should be enforced if it was violated.\n  What greater example of gross negligence is there than for a high \ngovernment official, such as the Secretary of State of the United \nStates of America, a member of the President's Cabinet, to communicate \nall business on a private, unsecured server when it is likely--and \nmaybe more than just likely--it is almost certain that sensitive \nnational defense information would pass through it?\n  We simply don't know what other laws may have been broken or whether \nthere are other explanations that Secretary Clinton might have that \nmight shed some light on this. But this is certainly why a special \ncounsel should be appointed. And I would say that if Secretary Clinton \nand the Obama administration are confident that no laws have been \nbroken, then why wouldn't they embrace the appointment of a special \ncounsel?\n  I would point out that in another case, the President's own \nDepartment of Justice has aggressively pursued the mishandling of \nclassified information in the past. So my simple request in calling for \na special counsel is that the same rules apply to Secretary Clinton.\n  The Department's clear conflicts of interest in this case and the \nextraordinary circumstances surrounding it could not be more obvious. \nAs a high-level official in the administration for 4 years, Secretary \nClinton is clearly allied with the administration. As a former First \nLady and a U.S. Senator, Secretary Clinton has a deep professional and \npersonal relationship with the administration, including the \nPresident's choice for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. I would think \nMs. Lynch, the Attorney General, would want the sort of integrity and \nproper appearance that would occur by appointment of special counsel \nrather than have it look as if she has simply sat on this information \nand not conducted a thorough investigation herself.\n  I am simply calling for that kind of investigation. As somebody who \nspent 17 years of my life as a State court judge and attorney general, \nI believe that sort of investigation is entirely warranted. Of course, \nsome of my Democratic colleagues--including the Senators from Vermont \nand California--have already claimed that this call for a special \ncounsel is some sort of political stunt. The senior Senator from \nCalifornia was quick to say that calls for a special counsel are purely \npolitical and completely unnecessary and would amount to wasting \ntaxpayer dollars. Well, I would like to point out to both Senators from \nVermont and California that each of them on more than one occasion has \ncalled for a special counsel in the past. Surely I don't think they \nwould characterize their own call for a special counsel in the same \nterms that the current call for a special counsel is described.\n  While serving as Senators, the President of the United States, Barack \nObama, and former Secretary Hillary Clinton, while both of them were \nSenators, called for the appointment of a special counsel.\n  All of that is to say that requesting an appointment of a special \ncounsel is not uncommon, and it is clearly warranted in this case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the response from the \nJustice Department to my letter requesting a special counsel be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2015.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn:  This responds to your letter to the \n     Attorney General dated September 15, 2015, requesting that a \n     Special Counsel be appointed to investigate the use of a \n     private e-mail server by former Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton.\n       The Special Counsel regulations, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 6001, which \n     were issued as a replacement for the former Independent \n     Counsel Act, provide that in the discretion of the Attorney \n     General, a Special Counsel may be appointed when an \n     investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice \n     (the Department) would create a potential conflict of \n     interest, or in other extraordinary circumstances in which \n     the public interest would be served by such an appointment. \n     This authority has rarely been exercised.\n       As you know, the Department has received a security \n     referral related to the potential compromise of classified \n     information. Any investigation related to this referral will \n     be conducted by law enforcement professionals and career \n     attorneys in accordance with established Department policies \n     and procedures, which are designed to ensure the integrity of \n     all ongoing investigations.\n       We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact this office if we may provide additional \n     assistance regarding this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter J. Kadzik,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would just say that for those who are \ninterested in reading the response--interestingly, I didn't get a \nresponse from the Attorney General, to whom I addressed the letter; I \ngot a response from the Assistant Attorney General. I read it over and \nover and over again, and it doesn't agree to the appointment of a \nspecial counsel and it doesn't refuse to appoint a special counsel. In \nother words, it is a non-answer to the question. I don't know what \nreason the Attorney General or the Department of Justice might have for \nleaving this open-ended and not actually declining at this time to \nappoint a special counsel, if that is their conclusion, but they simply \ndidn't answer the question.\n  I would just say in conclusion that my constituents in Texas sent me \nhere to serve as a check on the executive branch, and I am going to \ncontinue to press the Attorney General and the rest of the \nadministration for answers because the American people deserve the sort \nof accountability and, indeed, in the end, justice that need to be \ndelivered in this case--not a sweep under the rug, not a playing out \nthe clock until the end of the administration, but answers that can \nonly come from an independent investigation conducted by a special \ncounsel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy until about 3:40 p.m. with Democrats and Republicans who are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\nshow up here--I think Senator Vitter, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Manchin, and we may have others who will be here.\n  I see my good friend Senator Inhofe is here.\n  Senator Inhofe, we are now beginning. And Senator Whitehouse is here. \nSo if the Senator would like to jump in with his statement, that would \nbe great at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much.\n\n\n                              TSCA Reform\n\n  Mr. President, let me first mention that you don't see many things \naround this Chamber that are truly bipartisan, and you are about to see \none now.\n  I have to give credit to the Senator from New Mexico for the great \njob he has done in making it a possibility to even be talking about \nthis now. I am honored to be chairman of the public works committee. We \ndo a lot of significant work in that committee. We just passed out \narguably the second most significant bill of the year, which was the \nhighway reauthorization bill, and others. It is a very busy committee. \nHowever, the issue we are concerned about today--and I want to talk \nabout it a little bit--is the bill we have been working on for a long \nperiod of time.\n  We had a great Member--Frank Lautenberg--of the Senate for a number \nof years. He and I became good friends on this committee when Democrats \nwere for 8 years the majority party, and prior to that we were in the \nmajority for a long time. During that timeframe, Frank Lautenberg and I \nbecame good friends. We had some things in common people were not aware \nof; that is, we both came from the corporate world. We were involved in \ndoing things together and looking at things through a corporate mind.\n  But this bill we are talking about now is one where we are enjoying \n60 cosponsors.\n  I would mention that Bonnie Lautenberg is in the Gallery today. She \nhas been so cooperative. If you can single out one legacy of the great \nFrank Lautenberg, it would be this bill. I can remember calling Bonnie \nand asking if she would be willing to come and testify before the \ncommittee--this was some time ago--and she was more enthusiastic than I \nexpected she would be, and she has been a big help.\n  It is great to see so many of my colleagues excited about TSCA reform \nand specifically the Lautenberg bill, which now has overwhelming \nsupport on both sides of the aisle. For a long time, we have been \nfocused--and rightfully so--on the public health and environmental \nbenefits of reforming this 39-year-old failed law. I know a lot of my \nfriends across the aisle who are here will continue talking about that \ntoday, so I wanted to take my time on the floor to tell them some of \nthe benefits of TSCA reform that they might not be aware of, from a \nRepublican perspective.\n  TSCA reform, in addition to providing greater protections for \nfamilies in my State of Oklahoma and the rest of the country, can play \na pivotal role in boosting our economy, creating well-paying American \njobs, and creating regulatory certainty for businesses not only in the \nUnited States but across the world.\n  Today, the U.S. chemical industry is experiencing a resurgence. \nNobody had ever predicted it. For years, chemical manufacturing has \nbeen moving its way out of this country, relocating in places such as \nChina, Saudi Arabia, and South America. One of the reasons for this is \nthat we have this antiquated law on the books that made it very \ndifficult for them to operate in the United States. So we kind of got \nused to this. Everyone was leaving the United States because of that. \nNow they are coming back. The interesting thing is, there are two \nreasons that I am going to mention to you in a minute for why they are \ncoming back and what it means to us economically.\n\n  In the last few years, one thing has completely flipped the idea on \nits head that we are not going to be able to change the laws that are \nregulating the chemical industry. Natural gas liquids are the primary \nfeedstock for chemical manufacturing in the United States. Due to the \nshale boom or the shale revolution--we are very sensitive to that in my \nState of Oklahoma--natural gas production from companies such as \nContinental Resources, Devon, Chesapeake Energy--all in my home State \nof Oklahoma--manufacturers have an abundant and reliable source of \nnatural gas for decades to come.\n  This provides the stability and certainty that manufacturers need to \nonce again make major investments in the United States. There is no \nbetter example of an industry reinvesting in this country because of \nour energy revolution than the chemical industry. As of this June, the \nchemical industry has announced 238 investment projects valued at $145 \nbillion. Let me repeat that: $145 billion in new capital investments in \nthe United States of America by the chemical industry in large part due \nto American natural gas production.\n  This investment is predicted to be responsible for over 700,000 new \njobs along with $293 billion in permanent new domestic economic output \nby 2023. The benefits don't stop there. This investment is also \npredicted to lead to $21 billion in new Federal, State, and local tax \nrevenue in the next 8 years and will lower our trade deficit by \nincreasing our exports by nearly $30 billion by 2030.\n  Right now the U.S. chemical industry is capturing market share from \naround the world, and all of those facilities that packed up and moved \nto China, moved to the Middle East, and moved to Western Europe are \nrushing back. You don't have to look any further than comments by folks \nsuch as Antonio Tajani, the European Commissioner for Industry, who \nsaid:\n\n       When people choose whether to invest in Europe or the \n     United States, what they think about most is the cost of \n     energy. The loss of competitiveness is frightening.\n\n  In North America as a whole, chemicals and plastics production is \npredicted to double in the next 5 years, while it falls by one-third in \nEurope. In other words, it will go down by one-third in Europe. At the \nsame time, it doubles in the next 5 years in the United States. Some of \nyou may be wondering what this has to do with TSCA reform because I am \ntalking about the cheaper prices of energy. The main stock for \nchemicals is natural gas.\n  Specifically, the Lautenberg bill, what we are talking about today--\nlet me tell you, passing this bill and getting TSCA reform signed into \nlaw not only provides these domestic industries with one manageable \nnational rule book so products can be manufactured and distributed in \nall 50 States consistently, it also provides necessary regulatory \ncertainty, the lack of which could be the one thing to drive away this \nmuch needed economic investment.\n  Moreover, today global chemical manufacturing and use, in the absence \nof a coherent and functioning U.S. chemical policy, is dominated by the \nEuropean system called REACH. I will not get into much detail about the \nEuropean regulatory system, but it is significantly more burdensome and \ncostly than many of our businesses can afford to deal with.\n  Unfortunately, today it is the global standard. By enacting \nmeaningful U.S. chemical policy, our Nation will be on the path to once \nagain be the world leader, not only in chemical manufacturing or \nmanufacturing in general but to set the global standard in how \nchemicals should be managed. That is what we are talking about. That is \nwhat this is all about. So there are two things that are bringing this \nindustry back to the United States. One is our plentiful and cheap \nnatural gas and the other is this legislation.\n  Imagine people anticipating that the legislation is going to pass and \nmaking corporate decisions bringing back many jobs to the United \nStates. So there is going to be a surge in economic benefit, and \nconsequently right now the price of natural gas, the main feedstock \nthat goes into chemical manufacturing, is far cheaper in this country \nthan it is in Europe.\n  So I say to my good friend who has carried this ball, Senator Udall, \nthat it is great that those two things are happening at the same time. \nAgain, when I looked around at the press conference we had this \nmorning--and we saw everyone ranging from the most liberal Democrats \nand the most conservative Republicans. That does not happen very often \nin Washington, DC. I think a lot of it is due to my good friend from \nNew Mexico, along with\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\nSenator Vitter, who has been carrying this ball.\n  I would vacate the floor and ask for any comments.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Inhofe very much. I thank \nhim for his leadership. He is the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I remember we came early on--Senator Vitter and \nmyself--to him, and said: We have been working on this bill a couple of \nyears. We think it is ready to go, but obviously it has to go through \nyour committee.\n  The Senator worked with us all the way along the line. A lot of this \nhas to do with his leadership and helping us with--amending it in a way \nto keep making it bipartisan. That has been the history of this bill; \nthat it has grown. As we know, it passed his committee 15 to 5.\n  I say to Chairman Inhofe, our next speaker, Senator Whitehouse, who \nis on your committee, was able to work with you and three other members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee to get the bill in shape \nso we could then get it ready for the floor. Working with you, we have \nmade a few additional tweaks and things, but I think it is ready to go; \ndon't you?\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, I would observe the number of \npeople who said--when the bill first started out, there was a lot of \nopposition. There was opposition in our committee. I think a lot of the \npeople on the committee were surprised when we passed it on a \nbipartisan basis. Then, of course, once it got down to the floor--this \nis going to have support from all corners.\n  Again, yes, it was a bipartisan effort. It is kind of rewarding to \nhave that happen now and then. This is a good example.\n  Mr. UDALL. This is a great example. Thank you so much. Once again, we \ncould not have done this without your leadership, your chairmanship of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. You helped us shape this \nand helped us move in a bipartisan way.\n  I am going to next ask Senator Whitehouse to talk a little bit \nbecause Senator Whitehouse has the ability--the experience of a State \nofficial, a former State attorney general.\n  He took a look at this bill. It was ready to go in front of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. He looked at it as a former AG. \nHe looked at it in terms of the States being able to participate on \nenforcement and was able to help us craft a bill that could get out of \ncommittee 15 to 5.\n  Senator Whitehouse, we appreciate your help and your hard work on \nthis. You did an amazing job. Any thoughts, comments? Is this something \nthe Senate can take up and get done, in terms of where we have it right \nnow?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would answer my colleague's question \nby saying that I think we are very definitely ready to go. We are \nparticularly ready to go because of Senator Udall's achievement in \nsecuring the 60th vote, a filibuster-proof majority who are on this \nbill as cosponsors. That does not count people who are willing to vote \nfor it. I think we always had 60 people voting for it, but to have 60 \npeople willing to cosponsor it so it is clear from the get-go that if \nthis bill is called up, it will get through.\n  I think that is very important. There was some dispute on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We had a very lively hearing. I \nthink the impact of that hearing caused people to go back and say: We \nreally do need to improve this bill in some way. I commend Senator \nMerkley and Senator Booker for joining me in I guess a little mini \n``Gang of 3'' to pull the bill to a place where we would all support it \nin the committee. That is part of how it got to 15 and 5.\n  I think, since then, what Senator Udall has been able to accomplish \nis some of those 5 have now come over to join the 15. So to say that it \nis a 15-to-5 EPW committee-supported bill actually understates this \nsupport because of Senator Udall's continued work.\n  There is one issue on which I want to make a particular point because \nI know both Senator Udall and I have served as attorney general of our \nStates. We take this question of a sovereign State's ability to defend \nits own citizens very seriously. We both were attorneys general. We had \nthe responsibility to very often lead for the State those public \nprotection efforts.\n  So we wanted to be very careful about making sure there was a \nsignificant role for the States in this bill to look out for the health \nand the safety of their citizens. What we came up with is a provision \nthat I believe tracks very closely with the constitutional provisions \nthat govern this. A State is restricted from taking action here if it \nwould unduly burden interstate commerce. Well, that is a statutory \nrestriction. But guess what. As Senator Udall knows, that is also the \nconstitutional restriction under the so-called dormant commerce clause. \nSo we were not going to be able to move much further than that anyway. \nThat is essentially the commerce clause written into legislative text.\n  The next is if the action by the State would violate a Federal law or \nregulation. There is another part of the Constitution called the \nsupremacy clause, which says that when Congress has made a decision, \nthe States cannot overturn it. Once again, the restriction that we have \non States coming to protect their citizens mirrors and matches a \nrestriction that exists in the Constitution.\n  The last piece says that if a State is going to regulate in this \narea, it has to be based on peer-reviewed science. There is a third \nclause in the Constitution called the due process clause. Under the due \nprocess clause, the regulatory agency cannot just willy-nilly regulate. \nIf it does, its regulation can be challenged as being arbitrary and \ncapricious. In order to meet the challenge that it is arbitrary and \ncapricious, it has to be based on a sound factual foundation.\n  Here in the realm of science, that foundation is peer-reviewed \nscientific evidence. So as a former attorney general working with a \nformer attorney general, I think we are confident that where this bill \nis now gives our colleague attorneys general the ability to have a very \nstrong case to be made that they still have the authority to take \naction where their State has a real problem and people's health and \nsafety is suffering and somebody needs to act, even if somebody at EPW \nwill not.\n  I will close by saying this. This has been an education in \nlegislating for me. I came out of being a prosecutor, I came out of \nbeing an executive official, I came out of being a staff person for a \nGovernor, and I came out of being a practicing lawyer. But watching \nSenator Udall work has been instructive because--he will not say but I \nam prepared to say that he cosponsored this bill at a time when he did \nnot like it. I think he cosponsored this bill at a time when what he \nsaw was not that ``this is the bill I am going to go with,'' but he saw \nthat we need to fix TSCA, we need to have a bipartisan solution to \nthis, and ``if it takes me signing up for a bill I don't like as the \nopener to begin building that consensus''--that went first with Tom, \nthen with Senator Carper coming on, then with our Merkley-Booker-\nWhitehouse contingent, and now most recently with Senators Durbin and \nMarkey joining us--he has been the thread that has made all of that \npossible.\n  I wish to close by expressing a personal appreciation to him for \nhanging in there--particularly through that early period when there was \nnot a lot of support for this in our caucus--and working with us and \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Vitter to build the coalition that has today \nmade 60-plus cosponsors possible.\n  Congratulations to Senator Udall, and I thank him for letting me say \na few words.\n  Mr. UDALL. I say to Senator Whitehouse, thank you so much.\n  I just want to say about Senator Whitehouse--I mean, this bill would \nnot be where it is today had we not had that trio working in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I really believe that. They \ntook the bill that was coming up, we had a hearing on it, and they \nreally analyzed it and applied all the principles Senator Whitehouse \nand I have both talked about, and they came up with a very significant \nimprovement. We are here today because of his hard work.\n  I have been very open. I think Senator Vitter, who will join us in a \nminute, has been very open. Both of us said: Give us your ideas, give \nus your input, and we are going to take a look at it. We got technical \nadvice from the\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\nEPA and asked, ``Will this work?'' because they are over there running \nthis bureau.\n  So the Senator should feel very good about moving it down the field \nto the point where we are today.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My only caution going forward is that, for all the \nwonderful work that has been done by Senator Vitter and Senator Udall \nto pull us together, for all the support that has been reached here, \nthis is still a fairly delicate compromise. We first have to figure out \nand solve the procedural blockages that are preventing this from going \nthrough this Chamber.\n  I would suggest that the majority party ought to be supporting the \npassage of legislation that is led by the majority party. It is the \nminority party's role to throw up objections and to make demands \nagainst legislation proceeding. So maybe not everybody on the other \nside is completely taken aboard, but they are in the majority now. So I \nthink those blocks will be cleared and we will have the chance to go \nforward. But then we have to do something with the House. Either they \nhave to pass something or they have to pass this or we end up in \nconference. I think it is important that the record of this bill \nreflect that there is not a whole lot of wiggle room here for mischief \nto be accomplished between the House and the Senate.\n  My confidence is that--I really do think the industry supports this \nbill. They have worked with us, they have worked with you, and so I \ndon't think there is a huge incentive for mischief, but I think we do \nhave to be on our guard that the spirit, the structure, and the key \npoints of this piece are preserved in anything that goes forward \nbecause otherwise we will be back where we started, with everybody back \nin their seats again.\n  Mr. UDALL. I say to Senator Whitehouse, I couldn't agree more. I \nthink those are the delicate phases we have to go through.\n  What we have been telling our House colleagues all along is we have \nworked long and hard on this, we have been more comprehensive than they \nhave, and so we need their patience to work through it with us. There \nis not a lot of room. I couldn't agree with you more that that is where \nwe are today.\n  I have good relationships in the House. I served there 10 years. Fred \nUpton, John Shimkus, and Frank Pallone are all willing to work with us. \nI believe that if we look at what our goal is--to protect the American \npublic and to protect vulnerable populations--we can get this done.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. While we have the floor and until Senator Vitter \ncomes, might it be a good time to say a kind word about our staffs?\n  Mr. UDALL. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I know that during our process, our staff worked \nenormously hard, and the Senator's has been at this for a longer time \nthan just that intense period of negotiation where we moved the bill in \nour section, so I defer to the Senator to make those comments. I would \napplaud the Senator's staff and Senator Vitter's, who have been doing a \nterrific job.\n  Mr. UDALL. I couldn't agree with the Senator more.\n  I also wish to talk a little bit about Senator Frank Lautenberg. I \nhave a picture here of him with his grandchildren.\n  But let me first say, Senator Whitehouse, did you wish to mention \nyour staff member who worked on it, who I know spent time with Jonathan \nBlack and with the whole team? We have a great team of staff members \nwho are very goal-oriented and who want to get things accomplished.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My team was led by Emily Enderle, who leads my \nenvironmental team. She has terrific credibility in the environmental \ncommunity, and she knows these laws very well, but even with that it \nwas an enormously complicated task. This was a big bill. I forget the \nnumber of changes we actually put into it in the course of that \nnegotiation, but it was 20, 22. It was a large array of changes, so it \nwas a lot of work in a short period of time. Emily, the Senator's \nstaff, and everybody who was involved in that really dove in and worked \nhard in the best traditions of good staff work in the Senate with the \nintention to get to ``yes.''\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank Senator Whitehouse. I very much appreciate his \ncomments here today and especially appreciate his participation in \nterms of moving this forward in a bipartisan way.\n  I worked with my staff diligently on this bill. I was lucky to have a \nchief of staff by the name of Mike Collins who spent many hours working \non this. My legislative director, Andrew Wallace--Drew Wallace--worked \non this. He is a lawyer by training. Jonathan Black was the legislative \nassistant in the main policy area. He has been with this bill all \nalong, and he is very evenhanded and very good at dealing with the \nother staff members in getting people to focus on the goal and not get \ninto the arguments and not get sidetracked.\n  I think this is true of the staff on the Republican side and the \nstaff on the Democratic side. We have had tremendous support, and I \nexpect that to go forward when we start. Indeed, if we can get floor \ntime and get this out--and I believe the bill is ready to go--I think \nwe have the kind of staff effort in the House and the Senate that can \nresolve most of the major differences without too many problems. So \nthat is what we are looking forward to.\n  As I said earlier, I would like to say a few words about Senator \nFrank Lautenberg. This is a picture of Senator Lautenberg and his \ngrandchildren. I served on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwith Senator Lautenberg for a number of years, and there couldn't have \nbeen anything he was more passionate about than his grandchildren. You \nsaw that in his public work.\n  Before I got onto the committee, Senator Lautenberg was a champion in \nterms of smoking and indoor smoking and tobacco smoke hurting people \nand passed some significant legislation. So it was particularly moving \nto me to hear him say--when he got on this compromise bill with Senator \nVitter, he said he thought that bill, the Lautenberg-Vitter bill, would \nsave more lives than all the work he had done in the public health and \nenvironmental arena. I know he said that to Bonnie Lautenberg. And that \nreally hit all of us. He saw the legislation, he saw how it was going \nto evolve, and he really believed this would make a difference.\n  I saw that in Senator Lautenberg over and over again on the \ncommittee. Whenever an issue would come up--it didn't matter what issue \nit was--he always came back to his grandchildren: Are we doing the \nright thing by our children? So if we were looking at a infrastructure \nissue and the question was ``How do we frame the best possible \ninfrastructure package?'' he was looking out a couple of generations in \nthe future and saying ``Are we going to pass on a better infrastructure \nsystem so we can grow jobs and do those kinds of things?'' He had \npassion about it, and he brought up his grandchildren on a frequent \nbasis.\n  We all miss him very much, and we have named this bill after him. \nThis bill is the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century \nAct. Everybody is going to know how it started because he was one who \nbelieved in fighting for the very best, but he always believed in \ncompromise.\n  I will never forget when Senator Lautenberg had what I would call the \nperfect bill--I guess that is the best way to describe it--and he was \nable to pass it through the Environment and Public Works Committee, but \nit passed without a single Republican vote. When it passes out of \ncommittee, it is now ready for floor time. But everybody realized that \nwithout any Republicans on the bill, it wasn't going to go anywhere. So \nleadership said: You know, you better go back to square one. You can't \nget this out of the Senate the way it is currently crafted.\n  To Senator Lautenberg's credit, he then took the opportunity to \nvisit--I believe Senator Manchin was involved with this in terms of \nthem going together, and they started talking and saying: Maybe we can \ncome up with something which is bipartisan and which can attract people \nfrom both sides. And that was the original Lautenberg-Vitter bill that \nwas introduced. This is one of the interesting things: It immediately \nhad 24 cosponsors--12 Republicans and 12 Democrats. I was one of those \ncosponsors. I think that was due to the very good staff work--he had \nsome great people on his staff--but it was also due to his meeting of \nthe minds with Senator Vitter, coming together, and finding that common \nground.\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\n  I will never forget that on that bill, the New York Times came out \nalmost immediately--they had huge respect for Senator Lautenberg, and \nthey said: You know, this is much better than current law. Congress \nought to pass this. Of course, it needs a couple of changes--and I \nthink they mentioned three things in their editorial. We eventually \nmade those three changes they were talking about. But that just shows \nthe respect Senator Lautenberg had. He was able to work with everyone, \nhe was able to convey to the media what he was trying to do, and he had \ntremendous support for engaging the other side.\n  One of the things that has helped us come such a long way is--we lost \nFrank, and then I joined with Senator Vitter on the bill. We lost \nFrank, but we haven't lost Bonnie, his widow. Bonnie Lautenberg has \nbeen in this from the very beginning, wanting to see this bill become \nlaw and wanting to see that her children and grandchildren are \nprotected. I remember very well the speech she gave on the floor of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Senator Inhofe was very \ngenerous in terms of saying: If Senator Lautenberg's wife, Bonnie \nLautenberg, wants to come and testify on the bill, we are going to put \nher right up front.\n  She spoke very eloquently at the EPW Committee earlier this year:\n\n       Frank understood that getting this done required the art of \n     compromise. . . . This cause is urgent, because we are living \n     in a toxic world. Chemicals are rampant in the fabrics we and \n     our children sleep in and wear, the rugs and products in our \n     homes and in the larger environment we live in. How many \n     family members and friends have we lost to cancer? We deserve \n     a system that requires screening of all chemicals to see if \n     they cause cancer or other health problems. How many more \n     people must we lose before we realize that having protections \n     in just a few states isn't good enough? We need a federal \n     program that protects every person in this country.\n\n  That was Bonnie Lautenberg testifying before the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  Earlier today, we also had a large number of groups, which I will \ntalk about in a little bit, and Bonnie Lautenberg came down once again \nand spoke eloquently about the need to get this done for our children \nand to have a tough cop on the beat who is going to look out there, \nanalyze these chemicals, and try to do the right thing when it comes to \nthat regulatory effort--at the same time, as Senator Inhofe said, \nworking with the business community.\n  It has been great having Bonnie Lautenberg work with us. I know she \nfeels so passionate about this, she picks up the phone from home and \ncalls Senators and says: The bill is at this particular point. We need \nyour help. Will you take a look at it, and get with your staff?\n  She has been quite an advocate in terms of moving this legislation \nalong.\n  Now, I just want to say a little bit about what happened earlier \ntoday because it was really a remarkable experience to see the coming \ntogether of Democrats and Republicans and for us to finally reach the \n60 votes we need in order to break a filibuster and get the bill on the \nfloor. We had a variety of groups represented from the public health \nand environmental side. There was my good friend Fred Krupp from the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, Collin O'Mara from the National Wildlife \nFederation, and then we had representatives from the March of Dimes, \nthe Humane Society, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, \nMoms Clean Air Force, and other groups there on that NGO side.\n  We also had business leaders such as former Congressman Cal Dooley, \nwith whom I served in the House of Representatives. Cal is now the head \nof what is called the American Chemistry Council. And there were other \nleaders who were there also from the business side: the Alliance of \nAutomobile Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, and the American Petroleum Institute.\n  When we got them all there and saw them together, the big question I \nasked was this: Who would have ever thought that all of these groups \nwould be together supporting this bill and wanting this bill to move \nforward?\n  So that is one of the reasons we say to the leadership now that this \nbill is ready to go. It has 60 Senators. We believe the actual votes \nwould be higher than that, but clearly we have 60 cosponsors now, and \nwe are ready to roll here. So that is something that is very important \nfor both the leadership on our side and the leadership on the \nRepublican side to know, that we are willing to do the hard work on the \nfloor and willing to make sure that these kinds of issues that will \narise as we move through this we can take care of.\n  Now, I want to say a little bit about--I am hoping Senator Manchin or \nSenator Vitter will arrive at some point here because they have crucial \nthings they want to talk about. But people should understand that the \nToxic Substances Control Act of 1976 is there to protect American \nfamilies, and it doesn't. There are over 84,000 known chemicals and \nhundreds of new ones every year, and only 5 have been regulated by the \nEPA--only 5 out of 84,000.\n  What is absolutely clear here is that the American people want and \ndeserve a government that does its job to keep families safe. That is \nwhy I rise today to urge support for the passage of the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. Senator Vitter and \nI introduced this legislation for one reason and one reason only--to \nfix our Nation's broken chemical safety law.\n  Ever since the EPA lost a lawsuit in 1991, it hasn't been able to \nregulate asbestos, a known carcinogen. So that was one of the key \nthings that Senator Lautenberg knew a lot about. In 1991--so imagine, \n20-plus years back--the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in a ruling said \nthat in their analysis and in the tests they put forward--and the \nlawyers at the EPA looked at it and said: We are unable to regulate \nasbestos now. We are unable to move forward. And no real activity has \ntaken place since then.\n  There is nothing that says something is more broken than when an \nagency is unable to move forward with the regulatory activities it was \nset up to do. So for decades the risks have been there, the dangers \nhave been there, but there is really no cop on the beat taking a look \nat chemical safety. The current system has failed. It fails to provide \nconfidence in our consumer products. It fails to ensure that our \nfamilies and communities are safe. So there is just no doubt that \nreform is overdue--40 years overdue. On this Sunday, TSCA will be 40 \nyears old.\n  I see my good friend Senator Vitter has arrived on the floor. Let me \njust take a moment, before I introduce Senator Vitter, to say that I \ncouldn't have a better partner. I remember that over 2 years ago, \nSenator Vitter and I met for dinner, and we talked about this bill. We \nsaid: Let's work on it with each other, and let's grow bipartisan \nsupport. The Senator has worked actively on both sides of the aisle, as \nhave I, and we have come a long way. We think we are ready to go. We \nthink this bill is ready to go. I sure appreciate the partnership that \nSenator Vitter and I have formed on this. He has been a man of his \nword. When he said he was going to do something, he did it, and that is \nthe way we have worked through all of the issues. And we have had many \nissues.\n  Just to inform the Senator, we are in a colloquy situation now until \nabout 3:40. I think we have about 5 more minutes of the colloquy, and \nthen Senator Daines, who has arrived, is taking time at about 3:40, \nunless we can persuade him to give us a minute or two more.\n  So I thank the Senator for his good work on this. He has really \npulled long and hard to get the bill to this point, and we are ready to \ngo; are we not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, absolutely we are ready to go, and I want \nto join my friend and colleague Senator Udall. I want to join the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Jim Inhofe, and urge all of us to \ncome together, as we have been doing over these many months, and \nactually pass a good solid bipartisan TSCA reform effort.\n  It was over 2 years ago that I sat down with the late Senator Frank \nLautenberg of New Jersey in an attempt to find compromise and work \ntogether on updating the drastically outdated Toxic Substances Control \nAct, what we are talking about and sometimes known as TSCA. Updating \nthis law was a long-time goal and passion of Frank's, as has been \nnoted, and I am\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\nsaddened he is not here today to see it finally moving forward because \nhe worked so hard for that.\n  After Frank's passing, Senator Tom Udall stepped in to help preserve \nFrank's legacy and continued working with me to move bipartisan TSCA \nreform forward. But in the time since, Senator Udall and I have worked \ntirelessly to ensure the bill substantively addresses the concerns of \nour fellow Republican and Democratic colleagues as well as concerns and \nideas from industry and the environmental and public health \ncommunities.\n  If you need any evidence of this being accomplished, look no further \nthan the 60 bipartisan cosponsors of this bill--60 bipartisan \ncosponsors--as well as endorsements from groups ranging from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nAmerican Chemistry Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, the March \nof Dimes, and the Humane Society.\n  The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act was \ncreated to balance the needs of the regulatory bodies, the chemical \nindustry, and the affected stakeholders in an effective and transparent \nway. Our bipartisan legislation ensures that Americans will have the \ncertainty they deserve that the EPA is overseeing the safety of \nchemicals in the marketplace without stifling industry's success and \ninnovation.\n  That work has been a long time in coming, as many of my colleagues \nhave noted, but it is here, and now we need to move forward. We have a \nmoment of opportunity we need to act on, and I urge all of us to come \ntogether here on the floor and get this done now. In our work in the \nSenate, these opportunities don't come a dime a dozen. They do not come \nevery day. They are here before us right now, and so I urge all of us \nto act.\n  We have virtually unanimous agreement about a way to move this \nthrough the Senate on an extremely short time frame. The only issue is \nSenators Burr and Ayotte and their desire to have a vote on a \ncompletely unrelated piece of legislation. I am completely sympathetic \nto their wanting a vote, but we have an agreement otherwise to deal \nwith TSCA on the floor in 2 hours and move it through the Senate. So we \nmust take up this opportunity in an effective, bipartisan and \nresponsible way, and I urge all of us to do that.\n  I look forward to doing that in the very near future, and I thank \nagain everybody who has worked so tirelessly on this, including my lead \nDemocratic partner in this effort, Senator Tom Udall.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator so much. As I have said, he has been a \ngreat partner to work with on this. He has always been a man of his \nword.\n  Senator Manchin is now on the floor, and I thought it would be good \nfor him to talk a bit about his involvement. I know he was an early \ncosponsor. He was a good friend to Senator Lautenberg.\n  I say to Senator Manchin, one of the issues we have been talking \nabout is the question of whether this bill is ready to go, but please, \nit is open for your comment and discussion. Please proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill that \nis long past due--long past due--and one that, in part, honors our dear \ncolleague and my dear friend Frank Lautenberg. Anybody who served with \nFrank knew he served with compassion, and he had a passion with that \ncompassion that was unbeatable.\n  This is one of those pieces of legislation he had compassion for and \nthe passion to get it done, and I think we can all agree the current \nToxic Substances Control Act, which we know as TSCA, is inadequate and \nthe law is long past due to be reformed. The Toxic Substances Control \nAct has not been improved in more than 30 years.\n  I couldn't believe that when Frank explained to me the history of \nthis piece of legislation. How this all came about and how I became \ninvolved is that in 2013 I started talking to Senator Vitter. He was \nworking it diligently, and he told me that Frank had always been on the \nfrontline and championed this thing. So I went to Frank to get his \ninput, and he said: Joe, the time has come. We have to do something. We \nhave to move the ball forward. It is not going to be a perfect bill. I \nunderstand that. And to be honest, I have never seen a perfect bill. So \nwe worked on it, but Frank was willing to move it forward.\n  Here are the facts. In the 30 years that we have been talking about \ndoing nothing but talking about it, 80,000 chemicals have been \nregistered in the United States--80,000 new chemicals have been \nregistered--which many of us use every day. We use these unknowingly. \nOnly 200 have undergone EPA testing--only 200 out of 80,000. So Frank \nthought, very pragmatically, if we can just move the ball, can we do \n20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 or 50,000 of them? That is all we were \ntrying to do, and he knew this.\n  There is not one person here who can question Senator Lautenberg's \ndedication to not only reforming the law but also protecting the \nenvironment and the health and safety of every American. This thing got \na little bit nasty, to the point where Frank, really sincere about \nmoving this forward, knew he had to take some steps. After 30 years, I \ncan tell you Frank Lautenberg knew exactly what he was doing. He knew \nexactly that he had to make some adjustments to move the ball forward, \nand that is what we are here for. Frank wanted to do that.\n  So we had a long talk about that, and Frank said: Joe, try to move it \nif you can. So we all got together, our staffs got together, and things \nstarted to happen. Then Senator Udall became very much involved, and I \nappreciate that he was on the committee. He championed it from there. \nHe and Senator Vitter are sitting on that committee and really making \nthings happen.\n  Reforming TSCA would establish much needed regulatory certainty for \nthe chemical industry, which directly and indirectly employs about \n40,000 West Virginians and over 800,000 people nationwide. When Senator \nLautenberg met with Senator Vitter, he toughened many of the most \nimportant provisions in the law, and Senator Udall has taken up that \neffort and further strengthened the bill.\n  The bill we have before us includes increased States' rights under \npreemption. That was our hangup for a long time. They worked through \nthis, and I commend both of them for working through preemption and \nmaking sure that the States that have been out front and doing things \nare not going to be harmed by this. That was never the intention.\n  It ensures that doctors, first responders, and government health and \nenvironmental officials would have greater access to confidential \nbusiness information to guarantee that those potentially exposed to \nharmful chemicals could receive the best possible treatment.\n  Most importantly, it contains a safety standard that, unlike current \nlaw, is based solely on human health and the environment and includes \nno cost-benefit analysis.\n  Now let me get personal here. In my State we had Freedom Industry \nleak a chemical called MCHM, used in the coal cleaning process in West \nVirginia. We had no idea what effect this chemical had on humans. We \nhad one plant, one intake on the Elk River that supplied about 300,000 \nhomes with water. The whole valley was affected--everybody. Don't drink \nit, don't bathe in it, don't wash. We didn't know what effect it would \nhave so all precautions were taken. It shut down a whole industry. It \nshut down the whole community--the whole city, if you will.\n  In July of last year, I pushed the NIH and CDC to conduct further \nstudies into the potential impacts of crude MCHM. We didn't know. We \nhad to push them, and we had to get everybody onboard to tell us as \nquickly as they could what effect it has on our humans and on our \nchildren. Does it have any long-lasting effects?\n  The NIH's National Toxicology Program concluded their study into \ncrude MCHM and indicated that no long-term health effects should be \nexpected for residents who were impacted. That was great news, but it \ncame long after a lot of harm was done.\n  While I am thrilled with the findings, we shouldn't have to wait more \nthan 1 year to get safety information on the chemicals in question. \nThis bill that we are working on right now would require the EPA to \nsystematically review\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\nall chemicals in commerce for the first time ever. While this will be a \nlong process, it is far superior to the current system that allows the \nchemicals we use every day to go untested for health impacts on all of \nus.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that the bill could be better. I \nassure you it could be better. Every bill that we ever pass here could \nbe better. But you have to start somewhere. Frank Lautenberg knew that. \nAfter 30 years, he said: Listen, enough is enough. If Frank Lautenberg \nhad been able and we could have gotten this done 2, 3 years later, my \ncommunity, my State--300,000 residents out of 1.8 million--wouldn't \nhave been affected for 1 year with the uncertainty of what effect it is \ngoing to have on them.\n  I do know that before I decide to vote for a bill, I ask myself three \nthings. Will this improve the quality of life of my constituents? Is it \nbetter than the status quo? And have we worked as hard as we can to \npreserve our core beliefs? For me, the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety \nfor the 21st Century Act is a yes on all three. It is a win-win for all \nof us. Senator Lautenberg was an extremely smart legislator who knew it \nwas time to move past partisan politics and craft a bill that would \nfinally protect all Americans. This bill does that. It does it in grand \nfashion.\n  I think Senator Vitter summed it up. We have a little bit of a \njousting going on, if you will. I understand it. I sympathize with \nSenator Burr and Senator Ayotte in wanting to get a piece of \nlegislation that most of us--I think all of us--support. It may not be \nthe right fit for it right now, and this bill should go as clean. As \nmuch work and as much time as has elapsed, this bill should go clean. I \ntruly believe that.\n  We are committed with our energy bill coming up, as we are with the \nLWG--the land-water grant--and we are going to be there. We are going \nto fight for that. But it should be done in a different format than \nwhat this piece of legislation is being done in and given how important \nthis piece of legislation is--the Frank Lautenberg legislation, which \nhe worked so hard on and dedicated his life to. I want to make sure \nthat we support this in the fashion that it should be. It is \nbipartisan. There are not too many things here that are bipartisan. \nThis is one moment that we should seize and move forward for all of our \nconstituents.\n  With that, I say to Senator Udall, I commend you for the job you have \ndone and the work you have put into this, and I know that Frank would \nbe proud of you.\n  Mr. UDALL. I say to Senator Manchin, I want to thank you too because \nI know you have labored hard on this, and you helped the original \ncosponsors get together and talk with each other and help them find \ncommon ground. With Senator Vitter here, we both believe we are going \nto have a couple of meetings now to try to move forward with the bill, \nas you have talked about, and meet with leadership and iron out the \ndifferences. But this thing is ready to go.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If I may, I ask the Senator, the preemption was the last \nthing hanging, right?\n  Mr. UDALL. Yes.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. You have worked through that. All of our States that had \nconcerns about that know they will not be usurped by preemption, that \nwe will commence and you have to reduce your standards.\n  Mr. UDALL. The key here is that States are going to be able to \nparticipate much more. When we started with the original bill, we \nworked more towards having States participate.\n  I know that Senator Daines has been very generous to us and shown us \ngreat courtesy. We have run over our time. I am going to yield the \nfloor, Senator Manchin, unless you have something else.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I would like to recognize Mrs. Lautenberg here to \nobserve this historic moment.\n  We are so happy to have you here, Bonnie. I know that Frank would be \nproud of you, having fought the good fight that he fought forever.\n  There is our good friend right there.\n  Mr. UDALL. Earlier, before the Senator got here, this is what I \nshowed everybody, which is a picture of Frank and his grandchildren. \nYou know well how he always talked about his grandchildren--\n  Mr. MANCHIN. God bless.\n  Mr. UDALL. And how we were supposed to legislate with grandchildren \nin mind.\n  I wish to thank Senator Daines for his courtesies. The Senator can \ncount on me and Senator Manchin to work with him on the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Senator Manchin is from West Virginia, but I am from \nthe West, like he is. I think we all believe that should move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Montana has a rich legacy of service to \nour country. From maintaining our Nation's peace-through-strength \nstrategy at Montana's Malmstrom Air Force Base, where we oversee one-\nthird of our Nation's intercontinental ballistic missiles, to our Army \nand Air National Guard members' work to support our communities in \ntimes of emergency and respond to calls for deployment overseas, \nMontana is playing a critical role in meeting our Nation's security and \nmilitary needs. Montanans know firsthand the importance of supporting \nour men and women in uniform.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act is critical to ensuring \nservicemembers have the funding and support they need to fulfill their \nmissions. The NDAA prioritizes the needs of our servicemembers, while \nprotecting the important role that Montana holds in our national \ndefense. The passage of this legislation is critical to carrying out \nour missions in an increasingly dangerous world.\n  In fact, earlier this year former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He described the \nperilous state of our global security: ``The United States has not \nfaced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end of the \nSecond World War.''\n  The threats we face from Syria, Russia, China, and ISIS are too \nserious for our troops to lack the resources they need to protect and \ndefend our Nation from foreign threats. Yet the leader of our troops, \nour Commander in Chief, has threatened to veto the bipartisan NDAA, \nwhich would fund our military priorities at the levels he requested. \nThis is the same foreign policy agenda that has become the hallmark of \nPresident Obama's now famous ``lead from behind'' strategy.\n  Even former Democratic President Jimmy Carter agrees. In fact, \nearlier this summer, President Carter was asked whether he thought \nPresident Obama's foreign policy was a success or failure on the world \nstage. Here is what President Carter replied: ``I can't think of many \nnations in the world where we have a better relationship now than we \ndid when he took over.''\n  President Carter then continued: ``I would say that the United \nStates' influence and prestige and respect in the world is probably \nlower now than it was 6 or 7 years ago.''\n  This weekend the Washington Post's editorial board criticized \nPresident Obama for holding our troops ransom for his domestic policy \nagenda. That editorial said this:\n\n       American Presidents rarely veto national defense \n     authorization bills, since they are, well, vital to national \n     security. . . . Refusing to sign this bill would make \n     history, but not in a good way.\n\n  It is a mistake for President Obama to use our troops for leverage. \nOur troops deserve better. The NDAA seeks to provide our troops with \nthe support they deserve. It fully authorizes spending on defense \nprograms at the President's budget request level of $612 billion for \nfiscal year 2016. It authorizes $75 million for the Southern Border \nSecurity Initiative to help address challenges facing the U.S.-Mexican \nborder. It supports servicemembers beyond their years of sacrifice to \nour Nation by extending retirement benefits to the vast majority of \nservicemembers left out of the current system. It includes a provision \nthat mirrors my legislation, which I introduced, called the Securing \nMilitary Personnel Response Firearm Initiative Act, or SEMPER FI Act, \nwhich empowers a member of the Armed Forces to carry appropriate \nfirearms, including personal firearms, at DOD installations, reserve \ncenters, and recruiting centers.\n  Additionally, this bill provides much-needed support for Montana's \nmilitary missions. There is $19.7 million for the Tactical Response \nForce Alert Facility\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nat Malmstrom Air Force Base. There is $4.26 million for an energy \nconservation project at Malmstrom. It authorizes funding for Avionics \nModernization Program Increments 1 and 2 to ensure that our C-130s can \nstay in the air. It authorizes funding for C-130 engine modifications. \nIt expresses the sense of Congress that the nuclear triad plays a \ncritical role in ensuring our national security and that it is the \npolicy of the United States to operate, sustain, and modernize or \nreplace the triad and to operate and modernize or replace a capability \nto forward-deploy nuclear weapons and dual-capable fighter bomber \naircraft.\n  The heroes of our Nation serve our country selflessly day in and day \nout, and they don't deserve partisan politics. It is unfortunate that \ncritical appropriations for our military and veterans were blocked in \nrecent weeks. Today's vote shows there is overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport to fund our troops. Given this, it is senseless that partisan \npolitics continue to block funding for our troops.\n  I urge our Democratic Senators to put politics aside. Let's do what \nis right. Join me in supporting the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. Our heroes deserve our utmost respect and the \nsecurity to carry out their missions without threats--without threats \nfrom our Commander in Chief. Congress has a constitutional duty to \nprovide for the funding of our troops. This body needs to uphold that \nresponsibility. Let's do what is right. Let's pass the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    The Economy and EPA Regulations\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, last Friday the Obama administration \nreleased the latest numbers on unemployment and jobs, and once again, \nthe numbers were grim. Experts predicted that our economy would create \n200,000 new jobs in September. Instead, they fell woefully short. There \nwere only 140,000 jobs, so they were about 60,000 jobs short. That is a \nbig miss. It is nowhere near as many jobs as America's families need \nnow.\n  Here is how Investor's Business Daily put it in a headline on Monday, \nOctober 5, ``Private Hiring Pace Is Worst In 3 Years; Labor Force \nShrinks.'' Wages have gone almost nowhere for 6 years. They actually \ndeclined in September. We have had 74 straight months with wage growth \nbelow 2 and a \\1/2\\ percent. Before the recession, we routinely had 3 \npercent growth month after month, but President Obama seems to be \nsatisfied with this limping progress. Over the weekend, he bragged \nabout how many jobs have been created while he has been President.\n  Is missing expectations good enough for President Obama? It is not \ngood enough for me. It is not good enough to get the economic growth \nthat we need in this country and that we should have coming out of a \nrecession.\n  One of the very big reasons for this slow growth is due to all of the \nregulations that this administration has piled onto the backs of \nAmerican families. Since 2009, this administration has come out with \nmore than 2,500 new regulations. According to the American Action \nForum, the total cost of all of these new regulations--this new red \ntape--is about $680 billion. That is more than $2,100 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America right now.\n  According to the World Bank, the United States is 46th in the world \nin terms of how easy it is to start a business. Is 46th in the world \ngood enough? Maybe it is good enough for President Obama, but I don't \nthink it is good enough for the American people. All of these \nregulations make it very tough for someone to start a business right \nnow. It is also tough for existing businesses to create new jobs.\n  Last week, the energy company Royal Dutch Shell announced that it was \ngoing to suspend drilling for oil off the coast of Alaska. They said \none of the reasons was ``the challenging and unpredictable federal \nregulatory environment in offshore Alaska.'' Too much regulation is \nmaking it too difficult to produce the American energy and American \njobs that we need.\n  Unelected, unaccountable Washington bureaucrats have been having a \nfield day at the expense of our economy. As the Obama administration \nruns down, it is in a race to get even more rules on the books.\n  Just last week the administration announced three big new \nregulations. On Tuesday, the EPA finalized a rule on oil refineries. It \nis going to require refineries to install new equipment and spend more \nmoney on something other than creating jobs and paying higher wages to \ntheir workers. It is estimated that the rule could cost up to $1 \nbillion and provide very little in the way of health benefits.\n  On Wednesday, the EPA finalized more limits on coal, gas, and nuclear \npowerplants. Just like Tuesday's rule, this one will cost another one-\nhalf billion dollars a year. The rule sets the unacceptable amounts of \nsome emissions at zero.\n  Finally, on Thursday the EPA released a new limit on ozone in the \nair. The limit was 75 parts per billion, and they cut it to 70 parts \nper billion. This is a tiny change--we are talking about parts per \nbillion--but that tiny change is going to cost more than $2 billion a \nyear once the rule is in full effect. Huge chunks of the country are \ngoing to have to adjust to meet the new standard, and the benefit is \nminuscule.\n  Farms and small manufacturing companies will have to buy new \nequipment or change the way they do things. States and cities will have \nto change how they do local transportation projects. All of that adds \nup to lost jobs and even less economic growth than we have had in the \npast 6 years. These are huge effects, all to chase another few tiny \nparts per billion of ozone. Five parts per billion is the equivalent of \n5 seconds over 32 years. That is how small it is, but the costs are \nenormous.\n  Over the course of three days last week, three new regulations have \nbeen added. They will cost our economy billions of dollars at a time \nwhen the private-hiring pace is at its worst in 3 years and the labor \nforce shrinks.\n  We all agree that reasonable regulations make good sense. In the \n1960s and 1970s, regulations helped to clean up pollution in our air, \nland, and water, but now Washington bureaucrats are chasing after \nsmaller and smaller trace amounts of chemicals no matter what the cost, \nhow high the cost, or how insignificant the benefits.\n  The EPA issued one rule that I found hard to believe. I thought it \nwas a misprint, but it is not. They issued one rule that would cost \n$9.6 billion per year to administer.\n  What are the benefits? Only $4 million. I thought they had misspelled \nand misplaced the ``b'' and the ``m,'' but, no. It will cost $9.6 \nbillion and will produce only $4 million in direct benefits. That is as \nmuch as $2,400 in costs for every $1 in benefits. How can they do this? \nI am talking about direct benefits.\n  The EPA tried to say: Well, there are all sorts of what they called \nancillary benefits. Who gets to decide how much these are worth? \nApparently the Obama administration says that it does. It is no \nsurprise that this administration cooks up an imaginary number for \nthose theoretical benefits--not direct benefits, but their \n``ancillary'' benefits, and they say it is big enough to balance the \nvery real costs that American families feel.\n  It is all a way to justify these ridiculous rules that destroy jobs, \nrestrict freedom, and do very little good for Americans. It is \nWashington and this administration run amok.\n\n  Is the Obama administration trying to make sure our economy continues \nto limp along as it has for the past 6\\1/2\\ years? Is that what they \nwant?\n  In 1972, the Clean Water Act was meant to protect navigable waters. \nIt was reasonable. We want to protect our navigable waters. Today the \nadministration has a new water rule called waters of the United States. \nIt is going to give Washington bureaucrats control over everything from \nirrigation ditches to small natural ponds in someone's backyard. This \nis unreasonable. Where does it end? Bipartisan majorities in the \nCongress already say it needs to end now.\n  I have introduced a bill that would direct the Obama administration \nto\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\ncome up with a new rule on waters of the United States--one that \nprotects traditional navigable water from pollution, which we must do, \nbut it also protects farmers, ranchers, and private landowners. We can \ndo both.\n  This legislation has 46 cosponsors, Democrats and Republicans. We are \ntelling the Obama administration that enough is enough.\n  Republicans are also ready to take on some of these other outrageous \nrules such as the extreme new restrictions on powerplants. That is what \nCongress is going to be doing to stop the insanity of these out-of-\ncontrol regulations and out-of-control regulators. We need to cut \nthrough the redtape.\n  Americans want to get back to work. They want to get our economy \ngoing again. Congress needs to help them do it because this \nadministration certainly is not. The Obama administration basically \nneeds to get out of the way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak this afternoon on a very \nimportant vote that we took today to move forward on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I thought I would start by backing up a little bit.\n  Last week we had the opportunity to vote on and talk about funding \nfor our veterans and our troops. In addition to the Defense \nauthorization bill that we voted on today to proceed to that, the votes \nwe took last week were very important. They were very important to the \ncountry and certainly very important to my State--the great State of \nAlaska--which has a huge military presence, but also to our huge \nveteran population. We have probably the highest number of veterans per \ncapita than any State in the Union.\n  I am honored to have a good friend of mine, Representative Bob \nHerron, the majority whip in the Alaska House. He is in the Gallery \ntoday. He is also a marine. So he represents not only Alaska in our \nState Government but Alaska as a veteran, as a fellow marine.\n  The American people want the Senate to be working again. We all know \nthe country has huge challenges. I wish to speak about some national \nforeign policy challenges. We have a huge debt: $8 trillion. I think we \nare close to $19 trillion. We got downgraded in terms of our credit \nrating for the first time in American history. We can't grow the \neconomy. We have huge challenges.\n  For years the Senate was not working. It was not moving forward. Some \nwould have called it dysfunctional. No regular order, no amendments, no \nbudget, no appropriations bills; a locked down U.S. Senate not doing \nits work. I think the American people wanted us to do work. So last \nfall they said it is time for a change. We need to get to work. We need \nto start tackling our challenges.\n  So we are changing that. We are working hard to do things the \nAmerican people sent us to Washington to do. We passed a budget. It \nhasn't happened in years. We passed appropriations bills through \nregular order, Democrats and Republicans, bringing amendments to the \nfloor of the Senate, voting again. One of the things we have been \ndoing--and it happened today--is we are prioritizing where they want us \nto prioritize. Our national defense, which is probably the most \nimportant role we have in this body--our troops, our veterans.\n  So we are making progress, but progress is halting. It is never a \nstraight line. For some reason--and we saw it over the last couple of \nweeks--a lot of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle didn't \nwant to fund the government, particularly in terms of these critical \nissues of our troops, including our national defense and taking care of \nour veterans--and again we saw that over the last couple of weeks.\n  Two critical appropriations bills moved to the Senate floor. There \nwas the Defense appropriations bill, which again passed out of the \nAppropriations Committee by huge bipartisan numbers: 27 to 3. There was \nhuge bipartisan support for that bill. Then we had the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, which passed out \nof committee 21 to 9. It had huge bipartisan support. Why? Because the \nAmerican people want us to focus on these critical issues: national \ndefense, our troops, taking care of our veterans. So we are moving \nforward.\n  The budget, appropriations bills that we voted on that haven't been \nvoted on for years--bipartisan, prioritizing what the American people \nwant. But then these appropriations bills, which provide funding for \nour vets, funding for our troops, came to the floor, and progress \nstopped. I still don't understand why. When asked by constituents: Why \ndid the other side vote to move these bills out of committee in such a \nbipartisan way, but then when they got to the floor, they stopped, they \nfilibustered, no spending for our troops or for our vets, I don't know \nthe answer. I have asked. My constituents are asking. Directions from \nthe White House? Who knows. But I do think it is clear to me, I think \nit is clear to most Americans, and I even think it is clear to all of \nthe Members of this body that when those bills were filibustered over \nthe last 2 weeks, that our troops and our veterans were shortchanged \nbecause we are voting to defund them. That is what the filibuster did; \nit defunded our troops and our veterans.\n  So I have to admit that when we were getting ready to vote today, I \nfeared a repeat performance on probably one of the most important bills \nwe are going to take up all year--the National Defense Authorization \nAct. It authorizes spending, pay raises, sets out our military \nstrategy, retirement reform. It is so important to our country. Once \nagain, I wish to commend Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed, the \ntwo leaders of the Armed Services Committee who did such a good job \nmoving that bill forward. Once again, it started with such great \nbipartisan promise. It moved out of committee 22 to 4, very bipartisan. \nThen it came to the Senate floor for a vote a few months ago, the NDAA, \nthe Defense authorization bill; 71 Senators, incredibly bipartisan, \nmoved forward and voted for that bill. Then it went to a conference \nwith the House where it was improved. It all seemed to be on track to \nbring this bill back to the floor of the Senate and to vote on moving \nforward on the conference report.\n  What happened? That is great bipartisan progress. We are changing \nthings. We are making things happen. The President of the United States \nhas since said he is going to veto the bill. He is going to veto the \nbill--veto the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Once again--and I am not sure, taking orders from the White House or \nnot--the minority leader came to the floor and told the American people \nthis morning he would work with the President to sustain that veto, to \nsustain the veto of our Defense bill. What a disappointment. We have \nthis huge bipartisan progress. When given the clear choice between \nstanding with our troops and our veterans or the President, who says he \nis going to veto this bill for reasons I still don't understand, the \nminority leader is choosing the President.\n  I am honored to sit on the Armed Services Committee of the Senate as \nwell as the Veterans' Affairs Committee. As I said in remarks last week \non the Senate floor, these are two of the most bipartisan committees we \nhave. It is clear to me that every member--Democratic, Republican--of \nthese committees cares about our troops, respects our troops, cares \ndeeply about our national security. I believe every Member of this body \ndoes. Once again, we saw that today. We saw that today. There was no \nfilibuster. Seventy-three Senators voted to move forward on the Defense \nappropriations bill. It was 71 before and today it was 73--an important \nbipartisan victory for our national defense, for our veterans, for our \ntroops, but a Presidential veto still hangs out there. The President's \nveto threat still is like a cloud hanging over this very important vote \ntoday.\n  I mentioned at the outset that this is very important for my State, \nthe great State of Alaska. This is important for the national security \nof our Nation, and this is important for all of us. It is important to \nme. As a veteran and a marine in the Reserves, I know this is a \ncritically important issue. If he is going to veto this bill, I don't \nknow how the Commander in Chief will explain to the American people and \nour\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\ntroops why he is doing this. There have been only four times in the \nlast 53 years that the NDAA has been vetoed.\n\n  Providing the common defense of this Nation, the national defense, is \nprobably our most important duty. And that duty increases when you look \naround the world and see the threats that are emerging in different \nparts of the world--the Middle East, Ukraine, the Asian Pacific, the \nArctic.\n  Mr. President, to govern is to choose. To govern is to prioritize. \nThe President's administration spent years negotiating a nuclear deal \nwith Iran, and this body spent weeks debating the merits of the \nPresident's Iran deal. That deal and what we debated then needs to be \nput in the context of the President's veto threat to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Let me give a few examples.\n  The President's Iran deal will give billions--tens of billions--in \nthe lifting of sanctions to Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of \nterrorism, but the President threatens to veto a bill that will fund \nour military.\n  The President's Iran deal lifts sanctions on Iranian military members \nsuch as General Soleimani, who literally is responsible for the maiming \nand killing of thousands of American troops, but the President's veto--\nhis threatened veto--would stop payment of bonuses and improved \nmilitary retirement benefits to our troops and veterans.\n  The President's Iran deal gives access to the Iranians by lifting \nsanctions on conventional weapons, ballistic missiles, and advanced \nnuclear centrifuges, but the President threatens to veto in this bill \nadvanced weapons systems for the United States.\n  The President's Iran deal gives the opportunity for terrorist groups \nsupported by Iran such as Hezbollah and Hamas to have further funding \nfor their terrorist activities, but the President threatens to veto a \nbill that provides additional funding and resources and capability for \nour troops to defeat ISIS.\n  To govern is to choose. To govern is to prioritize. As we move \nforward on the substance of the national defense authorization bill, we \nare choosing and prioritizing our troops and our national defense, and \nthat is why this vote was so positive this morning. I hope we can have \nat least 73 Senators, who voted to move forward today, vote to pass the \nNDAA and put it on the President's desk for his signature. But if the \nPresident chooses to veto this critical piece of legislation, which has \nenormous bipartisan support, at this moment in time when our country \nfaces serious international threats, I hope that my colleagues--the 73 \nSenators who voted to move forward on this critical piece of \nlegislation--will also stand strong and vote to override the veto of \nthe President, which is exactly what our troops and the American people \nwould want us to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, what we saw in Roseburg last week was \na repeat of the evil we have seen in countless places across the \ncountry, causing tens of thousands of deaths in towns and cities and \nsuburbs and rural areas across this country.\n  Evil visited Roseburg. We saw the worst of human character in those \nmoments of mass killing. We saw also the best in human character in the \nresponse from the firemen, police, and emergency responders who risked \ntheir lives and saved lives.\n  When the sound of gunshots rang out that morning, my own recollection \nwas triggered of a morning just a few years earlier when I stood with \nthe parents and loved ones on that day of the mass slaughter in Sandy \nHook in Newtown.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Roseburg, with the \nvictims and their loved ones. I know that nothing said here--certainly \nnothing I can say--will help mend those wounds and ease the grief and \npain of those loved ones for the great lives lost and the many left \nbehind.\n  I am frustrated and angry coming here today because the places of \nthose mass killings have become shorthand for a deep disease, an \nepidemic of violence in America today--Virginia Tech, Columbine, \nCharleston, Sandy Hook, Newtown, and now Roseburg. They are shorthand \nfor mass slaughters which have occurred at the rate of about one a week \nwhile President Obama has been in office. There have been 142 school \nshootings since Newtown alone. There are 30,000 deaths per year in \nAmerica, the greatest, strongest country in the history of the world.\n  The mass killings are not even the source of the largest numbers. \nThey are individual deaths, such as that of Javier Martinez, a young \nman from New Haven with an enormously bright and promising future. When \nI visited his school after he was killed by a gun because he was in the \nwrong place at the wrong time, his classmates asked me to talk about \ngun violence--not as an abstract notion but as a real threat to them \nand their community.\n  It is a phenomenon that faces every community every day, everywhere, \nand everyone. All of us are touched by it if we think about it, if we \nput aside the denial that all too often affects us, a denial that \ncauses people to minimize the threat. We all are victims or we know \nvictims or we know of the tragic consequences of real stories in our \ncommunity as a result of gun violence.\n  The deaths in Roseburg are tragic, but no less tragic was Javier \nMartinez' death, nor are the gun deaths that occur in situations that \ninvolve domestic violence, gangs, fights between individuals, \naccidents, and suicides--a major source of death by gun violence--and \ncountless other circumstances where people who are dangerous or who \nlack the mental health or the maturity to responsibly use guns \nnonetheless have access to them and use them for deadly purposes.\n  Let's be very clear. The Second Amendment is a guarantee under our \nConstitution to law-abiding citizens that they can use guns for lawful \npurposes, whether recreational or hunting, that they can possess as \nmany as they please, and the vast majority of them support measures \nthat will keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\n  Keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people is the reason we \nhave advanced commonsense, sensible measures to stop gun violence, and \nthe failure to adopt them has made Congress complicit--in effect an \naider and abettor to those deaths--because Congress has enabled the \ncontinuation of death and destruction that has become a fact of life in \nAmerica, a disgraceful and shameful emblem of Congress's failure to \nact. There is a point when inaction causes culpability, when it \nbecomes, in effect, aiding and abetting and complicity. Congress in \nsome ways might just as well be standing at the elbows of those \nshooters, whether in Charleston or Roseburg or Sandy Hook or elsewhere.\n  Regret and grief are appropriate, but they are no solution. They are \nno excuse for inaction. Inaction is reprehensible when it comes to gun \nviolence--an epidemic and disease spreading in this country just as \nsurely as a contagion or infection. The inaction of this body speaks \nlouder than words.\n  My simple reaction is, enough--enough of inaction. The time for \naction is now on universal background checks, a ban on illegal \ntrafficking and straw purchases, a prohibition on assault weapons and \nhigh-capacity magazines, as well as mental health initiatives and \nschool safety measures. This kind of comprehensive package of reforms \nhas been proposed. This body failed to adopt it, but that is no excuse \nfor inaction now.\n  There is no one measure, no single solution, no panacea, no simple \nfix to this problem, but we must begin because laws have consequences. \nI refuse to adopt the defeatist or denial approach of many of our \ncolleagues who say the laws simply will not work, cannot do anything, \nwill not solve the problem.\n  We are here because we believe laws can improve the lives of ordinary \nAmericans, no less so when it comes to gun violence or any other \nproblem we face. In fact, we ought to approach this issue of gun \nviolence with the same urgency and immediacy that America would in \nattempting to solve any public health crisis because surely we face a \npublic health crisis and emergency in gun violence.\n  When there is a spread of a contagious disease, whether it is flu, \ntuberculosis, or Ebola, we track the source, hospitalize the victims, \ntake remedial action, admit them to treatment, and take preventive \nmeasures to prevent that kind of disease from recurring. When there is \na spread of food\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\npoisoning, we don't throw up our arms and say there is nothing laws can \ndo. In fact, law enforcement and health authorities track down the \npackages that are contaminated and provide relief for the people who \nsuffer from that kind of occurrence and take preventive measures to \nstop it from recurring by imposing sanitary conditions and rules and \nregulations on the food producer.\n  Infections, contagion, and spread of disease can be deadly and \ncrippling; they can threaten fear and harm and cause panic. Gun \nviolence is exactly the same. It is equally insidious and pernicious, \nand its impact is greater than any of those single epidemics. The \nspread of stolen guns--guns that are stolen or illegally purchased--is \nmuch like a disease in America today, and the ones who will testify to \nthat fact are our law enforcement authorities who see it firsthand and \nare on our side in urging responsible, commonsense measures and reform.\n  When this Nation faced, in effect, an epidemic of car deaths and \ninjuries, we didn't stop everyone from driving, but we did put in place \nreasonable safeguards--seatbelt laws, drunk driving measures, and speed \nlimits--and we enforced them. They were resisted at the time. Drunk \ndriving measures caused outrage among some civil libertarians, but now \nthey are part of our everyday expectations about how life will work in \nAmerica, and they have drastically reduced auto fatalities and \ninjuries. The recognition of the damage and destruction that has been \ncaused by automobiles means that we educate and we take commonsense, \nresponsible measures.\n\n  Much of the knowledge that led to those commonsense, sensible \nmeasures came from research--yes, knowledge. It was fact-based, \nevidence-driven research done by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. Like many of my colleagues, I am dismayed by the fact that \nsimilar, incredibly valuable public health data about gun control from \nthis world-class institution is unavailable to us because of the \nrestrictive, politically motivated budget riders forbidding it. It is \nunconscionable that Congress's response to this problem is denial, \nshutting out research and responsible, fact-based evidence involving \nthe provision of information.\n  This country knows how to respond to a public health crisis. We are \nAmerica. We face the challenges; we don't deny or disparage the truth \ntellers.\n  After the Stockton schoolyard shooting in California where 34 \nchildren were shot and 5 killed, President George H.W. Bush issued an \nExecutive order in 1989 banning the import of semiautomatic assault \nrifles. There were repeated circumventions of that order. Part of the \nresponse was, in 1994, a measure authored by Senator Feinstein--our \ngreat colleague--banning the manufacture and transfer of assault \nweapons and high-capacity magazines. That measure expired, but it shows \nhow we can act and how we can face challenges.\n  Ronald Reagan was almost killed by an assassin's bullet--a would-be \nassassin's bullet--in 1981. Ten years after the event, he wrote in the \nNew York Times that if the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act \nreduced gun deaths by as little as 10 percent, it would be ``well worth \nmaking it the law of the land because there would be a lot fewer \nfamilies facing anniversaries such as the Bradys and the Reagan's faced \nevery March 30th.'' That bill, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention \nAct, became law in 1993 with his support 12 years after that near \nassassination.\n  Both Stockton and the Reagan near assassination show that these \nmeasures are possible. It may look like a marathon. It is never a \nsprint. It is not only possible, it is obligatory.\n  I look forward to a number of my colleagues and myself--and I note \nthat a partner in this effort has been my colleague Senator Murphy, who \nwill follow me shortly--I look forward to all of us coming together and \nspearheading and championing again a set of reforms that will help make \nAmerica safer and better. The time for action is truly now. This public \nhealth emergency cannot go unaddressed. The gap in our current laws can \nbe remedied.\n  I have already offered the Lori Jackson Violence Survivor Protection \nAct, a bill named for a brave Connecticut mother of two children who \nwas estranged from her husband, fled her home for her life, obtained a \ntemporary restraining order for her and her children's protection, and \nthen was gunned down by her estranged husband because the temporary \nprotective order did not require him to surrender his weapon--a gap in \nthe law that must be remedied. That bill would do so.\n  This bill is modest. My bill would close this loophole requiring \nprotective orders, whether temporary or permanent, to require the \nsurrendering of weapons. Women who are victims of domestic violence are \nat the greatest risk. Women who are victims of this insidious peril are \nmost in danger when they first leave or try to leave. That is when the \ntemporary order is, in effect, most necessary, the danger at its \ngreatest but the law at its weakest in stopping gun violence.\n  We are on the right side of history. We are on the right side of law \nenforcement. We are on the right side of public opinion. The \noverwhelming majority of Americans clearly favor these kinds of \nmeasures and the overwhelming majority of gun owners too. If history is \non our side, we must be on the right side of this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to keep faith with the \nvictims of Newtown and Sandy Hook, to demonstrate that our grief and \nregret is more than just words, that it will lead to action. The time \nfor action is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Blumenthal for being \nsuch a great partner. He and I have traveled a very long journey \ntogether since September of 2012 when we both stood together at the \nfirehouse in Sandy Hook, CT. We have become evangelical in our belief \nthat this mass slaughter has to stop. On Friday we all stopped for a \nmoment and we sent our sympathies to those who were killed in Portland: \nLucero Alcaraz, Treven Taylor Anspach, Rebecka Ann Carnes, Quinn Glen \nCooper, Kim Dietz, Lucas Eibel, Jason Dale Johnson, Lawrence Levine--he \nwas the assistant professor there--and Sarena Dawn Moore.\n  Mr. President, 274 days this year and 294 mass shootings. We are \naveraging one mass shooting--multiple people being shot at one \nparticular moment--more mass shootings than we have days in the year.\n  Of course, for us, this shooting and the information that came out in \nthe aftermath of it was particularly chilling because we have seen this \nyoung man before. The young man, Christopher Harper-Mercer, was \nisolated, withdrawn, and obsessed with guns. His family had many of \nthem. He had rebuffed attempts at socialization by his family. He had \ngrievances that he mainly shared with himself. He eventually turned \nthose grievances on nine people who died and about an equal number who \nwere injured.\n  We know that story because we saw it play out in Connecticut as \nwell--a mentally ill individual, a young man who became isolated from \nhis friends, his community, and his family, who had a rather large \nstore of weapons, and who then took out his frustration and his outrage \non 20 little kids at Sandy Hook Elementary.\n  But I guess to me what is definitional about this scourge of mass \nviolence is not necessarily what happened on Friday but what happened \nthe day after, on Saturday. On Saturday there were likely another 80 \npeople killed by guns all across the country. That is about the number \nwe run every single day. Every day there are a handful of exceptional \nstories, stories that make your heart turn, that make your gut cringe.\n  On Saturday there was an 11-year-old boy who confronted his 8-year-\nold neighbor in Tennessee over the fact that she would not let him play \nwith her pet bunny. When she protested and said she did not want him to \nplay with it, he marched back into his house, got a shotgun, walked \nback over to her, and shot her with a shotgun. How on Earth did an 11-\nyear-old boy get that quick access to a shotgun? How on Earth have we \ngotten into a moment in which a dispute over whether you can hold a \nlittle pet bunny turns into a murder?\n  What I can tell you is that I guarantee that scene does not play out \nin other countries in this world, that 11-year-old boys don't shoot 8-\nyear-old girls with shotguns in Sweden or Japan or in Great Britain. We \nknow that because what is happening here in the\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nUnited States is exceptional. This rate of 80 people being lost to guns \nevery day, this normalization of mass shootings, is exclusive to the \nUnited States. We have a gun homicide rate in the United States that is \nnot twice the average of other OEDC countries, it is not 5 times, it is \nnot 10 times, it is 20 times the average of our first-world competitor \nnations. We have to ask ourselves, what is different about the United \nStates? What is different about life here, the way in which we resolve \ndisputes, from all of these other nations that have gun violence, gun \ndeath rates that are 20 times lower than the United States?\n  Let's be honest about one thing. It is not that the United States has \nhigher rates of mental illness than other countries. It is not that our \nmental health delivery system spends less than other countries. There \nis no more mental illness in the United States than there is in any \nother industrialized country. Some studies will tell you that we spend \nmore on mental illness treatment and behavioral health treatment than \nany other country. Yet gun deaths are 20 times what they are in other \ncountries. It is not because we lack for protection. Our malls and our \nchurches and our movie theatres are not any less protected or less \nsecure than those in other countries. We invest in law enforcement at a \nsame or greater rate than all of these other nations. What is \ndifferent? What is different here in this country? What is different is \nthat we are awash in guns. We are awash in illegal guns. We celebrate \nweapons that are designed exclusively to kill other people, and we \ncollect them and show them off for sport, military-style assault \nweapons, cartridges, drums of ammunition that hold 100 rounds, whose \nutility is only associated with ending life. That is what is different. \nThat is what is different about the United States.\n  I will admit that the solution is comprehensive because I will be the \nlast person to tell you that fixing our mental health system will not \nhave a beneficial effect on the rates of gun violence. Adam Lanza and \nChristopher Harper-Mercer were deeply troubled individuals who were \nill-served by a behavioral health system that was far too opaque and \ncomplex for them. Law enforcement needs more help on the streets of New \nHaven and New York and Chicago and Los Angeles. All those things will \nhelp. But what distinguishes America from the other parts of the world \nthat have much lower rates on gun violence is not investment in law \nenforcement and is not our rate of mental illness. So we have to have \nthis conversation about our laws that allow for this flow of high-\npowered guns and illegal guns onto the street.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I are going to join together tomorrow to \nintroduce what we think is a modest measure to ensure that no guns get \nsold to people who cannot pass a background check. Walmart does it \ntoday. They say: We won't sell you a gun unless you can pass a \nbackground check. But unfortunately many other retailers take advantage \nof a loophole that allows for 72 hours to pass without a background \ncheck, which then allows them to sell a gun. We just think there should \nbe a simple premise. If you can't pass a background check, you \nshouldn't be able to get a gun--getting a green light to walk out of a \nstore with a weapon that can kill people.\n\n  But that is just one brick in the wall. There are a series of other \nmeasures that enjoy 90 percent support in this country, whether it be \nmaking sure people who are subject to spousal restraining orders cannot \nbuy a gun during the period of time in which they are under a \nrestraining order or just expanding background checks to gun shows and \nInternet sales or just giving more resources to the background check \nsystem so they can make sure they upload the proper records. Mental \nhealth is part of the solution. It is not a substitute for the reform \nof our gun laws, but it is part of a solution as well.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Cassidy to introduce the primary \ncomprehensive mental health reform legislation on the floor of the \nSenate. It has 10 cosponsors at this moment: five Republicans and five \nDemocrats. We think you should fix the mental health system because it \nis broken, full stop, but we also understand it will have a downward \neffect on gun violence.\n  I wish to close by echoing the sentiments of Senator Blumenthal. We \nare going to introduce our legislation tomorrow, and we are hopeful it \nwill be taken up by this body.\n  What we really worry about is that this silence from Congress has \nbecome complicit. I know that sounds like a very hard thing to say--\nthat sounds very hyperbolic--but let me walk you through why I have \ncome to believe that the failure to act in the wake of these mass \nshootings has made us complicit in them. I think these young men--and \nit is not all young men, but it is mostly young men--these young men \nwhose minds are becoming unhinged and are contemplating mass violence, \nthey take cues from the total, complete, absolute silence from Congress \nin the face of mass shooting, after a mass shooting. If the Nation's \ntop elected leaders, the people charged with deciding what matters in \nthis Nation, don't even try to stop the mass carnage, then these would-\nbe shooters reasonably conclude that we must be OK with it because if a \nsociety doesn't condone settling a grievance with a gun, wouldn't the \npeople in charge of it at least try to stop it.\n  But we don't try--and that is what is most offensive. That is what \ntruly turns my stomach. We just lived through a summer in which 4,000 \npeople died on the streets of this Nation, and this body is sending a \nloud, clear signal that we don't care--we don't care. Nine more people \ndied on Friday--another mass slaughter--and we are back to normal this \nweek.\n  We are going to debate the Toxic Substances Control Act this week. I \ndon't deny that is probably a very important piece of legislation, but \nwe are acting as if there isn't an epidemic of preventable murder \nhappening in this Nation and that it is getting worse.\n  Somebody wrote last week that the gun control debate ended the day \nafter Sandy Hook because that was the day America decided it was OK to \nmurder 20 first graders. I know that is not the message my colleagues \nare intending to send, and we appreciate all of the sincere notes of \nsympathy that have been sent over the course of the last 2 years, 3 \nyears, to Newtown and those that went out on Friday to Oregon, but \nwords are beginning to become meaningless. The tweets aren't helping. I \nwould argue they are becoming a cover for cowardice.\n  It is not a coincidence that America has a gun violence rate that is \n20 times that of any other competitor nation. We are doing something \nwrong here and the whole reason we draw our paychecks is to make wrong \nthings right. If we cannot do something--a background check law, a \nmental health bill, more resources for law enforcement--if we cannot do \nanything to try to stop this soul-crushing, life-extinguishing \nviolence, then we might as well go home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of \nmy colleague Senator Murphy regarding the responsibility--our \nresponsibility--to deal with the issue of gun violence in our country.\n\n\n                    Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to turn to another subject. I wish to talk \nabout the Land and Water Conservation Fund or the LWCF as it is \ncommonly known.\n  Last week, at the end of the fiscal year, the LWCF authorization \nexpired. The LWCF is one of the Federal Government's best tools for \nsupporting conservation, and we need to act quickly to renew the law. \nAs cities grow, suburbs swell, and our natural world shrinks, the need \nfor more opportunities for outdoor recreation and education grows.\n  The LWCF helps expand those opportunities: opportunities for our \nveterans, our children, and our families. For example, we have heard \nfrom veterans who shared the therapeutic value of our public lands.\n  When Matthew Zedwick served in Iraq, he was comforted by memories of \nhiking and fishing on public lands in his Oregon hometown. Since coming \nhome to Oregon, he has found that visiting many of the trails, lakes, \nand streams that are protected by the LWCF helped him heal.\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\n  Also, this year, for the first time our Nation's fourth graders have \nfree access to all of our national parks. Why fourth graders? Because \nfourth graders are able to understand their surrounding environments in \nmore concrete ways. Through these kinds of experiences in our national \nparks, these fourth graders will, we hope, grow into having a lifelong \nappreciation of our environment.\n  Finally, millions of families looking for a weekend getaway flock to \nour parks, refuges, and wildlife reserves, areas that are afforded \nprotection thanks to the LWCF.\n  Despite being chronically underfunded, over the past 50 years the \nLWCF protected and conserved land in every single State. Rather than \nrelying on taxpayers, money for the fund comes from oil and gas \ndevelopment on the Outer Continental Shelf. Unfortunately, without \nrenewing the LWCF, conservation efforts across the country are at risk, \nincluding in Hawaii.\n  Hawaii's environment is unique. I am sure my colleagues are aware of \nour beautiful beaches, lush greenery, and spectacular geography. For \nall its beauty, Hawaii's environment is also fragile. One-third of our \nnative forest birds are endangered, and we are home to almost half of \nthe Nation's threatened and endangered plants, making us in Hawaii the \nendangered species capital of the world. Our coasts and beaches are \nbeing threatened as we speak by sea level rise. Our corals are expected \nto suffer the worst bleaching event in history this year--this coming \non the heels of a major bleaching event that happened just last year. \nAll of these phenomena impact our economy and way of life. We know what \nis at stake if we do not act today to protect our lands for tomorrow.\n  That is why my State put together a collaborative landscape proposal \nto receive LWCF money. This proposal is entitled ``Island Forests at \nRisk,'' an appropriate title as we are seeing firsthand how the future \nof our forests is indeed at risk. The Obama administration recognized \nthe importance of this proposal to conserving Hawaii's unique \necosystems. Thanks to this recognition, a number of the island forests \nat risk land acquisitions are in line to receive LWCF funding in the \nnext fiscal year. Under the plan, almost 5,000 acres will be added to \nHawaii's volcano national parks, Hawaii's most popular national park \nthat in 2014 alone attracted almost 1.7 million visitors.\n  Funds will also help add almost 7,000 acres to help allow Hakalau \nNational Wildlife Refuge, a land acquisition that has been the top \npriority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Pacific Region since \n2011. These critical land acquisitions have a pricetag of almost $15 \nmillion, and these acquisitions will only be made possible by the \nfinancial assistance provided by the LWCF.\n  Hawaii is not the only State that is set to receive money from the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund next year. Over the past few days, my \ncolleagues from across the aisle have come to the floor to talk about \nthe importance of the LWCF in their own States. They have talked about \nthe lands in their States and the experiences they have had in the \noutdoors with their families.\n  We all recognize the opportunities that LWCF investments provide for \nour people, our economies, and future generations. We know oil and gas \ndrilling is accelerating climate change. We know climate change is \nthreatening our native birds, our coasts, and our coral. Why not \nreauthorize a fund that takes money from activities that threaten our \nclimate and environment and invests it into conservation efforts? It \nseems like a no-brainer to me.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Ranking Member Cantwell and my fellow \nDemocratic colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in \nintroducing legislation that would permanently reauthorize LWCF--\npermanently so that it will not end.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in finding a bipartisan path forward \nto permanently reauthorize the commonsense fund that protects the \nenvironment and affords outdoor recreation and education opportunities \nin every single State. We owe it to the people who elected us, and we \nowe it to our children and our future generations.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Selling Used Cars on the Recall List\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, would the Chair like to buy a used car \nfrom a used car dealer that was on the recall list because it had a \ndefective Takata airbag in the steering wheel; so that if you had a \nfender-bender and it suddenly exploded, it might send shrapnel into \nyour face and into your jugular in your neck. The answer is obviously, \nno; that you would not want to buy such a used car. Well, to the credit \nof a major used car dealer, as well as new car dealer, AutoNation, \nheadquartered in Florida but with hundreds and hundreds of dealerships \nall over the country, they have set as company policy that they will \nnot sell a used car on the recall list for defective products until \nthat recall problem has been corrected.\n  All dealers do this with regard to new cars because it is the law. In \nfact, in the highway bill we passed a couple of months ago we put in an \nadditional provision, which if you are a rental car company such as \nAvis, National, and so forth, you cannot rent to a customer if it has a \nrecall on that vehicle until the recall item is fixed. That just makes \ncommon sense. You certainly wouldn't want to put a defective product \nout there for the consuming public.\n  So then why is the National Association of Automobile Dealers \nfighting us as we try to extend the law for new cars to used cars when \nit comes to the sale of a used car with a defective item? It defies \ncommon sense.\n  This is what it is: What is the economic interest versus what is the \nsafety interest--the economic interest of the used car salesman versus \nthe safety interest of the consuming public that would buy that used \ncar? I hope the national association will reconsider. This is an \nargument that cannot stand on all fours that they are making--that they \ncomply with the sale of new cars but they don't want to comply with the \nsale of used cars.\n  What we ought to be looking out for in light of all of these \nrevelations of all of the defective automobiles--look what happened \nwith General Motors and the ignition. Look what has happened to Toyota \nand Honda with the Takata airbags. By the way, in airbags we are \ntalking some 20 million recalls worldwide. It is huge. If we are going \nto protect the consuming public, we ought to make sure that recall \nitems are taken care of before those vehicles are sold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I wish to highlight a few items that are in \nthe NDAA conference report authorization that we are considering this \nweek. In April of this year, my office came across a $115,000 marketing \ncontract with the New York Jets and some other teams. But the contract \nwith the New York Jets showed that the weekly hometown hero tribute was \nactually paid for by the taxpayers. A resulting investigation found \nthat other taxpayer-funded tributes were not just with the Jets or with \nthe NFL but extended to other sports leagues, as well as the NCAA. We \ndon't need this kind of paid-for patriotism.\n  I wish to note that many in the NFL, many teams, and others of our \nsports teams and other leagues do this out of the goodness of their \nheart. It is what it looks like. But in many instances, these salutes \nto the troops have been paid for by the taxpayer. That needs to end. \nThat is why I joined Senator McCain and Senator Blumenthal in adding an \namendment to the NDAA that will bring an end to these taxpayer-funded \nsalutes to the troops.\n  This amendment also encourages sports organizations that have \naccepted these funds to consider making a contribution to a charity \nthat supports\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nmembers of the military or veterans or their families. In addition, the \nNDAA conference report also prohibits the DOD from spending 25 percent \nof its sports-related marketing budget until they can show that the \nmoney that they are spending in this regard actually contributes \ntowards their marketing goals or towards their recruitment goals.\n  These results have to be reported to both the House and the Senate. \nThat is a good thing. I want to thank the Pentagon, especially \nUndersecretary of Defense Brad Carson and his staff, for working with \nmy office and others as we continue to investigate the scope of these \ntaxpayer-funded tributes.\n  Another item I want to mention in this NDAA bill is that 22-year-old \nMarine Corps Cpl Jacob Hug of Phoenix was serving as part of the U.S. \nhumanitarian mission to Nepal in response to the earthquakes in that \ncountry. In May, Hug was one of six marines and two Nepalese soldiers \nwho were killed when their helicopter crashed during a mission to \ndeliver food and aid to the victims in the earthquakes there. Because \nJacob died during a humanitarian mission, Jim and Andrea Hug, his \nparents, were informed that the DOD was not authorized to pay for their \nflight to Dover Air Force Base to be on hand when their son's remains \nreturned to the United States.\n  Currently, the military is only authorized to pay for next-of-kin \ntravel expenses if the servicemember is killed in action. That is not \nright. The Hugs did get to travel to Dover because many in the Arizona \ndelegation worked with DOD to make sure the costs were eventually paid \nfor by DOD.\n  I worked with Senator McCain to amend the NDAA to ensure that no \nother family has to go through this--that if a family of a \nservicemember serving on an overseas humanitarian mission is killed, \nthe additional hardship is not faced by their family. This amendment \nhelp pays for the next of kin to travel to meet the remains of deceased \nrelatives if they are killed in humanitarian operations.\n  I hope we can approve this NDAA in the coming days and we can send it \nto the President. I hope that the President will sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Americans across the board recognize \nthe growing threat of global climate change. Last week was a big week \non the conservative and corporate sides. New polling revealed strong \nsupport among conservatives for smart policies to stem carbon \npollution. Coalitions of leading corporate voices--6 major banks and 10 \nmajor food and beverage companies--called on us to join them in backing \nstrong climate action.\n  I come to the floor today, now for the 114th time, to join with \nthem--with scientists and lay people, with military commanders and \nfaith leaders, with environmentalists and capitalists, with Democrats \nand Republicans, all saying it is time to wake up to this crisis.\n  Yes, I said ``and Republicans.'' Outside this Chamber, Republicans \nare calling for action on climate. The poll out last week, conducted by \nthree leading Republican pollsters, showed a majority of Republican \nvoters, including 54 percent of conservative Republicans, agreeing that \nthe climate is changing and that human activity contributes to the \nchanges we are all seeing.\n  They want solutions from us. The same proportion of conservative \nRepublicans--54 percent--would favor a carbon pollution fee on electric \nutilities, provided the revenue would then be rebated to consumers. As \nwe know, a carbon fee is a market-based solution, very much in line \nwith conservative principles. I recently introduced a bill that I hope \nboth Republicans and Democrats can embrace. It would establish an \neconomy-wide carbon fee on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas \nemissions and then return 100 percent of the money to the American \npeople.\n  It would work. A recent analysis said it would reduce U.S. carbon \ndioxide emissions by nearly 50 percent by 2030. The revenue would \noffset annual payroll taxes for every working person by $500, with a \nsimilar benefit to veterans and Social Security recipients. It would \nreduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 29 percent. It \nwould return the remaining funds to States to be used locally, for \ntransition costs, efficiency investments or whatever the States prefer.\n  With this bill, I extend to conservatives what my very conservative \nfriend, former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis, has called not just \nan olive branch but an olive limb. Whether you want tax reform, a \nproper free market for energy or even to address climate change, \nplease, let's get to work.\n  To state the obvious, Congress has been ruled by the lobbyists and \npolitical enforcers for the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel \nindustry, with political threats and very big money and lots of phony \nfront groups, has made the Republican Party in Congress its political \nwing. But outside this Chamber, where conservatives don't need fossil \nfuel industry money, there is considerable conservative support for a \ncarbon fee, from leading right-of-center economists, conservative think \ntanks, and former Republican officials.\n  President Nixon's Treasury Secretary, George Shultz; President \nReagan's economic adviser, Art Laffer; President George W. Bush's \nTreasury Secretary, Hank Paulson; and Bush Council of Economic Advisers \nChair, Greg Mankiw, have all advocated for some form of a carbon fee as \nthe efficient way to correct a market failure--the market failure where \nwe all have to pick up the costs of carbon pollution for the fossil \nfuel industry. No wonder they spend so much money around here. That \nmarket failure is a sweet deal for the fossil fuel fellas, but it is \nnot good free market economics.\n  In a 2013 New York Times op-ed, former Republican EPA Administrators \nBill Ruckelshaus, Christine Todd Whitman, Lee Thomas, and William \nReilly wrote: ``A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be \nthe best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.''\n  Republicans in Congress are being squeezed. On one side they see \nunequivocal scientific consensus, compelling economic theory, and \nmounting public opinion--all pointing toward the need for strong action \non climate. On the other side, they see rich and powerful polluters who \nfund their politics and who make heavy-handed threats against any \nRepublicans who might dare to cross them. That is why it was such glad \nnews when a group of 11 House Republicans, led by Congressman Chris \nGibson of New York, introduced a House resolution committing to address \nclimate change by promoting ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism.\n  That is not a bill yet. We have a ways to go still. But it is another \nsign that the ``denier castle'' is crumbling. First, climate change was \na hoax. Then, OK, maybe it is not a hoax, but it is natural variation. \nThen, OK, maybe it is real and humans do cause some of it. But, look, \nit paused. Then, OK, maybe it didn't pause. But we really can't do \nanything about it. And then, OK, we can do something about climate \nchange, but please stop asking me about it because I am not a \nscientist. And now this: A resolution by sitting Republican House \nMembers that we need to take climate action. It has been quite a \njourney.\n\n  The escape of 11 Republicans from the dark, crumbling ramparts of \ndenier castle gives dawning hope to Americans that bipartisan action on \nclimate change is becoming possible, even in Congress.\n  Last Thursday, Congressman Gibson and I joined together, bicameral \nand bipartisan, to hear from major food and beverage companies how \nclimate change affects their industry, supply chains, and bottom line. \nIt marked--as far as I can recall--the first time in years that a \nsitting Democrat and a sitting Republican Member of Congress joined in \na public event on climate change. I hope that is another sign that \nthings in this building have begun to shift.\n  For these big companies, climate change is not a partisan issue. It \nis not even a political issue. It is business. It is their reality. \n``Climate really matters to our business,'' Kim Nelson of General Mills \ntold us. ``We fundamentally rely on Mother Nature.'' The choices we \nmake to protect or forsake our climate, she said, will be ``important \nto the long-term viability of our company and our industry.''\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\n  Paul Bakus of Nestle agreed, impressing on us that this is not a \nhypothetical. Climate change ``is impacting our business today,'' he \nsaid. His company, Nestle, cans pumpkins under the Libby's brand. They \nhave seen pumpkin yields crash in the United States. ``We have never \nseen growing and harvesting conditions like this in the Midwest,'' said \nMr. Bakus.\n  Chief sustainability officer for Mars, Barry Parkin, was more blunt: \n``We are on a path to a dangerous place.''\n  These companies are reducing carbon emissions and demanding \nsustainable supply chains. Mars, for example, recently invested in a \n211-megawatt wind power farm in Texas to offset all of the electricity \nused by its U.S. operations. Unilever, in addition to shifting away \nfrom fossil fuels toward renewables and biofuel energy, is also \nfighting deforestation associated with farming.\n  Message No. 1 from these businesses was: This is important.\n  Message No. 2 was: They can't do it alone. They need us in government \nto pay attention. ``Business, government, civil society, and \nindividuals all have a part to play,'' said General Mills. ``We need \ngovernments to be involved,'' said Unilever.\n  Specifically, the companies want a strong global climate deal at the \nParis conference this December. They released a joint letter pledging \nto accelerate their own climate efforts and urging governments to do \ntheir part as well. They even took out full-page ads in the Washington \nPost. Here it is.\n  They had the full text of their letter and the signatures of the 10 \nCEOs printed in the Financial Times on the very day of our event.\n  The heads of Mars, General Mills, Nestle USA, Unilever, Kellogg \nCompany, New Belgium Brewing Company, Ben & Jerry's, Cliff Bar, \nStonyfield Farm, and Danone Dairy North America had the following \nstatement in the letter:\n\n       Climate change is bad for farmers and agriculture. Drought, \n     flooding, and hotter growing conditions threaten the world's \n     food supply and contribute to food insecurity.\n\n  They also pledged:\n\n       We will: Use our voices to advocate for governments to set \n     clear, achievable, measurable and enforceable science-based \n     targets for carbon emissions reductions.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nheads of these 10 major food and beverage companies asking world \nleaders and the Congress to act on climate change be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Accelerating Change]\n\n                     This Could be a Turning Point\n\n       Dear U.S. and Global Leaders: When you convene in Paris \n     later this year for climate negotiations, you will have an \n     opportunity to take action that could significantly change \n     our world for the better.\n       As heads of some of the world's largest food companies, we \n     have come together today to call out that opportunity.\n       Climate change is bad for farmers and for agriculture. \n     Drought, flooding and hotter growing conditions threaten the \n     world's food supply and contribute to food insecurity.\n       By 2050. it is estimated that the world's population will \n     exceed nine billion, with two-thirds of all people living in \n     urban areas. This increase in population and urbanization \n     will require more water, energy and food, all of which are \n     compromised by warming temperatures.\n       The challenge presented by climate change will require all \n     of government, civil society and business--to do more with \n     less. For companies like ours, that means producing more food \n     on less land using fewer natural resources. If we don't take \n     action now, we risk not only today's livelihoods, but also \n     those of future generations.\n       We want the women and men who work to grow the food on our \n     tables to have enough to eat themselves, and to be able to \n     provide properly for their families.\n       We want the farms where crops are grown to be as productive \n     and resilient as possible, while building the communities and \n     protecting the water supplies around them.\n       We want to see only the most energy-efficient modes of \n     transport shipping products and ingredients around the world.\n       We want the facilities where we make our products to be \n     powered by renewable energy, with nothing going to waste. As \n     corporate leaders, we have been working hard toward these \n     ends. but we can and must do more.\n       Today, we are making three commitments--to each other, to \n     you as our political leaders, and to the world.\n       We will:\n       Re-energize our companies' continued efforts to ensure that \n     our supply chain becomes more sustainable, based on our own \n     specific targets;\n       Talk transparently about our efforts and share our best \n     practices so that other companies and other industries are \n     encouraged to join us in this critically important work;\n       Use our voices to advocate for governments to set clear, \n     achievable, measurable and enforceable science-based targets \n     for carbon emissions reductions.\n\n\n                        That's where you come In\n\n       Now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of \n     climate change. We are asking you to embrace the opportunity \n     presented to you in Paris, and to come back with a sound \n     agreement, properly financed, that can affect real change.\n       We are ready to meet the climate challenges that face our \n     businesses. Please join us in meeting the climate challenges \n     that face the world.\n           Signed.\n       Grant Reid, President & CEO, Mars Incorporated; Paul \n     Polman, Chief Executive, Unilever; Jostein Solheim, CEO, Ben \n     & Jerry's; Kendall J. Powell, Chairman of the Board & CEO, \n     General Mills, Inc.; Mariano Lozano, President & CEO, Dannon \n     & Regional VP, Danone Dairy North America; John Bryant, Chief \n     Executive Officer, Kellogg Company; Kevin Cleary, CEO, Clif \n     Bar; Paul Grinwood, Chairman & CEO, Nestle, USA; Esteve \n     Torrens, President & CEO, Stonyfield Farm, Inc.; Kimberly \n     Jordan, Cofounder & CEO, New Belgium Brewing Company.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We heard a similar appeal from America's largest \nfinancial powerhouses last week. Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, \nJPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo released a strong call \nfor governments to come together on a climate agreement.\n  Here is what they wrote:\n\n       Policy frameworks that recognize the costs of carbon are \n     among the many important instruments needed to provide \n     greater market certainty, accelerate investment, drive \n     innovation in low carbon energy, and create jobs. . . . While \n     we may compete in the marketplace, we are aligned on the \n     importance of policies to address the climate challenge.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their statement also be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  In support of Prosperity and Growth: Financial Sector Statement on \n                            Climate Change \n\n       Scientific research finds that an increasing concentration \n     of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is warming the planet, \n     posing significant risks to the prosperity and growth of the \n     global economy. As major financial institutions, working with \n     clients and customers around the globe, we have the business \n     opportunity to build a more sustainable, low-carbon economy \n     and the ability to help manage and mitigate these climate-\n     related risks.\n       Our institutions are committing significant resources \n     toward financing climate solutions. These actions alone, \n     however, are not sufficient to meet global climate \n     challenges. Expanded deployment of capital is critical, and \n     clear, stable and long-term policy frameworks are needed to \n     accelerate and further scale investments.\n       We call for leadership and cooperation among governments \n     for commitments leading to a strong global climate agreement. \n     Policy frameworks that recognize the costs of carbon are \n     among many important instruments needed to provide greater \n     market certainty, accelerate investment, drive innovation in \n     low carbon energy, and create jobs. Over the next 15 years, \n     an estimated $90 trillion will need to be invested in urban \n     infrastructure and energy. The right policy frameworks can \n     help unlock the incremental public and private capital needed \n     to ensure this infrastructure is sustainable and resilient.\n       While we may compete in the marketplace, we are aligned on \n     the importance of policies to address the climate challenge. \n     In partnership with our clients and customers, we will \n     provide the financing required for value creation and the \n     vision necessary for a strong and prosperous economy for \n     generations to come.\n       Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, \n     Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. These are serious people running big, successful \ncompanies. They don't take climate change lightly, they don't scoff and \nneither should we. They are asking that elected officials find the \ncourage to address climate change. Majorities of voters of both parties \nand of Independents are also asking elected representatives to find the \ncourage to address climate change. That brings us back to that squeeze \nI talked about.\n  If you are not willing to address carbon pollution and the climate \nchange and ocean acidification it is causing, I ask my colleagues who \nare on the ballot in 2016: What are you going to say? What are you \ngoing to say to your voters? Are you going to say it is a hoax? Great. \nGood luck with that.\n  Are you going to say: OK. It is real, it is important, these \ncompanies are all right, but as far as fixing it, well, we have \nnothing--because right now that is what they have, nothing.\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\n  Maybe they should just beg: Please don't ask me about climate change \nbecause the big fossil fuel polluters are paying my party's bills and \nmaking mean threats to me. Those are not a great set of options.\n  At some point soon, I tell my friends: Your party's leaders are going \nto have to go to the fossil fuel billionaires and say: Enough. Enough. \nLet my people go. We held out for you as long as we could, but now you \nhave to let my people go, and it has to be soon.\n  As one executive told Congressman Gibson and me quite directly, ``The \nwindow of opportunity to act on climate change is closing.''\n  It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             The Filibuster\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to comment on an \nextraordinary about-face that we have seen from many of my colleagues \nacross the aisle with respect to the filibuster. When I say ``across \nthe aisle,'' I mean an about-face on the part of Democrats who see the \nfilibuster differently now than they did over the last 4 or 5 years. \nBut now, like Paul on the road to Damascus, they have seen the light \nand have now embraced the filibuster wholeheartedly, and like many \nconverts, they are very active in their faith.\n  Naturally, this has caused frustration for many Americans who wonder \nwhy we cannot address the pressing issues we were elected to address, \nand there are a lot of frustrated Members of the Senate as well. I am \none of those frustrated Members. When we have an opportunity for the \nSenate to function as James Madison said it should function, I don't \nunderstand why we cannot have it function that way. Not surprisingly, \nthe recent series of filibusters on legislation of enormous \nconsequences for our Nation has resulted in new calls for changes to \nthe Senate rules.\n  First, I would like to take stock of where we are right now. It was \njust last year that the previous majority leader was abusing the \ncloture motion to shut down debate and amendments on virtually every \nsingle bill, even before the debate had begun, all while blocking any \namendments. Any Senator who routinely votes for cloture motions under \nthose circumstances is obviously abdicating his or her responsibility \nto the people who elected that Senator to offer and debate any number \nof different ideas. That is what the Senate is all about.\n  Nevertheless, when those of us who were then in the minority voted \nagainst abdicating our responsibilities as Senators, we had a parade of \nDemocratic Senators come to the floor and accuse us of that most \ndastardly deed, at least according to them, the filibuster. They \nrepeatedly claimed that strict rule by the majority faction was the \nprinciple by which the Senate ought to operate with little or no input \nfrom the minority party; in other words, have it operate just like the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  We now have a majority--a Republican majority--that has tried to \nrestore the Senate to function as a deliberative body, as it used to \nand as it was intended to by the Framers of the Constitution. For \ninstance, last year the previous majority leader didn't bring a single, \nindividual appropriations bill to the floor of the Senate for \nconsideration and vote. By putting off appropriations until the end of \nthe fiscal year, that leader calculated that the threat of being blamed \nfor a government shutdown would force Republicans to accept a massive \nomnibus bill containing policies that would otherwise be rejected.\n  This year things are different. The Senate appropriators have done \ntheir work and reported out each separate appropriations bill--can you \nimagine, all 12 of those appropriations bills--and most of them on a \nbipartisan basis. Then, when the majority leader has attempted to bring \nthem to the floor, Senator McConnell, the majority leader, has been met \nwith a Democratic filibuster of the motion even to proceed to the bill.\n  What is the justification of that on the part of today's minority? \nThe majority leader Senator McConnell is not blocking amendments. In \nfact, he is even inviting amendments. So if there is something that the \nminority wishes to change or add to a bill, they can do it simply by \nparticipating in the process and offering amendments. After all, isn't \nthat what the Senate is all about? We have to pass appropriations bills \nor the government will shut down, so why can't we even bring \nappropriations bills up for consideration?\n  Well, the answer is quite obvious: The Democratic leadership is up to \nthose old games they used to keep the Senate from debating \nappropriations bills that they did over the last 5 years. By blocking \nappropriations bills and threatening to blame us for the shutdown, they \nhope and believe they can bully us into busting open the spending caps \nthat a majority in both the House and Senate agreed to in the budget \nresolution earlier this year. So much, then, for majority rule, which \nthe Democrats claim was such a deeply held principle, as they expressed \nit only last year and years before that.\n\n  They justify filibustering the appropriations bills because President \nObama has threatened to veto them unless he gets more spending. That \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  The first appropriations bill they filibustered was the Defense \nappropriations bill--not because that bill didn't provide enough \nfunding but because they want to hold it hostage to extract additional \nspending in other areas. Now they are holding hostage the bill that \nfunds the Department of Veterans Affairs. So they are holding hostage \nfunding for our men and women in combat and our veterans who have \nserved our Nation in order to protect the President from having to \nfollow through on his threat to veto these bills.\n  I understand that the President might not want to have to defend \nvetoing funding for our troops and veterans as a bargaining chip to \nextract additional spending from the Congress, but protecting the \nPresident from having to follow through with his threat is not a very \ngood reason for a filibuster.\n  A similar thing happened with the filibuster of legislation to \ndisprove the Iran deal. A bipartisan majority in both the House and the \nSenate was in favor of legislation to block President Obama's nuclear \ndeal with Iran. Because the deal was set to go into effect unless \nCongress acted, the Democrats cannot claim their filibuster was needed \nfor additional deliberation. It was a blatant attempt to run out the \nclock so the President would not have to use his veto pen.\n  So clearly it is not as though Democrats have now grudgingly accepted \nthe utility of the filibuster only in extraordinary circumstances; they \nhave now embraced it so completely that they used it simply to prevent \nembarrassing the President.\n  In light of this, it is understandable that many in my political \nparty and even in the grassroots are questioning whether we ought to \nget rid of the filibuster on legislation. This is an expression of the \nfrustration by a lot of conservatives that I hear from in the \ngrassroots of Iowa, and they hear it in the other body as well.\n  The argument goes kind of like this: After all, the Democrats \nunilaterally abolished the filibuster on nominations, contrary to \nSenate rules. Well, they will have to live with that come 2017 when the \nRepublican President is inaugurated, as I hope. But just as I think \nthey will live to regret that move, I think those of us on my side of \nthe aisle would ultimately regret the loss of the Senate as a \ndeliberative body if we were to change the cloture rule for \nlegislation. What would the Democrats do with unchecked power? We don't \nhave to guess. The Democrats briefly had the 60 votes needed to \novercome any filibuster, and they promptly ran the unpopular health \ncare law down the throats of an unwilling American public. They \ndismissed legitimate criticism from Republicans and skepticism from \ncitizens of America. They promised that Americans would like it once it \nhad passed and when we found out what is in it. Well, Americans now \nknow what is in the health care law, and the law hasn't become any more \npopular.\n  So does that mean we have to just accept that ObamaCare and other \naspects of ``the fundamental transformation of America'' the President \npromised are here to stay? Of course not. But we must not be \nshortsighted. I think a lot of the people who are conservatives, such \nas the grassroots of America, who are frustrated, as a lot of\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\nus in this body are frustrated, would be shortsighted if they consider \nchanging how the Senate operates.\n  Keep in mind that the American left was greatly influenced by the \nprogressive movement in the early 20th century which held that history \nis continually progressing toward a future of more governmental control \nover people's lives--for the people's benefit, of course. Now, most of \nus don't buy that--those who hold to the principle of limited \ngovernment--but there are a lot of people today who are buying it. We \nhear it in the Presidential campaigns, particularly of the other \npolitical party.\n  This led the progressives of the early 20th century to reject the \nDeclaration of Independence and focus on individual liberty and to \noppose our Constitution's system of checks and balances designed to \nprotect that liberty because it made it harder for the government to \nact. That comes from the philosophy that government always knows best. \nIt also means that those on the left played the long game, sometimes \nbiding their time, sometimes accepting incremental progress toward \ntheir goals, and other times making radical changes when they see an \nopening.\n  Those of us who are animated by the principle of individual liberty \nrecognize that liberty is the exception in human history, and threats \nto liberty must be fought constantly or we risk losing liberty and \nfreedom. As such, we are impatient to correct every loss of liberty \nright away, as we should be. However, in doing so, we must be very \ncareful not to break down those very safeguards that are in place to \nprevent government encroachment on individual liberty. If we are not \ncareful, then short-term gains could lead to even greater loss of \nliberty in the future.\n  The President's former Chief of Staff was famous for saying something \nlike this, and hopefully I am quoting him accurately: ``You never let a \nserious crisis go to waste, and what I mean by that, it's an \nopportunity to do things you think you could not do before.''\n  In other words, we have seen a concerted effort to take advantage of \nmomentary passions and temporary majorities to enact longstanding \npolicy goals of more governmental intervention in the economy and \nintervention in the lives of Americans. Preventing such a power play is \nprecisely the role the Senate was designed to play. Just listen to this \npassage from Federalist No. 62: ``The necessity of a senate is not less \nindicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to \nyield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced \nby factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.''\n  Of course, that was written by James Madison, who is rightly called \nthe father of the Constitution. Madison prepared extensively for the \nConstitutional Convention by studying ancient republics and ancient and \ncontemporary political philosophers. He came to the convention with \nwhat was called the Virginia plan, which the convention used as a \nstarting point for what became the U.S. Constitution. Madison also took \nextensive notes throughout the Constitutional Convention.\n  In other words, I think that when he speaks about the intent behind \nthe structure of the U.S. Constitution, he ought to know better than \nanybody, and that is particularly as he writes about the function of \nthe Senate in our Constitution system.\n  It is true that Madison did not speak to the filibuster itself, and \nthe Constitution leaves the rules of the House and Senate up to each \nChamber, but you cannot read the Federalist papers without a clear \nunderstanding that our system of government was intended to allow only \nmeasures that have broad and enduring support to actually get into law. \nThe Constitution was not designed to allow whatever faction happens to \nbe in power to have a free hand to do whatever it wishes.\n  As Madison said in Federalist No. 10, ``Measures are too often \ndecided not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the \nminor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing \nmajority.''\n  Where that minority is protected is in the U.S. Senate--the only \nplace in our political system. In fact, in arguing for the necessity of \nthe Senate in Federalist Paper No. 63, Madison is quite critical of \npure majoritarian democracies in ancient times and attributes their \nfailure to the lack of something we call the U.S. Senate.\n  That said, I understand why some of my Republican colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives are frustrated with the fact that many of the \nthings they pass become stalled here in the Senate. I say to them that \na lot of us on this side of the aisle share that frustration. So I and \nwe need to make sure those obstructing are held accountable. But anyone \nwho would change the Senate rules to give the majority leader the power \nto ram any bill through the Senate on a party-line vote should then ask \nwhether they can trust that this power will be used fairly by future \nmajority leaders. Remember that the previous majority leader tried to \nshut the minority out of the legislative process at almost every stage. \nThe Senate was routinely presented with bills often written behind \nclosed doors in the majority leader's office and told that there would \nbe only an up-or-down vote with no amendments.\n  Moreover, what would conservatives gain by abolishing the filibuster? \nI want people to think about what might happen if the filibuster is \nabolished. In the short term, we would have the emotional satisfaction \nof seeing President Obama use his veto pen, but that is about it. In \nthe long run, you can bet that modern-day progressives will use those \ntools to impose all sorts of policies to expand the scope of government \nthat would otherwise not make it through our constitutional system.\n  If you want to know what some of those ``intemperate and pernicious \nresolutions'' that Madison warned us about might be, we need only look \nto the past. I will list a whole bunch of things that could be the law \nof the land today.\n  Had the Senate operated on a purely majoritarian basis in the past, \nour country would be in much worse shape than it is now. For instance, \nif you think ObamaCare is bad, we would have had a single-payer, \ntotally government-run health care system if it weren't for the 60-vote \nrequirement. We would have had the disastrous cap-and-trade bill in \n2008 with its crony giveaways, making special interests rich while \ndestroying jobs for hard-working Americans. The list of items that \nwould have passed the Senate goes on and on--the 2007 immigration \namnesty bill; the DISCLOSE Act to intimidate private groups who engage \nin political speech that was brought up in 2010; the abolition of \nsecret ballot elections for unions in 2007; the prohibition on \nbusinesses replacing striking employees that was brought up in 1992; a \nbill to encourage public safety employees to unionize in 2010; the 1992 \nClinton crime bill; drug price negotiations in Medicare Part D that \namount to Federal price controls in 2007; an amendment to the \nConstitution to cancel First Amendment protections for speech around \nelection time in 2014; stripping religious liberty protections from \nChristian business owners who object to paying for drugs that can cause \nan abortion in 2014; President Obama's second big-spending stimulus \nproposal in 2011; the so-called Buffett tax would have been passed \nseveral times by now; the tax increase to pay local government employee \nsalaries in 2011; and who knows how many other tax increases they would \nhave passed if they knew they could get away with it. Of course, we \nheard a few weeks ago a speech by Senator Alexander, who has argued \nthat one of the first things the Democratic leadership would do is \nfollow the orders of union bosses and outlaw the many right-to-work \nlaws we have in the United States, forcing associations against the \nwill of some people.\n  This Senator knows well what it is like in the majority and what it \nis like being in the minority in the Senate, and I know things look \nvery different from each perspective. I would ask my conservative \ncolleagues who are frustrated that the current majority is not able to \nwork its will to consider the example of history and look to the \nfuture.\n  It is also interesting to observe the behavior of the many Democrats \nwho had never experienced a minority before who have now gained a new \nperspective on the filibuster and the power of the minority and the \nprotection of the minority by supporting the filibuster every chance \nthey get--and it\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\ndidn't take long. On the third vote in the Senate this year--after the \nchange of control, that is--most of the Democrats, including the \nloudest critics of the filibuster, voted against cloture on a motion to \nproceed, which until that point they claimed to be an egregious and \ninappropriate abuse of Senate rules. I know there are some Senate \nDemocrats who still say they are opposed to the filibuster even in \nprinciple, although apparently not in practice. It is no good saying \n``Stop me before I filibuster again.'' If you think it is wrong, don't \ndo it. It is as simple as that.\n  When Senator Wyden and I began to work on ending the practice of \nsecret holds, we pledged to disclose any hold that we placed on a bill \nin the Congressional Record, and we did that for years before finally \ngetting the rules changed so that every Member had to do that.\n  The Senate Democrats have shown through their actions that they now \nfully support the Senate filibuster. I guarantee that the next time \nRepublicans are in the minority, we, too, will see the necessity of \nthis traditional protection against what Madison referred to as ``the \nsuperior force of an interested and overbearing majority.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the year 1789, the U.S. Senate, in a \nchamber not far from here, approved the first 10 amendments to the \nConstitution. The Second Amendment reads: ``A well regulated Militia, \nbeing necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the \npeople to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' The Second \nAmendment to the Constitution is an amendment which has been uttered, \ndebated, and litigated over the entire history of the United States. \nWhatever the true intent of our Founding Fathers in writing that \nlanguage, that brief sentence, I wonder if they could even imagine what \nwe are dealing with today in the name of the right of people to keep \nand bear arms because every day, on average, in America, 297 people are \nshot--every day--and 89 of them die every day in America.\n  Last Saturday I was with my wife in Chicago having a cup of coffee \nand reading over the papers, listening to National Public Radio. They \nreported the Roseburg, OR, shooting at the community college, and they \ncited a statistic that I was not aware of: That shooting at the \ncommunity college that killed nine innocent people was the 45th school \nshooting in America this year. There have been 45 shootings in schools. \nThere were many other mass shootings in different places, but now even \nschools, even students, even schoolchildren are not safe from the \nrampage of guns.\n  I am honored to represent the city of Chicago. It is a great city. I \ndo my best to help it in every way I can. But I also have to be very \ncandid and honest with you. So far, there have been 2,300 shootings in \nthe city of Chicago this year. Where are all these guns coming from?\n  Yesterday morning I went to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms in Chicago and sat down with the new special agent in charge \nand asked him the question: Where are all these guns coming from? Why \ndo we have more guns per capita in Chicago than in New York? Why is it \nthat so many of these teenagers, kids, moms, and dads are armed to the \nteeth? Where are all these guns coming from?\n  He said: Senator, the No. 1 source of guns in the State of Illinois--\ncrime guns that we have taken in the commission of crime and can \ntrace--the No. 1 source is Illinois.\n  We have a phenomenon where people go into a federally licensed arms \ndealer and purchase guns and use them in crime. But the bigger problem \nis they send in someone without a criminal record who can pass a \nbackground check and who buys guns and turns them over to drug gang \nthugs and criminals on the street. They call it straw purchasing. So \nthe No. 1 source of guns is trading guns within the State of Illinois \nand these traffickers, these straw purchasers who purchase a gun not \nfor their own use but to turn it over to a criminal or sell it to a \ncriminal. That is the No. 1 source.\n  What is the No. 2 State that supplies guns to the State of Illinois? \nIt is Indiana, which adjoins Illinois to the east--specifically, Lake \nCounty, IN, in the northwestern section of that State.\n  Why do we get so many guns from Indiana into Illinois that are used \nin the commission of crime? Because of gun shows. Gun shows occur on \nthe weekends, and people literally show up in Indiana, show some State \nidentification, and without any background check walk out with a gun--\nnot just a gun but many times fill their trunks with guns and \nammunition and drive across the border into Chicago, Cook County, and \ngo to the west side of town or down south in Englewood. They pull up in \nan alley or maybe even on the curbside and have an open market, selling \nthese guns picked up at gun shows. The people who purchase these never \nwent through a background check. Nine times out of 10, unless they are \nbuying from a gun show from a Federal dealer, it is just an arms-length \ntransaction--however many guns you want to buy; no questions asked. \nMany of these people would be disqualified if they went to a Federal \ngun dealer. They have a history of committing felonies and other acts \nthat disqualify them.\n  The fact is that today that is the No. 2 source of crime guns--\nIndiana.\n  What is the No. 3 source of crime guns in the city of Chicago? \nMississippi. Mississippi. Why? Because their gun show requirements are \neven more lax than in the Midwest. It is an ongoing commerce of running \nthose guns up the interstate and selling them in the city of Chicago.\n  So what is happening? There is a dramatic increase in homicides \nacross America. We are awash in guns. Sadly, many of them are in the \nhands of people who buy them to kill innocent people. There has been a \nspike in homicides this year--not just in Chicago but in Milwaukee, St. \nLouis, Houston, Baltimore, New Orleans, and many other cities. The \nplain reality is that we are now awash in guns in America, and it is \nfar too easy for convicted criminals, felons, and unstable people to \nget their hands on a gun and to use it.\n  When guns are everywhere and when it is easy for dangerous people to \nget them, it puts everyone at risk. Can you imagine for a second that \nany of those students heading into that community college in Oregon \nthat morning had even an idea they would face a gunman and some would \ndie? The heartbreaking stories--one I remember hearing from a minister \nwho talked about his daughter, who survived because she appeared to be \na bloody corpse. The gunman stepped over her. The father could hardly \ncontain his emotions when he talked about dropping that girl off at \nschool and living with the possibility that she would have died there \nand that would have been his last memory of his daughter. Is that what \nAmerica has come to? Is that what we are?\n  Pretty much anywhere you go now, you have it in the back of your mind \nthat someone could have a gun, someone could start shooting. Do we want \nto live this way in America?\n  If you talk to the gun lobby and the special interest groups that \nmanufacture guns and want to sell more and more, they will say the \nsolution is to arm more good guys with guns so they can shoot the bad \nguys. That is a solution they like because it sells more guns, but why \nwouldn't we try in the first place to keep guns out of the hands of bad \nguys?\n  The Supreme Court has said there is no constitutional problem in the \nprovision that I read with keeping guns away from felons, domestic \nviolence abusers, the mentally unstable, and other dangerous people. \nThe Supreme Court across the street said that is completely consistent \nwith the Second Amendment. Why don't we do it? If our country did a \nbetter job of preventing bad guys from getting guns, there are a lot of \ninnocent people who would still be here today.\n  I held a hearing in my Constitution subcommittee a couple years ago \nabout gun violence. We talked about the need for better laws to stop \nillegal straw purchases and gun trafficking.\n  One of our witnesses, a young woman who has become my friend, was \nSandra Wortham of Chicago. Her brother Thomas was a Chicago police \nofficer. He had served two tours of duty in Iraq. He was a great guy. \nHe was gunned down in front of his parents' home on the South Side of \nChicago. He was murdered by gang members with a\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nstraw-purchased gun. He was an extraordinary police officer. When he \nwas shot, he had a gun on him. He shot back at the armed gunmen who \nwere trying to rob him, and so did his father, who was standing nearby, \nalso a retired police sergeant. But Officer Wortham was killed. He died \nin front of his parents' house on May 19, 2010. I attended his funeral.\n  Thomas Wortham's sister Sandra spoke at that hearing. It was \npowerful. This is what she said:\n\n       My brother carried a gun. My father carried a gun. But the \n     fact that my brother and father were armed that night did not \n     prevent my brother from being killed. We need to do more to \n     keep guns out of the wrong hands in the first place. I don't \n     think that makes us anti-gun; I think it makes us pro-decent, \n     law abiding people.\n\n  Sandra Wortham is right. I hope my colleagues will hear her words.\n  Some say it is impossible to stop bad guys from getting guns; they \nare just going to get them. It is true that there are a lot of \nloopholes in the law to get them today, like the gun show loophole and \nthe Internet loopholes in the background check system. I don't question \nthe possibility that those loopholes are there. It is also true that \nthe gun lobby is working hard every day to further weaken the laws on \nthe books and to strike them down in court. But we can stop the gun \nlobby from gutting the laws on the books, and we can close those \nloopholes if lawmakers just have the courage and political will.\n  Our goal should be to keep guns out of the hands of bad guys, not to \ntake them away from people who use them in a responsible and legal way. \nI grew up in downstate Illinois. Owning shotguns and rifles is just \npart of life. Taking your son or in some cases even your daughter out \nhunting is normal. It is what people do. I have been out duck hunting \nin Stuttgart, AR, with my former colleague, Mark Pryor. We had a good \ntime. Everybody there knew that a gun was a dangerous weapon that had \nto be handled carefully. We filed the necessary permits and licenses to \nbe out there hunting on that day and followed a long list of \nrequirements that limited our right to go shooting ducks, migrating \nducks in that area. We did it because it was the law and law-abiding \npeople pay attention to the law.\n  But what are we going to do now to respect those law-abiding people \nbut still get serious about stopping these guns that end up in the \nhands of felons and mentally unstable people? Are we going to shrug our \nshoulders? Are Members of Congress going to put out the standard press \nrelease after a mass shooting? Or are we going to rise to this \nchallenge on this occasion and do something? What a breakthrough it \nwould be if we could save these innocent lives.\n  I cannot imagine that classroom in that community college in Oregon \nwhere that crazy gunman, loaded and armed, went up to each of those \nstudents and asked if they were Christians. If they said yes, he told \nthem: You are on your way to Heaven, and then he shot them dead. I \ncannot imagine that moment. I certainly cannot imagine if in that \nclassroom was someone I loved, someone I knew, someone I cared about, \nand they were the victim of that kind of mental instability.\n  So are we going to shrug our shoulders, remember the victims in our \nthoughts and prayers and do nothing? Is that what it has come to? We \nare better than that. We can easily pass laws to protect domestic \nviolence victims by keeping the guns out of the hands of their abusers. \nAll it takes is will. We could easily hold gun dealers accountable for \nguns that they purposefully misplace into the hands of criminals. All \nit takes is the will. We can easily adopt technology to stop criminals \nfrom stealing guns and stop kids from using them accidentally. All it \ntakes is will. We can easily create a better background check system \nand pass better laws to stop straw purchasing and illegal gun \ntrafficking. All it takes is will. We can stop the gun lobby from \ngutting the laws on the books, and we can close these loopholes if \nlawmakers just have the courage and the political will.\n  As President Obama said, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. \nStopping this violence requires courage and political will. I hope the \nCongress can rise to this challenge. I am not giving up. I have seen \ntoo many lives cut short, too many families and communities devastated \nby this violence. I am going to do all I can to bring down the number \nof shootings in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, imagine a successful and popular program \nthat saves our special natural places, such as parks, recreation areas, \nwildlife refuges, and forests. Imagine further that this is \naccomplished not with tax dollars, but with royalties paid by companies \nthat extract oil or minerals from our public lands. What is not to love \nabout a program like that? Now imagine that some in Congress want to \nkill or weaken that program. In fact, its charter just expired on \nOctober 1.\n  For 50 years, a bipartisan commitment has promoted the preservation \nof our national parks, forests, and refuges and the vistas that are so \niconic in our national identity. But today we find ourselves yet again \nin the midst of a made-in-Washington crisis that devalues this history \nof shared commitment, replacing it with the misplaced ire of those who \ndo not understand its profound, community-driven impact on the land and \non our economy.\n  On September 30, the authorization of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, LWCF, America's most successful conservation and recreation \nprogram, was allowed to expire. Founded on the principle of balancing \nthe depletion of certain natural resources by conserving other \nresources, the fund uses revenues from royalties of offshore oil and \ngas extraction to support the conservation of our land and water, a \nsymmetry that conservation advocates have praised. More to the point, \nthe fund is supported at no cost to taxpayers. Similarly, congressional \ninaction allowed the Historic Preservation Fund--also a budget-neutral \nprogram with longstanding bipartisan support--to lapse. Together, these \ntwin programs represent key commitments to protecting our Nation's \nhistoric resources and lands for future generations.\n  For 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has supported the \ncreation of parks and refuges, but it has also filled in plots of land \nat risk of loss through development in our national parks to create a \nseamless park system that is easier and more cost-effective to manage. \nIt has provided resources to local communities to achieve otherwise \ncost-prohibitive conservation projects in small towns. It supports \ncommunity playgrounds and maintains trails, while fostering and \nprotecting our innate appreciation of the world around us, and it \naccomplishes all of this while being a boon to local economies.\n  In Vermont more than $123 million in LWCF grants have supported \nhundreds projects over the last five decades, and the benefits can be \nseen across every county in the Green Mountain State. These grants back \nan economy of outdoor recreation supporting 35,000 jobs, generating \n$187 million in state tax revenue and $2.5 billion in retail sales in \nVermont alone, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. On top of \nthis, an estimated 545,000 people hunt, fish, and enjoy the wildlife of \nthe Green Mountain State every year--a stunning number that nearly \nmatches our State's entire population.\n  In addition to local recreation projects, the LWCF in Vermont has \nsupported the creation of our State's only national park, the Marsh \nBillings Rockefeller National Historical Park. It has helped to add \n100,000 acres to the\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\nGreen Mountain National Forest, to establish the Conte National \nWildlife Refuge, and to forever preserve large swaths of the \nAppalachian and Long Trails. These are treasures today, preserved for \nfuture generations.\n  Across the country, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been \nvalued as America's premier conservation program--an outgrowth of what \nhas been called ``America's Best Idea,'' the creation of our National \nPark System. It has drawn strong bipartisan support for half a century, \neven as the political atmosphere has become more divisive. I recently \nled a bipartisan coalition of 53 Senators representing every corner of \nthe Nation in asking for a short-term extension of the LWCF and a \ncommitment to work to permanently authorize and fund the program. We \nsent a similar letter calling on Majority Leader McConnell and Minority \nLeader Reid to support permanent funding for the program, which was \nfollowed by a similar bipartisan letter from members of the House to \nSpeaker Boehner.\n  But despite this strong bipartisan and bicameral support, there are \nthose who seek to throw this longstanding, commonsense program out the \nwindow, shutting down one of the few reliable sources that fund \nconservation work across the country, a truly devastating bid that \nthreatens our land and water and our local economies. It makes no \nsense.\n  Several times last week, opponents of the widely popular LWCF \nobjected to extending its authorization, claiming that the fund was \nused to purchase privately held land from landowners. But that is \nprecisely what the fund is intended to support: the purchase of land \nfrom willing sellers interested in seeing land protected rather than \ndeveloped. Often these land deals include land exchanges, thus ensuring \nthat the Nation's most sensitive lands are not developed, while \nensuring that other working lands remain privately owned.\n  Too often we see these deals evaporate because the funding is not \nthere. This is why we need to ensure the fund is permanently authorized \nand fully funded. These projects should not slip away, as we have seen \nin Vermont and other parts of the country, because of a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of how the fund operates and how it is supported.\n  We have watched conservation funding wither across the country while \ndevelopments encroach our precious national parks and while the real \nthreat of climate change draws closer and closer. Now is not the time \nto break a commitment to conserve our natural resources, our heritage, \nand the legacy we will hand to our children and grandchildren. We must \nvalue and protect our heritage by renewing the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/senate-section/article/S7157-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONFIRMATION OF DALE DROZD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Dale Drozd to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of California.\n  Judge Drozd earned his bachelor's degree magna cum laude from San \nDiego State University in 1977 and his law degree from UCLA in 1980, \nwhere he was inducted into the Order of the Coif.\n  He began his legal career as a law clerk for a district judge in the \nsame judicial district where he now serves.\n  Following his clerkship, Judge Drozd worked as a criminal and civil \nlitigator in Federal and State courts at the trial and appellate levels \nfor 14 years.\n  Then, in 1997, Judge Drozd was appointed to serve as a magistrate \njudge in the Eastern District of California.\n  In 2011, he became the chief magistrate judge in that court.\n  Over his 18-year career as a magistrate judge, he has presided over \nthousands of cases.\n  He is well regarded in the legal community and among those who appear \nbefore him on a daily basis. The ABA has rated Judge Drozd ``well \nqualified,'' its highest rating.\n  Five different U.S. attorneys who served under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations over more than 20 years have endorsed his \nnomination.\n  Those former U.S. attorneys include David F. Levi, who later served \non the district court and is now dean of Duke law school, as well as \nGeorge O'Connell, Charles Stevens, Paul Seave, and McGregor Scott.\n  Their letter states: ``[w]e have all known Judge Drozd for many years \nand are also aware of his judicial reputation in the community. He is \nan effective, productive, fair, and balanced jurist who is widely \nrespected in this district.''\n  Their letter further recognized Judge Drozd as ``an outstanding \nmagistrate judge,'' and went on to state that ``he will be equally \neffective as a district judge.''\n  The president of the Sacramento chapter of the Federal Bar \nAssociation wrote to the Judiciary Committee in support of this \nnomination.\n  That letter notes that, although it is not typical for the Federal \nBar Association ``to endorse a particular candidate or nomination,'' \nJudge Drozd's nomination is ``uniquely easy to support.''\n  The letter further stated that Judge Drozd ``is widely respected in \nour district and commands a high level of respect from attorneys who \nappear before him.''\n  I would also add a point from the U.S. attorneys' letter about the \ncrushing caseload in this district.\n  Their letter states: ``[o]ur district has an extremely heavy case \nload and has been operating with a vacant judgeship for two and a half \nyears. It is vitally important to the fair administration of justice \nthat the long-vacant judicial vacancy in our Fresno district be \npromptly filled.''\n  This is a point that bears repeating: the caseload in the Eastern \nDistrict of California is extraordinarily large, and has been for many \nyears.\n  This district covers Sacramento and California's Central Valley, \nincluding Fresno and Bakersfield--it covers 55 percent of California's \nland area.\n  The district has only six judgeships for a population of nearly 8 \nmillion people, and it has almost two times as many people per \njudgeship as the average U.S. district court.\n  Over the last 6 years, the court has had nearly three times as many \npending cases per judgeship--more than 1400--than the national average, \n569.\n  These numbers translate into lengthy times for cases to be resolved. \nOver the last several years, it has taken between 38 and 51 months for \ncivil cases to get to trial--well above the national average of 26 \nmonths.\n  Criminal cases now take over 20 months to be resolved currently, \nalmost three times the national average of 7.4 months.\n  The point is this: the Eastern District of California is in serious \nneed of additional judges. I have worked for many years to create those \npositions, and I believe very strongly that they are needed.\n  I am pleased that the Senate took the step of voting on this \nnomination.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/senate-section/article/S7157-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7157-S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IDAHO HOMETOWN HERO MEDAL\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, today I recognize Aaron and Tami \nFite of Platte, SD. I selected the Fites to receive the 2015 Angels in \nAdoption Award presented by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. I \nchose this couple for the way they have opened their hearts and homes \nto their children Cody and Cate through adoption and the way they have \nhelped inspire their community to better understand adoption and \nchildren with all types of abilities.\n  Though they initially intended to adopt a child from abroad, God \nchanged their hearts and brought Cody into their lives. During the \nfirst 3 years of his life, Cody had a variety of complex medical needs, \nbut thanks to Aaron and Tami's love and support, today he is a healthy \nand vibrant 11-year-old who competes in basketball, track, and softball \nat the Special Olympics.\n  Two years after adopting Cody, Aaron and Tami welcomed a baby girl, \nCate, into their home through adoption. Cate has a condition she \ndeveloped in the womb that prevents her from being able to walk or talk \non her own. Despite these challenges, she has mastered using a Mustang \nwalker to walk and using an Eyegaze communication tool that allows her \nto talk to others using her eyes. Cate captivates others with her \nbeautiful smile and gentle spirit.\n  Not long after adopting Cate, Tami unexpectedly became pregnant. \nChloe was born in 2010, and another daughter, Clare, was born in 2012.\n  I am inspired by the Fites' faith in the Lord and their desire to \nspread the word about life. I am pleased they were able to travel to \nWashington, D.C., to help advocate for their message that opening homes \nto children through adoption can help spread the word that every life \nis valuable.\n  The Angels in Adoption award recognizes individuals, couples, and \norganizations that have made extraordinary contributions on behalf of \nchildren in need of a family. Awardees from all 50 states, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia and Puerto Rico, come together in Washington, \nD.C., each year to participate in events that celebrate their heroic \nactions and enable them to use their personal experience to effect \nchange on a national level.\n  Aaron and Tami's exemplary actions demonstrate the positive impact \nadopting a child can have on a family and a community, and the Fites \nare more than deserving of this award. I would like to extend my \nsincere thanks and appreciation to Aaron and Tami and their family, and \nI wish them the best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/senate-section/article/S7158-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, too often our days are filled with \nnews of worldwide violence and hardship. It is during these times that \nit is especially important to recognize those communities that find \nways daily to celebrate life, family, and culture. Today, I would like \nto recognize Lafayette, LA, a city that goes above and beyond to \ndistinguish itself as a cultural crossroads and one of the happiest \nplaces to live in America.\n  According to a 2014 report by the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch, \nthe top five happiest cities in America are all located in Louisiana, \nwith Lafayette taking the top spot. For anyone who has ever visited \nthis jewel of south Louisiana, the recognition will come as no \nsurprise. Lafayette is located in the heart of Louisiana's Cajun and \nCreole country--an area known for its upbeat music, flavorful foods, \nand for letting the good times roll.\n  Each and every day, Lafayette's rich, unique history and culture can \nbe seen throughout the streets of the city and the personalities of its \nresidents. Entertaining, educational events are scattered throughout \nthe calendar year, ensuring guests from around the world are shown a \nslice of the Lafayette way of life. Festivals such as the Festivals \nAcadiens et Creoles, held every October, provide an opportunity to \nexperience the one-of-a-kind food, music, and traditions that the \nLafayette region has to offer. Another annual Lafayette festival, the \nFestival International de Louisiane, attracts folks from across the \nState and the region in celebrating the intriguing history and culture \nshared between Louisiana and the Francophone world.\n  Lafayette is truly like no other place in the world; just ask any of \nits residents. With renowned food, music, and festivals, it is no \nwonder the population of this southern paradise always has a reason to \nsmile. Congratulations again to Lafayette, LA, on the recognition of \nbeing the happiest place to live; and I wish you many more successful, \nhappy years building and growing south Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/senate-section/article/S7158-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7158-S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING LAFAYETTE MUSIC COMPANY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, American musicians play a large \nrole in the cultural development of our Nation's history, and much of \nthat success is due to the local small businesses responsible for \nproviding the equipment and instruction musicians need. This week's \nSmall Business of the Week has an expert staff that is dedicated to \nserving all kinds of musicians. Congratulations to Lafayette Music \nCompany of Lafayette, LA, for being selected Small Business of the \nWeek.\n  The Lafayette Music Company is a 60-year-old family-owned business \nthat has continuously provided musicians in their community with \nexcellent equipment and instruction. Built in 1955 by Mr. William C. \n``Bill'' Peyton, the Lafayette Music Company initially focused on the \nsale of pianos and organs. When Mr. Raymond J. Goodrich joined the \nsales team in 1967, he expanded the company's focus to include \nservicing additional instruments, including the brass family. Under Mr. \nGoodrich's management, the Lafayette Music Company developed a band \ndepartment, catering to schools in the Acadiana region of south \nLouisiana. Mr. Goodrich's affable approach to securing a local consumer \nbase offered a unique and personalized level of assistance that was \nunrivaled in the area. After working as a salesman and sales manager \nfor 6 years and part owner for 3 years, Mr. Goodrich purchased a \nmajority of the company's shares to become the primary owner.\n  Today, Mr. Goodrich and his wife, Karen, provide beginner, \nintermediate, and expert musicians with a diverse product selection. \nThe Lafayette Music Company offers a wide array of the latest guitars, \ndrums, band instruments, accessories, pianos, church organs, and more, \nas well as an in-house repair department that has been in service for \nmore than 80 years. Additionally, the Lafayette Music Company boasts an \nastonishing customer service record that has ranked them in the top 100 \nlargest music products retailers by The Music Trades magazine for 3 \nconsecutive years.\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\n  Mr. Goodrich and his wife, Karen, provide entrepreneurs across the \nNation with an inspiring example of how pursuing a business plan with \nunrelenting vigor and creativity is the key to success. Centered in an \narea of the country with world-renowned music and an incomparable \nheritage, the Goodrich family has secured the business of a community \nof musicians with specific needs.

The \nSupplementary Agreement, signed at Prague on September 23, 2013, is \nintended to modify a certain provision of the Agreement on Social \nSecurity between the United States of America and the Czech Republic, \nwith Administrative Arrangement, signed at Prague on September 7, 2007, \nand entered into force January 1, 2009 (the ``U.S.-Czech Social \nSecurity Agreement'').\n  The U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement as amended by the \nSupplementary Agreement is similar in objective to the social security \nagreements already in force with most European Union countries, \nAustralia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, and the Republic of Korea. \nSuch bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the \nUnited States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual \nsocial security coverage and taxation, and to help prevent the lost \nbenefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers \nbetween two countries.\n  The Supplementary Agreement amends the U.S.-Czech Social Security \nAgreement to account for a new Czech domestic health insurance law, \nwhich was enacted subsequent to the signing of the U.S.-Czech Social \nSecurity Agreement in 2007. By including the health insurance law \nwithin the scope of the U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement, this \namendment will exempt U.S. citizen workers and multinational companies \nfrom contributing to the Czech health insurance system, when such \nworkers otherwise meet all of the ordinary criteria for such an \nexemption.\n  The U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement, as amended, will continue \nto contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the Social \nSecurity Act and other provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out \nthe purposes of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the \nSocial Security Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required \nby section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the estimated number \nof individuals who will be affected by the Supplementary Agreement and \nits estimated cost effect. The Department of State and the Social \nSecurity Administration have recommended the Supplementary Agreement \nand related documents to me.\n  I commend the Supplementary Agreement to the U.S.-Czech Social \nSecurity Agreement and related documents.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 6, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/senate-section/article/S7159-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 5:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2835.

Res. 278\n\n       Whereas the Government and people of the United States and \n     the Republic of Korea share a comprehensive alliance, a \n     dynamic partnership, and a personal friendship rooted in the \n     common values of freedom, democracy, and a free market \n     economy;\n       Whereas the alliance between the United States and the \n     Republic of Korea is a\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\n     linchpin of regional stability in Asia, including against the \n     threats posed by the regime in Pyongyang;\n       Whereas cooperation between our nations spans across the \n     security, diplomatic, economic, energy, and cultural spheres;\n       Whereas the relationship between the people of the United \n     States and the Republic of Korea stretches back to Korea's \n     Chosun Dynasty, when the United States and Korea established \n     diplomatic relations under the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, \n     Commerce, and Navigation;\n       Whereas the United States-Republic of Korea alliance was \n     forged in blood, with casualties of the United States during \n     the Korean War of 54,246 dead (of whom 33,739 were battle \n     deaths) and more than 103,284 wounded, and casualties of the \n     Republic of Korea of over 50,000 soldiers dead and over \n     10,000 wounded;\n       Whereas the Korean War Veterans Recognition Act (Public Law \n

Americans to display flags at half-staff in memory of the \n     Korean War veterans;\n       Whereas the Republic of Korea has stood shoulder-to-\n     shoulder alongside the United States in all 4 major \n     engagements the United States has faced since World War II--\n     the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, in Afghanistan, and in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas, since the 1953 Mutual

Korean Peninsula, and currently \n     there are approximately 28,500 United States troops stationed \n     in the Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas, in January 2014, the United States and the \n

 the costs associated with the stationing of United States \n     Forces Korea (USFK) on the Korean Peninsula;\n       Whereas, the Governments and people of the United States \n     and the Republic of Korea share a deep commitment to \n     addressing the continued suffering of the people of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea due to the human rights \n     abuses and repression of the regime in Pyongyang;\n       Whereas, on March 15, 2012, the United States-Republic of \n     Korea Free Trade Agreement entered into force, which both \n     sides have committed to fully implement, and the Republic of \n     Korea is the United States sixth-largest trade partner, with \n     United States goods and exports to Korea reaching a record \n     level of $44,500,000,000 in 2014, up over 7 percent compared \n     to 2013;\n       Whereas, on May 7, 2013, the United States and the Republic \n     of Korea signed a Joint Declaration in Commemoration of the \n     60th Anniversary of the Alliance Between the Republic of \n     Korea and the United States;\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2013, Her Excellency Park Geun-hye, the \n     President of the Republic of Korea, addressed a Joint Session \n     of Congress;\n       Whereas the United States Government notes the address \n     delivered by President Park Geun-hye in Dresden, Germany, on \n     March 28, 2014, and recognizes her efforts to promote peace, \n     stability, and cooperation in Northeast Asia;\n       Whereas the United States Government appreciates the \n     Government of the Republic of Korea's leadership and the \n     critical role of the United States-Republic of Korea alliance \n     in defusing tensions along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in \n     August and September of 2015, that were provoked by the \n     Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;\n       Whereas there are deep cultural and personal ties between \n     the peoples of the United States and the Republic of Korea, \n     as exemplified by the large flow of visitors and exchanges \n     each year between the 2 countries, including Korean students \n     studying in United States colleges and universities;\n       Whereas Korean-Americans have made invaluable contributions \n     to our Nation's security, prosperity, and diversity;\n       Whereas, from October 14-16, 2015, President Park Geun-hye \n     will visit Washington for a second official visit to the \n     United States since her election as President; and\n       Whereas the United States Government looks forward to \n
