Mr. President, ask most Americans to name two of the \nmost basic duties of a Senator, and you are likely to hear some \ncombination of the following: No. 1, protect the country. That means \nworking with us to pass the National Defense Authorization Act. No. 2, \nfund the government. That means working with us to pass the 12 \nappropriations bills that fund it.\n  But some of our Democratic colleagues don't seem all that interested \nin these things. It is not just that their words tell us this story, \ntheir actions do as well. The Democratic leader has used the phrase \n``waste of time'' to refer to a bill that protects our country. Passing \nthat bill usually inspires bipartisan cooperation, but this year it \nrequired overcoming senseless resistance from the other side before we \nfinally witnessed that cooperation yesterday with the bill's passage.\n  Democratic Senators have used phrases such as ``kind of a waste of \ntime,'' and ``a huge waste of time,'' to refer to the bills that fund \nour government.\n  Passing these bills used to be routine, and the new majority has \nworked hard to ensure that it does again after 6 years of inaction. \nThat is why we passed the budget. That is why we passed the 12 \nappropriations bills through committee in a bipartisan way. But now \nDemocrats have decided as part of some arbitrary political strategy to \nindiscriminately filibuster every last funding bill.\n  Now Democrats may no longer be interested in passing these bipartisan \nbills, but it doesn't mean they aren't interested in taking credit for \nthe same legislation they are now blocking. Take the bill that funds \nveterans. Democrats voted with us to support it in committee, then they \nissued press releases bragging about its contents, and then they \nfilibustered it. Take the bill that funds defense. Democrats voted with \nus to support it in committee, then they issued press releases bragging \nabout its content, and then they filibustered it, repeatedly.\n  Today we will consider the bill that funds America's energy security \nand its water infrastructure. Democrats voted with us to support this \nbill in committee, too. In fact, over 70 percent of the Democrats in \ncommittee supported the bill that is before us today. Democrats issued \npress releases with nice things to say about the bill's contents. One \nlauded the bill for funding important energy efficiency advances in our \nmilitary and for low-income families. Another reminded us the bill \nprovides ``robust funding'' for vital programs that deserve to be \nfunded. Today\n\n[[Page S7228]]\n\nwe will see if Democrats are seriously prepared to filibuster this bill \nas well.\n  This bill would strengthen our national security. The bill would \nenhance our energy security. The bill would root out waste with smart \ntargeted reductions so we can put that money to better use, funding \nmore important infrastructure projects, more innovative energy \nresearch, and more critical safety improvements for our dams and \nwaterways.\n  This bill is also critically important to our home States. \nKentuckians would benefit from initiatives to protect the Ohio River \nshoreline, from cleanup work in Paducah, and from construction of the \nOlmstead Lock and Dam and other vital inland waterway projects.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It deserves our support on the \nmerits. It is good for our constituents and good for our country. That \nshould be reason enough to support this funding bill. I would also \nremind my Democratic colleagues that 70 percent--70 percent--of the \nDemocrats in committee did support the bill before us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7228-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, for the record, the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, is attending a funeral this morning and I am standing in \nhis stead.\n  First, I will address the comments from the majority leader, Senator \nMcConnell. I have to disagree with his opening that Democrats are not \ninterested in funding the government, that Democrats are not interested \nin funding the Department of Defense. I may remind my friend from \nKentucky, the Senator who is the Republican leader, that it was the \nRepublican side that initiated the government shutdown 2 years ago. For \n16 days the government was shut down in a vain attempt to protest the \nAffordable Care Act. Now that threat is before us again.\n  It is unfortunate we are facing this, but I don't believe it is fair \nto blame our side of the aisle for delay. You see, Mr. President, as \nearly as June, we started saying we are facing an October 1 deadline, \nand we need to have a budget compromise, a budget negotiation. Why? \nBecause there is a fundamental disagreement about funding our \ngovernment in this fiscal year that began October 1.\n  The Republicans have argued to use wartime funds--$38 billion worth--\nto supplement the Department of Defense. The leaders at the Department \nof Defense say this is the wrong approach. They cannot build a strong \nnational defense with an injection of wartime funds which may or may \nnot exist at the end of the process--may or may not exist next year.\n  I might add, coincidently, that the Republicans failed--failed--to \nput additional funds in for nondefense spending. Some of it is related \nto national security--the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, and so many agencies that keep us safe here in \nthe United States. The failure of the Republicans to provide funds for \ncritical agencies that provide health and education services is the \nreason we have reached an impasse in the budget negotiations.\n  It is why 3 months ago we on the Democratic side said to the \nRepublicans: You are in charge. You are in the majority. But if we are \ngoing to have a process that ultimately succeeds, you need to engage on \na bipartisan basis in this negotiation. They refused. They refused and \nthey came up with a short-term spending bill--we call it a continuing \nresolution or CR--which takes us to the first or second week of \nDecember. Beyond that there is no certainty about what is going to \nhappen.\n  The Senator from Kentucky talks about the appropriations process, \nwhere so many Senators voted for a bill and now are against it. I have \nbeen on appropriations committees in the House and the Senate for a \nlong time. In the Senate we have an upside-down approach, where you \nvote on the overall bill first, then vote on amendments. In each of the \ncases the Senator from Kentucky refers to, many of us may have voted \nfor the overall bill, hoping that amendments would solve the budget \nproblems I have described. When those amendments failed to solve those \nbudget problems, we said: This ultimate bill is not going to work, and \nwe know it. That is the reality of the process in the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  So in June we invited the Republicans to meet with the President and \nDemocratic leaders to work out a budget compromise. There is an \nindication that some conversation is underway, but not enough.\n  Why have we reached this impasse? Frankly, it is because the \nRepublican leadership--certainly in the House--is in disarray. Today \nthere is going to be an election in the House of Representatives for a \nnew Speaker. A group of ultraconservative Republican House Members were \nsuccessful in ousting John Boehner from the Speakership. Now they are \ngoing to try to replace him but with conditions. One of those \nconditions is, as printed in the paper this morning, that the new House \nSpeaker has to pledge to the Freedom Caucus--the tea party \nRepublicans--that he will never, never agree to any compromise that is \na bipartisan bill coming out of the Senate.\n  Now, how is that for a standard when you are trying to govern in this \ncountry--when you have a President of one party and the Congress in \ncontrol of the other party? The Freedom Caucus says: Don't negotiate; \ndon't compromise. That is a recipe for a shutdown, a sequestration, and \na continuing resolution. Let me tell you what that does. If we get into \na continuing resolution for next year--this year we are in, I should \nsay--it is going to mean dramatic cuts in many agencies.\n  Yesterday the National Institutes of Health were called by Senator \nBlunt, who chairs the appropriations subcommittee for that agency. We \nsat before Dr. Collins and his leading researchers for the United \nStates of America, and we asked them: What happens if our budget \nprocess breaks down, if we go into sequestration, which is an across-\nthe-board cut, or we go into a continuing resolution, which is a \ncontinuation of this year's budget? What happens at the premier medical \nresearch facility in the world, the National Institutes of Health? Dr. \nCollins told us in very honest and somber tones: It would mean that we \nwould suspend research in areas like precision medicine, destined I \nthink to save lives across the world. We would suspend brain research \nin areas like Alzheimer's disease.\n  Once every 67 seconds in America--once every 67 seconds--an American \nis diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Last year, we spent $226 billion as a \nFederal Government in Medicare and Medicaid on Alzheimer's care. We \nestimate about the same number, over $200 billion, was spent by \nfamilies trying to care for those inflicted by dementia and \nAlzheimer's. There is a suggestion now that because our failure on \nbudget negotiations will lead to the suspension of research, we would \ndestroy any hope of finding a cure for this dreaded disease and scores \nof other diseases. That is how serious this conversation is. It is \nunfortunate that it has reached this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7228-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7228-S7229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when I was young and going to grade \nschool, we feared the bomb. We were in a cold war. We were given duck-\nand-cover drills to get under our desk just in case there might be a \nnuclear attack on the United States of America. That is imprinted in my \nmind to this day--the fear which we had about this threat to our \nsafety.\n  I wish to read a commentary that is making the rounds with wide \ncirculation by a mother who talks about a similar concern for her \nchildren. She writes:\n\n       Two weeks ago, my second and fourth grade daughters came \n     home from school and\n\n[[Page S7229]]\n\n     told me they'd a ``code red drill in case someone tries to \n     kill us. We had to all hide in the bathroom together and be \n     really quiet. It was really scary but the teacher said if \n     there was a real man with a gun trying to find us, she'd \n     cover us up and protect us from him. [Her little boy] started \n     crying. I tried to be brave.''\n\n  This mother goes on to write:\n\n       My 3-year-old nephew had the same drill at his preschool in \n     Virginia. Three-year-old American babies and teachers--hiding \n     in bathrooms, holding hands, preparing for death. We are \n     saying to teachers: Arm yourselves and fight men with assault \n     weapons because we are too cowardly to fight the gun lobby. \n     We are saying to a terrified generation of American \n     children--WE WILL NOT DO WHAT IT TAKES TO PROTECT YOU. WE \n     WILL NOT EVEN TRY. So just be very quiet, hide and wait. Hold \n     your breath. Shhh.\n\n  In the year 2013, the number of American police officers shot dead in \nthe line of duty was 27--27, in 2013. In 2013, the number of \npreschoolers--that is, children under the age of 4--who were shot dead \nwas 82; 27 American police officers, 82 children under the age of 4 \nwere shot dead. We need to do better as a nation.\n  When I heard on the news this last Saturday that the monstrous \ntragedy in Oregon was the 45th--45th--school shooting this year in \nAmerica, it broke my heart, and, more, it angered me.\n  In just a short while, in a few minutes, Members of the Senate \nDemocratic caucus will come together outside of this building to talk \nabout the need for America to take action to deal with gun violence. \nThere are so many aspects of it.\n  I am honored to represent the city of Chicago, but having met with \nMayor Rahm Emanuel yesterday, we have seen a 20-percent increase in gun \nviolence and deaths this year, and in Milwaukee, a 100-percent increase \nover last year. In scores of other cities, there is the same \nphenomenon. The city of Chicago and many others will be flooded with \nguns.\n  When I met with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives in Chicago on Monday, I asked them: Where are all these guns \ncoming from? And they told me they have analyzed the crime guns seized \nin the most violent areas of Chicago, and they found that 40 percent of \nthose guns came from gun shows in Lake County, IN, just across the \nborder from Chicago--40 percent of guns. We also know that we have a \nphenomenon where girlfriends and friends and family will go buy guns, \nbecause the criminal--the felon who wants to use those guns to \nterrorize and rob and kill--couldn't pass the test for purchasing a \ngun. It is known as a straw purchase. The girlfriend buys the gun and \nhands it over to the boyfriend who goes out and kills somebody. Well, \nthere are things we can do to change this. We need to close the gun \nshow loophole. It makes no sense that we don't even check the \nbackgrounds of people who fill their trunks and their cars with \nfirearms and ammunition at these gun shows. And yet when it comes to \nFederal licensed dealers, there has to be a background check. This gap \nin coverage accounts for 40 percent of the crime guns in the most \ndangerous neighborhoods in Chicago. So the gun show loophole needs to \nbe closed.\n  We also need to make it clear that if you are going to make a straw \npurchase of a gun and do so for the purpose of giving it to someone who \nis going to use it in the commission of a crime, you will pay a heavy \nprice for that, too.\n  I grew up in a family with a lot of members of my family owning \nfirearms in downstate Illinois. It was common for families to go \nhunting, to go out for target practice, and there was a gun cabinet in \nmost homes. When a little boy, sometimes a young girl, reached a \ncertain age, they were taken out in a rite of passage to go hunting for \nthe first time. It is a part of the culture where I grew up, and it is \nan acceptable part of the culture when those guns are used responsibly \nand safely.\n  I don't know a member of my family who would object to the following \nstatement: No one who is a convicted felon or mentally unstable should \nbe allowed to buy a gun in the United States. I don't know of a member \nof my family who would object to the notion that if you are going to \nbuy a gun so someone you know can use it to commit a crime and kill \nsomeone, you are going to be punished. Those are the two things that we \nshould start with when it comes to reducing gun violence. Those two \nprovisions are not going to hurt any legitimate, responsible, legal gun \nowner. But they are going to keep guns out of the hands of those who \nwould misuse them.\n  We have to restore some sense of order in this country, and we have \nto realize that when we reach the point that 3- and 4-year-olds are \nbeing killed in larger numbers each year by guns than even those brave \nmen and women who serve in our police departments--when it has reached \nthat point--clearly, Congress has to act. For Congress to act, we need \nto hear from the American people. If they share these feelings--if they \nshare the feeling--we need to move forward as a nation and stop this \nsenseless tragedy.\n  I hope that after we gather today on the floor, Members of the Senate \nwill come together and talk about this issue, and that across America \npeople will join us in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor as the ranking \nmember of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee. In that capacity, I rise to oppose \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2016 Energy and Water appropriations \nbill.\n  Let me be clear, I do this reluctantly.\n  In my view, this is a very good bill. Senator Alexander and I have \nput forth a well-balanced bill within the allocation levels we were \nprovided, which was a good level.\n  It has been a great pleasure for me over the years to work with \nSenator Alexander. I have the utmost respect for him. We have always \nworked things out, but this year I think we have a bigger issue, and I \nwish to address that in my remarks.\n  First, 6 of the 12 appropriations subcommittees received base \nallocations lower than last year.\n  Another four subcommittees received nominal increases but were still \nforced to make cuts due to rising costs beyond their control.\n  That leaves only two subcommittees--Energy and Water Development and \nHomeland Security--that received real funding increases.\n  That is why I believe considering the Energy and Water bill in \nisolation as we are now, rather than debating larger funding issues, is \nmisleading. That is why I can't support the motion to proceed to the \nbill.\n  We all know the vote today is not just about Energy and Water. It is \nabout the entire appropriations process, and that is the debate we \nshould be having.\n  Instead of debating just this specific bill, the debate should be \nfocused on\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\neliminating sequestration, negotiating a budget agreement with the \nPresident and the House, and putting an end to the destructive cycle of \ncontinuing resolutions, omnibuses, and threats of government shutdown.\n  The Republican leader has already initiated budget negotiations. I am \nled to believe three meetings have been held. It can be done. It is \nwhat needs to be done. I fully support that effort. That is where we \nshould focus our efforts.\n  Before I get into specifics of the Energy and Water funding issues, I \nwant to take a step back and discuss two very disturbing issues I have \nseen from my seat on the Appropriations Committee, and I am not a \nnewcomer.\n  I have been on that committee since I came to the Senate, which is \nmore than 20 years ago. They are the negative effects of sequestration \nand the unravelling of the overall appropriations process.\n  The strict budget caps put in place by the 2011 Budget Control Act \nhave been terrible for our country.\n  These spending caps, and the across-the-board cuts used to enforce \nthem, were designed to be so devastating that Congress would do \neverything it could to avert them.\n  The problem is, the Supercommittee failed to reach the agreement in \n2011, so those devastating cuts took effect.\n  These spending caps, which have essentially frozen spending levels \nfor the last 3 years, do not account for the increasing requirements \nplaced on the Federal Government.\n  The cost of veterans' health care is rising, insufficient, and has \nbeen roundly criticized. The cost of low-income housing is rising, the \ncost of educating our children is rising, and the cost of fighting \nnatural disasters, such as drought and wildfires, is also rising. But \nthe spending caps are not rising, meaning Congress is forced to make \ncuts to vital programs, and of course you get into the battle between \nthe national security portfolio, such as defense, and the domestic \nportfolio.\n  My portfolio on Energy and Water is part national security, because \nof the nuclear weapons for our country, and the domestic part is the \nOffice of Science, the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, which is the only infrastructure program we actually have \nfunctioning.\n  Having a static budget like this year after year, which does not even \naccount for inflation, is no way to run a country.\n  I am also disappointed by the collapse of the appropriations process. \nAt one time--and I hope this is interesting to the Presiding Officer \nsince he is a newcomer--it was the norm to pass each spending bill as a \nstand-alone piece of legislation. All Members could offer amendments, \nand each of us took ownership of the outcome. We haven't done that in a \ndecade.\n  It used to be that the entire Appropriations Committee, members of \nboth sides, would support bills drafted by each subcommittee chairman \nand approved by the full committee. We haven't done that in 5 years. It \nwas heresy for a bill to come out on the floor and not have members of \nthe Appropriations Committee support it. That is all gone today.\n  Everything changed in 2011. My Republican colleagues decided to vote \nagainst every appropriations bill to protest funding levels.\n  The die was cast, and we have had to cope with the consequences ever \nsince.\n  Since fiscal year 2010, we have passed 24 short-term continuing \nresolutions, which do nothing but keep the government going at the \nfunding levels of the year we were in at the time we passed the \ncontinuing resolution. That is nine more than in the preceding 5-year \nperiod. It is a 60-percent increase.\n  When Congress can't agree on funding levels, we end up putting \nFederal spending on autopilot.\n  Mr. President, 2011 also marked the year when Congress turned over \nthe power of the purse to the executive branch. By banning the use of \ncongressional adds, we not only admitted that we know less about our \nStates than executive agencies, we also removed a key reason many \nMembers voted for the appropriations bills.\n  And contrary to conventional wisdom, congressional adds were not out \nof control.\n  In 2010, the last year they were allowed, they totaled just one-half \nof 1 percent of spending approved by the Appropriations Committee. One-\nhalf of 1 percent were adds made by Members of this body and the other \nbody to do public projects in their districts.\n  I believe every Senator knows a great deal about his or her State--I \nreally do--and projects that are important for the State's survival, \nand I believe they evaluate them based on the importance to the public. \nI believe they know what vital projects need to be funded. Removing \nthat ability has removed individual Member's stake in an appropriations \nprocess that functions, and so it is nonfunctional today. It has \ndamaged our ability to govern, and I deeply believe that.\n  That is a long way of saying we need to return the appropriations \nprocess to the way it was handled in years past, and today's political \nvote on this bill doesn't move us in that direction.\n  Even though I do believe the Energy and Water bill represents an \nacceptable compromise under the circumstances, there are still \nsignificant issues with the bill caused by low spending caps.\n  The bill provides--and this is important--$35.4 billion. That is an \nincrease over fiscal year 2015 funding of $1.2 billion for defense and \n$8 million for nondefense programs, and that is where you can see the \nproblem. Those national security projects get an add of $1.2 billion--\nand it is largely the nuclear weapons--and all of our domestic \nprojects, such as the Office of Science, all of the energy projects, \nall of the innovations, the Energy Department, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, fixing rivers, fixing dams, dredging, and everything the \nArmy Corps of Engineers does only get $8 million as opposed to the $1.2 \nbillion that is added for defense. But even with that increase, there \nare significant shortfalls.\n  I will give a few examples. For the past 4 years, California and the \nWest have been suffering from a historic drought. I just came from the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee meeting. Senator Boxer and I \nhave put together a drought bill. We have worked on it for 2 years, and \nwe finally have a bill with some short-term fixes and some long-term \nprojects which can increase water supply in California.\n  Our reservoirs are at historic lows, and the Sierra Nevada snowpack, \nour major source of water, is at the lowest it has been in 500 years.\n  We have millions of dead trees littering the State, increased \nlightning strikes, big wildfires that go up like explosions into the \nair because it is so dry, and the State's agriculture sector, which \nfeeds the country, has been heavily affected. This is a $43 billion \nindustry that saw losses of $2.2 billion last year, has lost 17,000 \njobs, and on and on and on.\n  Here are some other ways the Energy and Water bill is weakened by low \nspending caps. I will talk for a moment more about the Office of \nScience. This is money used to expand research at our National \nLaboratories, and we are $196 million below the President's budget \nrequest in this bill. Energy efficiency and renewable energy programs \nhave seen an even bigger deficit with funding levels at $773 million \nbelow the President's budget request. This delays the development of \nvital technologies to reduce energy consumption and slash consumer \nspending.\n  Defense programs are also underfunded. With higher spending caps, we \ncould be putting into place strategies to keep nuclear materials out of \nthe hands of terrorists. We just heard about a cesium sale to shady \npeople that I can't remember ever happening before, and whether this \nopens the door to more, I don't know, but I do know it is a real \nweakness we have.\n  If we had some money, we could secure radiological resources at \nmedical and industrial facilities, we could install mobile and fixed \nradiation detectors at ports and border crossings. We could also use \nadditional funds to modernize the nuclear reactor infrastructure that \nsupports the Navy. This includes developing more efficient reactor \ndesigns that can last 40 years without refueling.\n  These are weaknesses we see in the funding picture and in our bill. \nAs I said, I actually believe it is a good bill when you know the \ncircumstances under which we are functioning.\n  But this isn't just about Energy and Water, and we can't view it in \nisolation. As I said, Energy and Water had a decent allocation, even \nwith the overall budget restrictions. But cuts made\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nto other bills are far more dangerous, and we can't ignore these cuts.\n  I will highlight a few of them. The Subcommittee harmed by the \ncurrent spending caps is responsible for the Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education. The subcommittee received an \nallocation of $3.6 billion below last year. The Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education received cuts. These are \ndraconian, and these programs affect our most vulnerable Americans. \nThat is what the Presidential election is all about right now--the \ndiscontent over our inability to solve some of these problems.\n  There is a $331 million cut to employment and training services for \nyouth, veterans, and the unemployed. There is an $87.8 million cut to \nteen pregnancy prevention programs. There is a $215 million cut to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention--disease control. They are \nseeing diseases that I haven't seen since my childhood, such as \nmeasles, spring up all over the State of California, and we need to do \nthese things to keep our people safe. Vaccinations are important.\n  There has been a $198 million cut to shelter and services for \nunaccompanied immigrant children, a $69 million cut to Federal student \naid programs, and the elimination of a $250 million program to expand \naccess to preschool. Expanding access to preschool is something \neverybody wants for low- and moderate-income 4-year-olds.\n  The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee, on \nthe other hand, did receive an additional $1.9 billion this year. \nHowever, the committee required a $3.4 billion increase just to \nmaintain current services.\n  As a result, the Subcommittee was forced to cut funding for mass \ntransit projects by more than $500 million below last year.\n  Affordable housing assistance is slashed by $834 million, and the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program that I used as the Mayor of \nSan Francisco a long time ago, which could always be counted on, was \nreduced by $100 million.\n  These cuts affected millions of Americans and hurt communities across \nthe country. We should not have to choose between providing rental \nassistance to low-income families and providing transportation options \nso they can get to work.\n  I see the Presiding Officer is nodding. I have about 3 more minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to finish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my friend. I appreciate it.\n  The Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee also received a \nmisleading increase in its allocation. While the Subcommittee received \nan extra $965 million on paper, it actually needed $1.1 billion just to \naccount for last year's credit from the Toyota settlement that is no \nlonger available this year. As a result, the subcommittee was forced to \ncut numerous important programs below last year's levels.\n  They include the U.S. Marshals Service, which was cut by $141 \nmillion; legal representation for immigrant children, reduced by $55 \nmillion; and Federal assistance to State and local law enforcement \nagencies, cut by $139 million.\n  Here is my conclusion. My good friend and colleague Senator Alexander \nis rightly proud of the work he and his staff have put into the Energy \nand Water bill, and, as I said, it is a good bill.\n  I sincerely wish the circumstance we find ourselves in today were \ndifferent. Those of us on this side of the aisle should have a voice in \nwhat happens and how we can solve this problem.\n  So what I plead for is, in these negotiations that are starting, by \nLeader McConnell, to move ahead, let's get it started and let's stop \nthe CRs, let's stop the omnibuses, and let's stop the fights over the \ndebt limit and shutting down the government. Let's go back to an \nappropriations process that this country did well by and that worked.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his forbearance, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7231-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7231-S7233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a previous President of the United States \nonce wrote that if he could add one amendment to the Constitution, it \nwould prohibit the Federal Government from incurring more debt. That \nPresident's name was neither Bush nor Reagan but Jefferson. The 217 \nyears since then have proven three things: The national debt crisis is \ngrowing, it is dangerous, and only the Constitution can compel Congress \nto act. We must act before it is too late.\n  The national debt was 19 percent of gross domestic product when \nThomas Jefferson called for a balanced budget amendment. President \nGeorge Washington told the House of Representatives that the regular \nredemption of the public debt was the most urgent fiscal priority. In \nhis first report on the public credit in 1790, Treasury Secretary \nAlexander Hamilton warned that continuously accruing national debt \ninterest would be a signal ``either of inability, or of ill faith, and \nwill not cease to have an evil influence on public credit.''\n  The commitment to fiscal balance over the next 150 years was so \nstrong that many referred to it as our unwritten fiscal constitution. \nUnfortunately, that commitment did not last. The national debt topped \n40 percent of GDP for the first time in 1934, and 2 years later the \nfirst balanced budget amendment was introduced in Congress. Eighty \nyears ago, Members of Congress began to realize that an unwritten \nconstitution was no longer strong enough to limit the national debt. \nGood intentions are not enough to balance the Nation's checkbook.\n  Senator Millard Tydings, a Maryland Democrat, introduced the first \nbalanced budget amendment to reach the Senate or House floor. The 1947 \nAppropriations Committee report on his proposal, S.J. Res. 61, opened \nwith these words: ``In no other way except by an amendment to the \nConstitution can Congress be compelled to balance its budget in \npeacetime.'' The Judiciary Committee held its first balanced budget \namendment hearing in 1956 on amendments introduced by Senator Harry \nByrd, a Virginia Democrat, and Senator Carl Curtis, a Nebraska \nRepublican. In current dollars, the national debt today is nearly five \ntimes what those distinguished Senators denounced as astronomical and \nstaggering.\n  Here is where the national debt has gone as Congress has failed to \npropose a balanced budget amendment. Let me refer to this chart. As we \ncan see, the national debt as a percentage of GDP is going up the \ncharts today to the highest ever. The national debt was 32 percent of \nGDP when I first introduced a balanced budget amendment in 1979. It \nclimbed to 34 percent of GDP in 1982 when the Senate--but not the \nHouse--passed a BBA; more than 62 percent of GDP in 1997 when we came \nwithin one vote of approving a BBA that I introduced; and 95 percent of \nGDP when the Senate voted on a BBA that I introduced in 2011. Today the \nnational debt stands at 103 percent of GDP, literally swallowing the \neconomy.\n  They say that the more things change, the more they stay the same. As \nthe national debt continues to change in the wrong direction, BBA \nopponents make the same arguments they always have. First, they say the \nnational debt is simply not a problem that needs a solution. The \nevidence, however, is all around us.\n  In a July 2010 policy paper, for example, the Congressional Budget \nOffice outlined what it called the significantly negative consequences \nof our rising national debt and repeated those warnings in its latest \nbudget outlook. Here are the consequences of a rising national debt--\nthis is the Congressional Budget Office in 2015--reduced investment, \nresulting in lower national income and higher interest rates; Federal \nspending on interest payments would rise; less flexibility to address \nfinancial and economic crises; and increased likelihood of a fiscal \ncrisis in the United States.\n  ADM Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nsays this national debt crisis is a serious threat to national \nsecurity--a conclusion echoed by experts from the Brookings Institution \nto the Heritage Foundation--or we can listen to the Government \nAccountability Office, which warned in 2009 that every year since\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\nthat ``the long-term fiscal outlook is unsustainable.''\n  A recent study published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives \nlooked at periods in different countries over the last two centuries \nwhen national debt exceeded 90 percent of GDP for more than 5 years. \nThe authors found that these periods not only lead to ``substantially \nslower'' economic growth but that ``even if such episodes are \noriginally caused by a traumatic event such as a war or financial \ncrisis, they can take on a self-propelling character.''\n  These findings are very important for us today because the national \ndebt has been more than 90 percent of GDP since the recession ended in \n2009. In fact, we are entering the longest period in American history \nwith the national debt above this toxic level. CBO projects exactly \nwhat this study predicts--that the national debt will remain above 100 \npercent of GDP and that GDP will grow at a rate ``notably less'' than \nin the past. Our own actual experience already proves the same thing. \nIn the 6 years since the recession ended, debt has been twice as high \nand GDP has grown at half the rate as during the same period after \nprevious recessions. This really does look like a self-propelling \ncrisis.\n  The second argument by BBA opponents is that even if the national \ndebt is a problem, Congress can solve it by willpower. That willpower \nonce existed, but it is long gone. The Federal budget has been balanced \nin only 7 of the 80 years since a balanced budget amendment was first \nintroduced in Congress and total deficits over those years dwarf total \nsurpluses by 23 to 1.\n  The third argument by balanced budget amendment opponents is that \neven if Congress won't solve the national debt by willpower, it can do \nso by legislation. In 1985 we enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985 when the national debt was 42 percent of \nGDP. We have enacted one law after another as the national debt has \ncontinued to climb. Most recently, we enacted the Budget Control Act of \n2011 when the national debt had swelled to 95 percent of GDP, but it \nfailed, as did all the others. Willpower and legislation have both \nfailed to tackle this crisis.\n  The national debt today stands at nearly $18.2 trillion. In its most \nrecent budget outlook, CBO projects that under current law the national \ndebt will swell to more than $25 trillion in the next decade. GAO \nissued its latest ``Federal Fiscal Outlook'' report in August. Without \nsignificant action by Congress, GAO says, Federal debt as a percentage \nof GDP could in the next 25 years climb to four times its historical \naverage.\n  New data show that the deficit for fiscal year 2015 will likely be \nlower than expected. If the best thing to say about our current fiscal \ncondition is that it could be worse, we are really in trouble. In its \nJune long-term budget outlook, CBO says that after a few years at a \nmore modest level, deficits will once again increase, especially when \ninterest rates start to rise.\n  Since President Obama took office, we have seen both the greatest \nbuildup of debt and the lowest interest rates in history. This is the \nperfect fiscal storm. Even a small rise in interest rates will explode \nthe cost of servicing this massive debt and contribute to higher \ndeficits and greater debt. CBO projects that interest rates will indeed \nrise, and, as a result, ``the government's net interest costs are \nprojected to more than double relative to the size of the economy over \nthe next decade.'' Both CBO and the Concord Coalition anticipate that \nover the next decade, interest costs alone will approach $1 trillion a \nyear--that is with a ``t''--$1 trillion a year.\n  The fourth argument by BBA opponents really amounts to plain old \nscare tactics. They figure that Americans may want a balanced budget \nbut only if their own favorite spending continues. So BBA opponents \nclaim that a BBA will automatically cut this or that program. Not only \nis this a cynical approach to a very serious problem, but it is not \ntrue. A balanced budget amendment will require that Congress finally \nget serious about priorities and decide which spending is the most \nimportant and the most cost-effective. Long-term fiscal responsibility \nis more important than any one spending item in the budget.\n  I introduced my first balanced budget constitutional amendment in \nJune 1979. I said then and I repeat today that a balanced budget \namendment ``requires that Congress think in order of budget \npriorities.'' Nothing short of the Constitution will make that happen.\n  One definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and \nexpecting different results. Neither willpower nor legislation can \ntackle the growing national debt crisis. It has been nearly 70 years \nand more than $15 trillion of debt since the Appropriations Committee \ndeclared in 1947 that only a constitutional amendment can compel \nCongress to balance its budget. That is the only option left.\n  The last gasp of BBA opponents isn't really an argument at all. They \nsay that adopting a balanced budget amendment will not by itself solve \nthe debt crisis. I have introduced 7 and cosponsored 20 balanced budget \namendments since I was first elected. In all this time, during all the \nhearings and floor debates, I have never once heard anyone claim that \nadopting a balanced budget amendment will, by itself, magically make \nthe debt disappear. Of course it won't. Neither did enacting all of \nthose so called budget control acts. Congress will still have to make \nthe decisions to determine whether we continue drowning in debt or \nchart a different course.\n  Congress cannot amend the Constitution by itself. Article V of the \nConstitution provides that constitutional amendments may be proposed by \neither two-thirds of Congress or by a convention called at the request \nof two-thirds of the States. In either case, a proposed amendment does \nnot become part of the Constitution until at least three-fourths or \nthree-quarters of the States ratify it. Congress can do nothing more \nthan propose a balanced budget amendment so that the American people \nmay decide whether they want to add it to their Constitution.\n  Government does not get to set its own rules. The Constitution is the \nlaw that governs government, and it belongs to the American people. It \nis the primary way the American people set rules for how their \ngovernment must operate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to finish \nthese remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Congress has proven, over decades of \nfailure resulting in trillions of dollars of debt, that it will not \nexercise its fiscal authority properly. The American people must be \ngiven a chance to decide whether to make fiscal responsibility \nmandatory. It is the American people who ought to decide this. The only \nway they can is to propose a balanced budget amendment and send it to \nthe States for consideration.\n  I have looked at dozens of national polls since I was first elected \nto the Senate conducted by major polling firms or national news \norganizations. Three-quarters of Americans supported a balanced budget \namendment in 1976 and three-quarters supported it last year. Is it \npossible, however, that all of those polls over all those years are \nactually wrong? The American people might be content with the national \ndebt swallowing the economy. They may not be bothered by being on an \nunsustainable fiscal path. Who knows, they might welcome soaring \nnational debt interest payments crowding out other budget priorities. \nThey might be OK with slower economic growth and a greater threat to \nnational security. The American people might believe, with balanced \nbudget amendment opponents here in Washington, that the national debt \nis no big deal or that Congress can solve it on its own. If so, then \nthe American people will decline to ratify a balanced budget amendment, \nbut the choice has to be theirs, not ours.\n\n  The Peter G. Peterson Foundation also does polling, each month \ncompiling the Fiscal Confidence Index of Americans' opinions about the \nnational debt. The results are both clear and consistent: 71 percent of \nAmericans are concerned about national debt, as seen here--let me just \ndefine it a little bit--71 percent say their concerns about the \nnational debt have increased; 63 percent say addressing the national \ndebt is on the wrong track; 81 percent say addressing the national debt \nshould be\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\namong Congress's top three priorities; 83 percent say Congress should \nspend more time addressing the national debt; 62 percent expect the \nnational debt crisis to get worse in the next few years.\n  Some of my colleagues may believe we have no obligation to handle the \nAmerican people's money responsibly. They might still claim that \nCongress can get its fiscal act together on its own or they may deny \nthat the American people should be able to set the fiscal rules for the \ngovernment they elect, using the Constitution that belongs to them.\n  Those colleagues should remember what the American people think about \nCongress. Disapproval of this institution is 83 percent today, higher \nthan 98 percent of the time since the early 1970s. The percentage of \nAmericans with very little or no confidence at all in Congress is the \nhighest since Gallup started asking in May of 1973.\n  I am continually amazed at the wisdom and foresight of America's \nFounders. Thomas Jefferson was right in 1798 that one of the most \neffective ways of keeping the Federal Government within constitutional \nprinciples is to require a balanced budget. The Appropriations \nCommittee was right in 1947 that Congress will not balance its budget \nunless the Constitution requires it. After seven more decades of \nattempting to tackle the debt by willpower or legislation, the crisis \nis worse than ever.\n  Continued failure is not an option, and there is only one solution. \nWe must act before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7233-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2028, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, a bill \n     making appropriations for energy and water development and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2016, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 \na.m. will be controlled by the majority.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                  National Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate came together in a \nbipartisan way to pass the National Defense Authorization Act \nconference report. This important legislation authorizes vital \nresources for our Nation's troops, our wounded warriors, and their \nfamilies.\n  This NDAA provides for our national security needs and will meet our \ncommitments to our allies. The defense funding bill also includes \nprograms that will directly benefit the West Virginia National Guard, \nincluding our partnership program with Peru and the Drug Interdiction \nand Counter-Drug Program to fight the wave of prescription drug abuse \nthat is all over our States and our State in particular.\n  This bill provides funding for STARBASE--I visited STARBASE just \nrecently--an innovative program that provides hands-on learning \nopportunities for students in science, technology, and mathematics, and \nhelps spur their interest in STEM. They were really excited that day.\n  On Monday when I visited the 167th Air Lift Wing in Martinsburg, I \nenjoyed the opportunity to personally meet and thank our servicemembers \nand learn about the challenges they face. These brave men and women \ndeserve our unified support and should not be subject to the gridlock \nthat has been too common in Washington.\n  Unbelievably to me, though, the President has threatened to veto this \nbipartisan legislation, even though it authorizes the same amount of \nspending for national defense that he asked for in his budget \nsubmission. Just recently the administration authorized tens of \nbillions of dollars for Iran through sanctions relief, including money \nthat will be used admittedly to further destabilize the Middle East. \nNow the President is threatening to veto funding authorization for our \nown troops.\n  We face great and growing threats to our national security. ISIS \ncontinues to advance. Syria's ongoing civil war is creating a flood of \nrefugees in Europe, Russia is increasing its influence in the Middle \nEast, and Iran will gain strength due to the sanctions relief granted \nin the nuclear agreement. It would be a mistake for the President to \nveto this funding for our national defense.\n  As the Washington Post editorialized this weekend, ``American \npresidents rarely veto national defense authorization bills, since they \nare, well, vital to national security.''\n  The editorial continues, ``Refusing to sign this bill would make \nhistory, but not in a good way.''\n  This is not the legacy the President wants to leave behind. He should \nreconsider his position and follow the lead of the 70 Senators who \nvoted yesterday--including 21 Democrats--to put our national security \nbefore politics.\n  The Senate is now considering another bipartisan bill that has \nimportant implications to our national security. The Energy and Water \nappropriations bill funds programs that help us use our energy \nresources in the most efficient way possible.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I saw the bipartisan work \nthat occurred between the chair and the ranking member. Continued \ninnovation in our energy resources, whether it is coal, natural gas or \noil, is absolutely a strategic asset to our national energy \nindependence.\n  The benefit of innovation in our energy sector is reflected in the \nvast reserves of shale gas that are now being produced in West Virginia \nand elsewhere across the country. It was less than a decade ago, when I \ncame to Congress, many of us were worried about a shortage of natural \ngas. Today, natural gas production is surging. In West Virginia alone, \nproduction has increased by over 500 percent in the last decade. It is \nexciting to watch. An energy economy is a jobs economy.\n  Not only does shale gas help us meet our domestic energy needs, we \nhave an opportunity to expand our LNG exports, creating more jobs at \nhome while helping to meet the energy and security needs of our allies \nin Europe and Japan.\n  Innovation and investment in clean coal technologies, not across-the-\nboard regulation, should be our focus. The Energy and Water \nappropriations bill includes $610 million in fossil fuel development. \nThis is a necessary investment in entities such as the National Energy \nand Technology Lab in Morgantown, so that they can use these dollars to \ndevelop the technologies to make coal, oil, and natural gas production \ncleaner and more efficient.\n  I strongly disagree with EPA regulations that require the use of \ntechnology that is not commercially available. That is what we see in \nthese regulations. They increase the cost of energy and they decrease \nthe reliability of electricity grid. The best way to provide that \nenergy and improve our environment is to invest in the technologies \nthat will help us and use those coal reserves in the most efficient way \npossible.\n  This bill also provides important funding for the Appalachian \nRegional Commission. West Virginia is the only State that is completely \nwithin the boundaries of the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the \nARC plays an important role in helping West Virginians meet our \neconomic challenges. The funding provided in this bill can help ARC \npromote rural broadband--something I talk a lot about on the floor of \nthe Senate--and will expand rural health care services and offer \nopportunity to our State's workers.\n  Investments made in the Army Corps of Engineers through this bill \nwill help provide the infrastructure we need to make sure American \nproducts can move to markets across the country and around the world.\n  The Energy and Water appropriations bill impacts every American. It \nwas carefully crafted, robustly debated in committee, and passed the \nfull Appropriations Committee with bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President and my fellow Members of the Senate, the Appropriations\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\nCommittee did its part. We passed all 12 government funding bills for \nthe first time since 2009. Nine of these bills had bipartisan support. \nSo far Democrats have chosen twice to block debate on the Department of \nDefense appropriations. Last week, the Democrats blocked debate on the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. That \nobstruction is the reason the government is continuing to operate on a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Let's get the bills on the floor. Let's debate them, make changes, \nand then vote again. That is what we are supposed to be doing. None of \nus was sent here to pass short-term continuing resolutions and allow \nthe government to operate on autopilot. Let's do our job. That is what \nwe are sent here for. We are here to advocate for our State and \nnational priorities, and this Energy and Water bill reflects those \npriorities. The full Senate should have an opportunity to debate this \nbill, offer amendments to improve it, and pass a bill that will lead to \nenergy security and improve our infrastructure. By contrast, voting to \nfilibuster this and other appropriations bills will make the threat of \na government shutdown more likely.\n  Americans deserve a government that makes wise and strategic \ninvestments to best meet our needs. Endless continuing resolutions are \nnot the most effective way to meet those needs and can prove wasteful \nin dollars and time. I ask my colleagues to allow debate on this \nimportant legislation to move forward and to support investments in our \nenergy and infrastructure priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise reluctantly to acknowledge that I \nam going to vote in opposition to moving to cloture on this Energy and \nWater appropriations bill--reluctant because I have supported every \nsingle movement to go to the appropriations act because that is what \nthe Senate should be doing. However, I will not reluctantly but will \npassionately object for the following reason: included in this energy \nand water report is language that was circuitously placed into the bill \nthat would disadvantage my State of Georgia and show a preference to \nother States that surround it. It is not our job as Members of the \nSenate to circuitously write language into a bill that directs what \npolicy this country may seek to follow.\n  My State, Florida, and Alabama have been in litigation for 30 years \nover what is called the water wars in the ACF and the ACT Basins. There \nhas been litigation and cases have been dismissed from the courts. We \nhave settled law in terms of the disposition and responsibility of the \nCorps of Engineers.\n  It is my responsibility, as a representative of my State, to do what \nis right, but it is also my responsibility to ask you the rhetorical \nquestion as follows: Should any Member of the Senate be able in any way \npossible to circuitously place language into a bill that would \ndisadvantage one State or advantage another without debate or without \ndirection? If we become that type of a body in the Senate, we are no \nlonger the most liberating body in the world; we are the most punitive \nbody in the world.\n  I appreciate the job the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee \nhas done in writing this bill, I appreciate the appropriations that \nbenefit the State of Georgia, but I do not appreciate the use of an \nappropriations bill to direct the actions of the Corps of Engineers to \ndisadvantage my State and advantage another State without debate, \nwithout any degree of direction, and in total conflict with the courts' \ndecisions in the past. So I reluctantly will vote no on moving forward \non cloture until we remove this language from the underlying bill.\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue.\n  Mr. PERDUE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us, the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act of 2015, is an important bill, and I appreciate \nSenator Isakson's leadership in this matter. I hope this bill can be \nconsidered again in the near future but under different circumstances.\n  This bill currently contains language that you just heard that would \nprevent the Army Corps of Engineers from updating the Master Water \nControl Manual for the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River system. By \nblocking updates to the water control manual, this bill would give \nAlabama the power to veto any plan by the Army Corps of Engineers to \nuse Federal projects to accommodate both States' water supply needs.\n  When we look at what is really happening, it should concern every \nMember of this body as well as every person in the United States. For \nthe last 30 years, as the Senator just mentioned, the States of Georgia \nand Alabama have been in litigation about the use of water in the ACT \nRiver system. In instances like this, the court system is the best way \nto resolve these issues between the States, not the body we are in \ntoday. Instead, the senior Senator from Alabama has chosen to insert \nspecific language in this bill to litigate this issue in the Senate \ninstead of the courts. As anyone can imagine, with nearly 30 years of \ncourt cases and 60 years of water rights issues, the line between who \nis right and who is wrong can sometimes get blurry, but the fact is the \nSenate should not be intervening in a dispute between the States. This \nis an issue that should be decided by the courts, and the Senate \ncertainly should not allow one Senator to invalidate progress on a \nmulti-State water issue problem.\n  Several attempts have been made to get the Governors of Alabama, \nGeorgia, and Florida to get together and once and for all solve this \nissue.\n  I want to applaud today Georgia's Governor, Nathan Deal, for his \nrecent attempts to solve this issue and hope that one day we will reach \na resolution to this problem that meets everybody's needs. But for now, \nit seems incredibly shortsighted to force any party in the negotiating \nprocess to give in and to tip the scales in one State's favor.\n  I have had my fair share of negotiations in my career, just as the \nsenior Senator from Georgia has in his business career. I can tell you \nthat forced negotiations never end well for anybody involved. I also \nknow that the citizens of Georgia are not in favor of prolonging this \nissue any further. I know, Senator, that many of our colleagues in \nGeorgia and many of our colleagues here don't like to be forced to \ndecide issues between the States they don't represent.\n  With that, Senator, it appears that this bill incentivizes the State \nof Alabama not to negotiate, causing our colleagues to adjudicate this \nmatter without all the facts.\n  I ask the Senator, can you give us your interpretation of this \nlanguage one last time here? I appreciate the Senator's leadership on \nthis.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator for his leadership. Without \nreservation, the language benefits one State to the detriment of \nanother. It is not the responsibility of the Senate to do so. It is \ninappropriate. I would ask this question of every Member of the Senate: \nIf we became a body of equal representation, two Senators per State, \nthat could secure that they write language into appropriations bills \nthat disadvantages another State, would you want to be a part of that \nbody or would you rather be a part of a body that debates, delegates, \nand then does what is right for the citizens of the United States of \nAmerica and right for those they represent?\n  I appreciate very much the hard work of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee. They have done a good job. We appreciate the priorities \nthat Georgia has gotten. But I don't appreciate a body or the attempt \nto make this body a court of arbitration between somebody with \nseniority or somebody with cash versus somebody without, or somebody \nwith a preference versus somebody without. We need to get back to the \nbusiness of debating and doing what is right for America, not \ndisadvantaging our neighbors or advantaging ourselves over someone \nelse, other than to negotiate what is right for the country and right \nfor the people we represent.\n  I commend the Senator from Georgia and appreciate his wholehearted \nsupport in this. I am going to ask every Member of the Senate to vote \nno on moving forward on the Energy and Water appropriations bill until \nthe language advantaging one State over another is removed.\n  I yield back.\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Mental Health Reform Act of 2015\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am deeply saddened by the terrible \ntragedy that occurred in Roseburg, OR, last week that resulted in the \nloss of nine lives and injured many more. My heart goes out to the \nvictims and their families, who are struggling to understand this \nsenseless act of violence and are shouldering incomprehensible grief. \nRoseburg, Newtown, Aurora, Virginia Tech, the Navy Yard--these mass \nshootings are examples of tragedies that our country has experienced \nfar too often.\n  The common thread that runs through all of these acts of violence is \nuntreated or undertreated severe mental illness. The shootings in \nRoseburg should serve as a wake-up call that it is time--indeed, it is \npast time--for a comprehensive overhaul of America's mental health \nsystem.\n  A serious flaw in our current system is that it is simply far too \ndifficult for families to get help for their adult children who are \nsuffering from severe mental illness. Over the past several months, it \nhas been my privilege to get to know Joe Bruce from Caratunk, ME.\n  Motivated by his own family's tragic experience, Joe has become a \npowerful advocate for mental health reform.\n  Let me share with you and with my other colleagues Joe's tragic \nstory. In 2006, Joe's 24-year old son Will, who had a history of severe \nand persistent mental illness, was discharged from a psychiatric \nhospital and returned home without the benefits of any medication. Will \nhad been advised that without his consent, his parents had no right to \nparticipate in his treatment or to have access to his medical records.\n  Will believed that there was nothing wrong with him and that he was \nnot mentally ill, which can be characteristic of some individuals with \nsevere bipolar disorder or paranoid schizophrenia. Will would not \nconsent to his parents' involvement with his treatment, and because he \nwas an adult, his father Joe and his wife Amy were barred from all \naccess to his treatment or his medical records.\n  Tragically, the fears that Amy and Joe had voiced to Will's doctors \nthat Will would hurt or kill someone came true. On June 20, 2006, Joe \nreturned home to find the body of his wife Amy. His son Will was in a \ndeep state of psychosis and, believing his mother to be involved with \nAl Qaeda, murdered her with a hatchet.\n  Because of that tragedy, Will was committed to the same psychiatric \nhospital, which had previously discharged him, by a criminal court. He \nis now doing well because he is getting the treatment and care he \nshould have had before. As his father says: ``Ironically and horribly, \nWill was only able to get treatment by killing his mother.''\n  Joe also introduced me to a group of families from Maine, who are \npart of a group known as the Families of the 4%, a reference to the \nsegment of our population that suffers from severe mental illness. All \nof them spoke of similar difficulties in getting needed treatment and \ncare for their adult children suffering from severe mental illness.\n  This group of parents was distressed, exhausted, and so worried about \ntheir loved ones. One mother told me that she had made more than 60 \ncalls seeking help for her son, whom she believed was dangerous.\n  Another mother described her son chasing her around the kitchen table \nwith a butcher knife. A few of these families had more uplifting \nstories, because they had finally been able to get needed help for \ntheir children. One mother told me about her son who is currently \nreceiving treatment and is in stable condition after being hospitalized \nmore than 30 times in 10 years and spending time homeless and in jail.\n  Another father told me about his son who had been hospitalized more \nthan a dozen times but is now living in an apartment and able to hold a \npart-time job because he too is finally receiving the care he needs.\n  While millions of Americans suffer from mental illness, only a very \nsmall number engage in unspeakable acts of violence against themselves \nor others. Yet many of the tragedies that we have witnessed in recent \nyears--these mass shootings--might have been prevented had the proper \nresources been in place to support a timely diagnosis, early \nintervention, and effective treatment for those struggling with severe \nmental illness.\n  That is why I have joined with my colleagues, Senator and Dr. Cassidy \nand Senator Murphy, in sponsoring the Mental Health Reform Act of 2015. \nThis bill is patterned on a bill that has been introduced by \nCongressman Tim Murphy, a clinical psychologist in the House of \nRepresentatives. It will make critical reforms to address a lack of \nresources, to enhance coordination, and to develop real solutions to \nimprove outcomes for families dealing with mental illness.\n  My hope is that this most recent tragedy in Oregon will provide an \nimpetus for the Senate to consider our bipartisan bill, which has been \nendorsed by so many mental health groups, including the National \nAlliance on Mental Illness, the American Psychological Association, and \nthe National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems. Passage of this \ncomprehensive, bipartisan legislation would help to jump-start the \nmuch-needed conversation in this country about how to better care for \npeople living with severe mental illness and to help their loved ones.\n  This bill addresses one facet, but a significant and ignored one, of \nthe problem of mass shootings. I will continue to support other \nactions, such as the gun purchase background checks proposed by Senator \nManchin and Senator Toomey. I hope we can come together to pass both \nbills to help lessen the chance that other families will have to endure \nthe loss of a loved one to a mass shooting.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join Senator Cassidy, Senator Murphy, \nand me in cosponsoring this important legislation to strengthen our \nmental health system, to help ensure that others in this country do not \nsuffer, as far too many families have done, because of adult children \nsuffering from severe mental illness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n                 Mental Health and Safe Communities Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know the President is traveling to \nOregon tomorrow. There is a lot of focus, and appropriately so, on the \ntragedy that occurred last Thursday afternoon in Oregon. I want to \nstart out my remarks this morning by offering, again, our deepest \ncondolences and heartfelt prayers to the families and friends who \nsuffered so much in what seems like a senseless act of violence.\n  Perhaps stating the obvious, that it is terrible for our Nation to \nexperience yet another tragedy like this, what I hope is that we don't \nbecome numb to hearing these reports so we end up being frozen into \ninaction or dysfunction but that we actually look for ways to try to \nwork together to try to make some progress to deal with the root causes \nof incidents like this.\n  For the family and friends of those who lost loved ones last week--\nlike so many others who have lost children, their friends, and siblings \nin one of these shootings--we know the emotions are still raw and real. \nSo it is with great deference to those who have suffered this loss that \nI wish to discuss what I believe to be one of the major contributing \nfactors to these seemingly senseless acts of violence that have \noccurred across the country, and I will talk a little bit about some \nlegislation which I have introduced which I think will actually help us \naddress one of those root causes.\n  The legislation I have introduced is called the Mental Health and \nSafe Communities Act. I believe it would bring real change to our \nNation and provide help to those struggling with mental illness. This \nbill would empower families with more options for their loved ones. I \nthink about the mother of Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, and \nhow she knew her son was suffering from mental illness, but basically \nshe didn't have any options other than to let him continue to descend \nand become sicker and sicker or to go to court and seek an involuntary \ncommitment for a temporary period of time.\n  So to make sure that families like Adam Lanza's and like the mother \nof\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nthe Oregon shooter--she said her son seemed to be doing fine as long as \nhe took his medication, but when he quit taking his medication, he \nwould become a real problem because he would get sicker and act out.\n  The legislation I have introduced attempts to strengthen the safety \nof our communities by providing families with more options when it \ncomes to treating people with mental illness and treating them \ndifferent from common criminals.\n  We know the majority of inmates at our jails in America are people \nwith mental illness. They may have committed some petty crime because \nof their mental illness, and frequently, because of their attempts to \nself-medicate with drugs or alcohol, they get in trouble with the law. \nBut rather than just lock them up, wouldn't it be so much better if we \ncould get at the root causes of their mental illness and the reason \nthey show up there in the first place? That is actually the goal of \nsome very innovative programs I will mention in just a moment, but the \ngoal of my bill that I introduced in August is to support families \nbefore it is too late and to provide a path to recovery and healing for \nthe mentally ill.\n  Proactively treating those with mental problems is a vital component \nto reducing the risk of violence in towns and cities across the \ncountry. This bill would help the whole community, including families, \nas I mentioned, and schools. Certainly teachers and administrators at \nschools are privy to information and know things or suspect things that \ncould be very helpful in providing assistance to families and those \nsuffering from mental illness. It would also help law enforcement, \nproviding them the training to spot the warning signs of individuals \nwho could become a danger to themselves and others.\n  Many of the provisions of this legislation are based on policies that \nhave been proven effective in State and local jurisdictions around the \ncountry.\n  Recently, I was in San Antonio--my hometown and where I served as a \ndistrict judge. In August I had an opportunity to visit with those in \nthe San Antonio area who have taken a leading role in coming up with \nnew and innovative ways to approach this issue, including one of the \nleaders of that effort, Sheriff Susan Pamerleau. She championed those \nreforms, made our community safer, and provided families with \nalternatives to an endless cycle of incarceration for people with \nmental illness who don't actually get their symptoms and the cause of \ntheir problems treated.\n  The mental health program in Bexar County, which is the county where \nSan Antonio is located, is now touted as the national standard for how \nto think strategically about those suffering from mental illness in our \ncriminal justice system. The legislation I have introduced will help \ninstitute some of these best practices at the national level.\n  This legislation would empower families who struggle to find help for \ntheir mentally ill loved ones and encourage the development of mental \nhealth awareness programs in schools to help educators identify \nstudents with mental illness and provide them with the resources and \ntreatment they need. It also includes specialized training for those on \nthe frontlines, such as law enforcement. I heard in San Antonio \nrecently that because of the training law enforcement receives, they \nhave been able to reduce, if not almost completely eliminate, the \nviolence that occurs when a police officer arrives at a call and \nencounters someone who is mentally ill. By providing the specialized \ntraining, you can deescalate the violence and allow the officer to \ndirect the person to a place where they can actually get some help.\n  This legislation would also encourage State and local governments to \ncreate pretrial screening and assessment programs to identify mentally \nill offenders, provide need-based treatment, and develop post-release \nsupervision plans so they don't become a danger to themselves and \nothers.\n  This bill also strengthens the current background check system by \nincentivizing information sharing among the States so that law \nenforcement has appropriate information regarding individuals with \nadjudicated mental illness in the criminal justice system. One example \nthat is pretty close to Washington, DC, is the Virginia Tech shooter, \nwho actually had been adjudicated mentally ill, but the State of \nVirginia had not uploaded that information to the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System maintained by the FBI. So when he \npurchased a firearm, it did not show that he was disqualified, as he \nwould have been if that information had been uploaded to the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System. Trying to make it easier for \nthe States to put information into the system is one of the goals of \nthis legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will view this as a commonsense attempt to try \nto make a significant step forward that will help not only those with \nmental illness get the help they need but also equip our Nation's law \nenforcement officers to perform their jobs.\n  Last week, more than 20 mental health organizations sent a letter to \nMembers of the House advocating for mental health reform, calling the \nneed ``urgent'' to ``improve the lives of tens of millions of \nAmericans, their families, and our communities.'' We need to listen to \nthem, and we need to act.\n  I know from reports that some of our Democratic colleagues have said \nthey are going to introduce some gun control legislation that we all \nknow has been tried before and cannot pass this Chamber. What we need \ninstead is a broad consensus to try to get something done that can \nbring people together, and I believe my legislation can do that by \naddressing the root cause of some of these horrific events--again, \nmental illness.\n\n  So instead of calling each other names, as the minority leader did on \nthe floor last week, I would invite our colleagues across the aisle to \ndo something constructive and to work together on this legislation.\n  The Mental Health and Safe Communities Act is a serious proposal and \nwill take important steps toward preventing additional tragedies across \nthe country. I think many of us understand that mental health reform, \ngenerally speaking, is long overdue, and this is an issue many groups \nin the mental health community support.\n  I should point out that there are many other organizations that \nsupport this legislation as well. Just to make my point about this \nbeing consensus legislation, I will mention some of the organizations \nthat are supporting the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act: the \nNational Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the American Correctional Association, the American Jail \nAssociation, the Council of State Governments, the Treatment Advocacy \nCenter, the National Association of Social Workers, and the National \nRifle Association. Madam President, I daresay that you won't find a \ngroup like that coming together on many issues, but on this \nlegislation, on which we worked very closely with them, they have \nactually been able to settle some of their differences and meet each \nother on common ground in a way that I think gives us hope that we can \nactually get some legislation passed and send it to the President. That \nwill actually provide help to people like Adam Lanza's mother or the \nmother of the shooter in Oregon, who had nowhere else to turn, under \nthe current state of the law, in order to get her son to comply with \nhis doctor's orders to take his medication. Thanks to the miracle of \nmodern medical science, there are miraculous medications that can help \npeople suffering from mental illness lead productive and relatively \nnormal lives.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider how we can move this \nconversation forward in a way that results in real, positive change for \nour country--above the polarizing rhetoric and political gamesmanship \nthat tends to characterize too much of what we do here in Washington \nand certainly on this topic.\n  Last week President Obama addressed the Nation after this horrific \nincident in Oregon. I believe his emotions were real, but unfortunately \nhe didn't offer any concrete solutions to the problem. He said, among \nother things, that making our communities safer will require changing \nour laws. He went on to say that Congress needs to put forward such \nlegislation, and that what is I have tried to do.\n  I am pleased that the President indicated his interest and concerns, \nbut the real question is, Will the President\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nwork with us on legislation that actually offers solutions or will it \njust be a matter of grandstanding? Will our Senate colleagues offer \nlegislation that previously has shown it cannot move in the Senate and \nrender us dysfunctional or will they work together in a bipartisan way \nto try to find common ground and real solutions? I think that is the \nquestion.\n  I would ask our colleagues who are offering legislation--sort of \nrelitigating some of these issues on which we haven't been able to find \nconsensus--which of these proposals would have actually gone on to \naddress the root causes of some of these incidents in the past? I think \nthat is a very important question because if you are interested in \ndemagoguing an issue, you can talk about that and offer purported \nsolutions which can't pass and which actually would not have changed \nthe outcome. What I have tried to do is figure a way that--OK, given \nour differences on this issue, how can we find that common ground and \noffer solutions?\n  Through this legislation, we would give families a way to help their \nmentally ill family members. We would help schools appropriately \nidentify and respond to someone with mental illness. We would improve \nthe response of law enforcement and the criminal justice system to make \nsure that mentally ill individuals do not become dangerous to \nthemselves and others. We would work to help the States fix the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System. We would reduce the \nstigma associated with mental illness by protecting due process rights \nof the mentally ill.\n  I was somewhat taken aback and disturbed when I saw a story this \nmorning in Politico: ``Dems ready sweeping new guns bill.'' One of the \nstatements in the article jumped out at me. It says: ``Democratic \nleaders are wary that their rank and file could defect and begin \nsupporting the Cornyn bill.'' So actually, according to this article, \nwhat is occurring is, rather than looking to find consensus or to join \ntogether to support legislation that might actually help solve the \nproblem, some in the Democratic leadership are actively lobbying their \nown Members not to get on legislation or support legislation that might \nactually pass and might actually work. That strikes me as incredibly \ncynical and doesn't demonstrate an interest in actually solving the \nproblem but, rather, political grandstanding.\n  I would encourage all of our colleagues, regardless of where you \nstand on this issue, let's try to figure out a way to move forward. We \nhave a real opportunity to address the common element found in most of \nthese mass shootings, and we don't have any time to waste. We can do \nbetter for the American people and get the Mental Health and Safe \nCommunities Act done.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, following the cloture vote \non the motion to proceed to H.R. 2028 on Thursday, October 8, the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 123, 266, 267, 300, 325 through 328, \n330, 331, and 335; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc \nwithout intervening action or debate; that following disposition of the \nnominations, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nominations; that any statements related to the \nnominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have come to the floor to speak in \nsupport of the fiscal year 2016 Energy and Water appropriations bill. I \nwant to thank the senior Senator from Tennessee for his leadership in \ndeveloping this bill, for doing his part to help the Senate return to a \nregular budgeting process, and I want to urge my colleagues not to \nfilibuster when we vote on it.\n  The Appropriations Committee passed this bill with broad bipartisan \napproval in late May. The final vote in committee was 26-4, with all \nRepublicans and 10 Democratic Senators supporting it. That means close \nto 90 percent of the Appropriations Committee voted to advance this \nbill--a very strong ratio that we should carry over here on the floor, \ninstead of grounding it with demands for more and more spending.\n  There is a lot in here that the Senate should like. My colleague from \nTennessee has developed a good, balanced bill that will provide funding \nand direction to the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, \nand the Bureau of Reclamation. It will allow the Senate to advance our \nNation's energy security, nuclear waste cleanup, flood control, and \ninfrastructure development.\n  We hear a lot of talk about the importance of Federal energy policy \naround here. As the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I certainly agree that energy policy and stewardship of our \npublic lands are worthy of our time and attention. And that is one of \nthe reasons this bill should be allowed to go forward. It will support \nresearch and development for our conventional energy resources, for \nrenewable resources, for nuclear energy, and for many other promising \ntechnologies.\n  It includes a pilot program for the consolidated storage of spent \nnuclear fuel, a step in the right direction after years of stalemate \nthat have placed our Nation's nuclear future in limbo.\n  It focuses on the legacy wastes from the Manhattan Project and \nprovides considerable funding for environmental cleanup at legacy sites \naround the country.\n  It will also uphold our Nation's nuclear security, providing funds \nfor nonproliferation efforts and weapons activities.\n  But that is not all this bill will accomplish.\n  It will also fund the Army Corps of Engineers, whose construction \nprojects and maintenance operations are critical not only for Alaska's \nharbors, but for every port in the country. Dozens of communities in my \nhome State depend on the sea for their livelihoods--it is a source of \nfood, jobs, and income. Without a viable port, many Alaskans cannot \nmaintain their traditional subsistence way of life, so this is \nparticularly vital to our Alaska Native communities.\n  I don't have time to tick through what this bill will do for all 50 \nStates--but I can tell the Senate a little about what it will do for \nAlaska.\n  It will fund general investigations in Craig, Kotzebue, Perryville, \nand St. George.\n  It will provide construction funds for Port Lions and fund the \nContinuing Authorities Program, which allows projects that are needed \nby small communities to take place far quicker than can occur through \nthe usual congressional approval process.\n  Operations and maintenance funds will go towards dredging in \nAnchorage, Homer, Nome, and other cities to ensure their harbors are in \ngood working order and able to handle maritime traffic.\n  This is a good bill. It spends a total of $35.4 billion--which used \nto be a big number around here. It makes important choices and wise \nchoices and funds our priorities.\n  So if you care about the national lab system or university research \nprograms, you should support this bill.\n  If you care about energy innovation and nuclear safety and \nnonproliferation, you should support this bill.\n  If you care about ports, roads, harbors, and other infrastructure all \naround the country, you should support this bill.\n  And if you think the Senate should lead in the Federal budgeting \nprocess--if you are serious about getting that back on track, serious \nabout us playing a role instead of being a bystander--you should \nsupport this bill.\n  Again, I thank the senior Senator from Tennessee for his hard work \nand encourage the Senate to move to full consideration of this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nDemocratic-controlled time, Democratic speakers be allowed to speak for \nup to 3 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nan issue that hits far too close to home for far too many families in \nWashington State and across the country--in Roseburg, OR; in \nBlacksburg, VA; in Newtown, CT; in Seattle, WA, where a student at \nSeattle Pacific University opened fire just over 1 year ago; in \nMarysville, WA, where a teenager killed four students in a high school \ncafeteria before turning the gun on himself; and in so many other \ncommunities, too many to list.\n  Madam President, in the hours and days and weeks after those \nshootings in my State, the community showed incredible resilience and \nstrength. But I can tell you that anyone who has been affected by gun \nviolence understands all too well that all the strength in the world \nwill never erase the pain of the parents who lost a child or the \nstudents who lost friends and teachers.\n  Today I echo the questions I have heard from so many people in \nWashington State: What will it take for this Congress to adopt simple, \ncommonsense reforms? Why would this Congress hesitate at taking even \nthe most basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous \nindividuals? Why do we fail to act when children at school and young \nadults on campus and women in abusive relationships and so many others \nare so vulnerable to the threat of gun violence?\n  I know this is a complex issue, but that doesn't mean we should do \nnothing. It is long past time for us to improve background checks. It \nis long past time for us to end the illegal pipeline of guns that \ncontribute to crime.\n  I think it is also important to note that too often those who commit \nterrible acts of violence needed help and intervention they did not \nget. To be clear, they represent a very small minority of the many \npeople in our country who struggle with mental illness. But when so \nmany lives are truly on the line, we need a comprehensive approach, and \nthat should include strengthening our mental health care system so that \nit is available to anyone who needs it.\n  Madam President, this issue isn't going to go away. I wish it would. \nI wish we never had to have this conversation again. I wish we had \nnever had to hear about the latest child killed, the latest school \nupended. I know we all wish that. Wishing will not make it happen. It \nis time for Congress to listen to the American people and act.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, Congress has failed to protect the \nAmerican people from the tragic gun violence that is plaguing our \nNation. The mass shooting in Roseburg, OR, was the 297th in the United \nStates this year alone. That is more than one mass shooting per day so \nfar this year in our country.\n  In fact, every year more than 30,000 Americans are killed by guns. \nYet the Republicans have blocked any legislation to prevent future \ntragedies. It is past time for us to act. It is time for us to listen \nto the American people, who overwhelmingly support commonsense \nlegislation on guns. Ninety percent of Americans support background \nchecks before someone can buy a gun. Ninety percent of Americans \nsupport background checks before someone can buy a gun--90 percent of \nAmericans.\n  So let's close the loopholes that allow online gun sales and sales at \ngun shows without a background check. Ninety percent of Americans want \nbackground checks. Let's close the loophole that allows already proven \ndomestic abusers to buy guns. That is overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican people. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers \nto buy guns and flood our streets with them. Overwhelmingly, Americans \ndon't want these kinds of illicit sales with no background checks to be \nconducted across our country. Let's close the loophole that allows a \ngun sale before a background check is completed. At least let's \ncomplete it. Let's take our heads out of the sand on the causes of gun \nviolence and how to prevent it.\n\n  We have the power here on the floor of the United States Senate to \npass legislation that pretty much all of America expects us to pass. It \nis time to end the NRA's vise-like control of this Chamber. The NRA \nsays it is the National Rifle Association. Well, our goal should be, on \nthis floor, to say that the NRA stands for ``Not Relevant Anymore'' in \nAmerican politics.\n  We should do this now. There is an epidemic of gun violence in our \ncountry. It is not preordained; it is preventable. I am proud to join \nwith my colleagues in support of these commonsense gun safety measures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I was born in a small rural \ncommunity where deer season was as much a part of fall as football and \nfalling leaves. I was raised in a household where my dad taught us that \nhunting was part of our culture in Missouri. I don't know any of my \ndad's friends, but I certainly know that my father, were he still \nalive, would be shaking his head about the massacres, about school \nshootings--45 school shootings in one year--of innocent children, \ninnocent college students being mowed down. It is horrific and it is \ntragic.\n  The American people want us to respect gun rights, but they want us \nto use common sense. They don't want terrorists to be able to buy a gun \nat a gun show. We should not be selling AK-47s to terrorists at gun \nshows. We should not be allowing someone who is convicted of stalking \nthe ability to buy a gun.\n  That is the only thing we are talking about, the principles of common \nsense that run deep in my State. Close the gun show loophole. Make \nbackground checks more effective in order to keep guns out of those \nhands that should never hold them.\n  No one is trying to do anything other than protect the innocent. No \none is trying to remove a gun from lawful citizens of the United \nStates, but if we do nothing, if we shrug our shoulders and do nothing \nwhen an overwhelming majority of our country want us to try to close \nthese loopholes and make background checks more effective, then we are \npart of the problem. We really need to look in the mirror at the \nbillions we are spending to fight terrorists who are not mowing down \nour citizens, our innocent children sitting in classrooms, and the \nbillions of dollars we are spending to try to make sure illegal \nimmigrants don't come in this country when, among us, we allow \nterrorists to buy guns at gun shows, and we allow convicted stalkers to \nget a weapon. Fifty percent of murder victims in domestic violence have \nbeen stalked.\n  I hope that Americans rise up and call their Congressman, call their \nCongresswoman, call their Senator, and get busy because we have to take \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncalling for commonsense action to keep guns out of the hands of \ndangerous people who should not have guns, including domestic abusers, \nand to close loopholes in existing laws that are now being exploited by \ncriminals who are prohibited by law from possessing guns.\n  Like the Presiding Officer's State, my State is a big hunting State. \nWe are proud of that tradition, so whenever I look at any of these \nproposals, I think: Would this somehow hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer \nstand? Would it do anything to take away the rights of those who hunt, \nthe rights of legal gun owners? That is how I look at each proposal, \nand the proposals we are talking about today would not do that. I \nwouldn't be supporting them if I thought they did.\n  We know that no single policy can prevent every tragedy that has been \ncaused by gun violence, but there is one area--what I call the silent \nvictims--the women and the children who\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\nare killed in their homes every single day due to acts of domestic \nviolence. According to domestic violence experts, more than three women \nper day lose their lives to their partners. More than half of those are \nkilled--are shot--with a gun. This means that thousands of women--\nthousands and thousands of women in the United States--were murdered by \nan intimate partner using a gun between 2001 and 2012 alone. These \ncrimes don't discriminate. They impact people across all backgrounds, \nethnicities, and income levels. They are serious crimes, and the \nnumbers tell the story of the work left to do.\n  I am a former prosecutor. Before I came to the Senate, I spent 8 \nyears running an office of 400 people. We made prosecuting felons in \npossession of guns one of our major priorities, and I am proud of the \nwork we did. I will say that some of the disturbing cases that were \nmurders, that were shootings, did not always involve felons, but they \ninvolved criminals. They involved people who, over a series of crimes, \nhad racked up a number of convictions, maybe in the misdemeanor area, \nmaybe for restraining orders and other things.\n  I remember one case where a woman was shot to death by her boyfriend. \nHe killed her and then killed himself while both of their children were \nstill in the house. It was ultimately his 12-year-old daughter who went \nto the neighbors for help. The worst part of the story: It could have \nbeen prevented. In the 2 years leading up to the murder-suicide, the \npolice had been called at least five times to resolve domestic \ndisputes. Yet somehow this man managed to have a gun in his hands that \nday and kill his girlfriend.\n  Consider the police officer who was called to a domestic scene. The \nguy there had mental health problems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. The man there shot the police officer in the head--\nshot him in the head. I was at that scene, and what I will never forget \nare the three little kids, including the little girl with a blue dress \nwith stars all over it, going down the aisle of that church after being \nin that church a week before for a nativity play with her father. That \nis what we are talking about, and we are very glad that this proposal \nwill be in the package of proposals along with the background check.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am very proud to stand up with my \ncolleagues and say: It is time to act. Enough is enough. Close \nloopholes that are being used by people who are not following the law, \nunfortunately resulting in death and injury to children and families \nacross the country.\n  Like a lot of my colleagues, I grew up in a small rural town in \nNorthern Michigan. My family members are all hunters. We enjoy the \noutdoors and gun ownership. I purchase and own guns myself. That is not \nwhat this is about. My family goes through background checks. We don't \nwant people being able to use loopholes and not to have to follow the \nlaw. So this is simply about making sure that the law makes sense and \nthat we are enforcing it.\n  I also think it is very important to stress the fact that we know \nthere are tremendous mental health needs in this country. In fact, \nSenator Blunt and I offered legislation--the Excellence in Mental \nHealth Act--before this body that was passed as a pilot project to get \nstarted about 18 months ago. If we had the full support of our \nRepublican colleagues in the House and the Senate, we could quickly \nmake comprehensive quality mental health services available all across \nthe country. Instead, because we have not yet--I hope we can get that \nsupport. I would love to see that support. If we had that support, we \nwould have more than eight States that are going to have emergency \nmental health services available, 24-hour services available, so \nfamilies or law enforcement or individuals have a place to take someone \nor someone can go in themselves and ask for help--24-hour psychiatric \nservices available on an emergency basis.\n  That is what is in the Excellence in Mental Health Act. We have begun \nthe process to make sure it is available in these States. It needs to \nbe available in 50 States. We need to make sure comprehensive services \nare available in the community for behavioral health just as we have \nfor federally qualified health centers.\n  We came together on a bipartisan basis to extend funding for \nfederally qualified health centers. We now have a new category called \nfederally qualified behavioral health clinics, and funding will be \navailable to comprehensively provide those services in eight States \nunder our pilot project. It needs to be in 50 States.\n  I welcome colleagues coming to the floor and talking about what we \nneed to do in mental health. We have colleagues on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may ask for 15 more seconds.\n  We have colleagues on both sides of the aisle on bipartisan proposals \non a number of different issues. Let's get that done, too. Let's fully \nfund comprehensive community mental health services. Let's work \ntogether on the other issues. It is time to pass commonsense gun safety \nlaws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today Democrats, from the most moderate \nand conservative Members of our caucus to the most liberal, are united \naround a series of principles. They are principles that are \noverwhelmingly supported by over 90 percent of the American people--\nuniversal background checks. They are principles that are supported, \naccording to Pew, a nonpolitical poll, by 85 percent of gun owners. \nThey will save tens of thousands of lives without impinging on the \nrights of any legitimate gun owner.\n  The gun owners know it. That is why 85 percent of them support it. \nGun owners don't want felons to get guns. Gun owners don't want people \nwho have been convicted of stalking and abuse to get guns. We know \nthat. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to move \non anything. Senator Cornyn--I know Senator Stabenow and Senator Murphy \nand others have done great work on mental health. Senator Cornyn came \nto the floor today and talked about mental health. First, we want to do \nthings on mental health. We should. It is a huge problem. I would like \nto see my good friend from Texas support the money that is needed--not \na pilot program, but the money that is needed.\n  The more important point is this: Doing things on mental health--\nwhich we should--is not a substitute for closing the gun show loophole. \nSome of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are feeling the \nheat, but instead of taking the action they should, supporting closing \nthe gun show loophole, they say let's focus on mental health without \ngiving any good reason why we shouldn't close the gun show loophole. \nLet's do both.\n  Today we are calling on the American people to create a groundswell. \nPresident Obama was exactly correct. The gridlock in Congress on guns--\nwhich befuddles almost all American people in every State, purple, red, \nor blue--is because the overwhelming support of the American people is \nnot translated into action here. We are calling on the American people \nto raise their voices in the next few months. We are calling on the \nAmerican people to write. We are calling on the American people to \ncall. We are calling on the American people to tweet. We are calling on \nthe American people to post on Facebook. We are calling on the American \npeople to march and tell Washington: Enough--enough of these terrible \nshootings that all of us grieve over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let's put the other side on notice. We will get a vote \non this legislation. We will use all the procedural means in our \nability. Once the groundswell occurs and people on both sides of the \naisle have to study the issue, they will have to vote. We will do it \neither toward the end of this term\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\nor early in the next term of this Congress, and we believe we have a \nchance to win. The American people have said enough. A small group in \nthe House and Senate, who are so unrepresentative of the views of their \nconstituents, will not hold things up any longer. That is my belief. I \nhope and pray it becomes a reality.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, democracy doesn't work like this. \nDemocracy doesn't work such that 90 percent of the American public can \nsupport the pretty simple concept that you should not get a gun if you \nare a criminal and have Congress ignore its will. Democracy doesn't \nwork like that.\n  As Senator Schumer said, this is really about making sure the \nAmerican public are engaged at the highest level and are making it \nabsolutely clear that silence in the face of these mass murders, \nsilence in the face of young men and women--predominantly young men \ngetting gunned down in the streets of our cities every day--isn't \nacceptable.\n  We are hopeful that over the course of the next several weeks and \nmonths Congress is going to hear loud and clear that our silence has \neffectively become an endorsement for these murders. I know that is \nhard to hear. But the reality is that when the Nation's most esteemed \ndeliberative body does absolutely nothing in the face of this \nslaughter--we don't even hold one single public hearing--those whose \nminds are becoming unhinged start to think that those in charge have \nquietly endorsed it, because if they didn't, they would be doing \nsomething about it.\n  The outline that we have laid before our colleagues today is \nreasonable, commonsense, and exists side by side along with the \nprotection of the Second Amendment, and we should adopt it as quickly \nas possible. But at the very least, we should get started on a \nconversation about how we can end our silence on this issue.\n  I live every day with the memory of standing before the parents of \nSandy Hook Elementary School on that morning on which 20 first graders \nwere gunned down. I live every day with the thought of a young man, \ndisturbed in his mind, walking in with a military-style assault weapon, \nand in less than 5 minutes, killing every single little boy and girl \nthat he shot. Twenty little boys and girls were shot in under 5 \nminutes. Every single one of them was dead because of the power of that \ngun, because it was being loaded by cartridges of 30 bullets at a time. \nIt is something no hunter needs in order to enjoy his sport or his \npastime.\n  I talked to my first grader this morning as he was heading off to \nschool. I told him that I was coming to talk about keeping guns out of \nthe hands of criminals. He looked at me with this vision of puzzlement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. He didn't understand why it was already the law of the \nland. A 7-year-old had enough common sense to know that criminals \nshould not be able to own guns. As he went off to his first grade \nclassroom--not unlike the first grade classroom that those little boys \nand girls walked into in December of 2012--I was reminded of the fact \nthat if little boys and girls in a quiet town in Connecticut or young \nmen and women in a quiet town in Oregon are not safe, then my son is \nnot safe either. In the face of political opposition, which is real, \nthat is why we are coming together to say: Enough is enough. It is time \nfor us to understand that without a change in the law, the reality on \nthe ground for those who are being affected by this plague, this \nepidemic of gun violence, will not end either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, we are saying today not only enough \nis enough but also: Rise up, America, and demand action from this \nCongress, which for too long has been complicit--in fact, an aider and \nabettor in the mass killings that have taken place at Virginia Tech, \nColumbine, Charleston, Sandy Hook, and now Roseburg.\n  If America rises up, Congress will hear and heed that message, just \nas it would in any public health crisis, and today we face a public \nhealth crisis as real and urgent as a contagion of flu or tuberculosis \nor, yes, Ebola. The same kind of urgency and immediacy in response is \nnecessary--commonsense, sensible measures to fill gaps, close \nloopholes, and expand existing law to keep guns out of the hands of \ndangerous people. One of those principles should be this: no background \ncheck, no gun; no check, no sale.\n  Let us close the gap that permits countless criminals to buy guns \nbecause the background check isn't complete within the required 72 \nhours. One of the 15,729 ineligible purchasers over the last 5 years--\npeople who were barred by law from buying guns--was Dylann Roof in \nCharleston. He used his gun to kill nine people in a church in \nCharleston. He was ineligible to buy a gun, but the background check \nwas not completed within 72 hours.\n  We are igniting and activating a silent majority in America. More \nthan 90 percent of the American people want background checks on every \ngun buyer, along with other commonsense measures, such as a ban on \nillegal trafficking and straw purchases and a mental health initiative \nin school safety. Let us give America its say, and this moment is one \nwe should seize to say: Rise up, America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it wasn't long ago that towns such \nas Columbine, Aurora, Blacksburg, Newtown, and now Roseburg were \nunknown outside their States. But today, these towns have witnessed the \nworst kind of tragedy: mass shootings, bodies torn to pieces, families \nshattered. The common element in each has been an unstable individual \nwho had easy access to deadly weapons.\n  I stood here 2\\1/2\\ years ago to argue for restrictions on the \nmanufacture, transfer, and importation of military-style assault \nweapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. That vote failed.\n  I stood here to argue for universal background checks. It makes sense \nthat there be a process to ensure a firearm isn't purchased by someone \nwho can't legally possess it, such as a felon. Even that bill, \nsupported by the overwhelming majority of the public, failed.\n  Here we are once again, standing on the Senate floor, demanding \naction in the wake of another deadly shooting. As frustrated as I may \nbe, I have not lost hope that the American people will rise up and \nforce their elected representatives to take real action to help stop \nthese senseless murders. I hope they pick up their phones and call \nevery Senator, every Representative, and every Presidential candidate \nand demand to know where they stand.\n  President Obama noted this week that the United States is the only \ncountry--the only country--that so frequently suffers these deadly \nattacks. Let me quote some figures. In 2013, we had 33,636 people \nkilled by guns. In 2011, there were 146 gun deaths in the United \nKingdom and 698 in Canada. In 2012, Australia saw 226 gun deaths. Last \nyear, there were 6 gun deaths in Japan. Our number is 33,636.\n  We cannot let that continue. Gun laws work in other countries, and \nthey can work here too. There are simple actions that Congress can take \nto make a difference. An individual should not be able to buy any \nweapon they want online or at a gun show with no background check. An \nindividual should not be able to purchase weapons and then immediately \nresell them, without background checks, to criminals. An individual who \nhas committed domestic violence should not be able to purchase \nfirearms.\n  These are not drastic changes. In fact, all of these proposals are \nalready law in some States. Congress simply must take some action. The \nlonger we delay, the more innocent people, including children, will be \nkilled in our schools, our office parks, our movie theaters, and our \nstreets.\n  I wish to conclude with a story written by blog writer Glennon Doyle \nMelton. She offers up a powerful tale, and I would like to read a \nportion of it.\n  ``Two weeks ago, my second and fourth grade daughters came home from \nschool and told me that they'd had a code red drill.''\n  She recalled her daughter saying:\n\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\n\n  \n\n       [The drill was] in case someone tries to kill us. We had to \n     all hide in the bathroom together and be really quiet. It was \n     really scary but the teacher said if there was a real man \n     with a gun trying to find us, she'd cover us up and protect \n     us from him. Tommy started crying. I tried to be brave.\n\n  Glennon continues:\n\n       My three-year-old nephew had the same drill in his \n     preschool in Virginia. Three-year-old American babies and \n     teachers--hiding in bathrooms, holding hands, preparing for \n     death. We are saying to teachers: arm yourselves and fight \n     men with assault weapons because we are too cowardly to fight \n     the gun lobby.\n       We are saying to a terrified generation of American \n     children--WE WILL NOT DO WHAT IT TAKES TO PROTECT YOU. WE \n     WILL NOT EVEN TRY. So just be very quiet, hide and wait. Hold \n     your breath. Shhh.\n\n  This is chilling. To hear what our children and grandchildren must \nendure, even in their earliest years. I wish to say to all of us that \nwe must have the courage to stand up and do what it takes to provide \nsome commonsense protection for our constituents and for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise to talk about the topic of \ngun violence. Time and again we have heard calls in this Chamber for \ntougher gun safety laws. We have debated ideas that have ultimately \nfallen short of passage. These were basic reforms that would better \nprotect all Americans, and every time these proposals have failed, more \nof our communities have fallen victim to gun violence. There are more \nand more vigils, more funerals, and more questions about how these \ntragedies keep happening.\n  Today lawmakers in Washington put forward a set of general principles \nto guide us as we work to stop the enormous amount of gun violence and \ngun deaths in our country. These principles include more thorough \nbackground checks, which the vast majority of Americans support. They \ninclude closing the various loopholes that make it so easy for \ncriminals--not law-abiding citizens--to buy guns, and they include \ncracking down on gun trafficking and making it a Federal crime.\n  I have introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Kirk. The bill \ncalled the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking and \nCrime Prevention Act of 2015. It was named after two young girls who \nlost their lives when stray bullets from gang violence killed them.\n  This bill is bipartisan. My main cosponsor is a Republican. Gun \ntrafficking is recognized all around this country as a major source of \nfuel for American gun violence. Our bill would finally make gun \ntrafficking a Federal crime. It would give law enforcement the tools \nthey need to get illegal guns--we are not talking about legal guns--off \nthe streets and prosecute those who make money dealing in trafficked \nweapons.\n  Right now there is no Federal law that prevents someone from loading \ntheir truck in Georgia, driving up I-95, and reselling those guns to \ngang members in New York. These guns go to dangerous criminals. They \nare not going to our law-abiding citizens. They are not going to \nhunters in upstate New York. They are going to gang members in New York \nCity, Chicago, and big cities across this country.\n  We need to make it possible for our law enforcement to do their jobs. \nI have said it over and over again, nothing ever happens in Washington \nuntil regular people stand up and demand action. They want this \nnonsense to stop. They want innocent lives not to be lost because of \ncriminals and the mentally ill who can so easily get access to weapons. \nIt is insane that we cannot do commonsense gun reform that the vast \nmajority of Americans and gun owners actually support.\n  If you, God forbid, are a parent who has lost a child, we need to \nhear your voice. If you are a member of law enforcement, we need to \nhear from you about what has worked and what has not worked. What \nresources do you need for us to help you do your job? If you are a law-\nabiding gun owner, we need to hear your ideas about how to prevent \ncriminals from getting their hands on guns. If your life has been \naffected by gun violence, we need to hear your ideas about how to \nprevent other people from having to live through the horror you have \nlived through.\n  The only way we are going to make our country safer from gun violence \nis through Federal action. Right now, we are stuck with a patch of \nState and local laws which make it very hard for law enforcement to do \ntheir jobs to keep us safe. We urgently need Federal gun safety reform. \nMonth after month, year after year illegal guns tear apart communities \nin New York and across our country.\n  According to the last Federal data, there were 8,539 firearms \nrecovered and traced in my home State in 2013 alone, and of those more \nthan 8,500 guns, nearly 70 percent of them came from out of State.\n  I cannot say this more strongly: We have to make gun trafficking a \nFederal crime. Give law enforcement the tools they need to keep our \ncommunities safe. Stop handing guns over to criminals. We can do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 338\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. This has been a very important program for preserving our outdoor \nspaces and the beauty of our country. It is particularly important to \nmy home State of New Hampshire, where this fund actually comes from \nleasing revenues from oil and gas, and so these are dollars that are \nsupposed to be designated for this purpose since the law was passed in \n1965. I am very disappointed that this body has allowed the LWCS \nauthorization to expire.\n  We have a bipartisan bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Burr, \nSenator Bennet, and myself--the Burr-Bennet-Ayotte bill, which is one \nthat I will seek unanimous consent on in a moment. It has a number of \ncosponsors. This is a very bipartisan bill. Senator Tester, Senator \nShaheen, Senator Alexander, Senator Collins, and Senator King have also \ncosponsored this bill. This bill would permanently reauthorize the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund.\n  We know from a previous vote in the Senate, we have 60 votes for \npermanent reauthorization. People on both sides of the aisle feel very \nstrongly about preserving our great outdoors in this country.\n  In New Hampshire, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been used \non 650 projects, from every aspect of our State--from Sunapee to \nOssipee, to Berlin, to Seabrook, to my home city of Nashua, and the \nMine Falls Park that I run in every day whenever I am home.\n  According to travel officials, 660,000 visitors are expected to \ntravel to New Hampshire this weekend over the Columbus Day holiday. We \nwelcome them, but they are coming to experience the beauty and iconic \nfall foliage of New Hampshire, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nhas given them opportunities to enjoy our great outdoors, whether it is \nhiking, bicycling or hunting, whatever they like to do in the great \noutdoors.\n  Protecting our treasured outdoor spaces is not a partisan issue. We \nshould work together on this issue and extend this important fund. I \nurge this body to immediately take up and pass the reauthorization for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund and to continue to preserve our \ngreat outdoors, this beautiful country, and my beautiful State of New \nHampshire. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped to preserve \nour beauty not only in New Hampshire but across this country and our \nNation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 10, S. 338; I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I want to be very clear about what it is we \nare\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\ntalking about today. We are discussing the expiration of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund's ability to accrue additional revenues to the \nfund and nothing more.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund currently has an unappropriated balance of around $20 \nbillion that can be appropriated in implementing LWCF projects. If you \nassume the current rate of appropriations is roughly $300 million per \nyear, it would take around 60 years before that fund is exhausted.\n  Meanwhile, we have both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and its House counterpart, the House Natural Resources \nCommittee, working on reforms to the LWCF to address some of the issues \nthat are causing a lot of people to be concerned with the LWCF. These \nissues involve, for instance, the maintenance backlog that we have with \nregard to many of our national parks and public lands and also with \nregard to the manner in which the Federal Government acquires new land. \nThis is of concern to many of us, especially those of us who come from \na State like mine where the Federal Government owns nearly 70 percent \nof the land.\n  On that basis, Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I am obviously disappointed that an \nobjection has been rendered by my colleague from Utah, but I will say I \nappreciate his interest in making sure we maintain our public parks and \nlands, and this is certainly an interest that we all share together. It \nis my hope that we reauthorize this program--I know there are some very \nimportant projects that can go forward not only in New Hampshire but \nacross the country--because you can't do anything new unless you \nreauthorize it.\n  I am disappointed that there is an objection, but I am hoping this is \nsomething we can overcome and make sure we can work together and get \nthis reauthorized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, just to clarify. We have two committees, \none in the Senate and one in the House, looking at the possibilities \nfor reforming this program. I am confident we can find agreement on how \nthis program ought to be reformed. That is my goal, and I will continue \nto work toward that end. I want to make sure we have reforms put in \nplace as we reauthorize this.\n  In the meantime, I want to be clear: This doesn't do anything to halt \nthe program as a whole. This just deals with the accrual of revenue to \na fund that has an accumulated unappropriated balance of $20 billion. \nWe certainly have time. This shouldn't be rushed through. We need to \ngive the committees the time they need in order to work out the reforms \nneeded.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I join the Senator from New \nHampshire, Ms. Ayotte. I thank her for her leadership on the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. She has been out front on this, she cares \nabout it, she is effective, and works well with other Members of the \nSenate. My bet is that she will succeed before very long.\n  In 1985 and 1986, at President Reagan's request, I was chairman of \nthe President's Commission on Americans Outdoors. It was our job to \nlook ahead for a generation and try to see what kind of recreational \nfacilities Americans would need in the next generation. Our principal \nrecommendation was that we fully fund the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. It was created in the 1960s and has worked with States, as well \nas through the Federal Government, to create city parks and \nopportunities to enjoy one of those aspects of the American character \nthat makes us exceptional; that is, the great American outdoors.\n  Senator Burr of North Carolina and Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire \nhave been among the most vigorous supporters of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I join with them, and I look forward to their \nsuccess.\n  Now, on another subject, Madam President, in about 15 minutes, the \nfull Senate will have an opportunity to vote on whether we want to \nconsider the Energy and Water Appropriations bill this year. We are \nvoting on the motion to proceed to the bill.\n  I will try to put that in plain English. That means our \nAppropriations Committee, which consists of 30 Members of the Senate, \nhas finished its work on the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. In \nfact, we finished it on May 21. We voted in a bipartisan way, 26 to 4, \nto send it to the floor of the Senate.\n  Senator Feinstein, who is a wonderful partner to work with from \nCalifornia, is the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee. She helped write the bill. I helped write the bill. \nThirty other members of the Appropriations Committee helped write the \nbill. This will be an opportunity for the other 70 Members of the \nSenate to get involved in our first responsibility, which is the Senate \nappropriations process.\n\n  So the question is that a ``yes'' vote means yes we want to debate \nthe bill.\n  As a Member of the Senate, I would like to be involved in the Energy \nand Water appropriations process. I would like to have a say about \nwhere we put our nuclear waste. I would like to have a say about our \nNational Laboratories and what they are doing to create new jobs for \nour country. I would like to have a say about whether we will be first \nor whether we will be in the middle of the pack on supercomputing. I \nwould like to have a say about whether the harbors along our coasts are \ndredged and deepened so that the big ships from the Panama Canal, which \nis being widened, will come to the United States and bring cargo and \njobs here instead of other places. I would like to have a say about \nnuclear weapons. I would like to have a say about whether to move ahead \nwith a new class of submarines.\n  All of that is in this bill. All 30 Senators on the Appropriations \nCommittee have had our say, but the other 70 Senators have not. The way \nthe Senate works is this is the time for Senators to stand up and say \nyes or no. I want to have my say on behalf of my State about national \ndefense and about growth, about jobs, about our country. Why wouldn't a \nSenator want to do that? It is hard for me to understand this.\n  The Democrats are saying: No, we don't even want to talk about it. \nThey are saying: No, we don't want to debate it.\n  That is our job. It is our job to debate it. They say: Well, we have \na difference of opinion over spending. Do my colleagues know how big \nour difference of opinion is? Three percent. This bill that we are \nabout to vote on spends 97 percent as much money as the Democrats want \nto spend. They want to spend 3 percent more. I actually think this is a \npretty good way to appropriate. That means we at least been able to \nsqueeze 3 percent out. And if later on, in a few weeks, we have a way \nof negotiating an agreement that says we will spend 3 percent more, we \ncan add that 3 percent in 24 hours. It would not take long at all. That \nwould be the way to do it.\n  The way we are supposed to do an appropriation is to bring the bill \nto the floor and let all 100 Senators vote on it--not just the 30 who \nare on the Appropriations Committee--and have a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives. They have had their say. Then we send it to \nthe President and he has his say.\n  Now, the President has said he will veto it because it needs to spend \n3 percent more. That is his prerogative under the Constitution. It is \nthe prerogative of the minority Democrats in the Senate to say we will \nuphold the President's veto because we agree with him on spending. But \nwe don't start the process at the beginning and not even allow the full \nSenate to do its appropriations job. We go through the whole process \nand let the President have his say and then we sit down and talk about \nwhat to do.\n  This is a very bad precedent that really insults the Senate. What \nthis means is that if the Republicans are in the minority of the Senate \nin the next Congress and we have a difference of opinion with the \nDemocrats over how much to spend, we won't have an appropriations \nprocess, some might say. They will say: We have a difference of\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nopinion, and since we have 41 Senators, we will just stop the \nappropriations process at the beginning. We won't let the rest of the \nSenate have its say.\n  That is not the way we are supposed to do our job. We are sent here \nto have our say on behalf of the people.\n  Let me give an example or two, if I may. Senator Feinstein and I \nworked very hard on this bill. It provides a total of $35 billion; $1.2 \nbillion more than last year and $668 million below the President's \nbudget request. The bill is consistent with the Federal law that is \ncalled the Budget Control Act. We didn't just make up out of thin air \nhow much to spend. The law tells us how much to spend. That is the law \nof the Senate, which the House and the Senate all voted for, passed, \nand signed, and which governs what we spend. Our friends on the other \nside would like to spend more. That is their prerogative and they can \nvote to spend more. But why would they stop us from having a discussion \nabout spending more?\n  Half the bill is nondefense spending that supports scientific \nresearch and laboratories, harbors, locks, and dams. Half the bill is \ndefense spending. It funds nuclear weapons, life extension programs. It \nmaintains our nuclear weapons stockpile. As I said earlier, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee fully considered it and approved the work that \nSenator Feinstein and I had done, 26 to 4, on a bipartisan basis. \nDefense spending is higher this year, primarily because of an agreement \nwe made a few years ago when we enacted the START treaty to modernize \nour nuclear weapons program. It funds several other important agencies, \nincluding the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and \nthe National Nuclear Administration. It reduces wasteful spending \nbecause of our oversight. Every year, Senator Feinstein and I cut out \nof our budget at least one program that we consider low priority. We \ndid that again this year. And if the Senate would allow us to have the \nbill on the floor and discuss it and vote on it and approve it, we \ncould save $150 million from the U.S. contributions to the \nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France. But, no, we \nare not going to discuss that, say our friends on the other side.\n  The bill helps our economy. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke wrote a good column in the Wall Street Journal earlier this \nweek. He said: Don't count on the Fed alone to make the economy better. \nWe have to do some other things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thought I had until 12:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am sorry. If I may have 30 more seconds to wind up--\nno one told me that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  So I would say to my friends on the other side, if you want to have a \nsay about nuclear waste, about nuclear defense, about National \nLaboratories, about flood control, about waterways, and about locks and \ndams, then vote yes, because that will give you a say and you will be \ndoing your job. Voting no sets a dangerous precedent for the Senate \nthat says we are not interested in doing our job on appropriations.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise as the vice chair of the \nAppropriations Committee to urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion \nto proceed to the Energy and Water appropriations bill.\n  I wish to comment about the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee. \nFirst of all, I have such admiration for him and for his advocacy for \nTennessee, the skilled legislator that he is. He has been an advocate \nfor his State and for the United States of America. He is an \noutstanding chair of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. \nI know he and my colleague, the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, have \nworked very well together.\n  I don't dispute many of the things the Senator said in terms of what \nimpact this would have on the economy. Certainly, if one is the Senator \nfrom Maryland, the Corps of Engineers is part of our economy, \nparticularly because of the role it plays in helping to keep our \nwaterways open and able for the Port of Baltimore to be viable and \naccept the new Panama Canal shipments. We could go through item after \nitem.\n  We need a bipartisan budget agreement. While the Senator says he \nwants to have his say, which I appreciate, we have been trying to get \nbudget negotiations going since May. In the committee I voted to move \nthis bill forward because I wanted to move the process forward. I was \nhoping that the leadership of both bodies would move to a new top line \n302(b) allocation and lift the caps. We need leadership on both sides \nof the aisle and on both sides of the dome. We wanted that five months \nago, yet here we are for yet another parliamentary maneuver that just \npits well intentioned, hard-working people against each other over \nprocess. We need a new top line so we can have a better bottom line for \nour national security and our economic security.\n  I am deeply worried that the trajectory we are on is hollowing out \nour America, that we are hollowing out the much-needed infrastructure \nthat we need, part of which comes from the Army Corps of Engineers, \nwhich includes our waterways.\n  Look at the whole issue of dam safety. Our colleagues in South \nCarolina now are worried about the rivers. The Corps of Engineers is \nworking 36-hour days with Governor Haley to really try to help South \nCarolina. But we need investments in our infrastructure, not only for \ncrisis response. And by the way, of course we are going to stand with \nthe people of South Carolina to help them. We need to be able to cancel \nsequester, and we need to be able to do it for defense and for \nnondefense.\n  In the Energy and Water bill that is before us, the increases are in \nthe defense side. Some of the national security issues have been \noutlined by the Senator from Tennessee. But in the area of nondefense, \nit has just gone up a couple of hundred million dollars--excuse me, $8 \nmillion. The bill is short on infrastructure and it is short on \nresearch funding.\n  Now, I believe we should have a sensible approach to spending. I know \nthat we agree with the budget caps, but these budget caps are placing a \ncap on our national security. They are placing a cap also on our \ncompelling infrastructure needs that every State is crying out for. The \nSenator from Tennessee knows the requests have come his way, along with \nSenator Feinstein.\n  We are also capping innovation. We need to be able to have more \nbreakthroughs, whether it is in life science--we had a wonderful \nhearing yesterday that we both attended regarding the breakthroughs at \nNIH, but we need breakthroughs in energy.\n  We need to maintain our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We need the \nCorps of Engineers to have the resources it needs for flood control, \nwaterways, and harbors. My port depends upon it.\n  We also need adequate funding for the cleanup of uranium enrichment \nplants such as in Portsmouth, OH, where 500 workers will lose their \njobs.\n  We need to stop talking and engaging in parliamentary dueling.\n  My hope is to encourage our leadership to come up with a new budget \ndeal that lifts the caps so that the Senate appropriations committees \ncan get on with their job.\n  I have worked now with our colleague, the full committee chairman, \nSenator Cochran. The Senator from Mississippi, a gentleman of the old \nschool, has done a good, solid job running the committee. As to the \nchairman that we have worked with, we feel we have good relations. But \nit is not how well we get along; it is how much we get done. And the \nway to get it done this year is to be able to lift the budget caps, \ncome up with a sensible agreement with appropriate offices, and then \nlet's let the appropriators do our job.\n  I wish to say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we do look \nforward to working with you, but when all is said and done, we want to \nget more done than we get said.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, we yield back any remaining time on \nour side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we yield back our remaining time.\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, a bill making \n     appropriations for energy and water development and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Mike Crapo, Richard C. \n           Shelby, Richard Burr, Daniel Coats, Ben Sasse, Thom \n           Tillis, Roger F.

The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWyden and Senator Murray be added as cosponsors to S. 2165, a bill \nintroduced earlier today to permanently authorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2165\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2165, which is a permanent extension \nof the Land and Water Conservation Fund; that the bill be read three \ntimes and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this Land and Water Conservation Fund \nhas been around for 40 years. It has $20 billion built up in reserve. \nThe authorization, as it is expired at this point, only changes the \namount of money coming into it.\n  We are still doing the same projects. Literally, this fund has 65 \nyears worth of reserve built into it.\n  What we are trying to find is some way to be able to help protect the \nlands that we already have. We are adding more lands. We are not doing \nmaintenance on the lands. We have an $11 billion maintenance backlog \njust in our national parks.\n  So I do have a concern that we are continuing to add more lands, and \nwe are not taking care of what we have. There is not an immediate \nemergency need for this because the fund continues to operate. We are \njust not adding new dollars into it in the days ahead.\n  But, again, we have about 65 years of reserve currently in it. So we \nare not in a hurry. We do want to be able to get this right, though, on \nhow we actually maintain our lands as well as actually do purchasing or \nState entities do--whatever it may be--so I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, if I could continue, because I am very \ndisappointed that these objections are now proceeding. Just to be \nclear, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been around for 51 \nyears, and this is the first time in the history of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund that it has expired. So I hope that sportsmen, I hope \nthat fishermen, I hope that everybody who loves the outdoors and \nparticipates in the outdoor economy will call their Senators and make \nsure they understand that these are important bills to pass.\n  We don't want to become the holdup Senate where you cannot get the \nExport-Import Bank finally past the finish line, where you cannot get \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund--things that have worked for \ndecades and decades, that are bipartisan, and that the majority of \nMembers on both sides support--and it is about making sure they can get \na vote.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund has supported more than 6 \nmillion jobs nationwide as part of outdoor recreation, and it is \ncredited with over $900 million from, basically, Outer Continental \nShelf drilling. So those gas receipts paid for this open space that \nthen generates more to our economy by having outdoor recreation \nopportunities.\n  So every State, I am sure, will hear from cities, from counties, from \norganizations, and sportsmen who will say: Let's get this bipartisan \nlegislation passed; let's continue our efforts as a conservation \ncountry to invest in the things that will help grow our outdoor \neconomy.\n  I hope my colleague from the other side of the aisle will stop coming \nto the floor and objecting to this. I know there are Members on both \nsides of the aisle who have tried to get this passed. I hope that when \nwe return in a week, we will find a path forward to say that this is a \npriority, that after 51 years of this legislation, we haven't lost our \nmind as it relates to how important outdoor recreation economies are to \nour country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                  Tragedy at Umpqua Community College\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am on the floor of the Senate with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to share a few thoughts about the \ntragedy that has occurred in our home State.\n  One week ago today, a madman turned a quiet fall day in Roseburg, OR, \ninto a day of horror and terror.\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\nWhat occurred on the grounds of Umpqua Community College is an \nunspeakable, senseless innocent tragedy--nine innocent lives cut short.\n  Lucero Alcaraz was just 19 years old. She graduated from Roseburg \nHigh School this past year. She had received scholarships that would \ncover her entire college costs, and she had hopes of becoming a \npediatric nurse working with children.\n  Quinn Cooper, 18 years old, also just graduated from Roseburg High \nSchool. Quinn loved dancing and voice acting. He was just on the verge \nof taking his brown belt test in martial arts.\n  Lucas Eibel, 18 years old, was a third graduate of Roseburg High \nSchool. He was studying chemistry. When he wasn't in school, he played \nsoccer and volunteered at Wildlife Safari animal park and a local \nanimal shelter.\n  Treven Anspach was 20 years old. He was a talented athlete, and he \nworked with the Douglas County Fire District when he wasn't in class. \nHis parents referred to him as the ``perfect son.''\n  Kim Dietz loved the outdoors, her 18-year-old daughter, her two Great \nPyrenees dogs, and she worked as a caretaker at the Pyrenees Vineyard.\n  Jason Johnson was 33 years old. Jason recently turned his life \naround. After completing a 6-month drug rehab program with the \nSalvation Army, he decided to continue his education. As his mother \nsaid, he had ``finally found his path.''\n  Sarena Moore. Sarena was in her third semester at Umpqua Community \nCollege, studying business. She was an active member of the Grants Pass \nSeventh-day Adventist Church and the proud mother of two adult sons.\n  Lawrence Levine was the professor teaching the writing class that was \nassaulted by the gunman. He loved the blues. He loved fly fishing. \nWriting was his passion.\n  Rebecka Carnes. Rebecka graduated just last year from South Umpqua \nHigh School. In this picture she is holding a graduation cap, and the \ngraduation cap says ``the adventure begins.'' She was full of zest for \nthe life to come.\n  These were nine upstanding citizens of the community, nine promising \nlives cut short. Yet even in tragedy we saw in Roseburg examples of \nresilience and heroism. The law enforcement officers, the first \nresponders proceeded to act quickly and to act competently.\n  There were students like Chris Mintz, who was shot five to seven \ntimes seeking to stop the gunman. The sheriff, the county \ncommissioners, the mayor, the city manager all made decisions in a \nflash to respond and to address the unfolding crisis, and they did an \nincredible job, but there is no job that can repair the damage done, \nthe tear in the fabric of the community or the broken hearts of the \nfamilies and the community and all Oregonians. This mass shooting will \nbe seared into our memories.\n  The name Roseburg will be added to a list that includes Charleston, \nNewtown, Aurora, Oak Creek, Virginia Tech, and Columbine. This is a \nlist of communities and schools that no community or school ever wants \nto be on.\n  I was born in Douglas County, in the town of Myrtle Creek. I spent my \nearly childhood there and then in Roseburg. That area is an incredibly \nbeautiful place. It is home to one of the most beautiful rivers in the \nworld, the Umpqua River, and a town that is just the right size, where \neveryone knows each other and everyone helps each other. I am shocked \nwhen I think of the community, that this could happen there.\n  If this can happen in Roseburg, it can happen anywhere in our \ncountry. That is something that becomes evident day after day, week \nafter week. In the course of 2015, there have been 45 shootings in our \nschools across the country, 18 mass murders, or roughly 1 every 2 \nweeks. So we grieve the lives lost at Umpqua Community College in \nRoseburg, and we grieve the lives lost in assaults across the country. \nWe will search our souls to ask ourselves how we might diminish the \nodds of this occurring in another community, and that conversation will \ntake place here in this Chamber in the weeks ahead.\n  I want to close with recognizing that if we can diminish the \nopportunity of a disturbed individual to get hold of a gun and we can \nincrease the opportunity for them to get help, there will be fewer \ntragedies like this.\n  With that, I turn the floor over to my colleague, Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, Senator \nMerkley, a son of Douglas County, and reflect for a few minutes on the \nhorrendous events of the last week. My colleague has eloquently talked \nabout this, and I am grateful for that.\n  Senator Merkley and I will be returning home tomorrow, but I want to \ntalk a little bit about some of what was inspiring last Friday. My \ncolleague and I and our colleague from the House, Congressman DeFazio, \nwent to Mercy Medical Center, and we saw all of the staff. My own sense \nis that there is no way you can truly prepare for something like this. \nYou can go through as many training programs, have as many drills, have \nas many handbooks as anybody can invent, but you are never truly \nprepared for it. When Senator Merkley and I and a colleague from the \nother body, Congressman DeFazio, walked into that mayhem, there were \nprobably 150 staff there, and I said: This is the face of Douglas \nCounty. These are the people--the doctors and the nurses and the \npharmacists and the volunteers--who were there in a time of \nextraordinary stress giving those individuals the very best of care and \nthat little extra touch of Douglas County caring that my colleague \nknows much more about than anyone else here in the Senate.\n  I so appreciated what we saw at Mercy Medical Center because it told \nme that even at a time of such pain and after such carnage, we know \nDouglas County is going to come back. Roseburg is going to come back. \nThe reason we know that is because of what we saw there at Mercy \nMedical Center--all of those committed, wonderful advocates who, \nagainst all odds, came through.\n  There is one other part of Douglas County I want to reflect on \nbecause it says so much about the community. My colleague and I have \ntownhall meetings around the State. We have both been in Douglas \nCounty. I was at a townhall meeting at UCC just a couple of months ago. \nAs I was driving in, all of the log trucks were parked out front \nbecause it is a community that cares a great deal about sensible \nnatural resources policy. We had a spirited town meeting, as most of \nthe town meetings in Douglas County are, because people have strong \nviews, but on that day I saw much of what I saw at the Mercy Medical \nCenter when my colleague and I visited--people who care about their \nfriends and neighbors, who care about a whole host of issues, from the \neconomy to charity to what the Congress is doing, that might actually \nbe relevant to them.\n  I bring this up by way of saying I am so grateful my colleague made \nthe presentation he did so that we understand what a huge loss this has \nbeen, but I also wanted to touch on what I saw with my friend at Mercy \nMedical Center and what I saw at the Umpqua Community College townhall \nmeeting just a couple of months ago. Because at a time of great loss, \nwe can also be inspired by what we saw at that medical center and the \nfriends and neighbors of goodwill coming together to deal with some of \nthe biggest challenges the community and our country face.\n  I look forward to going home with my colleague tomorrow, to once \nagain talk about the challenges that are ahead after Roseburg. We \ntalked a little bit about that on the steps, but I mostly want to say \nthat what we saw last Friday in the middle of tragedy and great stress \nought to send the message to all concerned that Douglas County is going \nto be back. Douglas County is a special place, and as horrendous as \nthese losses were, those are people who embody the best of our State \nand the best of our country.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague and, with his leadership, \nproviding whatever solace we can in the short term and then moving on \nto tackle the community's bigger issues in the days ahead.\n  I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, 3,000 people were \nbrutally killed in this country. The response of our Nation was \noverwhelming. We changed our laws, we increased our intelligence \ncommunity's capacity dramatically, we fought two\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\nwars, and we imposed vigorous inspection regimes at airports and in \nconnection with transportation. We made huge changes in order to see \nthat such a thing did not happen again. Why? Because we love each \nother. We are a compassionate people, and when American lives are \nthreatened, we react. In that case, we reacted in an overwhelming way.\n  In 2014, we lost one American to a potential Ebola epidemic. One life \nwas lost. Even though it was only one life, millions of dollars were \nspent across the country, and our entire health system was mobilized, \nagain, because we love each other and we want to protect each other.\n  Over the last 10 years we have had disasters in this country that \nhave affected our neighbors, most recently in South Carolina. Of \ncourse, the two great disasters of the last decade are Katrina and \nSandy. Again, we responded. In money, $100 billion was allocated for \nrelief from those two storms. Why? Because we love each other and we \ntake care of each other.\n  When we see a problem in this country, particularly a problem that \nthreatens fellow Americans, we act. We do something. When there is a \nrisk to our colleagues and our friends and our families, we address it. \nYet we have one epidemic in this country, one disaster that we are \ndeliberately ignoring. It is an epidemic which takes over 30,000 lives \na year, 30,000 American lives a year, and that is gun-related violence. \nThe breakdown on that 30,000 figure is over 10,000 homicides committed \nwith guns and 20,000 suicides committed with guns.\n  Maine is a gun-owning State. Of any State, I think my State has the \nsecond or third highest percentage of gun owners in the country. Yet we \nhave one of the lowest levels of gun violence. Why is that? I think it \nis because of our deep tradition of respect and care for firearms and \nthe idea that is passed down from generation to generation that \nfirearms are to be treated responsibly and with respect and with an \nunderstanding of their destructive capacity.\n  Thinking about this issue has made me reflect upon what is the proper \nresponse from what level of government. I do not think all problems in \nthis country need to be solved by the Federal Government. I think this \nis one of them. I think there is an important role to be played by \nStates and localities because they can adjust their rules and laws \naccording to the needs in their States. The needs, responsibility, and \nthe importance of this issue in Maine may be different than it is in \nNew Mexico or Texas or Illinois or New York. Therefore, under the \ngenius of our system, the principle responsibility should rest at the \nState and local level. However, I do think there are minimum standards \nthe Federal Government can impose that will enable the States then to \nwork within those standards to meet the requirements that they see are \nmost important for their citizens. This is a true role of federalism.\n  In our Federal Constitution we have the Second Amendment, and I \nrespect and support it. It is a basic part of our governing document, \nbut the Second Amendment, to me, not only imparts rights but \nresponsibilities. Guns are dangerous instrumentalities. Anybody who has \never used one knows that, and there are responsibilities which come \nwith the right to keep and bear arms.\n  Justice Scalia in the Heller decision--where the Court struck down \nthe District of Columbia's total ban essentially on handguns, saying it \noverreached and violated the Second Amendment--was very clear and \nexplicit where he said: The Second Amendment, like all other amendments \nin the Constitution, has limits. Interestingly, specifically he \nmentioned in that opinion--and nobody ever accused Justice Scalia of \nbeing a liberal. Justice Scalia pointed out: Of course you can limit \nthe ability of felons and the dangerously mentally ill to obtain \nhandguns. The government can limit it. And also, the government can \nreasonably place limits on the commercial transaction, the sale and \npurchase of guns.\n  We are here today because of one more in a depressingly familiar \nseries of mass shooting incidents: Columbine, Newtown, and now Oregon. \nAll over the country this is happening in a repetitive way. It is \nimportant to use this occasion to reflect upon the dangers we are \nignoring, the epidemic we are ignoring, but I think we also have to \nrealize that mass shootings, as horrendous as they are, are not the \nbulk of the crimes committed with guns and the deaths dealt by guns in \nthis country; that those are everyday criminals, abusive spouses, and, \nsadly, people taking their own lives. Don't forget that those 30,000 \ndeaths a year of our fellow citizens are not all in mass shooting \nsituations, but they involve many other circumstances.\n  So what is the solution? A friend of mine in Maine coined the term, \nwhich I think aptly applies--in fact, it probably applies in this case \nmore than any other: There is no silver bullet. There may, however, be \nsilver ``buckshot''--a multiplicity of solutions, no single solution. \nNothing we do today in the way of background checks or anything else is \ngoing to solve this problem entirely. We must recognize that. So we \nmust move in a comprehensive way--not only on the Federal level but on \nthe State level as well--not to compromise the Second Amendment, not to \ntake guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens, not to make it \ninherently more difficult for law-abiding citizens to maintain them but \nto put into place commonsense solutions to deal with this epidemic of \ngun violence.\n  The first, of course--and I commend my colleague from Maine for \nemphasizing this today; that is, we have to deal with the failures of \nour mental health system. In all of these mass shooting incidents, it \nappears that the perpetrators had some significant mental health \nissues. We have to deal with that. We have to have a better system that \nfinds people in advance, before they act out their violent fantasies. \nWe have to try to intervene and help those people before violence \noccurs.\n  So mental health has to be a part of this, but it is not the whole \nanswer because people with those kinds of proclivities, whether they \nare violence-prone felons or people with dangerous mental health \nissues, we simply have to keep guns out of their hands.\n  That brings us to the second commonsense solution, which is \nbackground checks, which we already have. We have had them for 15 or 20 \nyears. Some people say: Well, we are worried about background checks \nbecause it will lead to a Federal registry, and they will know who has \nthe guns and then they will come and get them. We have had the \nbackground checks for a number of years. That hasn't happened. In the \nManchin-Toomey bill that we voted on a few years ago, it was a felony \nfor any Federal official to create a registry that would be available \nto the government.\n  The simple, basic, commonsense idea of a background check is to see \nwhether someone is a convicted felon or has demonstrated a dangerous \nmental illness that should disqualify them from having a firearm. That \nis common sense. That has been supported--is supported--by a majority \nof gun owners and by the vast majority of the American people. It was \neven supported by some of the national gun organizations as recently as \n10 or 15 years ago but no longer, for reasons I don't understand.\n  Another part of the package I think will be introduced in the next \nweek or so is to add convicted spousal abusers to the list--which, \nagain, is common sense. I mentioned in Maine we have a very low level \nof gun violence, but much of it involves spouse upon spouse. If we have \na case where someone has been convicted of spousal abuse, to me, again \nit is common sense that they should not be able to obtain a gun.\n  Finally, if we are going to have a system of background checks that \nis nationwide--that, by the way, should be efficient--in this day and \nage, there is no reason it has to take any kind of long period to \ncheck, but if we have such a system, then it doesn't make sense to turn \na blind eye to trafficking and straw purchases, which are essentially \ndesigned to get guns into the hands of people who otherwise couldn't \nbuy them.\n  That is a modest package. To the express language of Justice Scalia, \nit doesn't violate the Second Amendment, and it will not solve the \nwhole problem. Nothing is going to solve the whole problem. We are a \nhuman society, and humans, sadly, are often prone to violence, but it \ncan make a difference. It can make a difference. Remember, we are \ntalking about 30,000 people a year--30,000 people a year.\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\n  The American people send us to address issues, to address problems. \nOn September 11, Congress acted. After Sandy and Katrina, Congress \nacted. During the Ebola crisis, Congress and the American health system \nacted. Why? Because we love each other and we value each other. It \nseems to me this is exactly the same case. We look out across the \ncountry, and one of the problems with this issue is it is slow motion \nand small. Every now and then we have one of these incidents, like we \ndid last week, where a significant number of people are killed in 1 \nday, but the truth is, 10,000 people a year are murdered in the United \nStates--10,000 people a year--not necessarily in a mass shooting. But \n30,000 people a year altogether, if we include suicides, is a small \nAmerican town disappearing every year. If all of these deaths occurred \nin one town or in Iowa or Illinois or Chicago or California, we would \nbe on this. We would find the cause. We would be at least trying to \nprevent it, but because it happens in slow motion in small ways across \nthe country, in small towns and large cities, we are ignoring it.\n  The incident in Oregon gives us an occasion to remind us once again \nof how serious this is and that we have an opportunity to do something \nabout it, not by overreaching, not by violating the Second Amendment, \nnot by impinging on the rights of law-abiding gun owners--of whom we \nhave many in Maine--but simply by the commonsense imposition of a \nnationwide system to be sure that people who are felons or dangerously \nmentally ill can't get guns. I don't understand how anybody can object \nto that goal because I care about my fellow Americans, I love my fellow \nAmericans, and I want to protect them from harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Health Care Excise Tax\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to share my concerns with the \ndevastating impact of the Cadillac tax, enacted as part of the \nAffordable Care Act. The Cadillac tax is a 40-percent excise tax set to \ntake effect in 2018 on employer-sponsored health care plans around the \ncountry. This is precisely why I have authored the only bipartisan \npiece of legislation that would fully repeal this onerous tax. The \nreason I did so is that in Nevada, 1.3 million workers who have \nemployer-sponsored health insurance plans will be hit by this Cadillac \ntax. These are public employees in Carson City. They are service \nindustry workers on the Strip in Las Vegas, small business owners, and \nretirees all across the State. Hardly anyone in Nevada will be shielded \nfrom the devastating effects of this Cadillac tax.\n  What I am most proud of on this piece of legislation is the fact that \nwe have 14 other cosponsors here in the Senate. It is also sponsored \nand supported by 75 other organizations across the country. Some of \nthose organizations include unions, chambers of commerce, small \nbusiness owners, State and local government employees, and retirees, \nand they are all saying the same thing: The Cadillac tax needs to be \nfully repealed or our employees will experience massive changes to \ntheir health care.\n  We are talking about reduced benefits. We are talking about increased \npremiums. We are talking about higher deductibles. Over 33 million \nAmericans who use flexible spending accounts, FSAs, and 13.5 million \nAmericans who use health savings accounts, HSAs, may see these accounts \nvanish in the coming years as companies scramble to avoid the law's 40-\npercent excise tax. HSAs and FSAs are used for things such as hospital \nand maternity services. They are used for dental care, physical \ntherapy, and they are also used for mental health services--something \nwe badly need today. Access to these lifesaving services could all be \ngone for tens of millions of Americans if the Cadillac tax is not fully \nrepealed.\n  I have heard from employers--from big business, to unions, to small \nbusinesses from all over Nevada--who are saying that they will \ninevitably have to eliminate services their workers currently enjoy. \nThey will have to cut certain health care providers out of their \nnetworks.\n  This goes to the heart of the broken promises of ObamaCare; that is, \nif you like your health care, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, \nyou can keep your doctor.\n  Earlier this week, I held a telephone townhall meeting with thousands \nof Nevadans from all walks of life. During the meeting, I asked the \nparticipants on the call ``Should the Cadillac tax be repealed?'' One \nof the best parts about these tele-townhall meetings is that you can do \nthese surveys. We do this weekly. The question this week was ``Should \nthe Cadillac tax be repealed?'' Almost 70 percent of them said ``Yes, \nthe Cadillac tax should be fully repealed.'' Let me repeat that. Almost \n70 percent of Nevadans supported the repealing of the Cadillac tax. \nThey see this as a burdensome and costly tax that will hurt hard-\nworking Nevadans, hard-working Americans.\n  The onerous tax targets Americans who already have high-quality \nhealth care. No one claims that our health care system ever was or is \nperfect. The goal of health reform should be to help those who do not \nhave health care coverage and lower costs for those who already have \ninsurance. This tax does not achieve either one of these goals.\n  It is very rare these days to see this much agreement in Washington. \nOrganized labor, the chamber of commerce, local and State governments, \nand small businesses have all come together with a bipartisan group of \nSenators putting forth a solution to fix a problem affecting so many \nhard-working Americans and their families.\n  Some Members on both sides of the aisle have tried to make this a \npartisan issue for different reasons, but this is not a partisan issue, \nwhich is evident by the fact that the companion legislation to my bill \nin the House enjoys more Democratic cosponsors than Republicans.\n  Fully repealing the Cadillac tax is an opportunity for Republicans \nand Democrats to join forces and work together to repeal a bad tax for \none purpose; that is, to help 151 million workers keep the health care \ninsurance that they like.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, for 20 years one of the biggest billboards \nin America was next to Fenway Park, facing the Massachusetts Turnpike. \nIt had a giant number counter on it.\n  When I was running for the Senate in 2012, I would drive past that \nbillboard sometimes three or four times a day. Each time, I would look \nup at the counter to see how it had changed since the last trip--up 2, \nup 6, up 12. The billboard was from Stop Handgun Violence, and it \nshowed the number of children killed by guns in the United States.\n  When the tragedy happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School, my first \nthought was of the 20 little children who would be added to the count \non that billboard. I thought about how we, the grownups, had failed to \nkeep safe the thousands of children counted there.\n  There are mass shootings, everyday shootings, drive-by shootings, \nrandom shootings, sometimes with big headlines and mostly with no \nheadlines at all.\n  The facts are simple: Eighty-eight Americans die every day from gun \nviolence. Seven of those people are children or teens. That is seven a \nday, every day, young bodies piling up by the thousands year after \nyear. What has happened to us? If seven children were dying every day \nfrom a mysterious virus, our country would pull out all the stops to \nfigure out what had gone wrong and to fix it.\n  Gun violence is an epidemic--an epidemic that kills children, kills \nthem in schools, on playgrounds, and in our neighborhoods. But day \nafter day, month after month, tragedy after tragedy, the Congress has \ndone nothing--nothing. Republicans in the Senate have blocked even the \nsmallest steps to protect our communities and keep our children safe.\n  This must stop now. Today, Senate Democrats are calling on \nRepublicans to join us in supporting three measures\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nto reduce gun violence. First, end the gun show loophole. Everyone gets \na background check. Second, end straw purchases. The one who gets \nchecked has to be the true owner. Third, close holes in the background \ncheck database and stop domestic abusers from purchasing guns, period.\n  Look, let's be frank. These three steps will not be enough to stop \nall handgun violence in our communities, but these are meaningful steps \nin the right direction--steps that huge majorities of Americans \nsupport, steps that are calm and sensible. These three steps are a \ntest--a test for every single Member of Congress. These three steps put \nthe question to everyone in Congress: Whom do you work for? Do you \nrepresent the people who have lost children or sisters or cousins to \ngun violence and who have stood at gravesides and sworn that we will \nmake change? Do you represent the people who don't want their loved \nones to be the next victims? Do you represent the people who want some \nsensible rules about gun safety? Or do you represent the NRA? It is \ntime to make a choice right here in Congress--the American people or \nthe NRA.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I withdraw the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 2028.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators will soon travel to their home \nStates for the State work period. I ask colleagues to consider some \nimportant questions as they meet with constituents and take time to \nreflect.\n  In a time of limited Federal resources and tough choices, is it fair \nto treat localities that cooperate with Federal law enforcement or work \nhard to follow Federal law no better than localities that refuse to \nhelp or actively flout the law? When a deputy sheriff puts her life on \nthe line every day, is it fair to make her live in constant fear of \nbeing sued for simply trying to keep us safe? When felons enter our \ncountry illegally and repeatedly, is it fair to victims and families to \nnot do what we can now to stop them? The answer to all of these \nquestions is no. No, it isn't fair--not to citizens and governments \nthat do the right thing, not to law enforcement officers who risk \neverything for our safety, not to victims and their families.\n\n  The proponents of so-called ``sanctuary cities'' seem to callously \ndisregard how their policies can hurt other people. That is not right. \nThe bill I just filed cloture on this afternoon aims to ensure more \nfairness on this issue.\n  The ideas underpinning the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \nAmericans Act are supported by a great many Americans. The bill is \nsupported by many law enforcement organizations as well. They have had \nsome really positive things to say about it, such as this letter:\n\n       Thank you for introducing the Stop Sanctuary Policies and \n     Protect Americans Act which will empower Federal and local \n     law enforcement officers' cooperative efforts to better \n     protect our communities and our citizens. Your proposal will \n     ensure we do not dishonor the memory of Kate Steinle and the \n     immeasurable grief her family is enduring.\n\n  The letter went on:\n\n       Ms. Steinle was killed in San Francisco by an illegal \n     immigrant who had previously been deported from the United \n     States five times, and had been convicted of seven felonies. \n     The shooter chose to live in San Francisco because he knew it \n     was a sanctuary city that would shield him from Federal \n     immigration law. Tragically, his ``sanctuary'' gambit proved \n     fatal for the Steinle family. Federal officials requested \n     that San Francisco detain the shooter until immigration \n     authorities could pick him up, but San Francisco officials \n     refused to cooperate and released Sanchez three months before \n     Kate's murder. We owe it to Kate and the American citizenry \n     to fix this community safety issue now.\n\n  That is what the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association had to \nsay about the bill that we will be voting on when we get back. Groups \nlike the National Sheriffs' Association and the National Association of \nPolice Organizations have sent letters in support as well.\n  I thank the sponsors of this legislation for all their hard work on \nthis bill. I hope Senators will reflect on the questions I have raised \nover the State work period. The Senate will consider this bill when we \nreconvene.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            60th Anniversary of Crispus Attucks Championship\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, earlier this year I was incredibly \nfortunate to be part of the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a moving \nand meaningful experience in Selma, AL. Fifty years ago, during the \nmarches from Selma to Montgomery, civil rights leaders and everyday \ncitizens of this country put their lives at risk in a passionate, \nnonviolent demonstration for a more equal and more just society. The \npassion and courage for equality reflected in the historic marches in \nSelma were the culmination of decades of struggle shown by men and \nwomen across this country.\n  In my home State of Indiana, a place that takes great pride in high \nschool basketball, it is fitting that 60 years ago the civil rights \nmovement played out on the hardwood of Indiana basketball courts. On \nMarch 19, 1955, at the Butler Fieldhouse, the Flying Tigers of Crispus \nAttucks High School became not only the first all-African-American high \nschool team to win a State championship in Indiana but the first all-\nAfrican-American high school athletic team to win a State championship \nin the United States. Led by future NBA Hall of Famer--and maybe the \nbest basketball player of all time--Oscar Robertson, the Flying Tigers \nfinished their 1955 season with a 30-and-1 record, capped with a 97-to-\n74 victory over Gary Roosevelt High School in the State final.\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\n  Before Crispus Attucks' historic 1955 season, no Indianapolis \nbasketball team had won a State championship in the tournament's 45-\nyear history. Attucks' win was a source of pride, particularly for the \nAfrican-American community.\n  Crispus Attucks High School was founded in 1927 as a segregated high \nschool for Black students. The Indiana High School Athletic Association \ninitially refused to grant Crispus Attucks membership, and the school \ncould not play in the State tournament until 1942. Even then, many of \nthe all-White schools refused to play Crispus Attucks. The Crispus \nAttucks team would often have to travel dozens or even hundreds of \nmiles to find teams willing to play against them. Because the school's \ngym was built too small for home games, every game was an away game for \nthe Flying Tigers.\n  Despite the segregation and racism, Crispus Attucks thrived. African-\nAmerican educators could not teach in White schools, so Crispus Attucks \nattracted an elite African-American community. Nearly every teacher had \neither a doctorate or master's degree. Teachers at Crispus Attucks \nincluded former Tuskegee Airmen and members of the Golden 13, the first \nAfrican-American U.S. Naval officers.\n  One of those teachers was Ray Crowe. A native of Johnson County, IN, \nCrowe became head coach of the basketball team in 1950. He instituted a \nnew fast-paced style of offense and was a coach who cared deeply about \nhis players. Crowe's coaching style brought enormous success to the \nteam.\n  Soon, the same White schools that refused to play Crispus Attucks \nwanted to schedule games with them. Lacking a home court, the team \nwould frequently play at Butler Fieldhouse on the campus of Butler \nUniversity. The Flying Tigers packed the house, regularly attracting \n10,000 fans or more to a high school basketball game. Still the team \nwas not treated fairly. When traveling for games, the players were \nunable to stay at hotels or to eat in restaurants that only served \nWhite people.\n  That wasn't the only challenge the Flying Tigers confronted. They \nalso had to contend with bias from the referees. Coach Crowe used to \ntell the team they had to play against seven people every game--the \nfive players and the two refs. Yet the Flying Tigers kept winning. In \n1954, the team made it all the way to the State semifinals, even with \nseveral key players missing from injuries. The stage was set for the \n1955 season, when a junior forward named Oscar Robertson was ready to \nlead the team. He had some of the most amazing teammates you could ever \nfind.\n  Coach Crowe and the Flying Tigers finished the regular season with \none loss. They breezed through the first four games of the tournament, \nwinning by an average of 28 points per game. Then they faced Muncie \nCentral, another powerhouse basketball program, and the Flying Tigers \nwon by a single point--but all you need to win by is one point. Over \n15,000 fans came to the Butler Fieldhouse to watch Crispus Attucks beat \nNew Albany in the State semifinal and then again to witness history as \nCrispus Attucks defeated another all-African-American team, Gary \nRoosevelt, 97-to-74 to become State champs.\n  The trailblazing players who made it possible included Johnny Mack \nBrown, Bill Brown, Willie Burnley, John Clemons, John Gipson, Bill \nHampton, Willie Merriweather, Sam Milton, Sheddrick Mitchell, Stanford \nPatton, Oscar Robertson, and Bill Scott.\n  It was a crowning achievement. The ``Big O'' Oscar Robertson said:\n\n       I remember that night. They called us Indianapolis Attucks, \n     not Crispus Attucks. . . . To me, that sort of meant we \n     arrived. They just wanted you to win; they didn't care what \n     color you were.\n\n  There was a tradition in Indiana that after every State championship \nthe winning team would climb onto a firetruck and then be taken around \nthe city of Indianapolis for a victory parade. The parade route always \nincluded a stop at Monument Circle for pictures and celebration, \nfollowed by a tour of downtown Indianapolis, but as the firetruck \ncarrying the Flying Tigers approached Monument Circle, it didn't stop, \nand it didn't continue through downtown. Instead, the firetruck brought \nthe players and fans to a park in the city's African-American \nneighborhood.\n  Crispus Attucks, the team that had just made American history, didn't \nreceive the celebration they deserved simply because of the color of \ntheir skin. When Attucks repeated in 1956 and again won the State \nchampionship, the firetruck took the same detour.\n  Change did not come overnight, but the Crispus Attucks basketball \nteam inspired many schools to begin recruiting African-American players \nalong with starting to end their long-held policies of segregation. \nOscar Robertson later said:\n\n       By us winning, it sped up the integration. I truly believe \n     that us winning the state championship brought Indianapolis \n     together.\n\n  In March, members of the Indianapolis-based Family Girls Youth \nMentoring Program honored the seven living members of the 1955 \nchampionship team and the celebration included the traditional victory \ntour through the streets of Indianapolis, an honor that was denied to \nthese players 60 years ago.\n  At this year's Indy 500, the 1955 Crispus Attucks basketball team \nserved as the grand marshals of the Indy 500 Festival Parade. For the \nfirst time in the parade's history, there was a stop at Monument \nCircle, where the Flying Tigers got the celebration they had rightfully \nearned so long ago.\n  Today I am proud to join my friend Congressman Andre Carson in \nhonoring the legacy of the 1955 Crispus Attucks basketball team. As \nIndiana's Senator, on behalf of Hoosiers, I want to recognize the \nCrispus Attucks team not only for their amazing accomplishments on the \ncourt but for the powerful message they always sent throughout the \nState of Indiana and for the pride that is still present in \nIndianapolis today for them and for all their accomplishments and for \nall they mean to us.\n  The members of the 1955 State championship Crispus Attucks basketball \nteam, their coaches, the teachers who taught them, the community that \nsupported them, and the families who loved them--they were an \ninspiration in 1955 to all of us, and they are an inspiration today. \nGod bless all of those young players, God bless Indiana, and God bless \nAmerica.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I graduated from high school in 1952. I was the captain of \nthe high school basketball team. I followed this Crispus Attucks team. \nIt was fantastic, almost every player.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Extraordinary people.\n  Mr. HATCH. They were extraordinary, and they inspired all of us, \nespecially in the way they conducted themselves and carried through. \nWhat a bunch of great athletes they were.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. To my colleague, the leader of the Senate, our \nPresident pro tempore, I am so honored for you to speak of our fine \nyoung men that way. Every citizen of Indiana is grateful. They were an \nextraordinary group. I met them when I was back home. As fine a people \nas they were when they were young, they are even more extraordinary \ncitizens for our State and for our country.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you. They were all winners, I will tell you that.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                        Defend Trade Secrets Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important \nform of intellectual property: trade secrets. I am pleased to be \nparticipating in this colloquy with my friend from Delaware, Senator \nChris Coons.\n  Earlier this year, we introduced the Defend Trade Secrets Act, a bill \nthat will create a harmonized Federal standard for protecting trade \nsecrets. Trade secrets such as customer lists, formulas, and \nmanufacturing processes are an essential form of intellectual property, \nyet trade secrets are the only form of U.S. intellectual property where \nmisuse does not provide the owner with a Federal private right of \naction. Instead, trade secret owners must rely on State courts or \nFederal prosecutors to protect their rights. The multistate procedural \nand jurisdictional issues that arise from such cases are costly and \ncomplicated, and the Department of Justice lacks the resources to \nprosecute many trade secret cases. Those systemic issues put companies\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\nat a great disadvantage since the victims of the trade secret theft \nneed to recover information quickly before it crosses State lines and \nleaves the country.\n  At a time when cyber theft of trade secrets is at an alltime high, \nparticularly as it involves Chinese competitors, it is critically \nimportant that U.S. companies have the ability to protect their trade \nsecrets in Federal court. Senator Coons, trade secret theft has hit \nsome of the nation's best known companies, including Delaware-based \nDuPont and its popular Kevlar synthetic fiber products.\n  I would like to ask how trade secret theft has impacted DuPont.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on \nthis important issue. As the Senator from Utah has mentioned, trade \nsecrets are the only form of intellectual property not protected from \ntheft under Federal civil law, which is particularly striking when one \nconsiders the value of trade secrets to the economy. According to some \nestimates, they are worth $5 trillion for the U.S. economy, on par with \nIP protected by patent. The scope of the loss due to theft or \nmisappropriation is huge, somewhere between $160 and $480 billion \nannually.\n  I submit that there is not a State in the country that has not been \naffected by this problem, and Delaware is no exception. In the 1960s, \nDuPont--one of our signature manufacturing chemistry-based companies--\ninvented Kevlar, a para-aramid fiber with extraordinary strength that \nis also very lightweight. These properties make Kevlar versatile, but \nits best known use is in lifesaving body armor worn by our police \nofficers and the brave men and women in the American Armed Forces. It \nhas saved thousands of lives, including more than 3,000 police officers \nhere in the United States whose lives have been saved by Kevlar vests.\n  About 10 years ago, DuPont developed the next generation of Kevlar, \nwhich is even lighter and better able to withstand penetrating trauma \nfrom a broader range of rifle rounds and IED-generated shrapnel. It \nrepresented a real breakthrough in safety, but it cost millions of \ndollars to develop.\n  Chemically, para-aramid fibers are not that complicated, but the \nfabrication method, the manufacturing technique, which is what gives \nthem their strength and flexibility, is actually incredibly difficult \nto develop and implement. So one day about 6 years ago, a rogue \nemployee of DuPont took the know-how behind DuPont's creation of next-\ngeneration Kevlar and began to work with a rival manufacturing company \nin Korea, using DuPont trade secrets. The potential loss to DuPont \nalone from this one instance of trade secret theft or misappropriation \napproaches $1 billion.\n  So I ask Senator Hatch, if you were a CEO and your employees were \nripping off your trade secrets, your intellectual property, and taking \nit to another country at the cost of $1 billion a pop, would that \naffect your willingness to invest the resources in future R here in \nthe United States that are needed to make similar lifesaving \ntechnological breakthroughs?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, of course it would. I thank Senator Coons. He has \nasked what really is the critical question. If I were a CEO responsible \nto my shareholders, I could not, according to my fiduciary duties, make \nthose investments if rogue employees could just take off and render \nthose investments worthless.\n  Trade secret theft does not just affect manufacturing. I read \nrecently an interesting article in the New Republic titled ``Corn \nWars'' that provides a detailed account of how China is stealing \nproprietary corn seeds from America's farms.\n  Most corn in China is used as a feed for livestock. That was not a \nproblem until the country's middle class acquired an appetite for meat. \nGiven this new demand, China is trying desperately to increase corn \nproduction amidst its water shortage and lack of arable land.\n  That is where our country's intellectual property comes in. Rather \nthan spend the time and resources to develop a hybrid corn seed of its \nown, China would rather steal, literally right out of the ground, \nAmerica's high-performing seeds. Experts from America's top seed \nproducers confirmed that acquiring the technology behind a specially \ndesigned line of seed is equivalent to 5 to 8 years of research and at \nleast $40 million. You better believe the Chinese know the value of the \nseeds they steal and the numerous crimes they are committing while in \nour country.\n  Let me read an excerpt from the New Republic article that details an \nencounter a DuPont Pioneer field manager had with industrial spies from \na Chinese agricultural company:\n\n       It was early May 2011 and Mo [Hailong] and Wang Lei, vice \n     chairman of Kings Nower Seed at the time, were driving roads \n     in Tama County, Iowa, allegedly searching for a DuPont \n     Pioneer test field. But apparently uncertain if he was in the \n     right place or unsure of what kind of seed DuPont Pioneer was \n     testing, Mo had Wang pull to the edge of the field, so they \n     could question a farmer in the midst of spring planting. . . \n     . How had these two men chanced upon his field on the very \n     day he happened to be planting an experimental and top-secret \n     seed under development by DuPont Pioneer?\n       The next day, a DuPont Pioneer field manager spotted the \n     same car. He watched Mo scramble up a ditch bank, and then \n     kneel down in the dirt and begin digging corn seeds out of \n     the ground. When confronted by the field manager, Mo grew \n     flustered and red-faced. . . . But before the field manager \n     could question him further, Mo fled.\n\n  There is no doubt that China and other foreign competitors are \nworking furiously to steal American innovation not just from \nmanufacturing and agriculture but from all sectors of the economy, \nincluding high-tech, life sciences, aeronautics, financial services, \nand the energy sector. That is why Congress must act now to pass the \nbipartisan, bicameral Defend Trade Secrets Act.\n  I ask Senator Coons, what exactly does this bill that you and I are \ncosponsoring do?\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Hatch for the opportunity to go into more \ndetail about this terrific bipartisan, bicameral Defend Trade Secrets \nAct. It is actually relatively simple. It creates a Federal private \nright of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. It uses an \nexisting Federal criminal law, the Economic Espionage Act, to define \ntrade secrets. It draws heavily from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act \nwhich has been enacted by many States to define what is \nmisappropriation.\n  Simply put, our bill harmonizes U.S. law. Each State has a different \ntrade secret law, and they vary in a range of different ways. Not all \nof these differences are major, but they affect in small but real ways \nthe definition of a trade secret, what an owner must do to keep a trade \nsecret a secret, what constitutes misappropriation, and what damages \nare available.\n  So our Defend Trade Secrets Act creates a single, national baseline \nor a minimum level of protection and gives trade secret owners access \nto both a uniform national law and our excellent Federal courts, which \nprovide nationwide service of process and execution of judgments. It is \nimportant to note that this bill does not preempt State law because \nStates are free to add further protections on top of what is in this \nbill. The proposed legislation does one more thing, and trade secret \nowners tell us this is a critical component of the law not available in \nStates. It creates an ex parte seizure ability. Trade secrets are \ndifferent from other forms of intellectual property because they are \nprotected under the law only if they remain a secret. Once the public \nlearns of a trade secret, even if it does so wrongfully, the trade \nsecret loses its legal protection. So this bill provides a limited \nright of action for the owner of a trade secret to go to court ex parte \nand get it back before the misappropriator, the thief of the trade \nsecret, has a chance to share it with a competitor or the world, thus \nexposing it.\n  This is a commonsense idea to help address a very serious problem, \nbut when talking about Federal private rights of action and ex parte \ninjunctive relief, we had to be very careful to avoid any unintended \nconsequences. So, Senator Hatch, would you address how you took \nconcerns about unintended consequences into account as we worked \ntogether to draft this bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. I want to thank Senator Coons for that helpful \noverview. As a Republican, I was initially cautious when he approached \nme about expanding Federal civil law to create a new private right of \naction for trade secret theft. After all, some have suggested that \nState law is sufficient, but\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nafter consulting with many in the business community, I was convinced \nthat creating a Federal trade secrets law is the right approach.\n  Soon after its introduction, the Heritage Foundation confirmed the \nneed for Federal legislation. Mr. Alden Abbott from the Heritage \nFoundation writes:\n\n       The lack of a federal civil remedy for victims of trade \n     secret theft precludes owners of trade secrets from \n     vindicating their rights under certain circumstances. \n     Enjoining and sanctioning trade secret thieves who cross \n     state lines is often difficult. . . . [A] federal civil \n     statutory remedy would make Federal tribunals instantly \n     available to aggrieved businesses that seek injunctions, \n     which is particularly important when time is of the essence \n     due to flight risks.\n\n  Another problem we faced was ensuring that the ex parte seizure \nauthority could not be used abusively or for anticompetitive purposes.\n  When we began the drafting process last Congress, we started from \nscratch and asked for input from all interested stakeholders, \nespecially in regard to the ex parte provision. We received many \nhelpful suggestions and included them in the bill. That is correct, \nisn't it, Senator Coons?\n  Mr. COONS. Yes, it is, I say to Senator Hatch. After all that work \ntogether, all that consultation, when we introduced this bill last \nCongress, we wanted to make sure the ex parte provision couldn't be \nused for abuse, so we required that the party seeking ex parte review \nmust make a rigorous showing that they owned the trade secret, that the \ntrade secret had been stolen, and that third parties would not be \nharmed if an ex parte order were granted. We also included damages for \nwrongful seizure, including attorneys' fees. And with that whole \ncombination of important measures to ensure that the ex parte seizure \ncapabilities under the statute are not misused, I think we achieved \nreal consensus at that time. Isn't that right, Senator Hatch?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right, I say to Senator Coons.\n  As we prepared to reintroduce our bill in this Congress, we were \nfortunate to join forces with Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona. He was \ninvaluable in fine-tuning the ex parte seizure language.\n  Because of Senator Flake's good work, I believe the ex parte \nprovisions are where they need to be--strong, fair, and not susceptible \nto abuse.\n  Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. COONS. Yes, I would, thanks in no small part to you, I say to \nSenator Hatch, and to Senator Flake, who insisted both last Congress \nand this Congress that we put everything on the table and invite all \nstakeholders to come forward and share their concerns. We worked \ntogether, we did that, and we found an incredible consensus.\n  In addition to talking with industry, we have gone to think tanks and \nacademic institutions about this bill. Some people with whom we have \nspoken raised concerns that our bill, as previously drafted, could harm \nemployee mobility.\n  So, Senator Hatch, I don't want to restrict employee mobility, and I \ndon't think you want to either; is that right?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right, I say to Senator Coons. I never thought our \nbill harmed employee mobility. But when I heard these concerns, I \nwanted to make sure that we addressed this particular issue. So we \nincluded language in the bill this Congress that states explicitly that \na person cannot be prevented from accepting an offer of employment \nbecause of his or her prior exposure to trade secrets.\n  I think we have struck the right balance with this bill. I am not \naware of any stakeholder opposition to this bill. Those who operate \nbusinesses in the real world and have to protect their trade secrets on \na regular basis are strong supporters of the Defend Trade Secrets Act.\n  The list of companies and associations that have endorsed the act is \ndiverse and impressive. Let me read the names of some of the businesses \nand organizations that support this bill: Adobe, AdvaMed, American Bar \nAssociation Section of Intellectual Property Law, American Intellectual \nProperty Law Association, Association of Global Automakers, \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, Boeing Company, Boston Scientific, \nBSA-The Software Alliance, Caterpillar, Corning, DuPont, Eli Lilly and \nCompany, General Electric, Honda, IBM, Illinois Tool Works, Information \nTechnology Industry Council, Intel, International Fragrance Association \nof North America, Johnson & Johnson, Medical Device Manufacturers \nAssociation, Medtronic, Michelin North America, Micron, Microsoft, \nNational Alliance for Jobs and Innovation, National Association of \nManufacturers, New England Council, Nike, Pfizer, Philips, Intellectual \nProperty Owners Association, Procter & Gamble, Semiconductor Industry \nAssociation, SAS, Software & Information Industry Association, U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, and United Technologies Corporation. And let me \nmention just one more, but there are others: 3M.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support from these organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                                  October 5, 2015.\n     Re S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2015\n\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: I write to \n     express the views of the American Bar Association Section of \n     Intellectual Property Law on S. 1890, the ``Defend Trade \n     Secrets Act of 2015.'' These views have not been submitted to \n     or approved by the ABA House of Delegates or Board of \n     Governors, and should not be considered to be views of the \n     Association.\n       There is no generally applicable federal private cause of \n     action whereby an owner of a trade secret can seek redress \n     for misappropriation of a trade secret. Relief must be sought \n     under state law, and most states and the District of Columbia \n     have in effect some version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act \n     (UTSA).\n       Congress recognized the need for federal protection of \n     trade secrets when it enacted the Economic Espionage Act of \n     1996. That law authorizes criminal penalties of imprisonment \n     for up to 15 years and a fine of not more than $10,000,000 \n     for the theft of trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign \n     government or other foreign interest. Lesser penalties are \n     provided for misappropriation not benefiting foreign \n     interests but which relate to products in interstate or \n     foreign commerce. The Attorney General of the United States \n     has the authority to seek injunctive relief against the theft \n     of trade secrets, but the Act does not contemplate a private \n     cause of action by the owners of those trade secrets. The \n     Section of Intellectual Property Law supports establishment \n     of such a cause of action, and urges the enactment of S. 1890 \n     for this purpose.\n       Currently in the United States, trade secrets are protected \n     under an un-harmonized patchwork of trade secret laws that is \n     ill-equipped to provide an effective civil remedy for \n     companies whose trade secrets are stolen. Not all states have \n     adopted the UTSA, and many differ in the interpretation and \n     implementation of existing laws. For instance, many states \n     define protectable trade secrets differently and also have \n     different requirements for the maintenance of claims for \n     trade secret misappropriation. To give but two examples, some \n     states have found a novelty requirement for information to be \n     considered a trade secret, and some are more protective than \n     others of customer lists.\n       States have differing statutes of limitations for trade \n     secret claims, and there are also significant differences in \n     the availability of monetary relief. Many states have not \n     enacted Section 8 of the UTSA, which calls upon each state to \n     construe and apply the law to achieve uniformity among \n     states. Moreover, victims of trade secret theft can face \n     lengthy and costly procedural obstacles in obtaining evidence \n     when the misappropriator flees to another state or country or \n     transfers evidence outside the state.\n       S. 1890 is the product of several years of congressional \n     consideration and development. The Section of Intellectual \n     Property Law has followed these developments and, in doing \n     so, has identified essential components that should be \n     included in a bill to establish a federal private cause of \n     action for misappropriation a of a trade secret. These \n     components include:\n       a definition of trade secret that is clear and effective \n     and not unduly restrictive or overly technical;\n       a clear delineation of the requirements for a federal cause \n     of action;\n       the availability of remedies that are comparable to those \n     available under the UTSA, including provisions providing for \n     injunctive relief and monetary relief in the form of \n     royalties, disgorgement of the proceeds of unjust enrichment, \n     and exemplary damages;\n       provisions for seizure orders that adequately limit the \n     circumstances in which they may be issued and executed and \n     that provide for the custody, security, and access to seized \n     property; and\n       confirmation that the bill's enactment will not preempt \n     state trade secret laws.\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\n       Because S. 1890 contains these essential components, the \n     Section of Intellectual Property Law supports its enactment.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                            Theodore H.

Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Coons,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Flake,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch, Senator Coons, and Senator Flake: The \n     undersigned companies and organizations write to express our \n     support for the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2015. We \n     appreciate your leadership on this issue.\n       The Defend Trade Secrets Act will create a harmonized, \n     uniform standard and system for companies to protect their \n     trade secrets. Your bipartisan legislation will establish a \n     strong standard for trade secret protection.\n       Trade secrets are an essential form of intellectual \n     property. Trade secrets include information as broad-ranging \n     as manufacturing processes, product development, industrial \n     techniques, formulas, and customer lists. The protection of \n     this form of intellectual property is critical to driving the \n     innovation and creativity at the heart of the American \n     economy. Companies in America, however, are increasingly the \n     targets of sophisticated efforts to steal proprietary \n     information, harming our global competitiveness.\n       Existing state trade secret laws are inadequate to address \n     the interstate and international nature of trade secret theft \n     today. Federal law protects trade secrets through the \n     Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (``EEA''), which provides \n     criminal sanctions for trade secret misappropriation. While \n     the EEA is a critical tool for law enforcement to protect the \n     clear theft of our intellectual property, U.S. trade secret \n     owners also need access to a federal civil remedy and the \n     full spectrum of legal options available to owners of other \n     forms of intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, \n     and copyrights.\n       The Defend Trade Secrets Act will create a federal remedy \n     that will provide a consistent, harmonized legal framework \n     and help avoid the commercial injury and loss of employment \n     that can occur when trade secrets are stolen. We are proud to \n     support it.\n           Sincerely,\n       Association of Global Automakers, Inc., Biotechnology \n     Industry Organization (BIO), The Boeing Company, Boston \n     Scientific, BSA/The Software Alliance (BSA), Caterpillar \n     Inc., Corning Incorporated, Eli Lilly and Company, General \n     Electric, Honda, IBM, Illinois Tool Works Inc., Information \n     Technology Industry Council (ITI), Intel, International \n     Fragrance Association, North America.\n       Johnson & Johnson, Medical Device Manufacturers Association \n     (MDMA), Medtronic, Micron, Microsoft, National Alliance for \n     Jobs and Innovation (NAJI), National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), The New England Council, NIKE, Pfizer, \n     The Procter & Gamble Company, Siemens Corporation, Software & \n     Information Industry Association (SIIA), U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, United Technologies Corporation, 3M.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Semiconductor\n\n\n                                         Industry Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2015.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chris Coons,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Doug Collins,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jerry Nadler,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch, Senator Coons, Congressman Collins, and \n     Congressman Nadler: On behalf of the Semiconductor Industry \n     Association (SIA), I am writing to express our support for \n     the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2015 (S. 1890; H.R. 3326).\n       The U.S. semiconductor industry supports the strong \n     protection of all forms of intellectual property, including \n     trade secrets. Our industry invests 18 percent of revenue on \n     average on research and development--the highest of any U.S. \n     industry. Protecting the valuable intellectual property that \n     results from this significant investment is critical to our \n     industry's continued success.\n       In the semiconductor industry, trade secrets include \n     essential intellectual property such as manufacturing \n     processes and techniques, circuit designs, software source \n     code, and business strategies and customer lists. The ability \n     to protect these types of trade secrets has contributed to \n     advances in semiconductor design and manufacturing that have \n     helped enable technological advancements in sectors \n     throughout the economy.\n       Unfortunately, existing laws are inadequate to address the \n     theft of trade secrets in today's environment. Federal law \n     currently provides criminal sanctions for trade secret \n     misappropriation, but owners of trade secrets currently lack \n     a federal civil remedy for the theft of their trade secrets. \n     State laws provide a civil remedy, but the state courts lack \n     the authority to act effectively against trade secret theft \n     that crosses state and national borders.\n       The Defend Trade Secrets Act would strengthen the \n     protection of trade secrets by providing for a federal civil \n     cause of action. The bills would provide a consistent, \n     harmonized legal framework and help avoid the commercial \n     injury, diminished competitiveness, and loss of employment \n     that can occur when trade secrets are stolen.\n       We appreciate your leadership in introducing this \n     bipartisan legislation that will strengthen U.S. \n     competitiveness and innovation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Neuffer,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask Senator Coons, don't you think it is time that \nCongress acted on trade secret theft?\n  Mr. COONS. Absolutely, Senator Hatch, I do. I think when you talk \nabout an important issue such as trade secret theft, which poses such a \ngreat threat to American innovation, economic growth, and \ncompetitiveness, it really is past time that we act on this issue.\n  This bill is truly bipartisan. I was the lead sponsor in the last \nCongress, and you are the lead sponsor in this Congress. Along the way \nwe have worked closely together and undertaken an inclusive and \niterative process to make sure we have heard from all stakeholder \nperspectives so that we have legislation that creates winners only, not \nwinners and losers.\n  Senator Hatch, it has been an honor to work with you on this. You \nhave been a big part of the reason we were able to undertake such a \nsuccessful and constructive process.\n  I would ask, Senator Hatch, in your view, has this process now \nproduced a bill that is ready to move in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, on which we both serve?\n  Mr. HATCH. First, I thank you for your work on this bill, Senator \nCoons. You have been a great partner in advancing this bill.\n  I agree with you that the Defend Trade Secrets Act is ready to move--\nnot just through the Senate Judiciary Committee but also on the Senate \nfloor. In fact, I think this is the type of bill that could move by \nunanimous consent.\n  At the same time, we are not closing the door or turning a deaf ear \nto anyone who has thoughts on this legislation. Let me say, if my of my \ncolleagues have concerns or questions about the bill, come talk to me \nor Senator Coons. Now is the time to resolve your concerns, and we will \nresolve them.\n  If you talk to any of the companies that were initially on the \nfringes and that are now supporters of the bill, I think they will \nagree that you and I are willing to address all legitimate concerns. So \nwork with us.\n  I am pleased with the momentum we have already seen on this bill \nthrough industry support and in the Senate. One way that is happening \nis that Senators on both sides of the aisle want to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators James Risch, \nMike Crapo, and Roy Blunt be added as cosponsors to the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act, S. 1890.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am pleased with the support we have already seen and \nencourage many more of my colleagues to support and help us pass this \nbill. Help us make this happen. It is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                 Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, over the past several months, law \nenforcement officers across our country have been shot, shot at, and \nkilled without provocation, too often simply because they wear a badge. \nViolent crime and murders have increased across the country at almost \nalarming rates in some areas. Drug use and overdoses are occurring and \ndramatically increasing. It is against this backdrop that we are \nconsidering a bill, or will be, to cut prison sentences for drug \ntraffickers\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\nand even other violent criminals, including those currently in Federal \nprisons.\n\n  So we need to be asking about this carefully and with real caution, \nbecause as a prosecutor for a number of years, I know there are reasons \nwe have people in jail. One is that it is just desserts. When somebody \nassaults another person, breaks into their house and robs them, uses \nweapons to rob a person of a thing of value, steals their automobiles, \nmurders, rapes, and those kinds of things, they have to have a certain \npunishment or there is no real justice in the world. Just desserts is a \nlegitimate reason to have punishment. It is not all economics. It is \nnot all about whether they might or might not commit another crime. If \nyou do a serious crime, you should do some time for it.\n  Another one is incapacitation. This is too little appreciated, but \nwhen you take a person who is committing crimes--and many of them \ncommit many crimes--a study in California of their State prison system \nshowed there was a huge number of those criminals who admitted \ncommitting as many as 170 crimes a year. We say that is not possible, \nbut people would break into two or three cars a night. They would break \ninto businesses, break into Coke machines, break into other things and \ncause all kinds of issues, such as lost time from work, costs to \nrepair, disrupting lives, making people change the very nature of their \nbusiness affairs because they are afraid of being robbed or \nburglarized. So those are things that occur.\n  Rehabilitation is a factor. The original idea was that in prison--we \ncalled it a penitentiary--where people do penance and hopefully they \ntry to change their lives.\n  So I would just point out that those are some of the things we need \nto be aware of when we are talking about sentencing and what is \nappropriate, particularly in a time of rising crime.\n  People want Congress to represent their best interests and to protect \nthem--people who do the right thing. They want their children to be \nable to play in the streets, walk around the block, see their friends, \nand not be afraid of some drug dealer or some gang member. Too often \nthat is not possible in America. It got better, but it is getting \nworse, and we need to be aware of that as we consider legislation to \nimprove our criminal justice system.\n  According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the amount of \nheroin seized at the southwest border has increased nearly 300 percent \nfrom 2008 to 2013, and I suspect the numbers are still going up. Heroin \noverdose deaths have increased 45 percent. That is huge. We went \nthrough a period of decline in all of this. It took 20 years. I was \nthere. I worked with the Coalition for a Drug-Free Mobile, the \nPartnership For Youth. They volunteered hours and hours--teachers, \nschool systems, gave their time and effort. We went from a period when \n50 percent of high school seniors in 1980, according to a University of \nMichigan study, admitted to using an illegal drug, to less than 25 \npercent. It was cut by half. How many young people's lives stayed on \ntrack? How many people's lives were not led astray and destroyed by \ndrug addiction as a result of that significant decline in drug use?\n  I think it needs to be said that the President should never have said \nsmoking marijuana is like smoking cigarettes: Oh, I wish I hadn't done \nit. That is the kind of message people hear. Now we have States \nlegalizing it, and they are already talking about decriminalizing it. \nIt is a mistake. We have seen that experiment before. Lives are at \nstake.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration called me recently and told me \nthat 120 people a day are dying of a drug overdose in America. How many \nof them have serious brain injuries as a result of those overdoses? Our \nPresiding Officer, Dr. Cassidy, has been around emergency rooms. How \nmany people are taken to emergency rooms and at what great cost to our \ncommunities? How many lives are disrupted? How many children are in \nbroken homes? How many people had to leave their home because one \nspouse or the other has spent all the family money on drugs to support \na habit? How many children have been abandoned, went to bed without \nfood because of addiction in their family?\n  These are serious matters. We made tremendous progress. The murder \nrate in America dropped by over 50 percent since the 1980s when Ronald \nReagan said ``just say no'' and started a War on Drugs. He appointed me \nas the U.S. attorney in Alabama. I know what we did. And the Federal \nGovernment led the way with tough sentencing, eliminating parole, \ntargeting dangerous drugs in effective ways, and States and local \ngovernments followed.\n  I am worried about it. It is just tragic to me that we are making the \nsame mistakes we made in the 1960s and 1970s. According to new data, \n4.3 million people abuse or are dependent on marijuana. Marijuana is \nstronger today--several times stronger--than the marijuana of the \n1960s, and it does impact people adversely.\n  The American Medical Association has issued a report that is \nunequivocal about the danger and the ramifications of the use of \nmarijuana. According to the 2014 ``Monitoring the Future'' study, since \n2007, lifetime, past year, past month, and daily drug use among 8th, \n10th, and 12th graders combined have all increased.\n  Meanwhile, over the last several years, Congress, the President, the \nSupreme Court, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission all have taken steps \nto lessen punishment for, or altogether stop, the enforcement of laws \nthat we passed over the years that led to this decline. They have been \neliminated and weakened. I supported one of the big ones in Congress. I \nworked with Senator Durbin and we passed a bill that I think was \njustified and would not have done anything other than make the system \nbetter, in my opinion, and fairer, but now we need to ask ourselves, \nwhat do we do next, if anything?\n\n  In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the sentencing guidelines that \nwere enacted by Congress were not mandatory. This was a huge thing. In \nthe early 1980s we passed sentencing guidelines and, depending on the \nseverity of the crime and what the aggravating factors were at work, a \nperson got more time or less time. It involved aggravating factors and \nmitigating factors, and it ended this idea that if you went to one \njudge, he would give you probation and if you went to another judge for \nthe same crime, you would get 10 years, 15 years in jail.\n  So I think that is to be noted. This is a very significant reduction \nas a practical matter in the amount of time that a person would serve \nbecause of eliminating the mandatory requirement of the sentencing \nguidelines.\n  Then in 2010--this is a bill I worked on, the Fair Sentencing Act, \nwhich reduced the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine \nand made other changes that in many ways reduced sentences overall. It \nreduced sentences. It was designed because minority groups, \nparticularly the African-American community--the drug of choice too \noften was crack and that had much higher sentences and it seemed to be \nunfair, and we fixed that to a large degree. It eliminated the \nmandatory 5-year minimum sentence--the mandatory 5 years without parole \nfor possession of crack cocaine. I didn't think that was legitimate, \nCongress agreed, and we eliminated that requirement. It was being \ngotten around, and not many times were people being sentenced for \nsimple possession of a small amount of cocaine. That was changed, and \nthe Sentencing Commission then implemented an amendment to the \nsentencing guidelines that applied this retroactively. So people who \nhad been sentenced under the previous procedures had those procedures \nreversed and then they got out of jail early--and a lot of people did. \nIt resulted in early release of thousands of offenders.\n  In August of 2013, in a dramatic event too little appreciated, \nAttorney General Eric Holder ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge \ncertain drug offenders with mandatory minimums, regardless of the \nquantity of drugs involved. He directed the prosecutors not to follow \nthe law. Under the law, if you have a certain amount of drug use, you \nare supposed to serve at least a minimum mandatory sentence. This is \ndifferent from the guidelines. This is a statutory requirement. And \nAttorney General Holder reversed previous attorneys general memoranda \nwhich directed that prosecutors should charge the main offense and they \nshould be\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\nsubject to the main penalty. That further reduced the number of people \nconvicted and the amount of time they served.\n  Then the administration has declined to enforce Federal drug laws \nregarding marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon. It is still a \nFederal offense to deal marijuana in the United States. So even though \na State doesn't have that law, the Federal Government does. They said: \nWell, if you don't enforce it, we won't enforce it--another relaxation \nof Federal law.\n  Then, according to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, \nprosecutions for drug trafficking--the number of people actually tried \nand prosecuted for drug trafficking under the primary drug law, 21 U.S. \nCode section 841, has declined over 16 percent since 2009, and since \nPresident Obama took office, prosecutions under 21 U.S. Code section \n960, the Import-Export Act, have declined by 30 percent over that time \nperiod.\n  We haven't had those kinds of reductions in drugs that are imported \ninto the United States. We don't have fewer drug distribution networks. \nWe have more. Those prosecutions shouldn't be declining. We didn't \nreduce the number of prosecutors working in the U.S. Attorneys' \noffices.\n  Attorney General Holder ordered Federal prosecutors to refrain from \nobjecting to defendants' requests in court for shorter sentences. He \nsaid: Don't object to their requests for shorter sentences. Less than a \nmonth later, the Sentencing Commission voted to reduce sentences for an \nestimated 70 percent of Federal drug trafficking offenders, including \nthose who possessed a firearm, committed a violent crime or had a prior \nconviction, decreasing their sentence an average of 11 months--almost 1 \nyear. An estimated 6,000 will be released from Federal prison beginning \nNovember 1, and about 40,000 will be eligible for early release in the \ncoming years.\n  President Obama has commuted the sentences of 89 Federal drug \noffenders, including crack cocaine distributors--some convicted of \ndealing more than 10 pounds of crack, which is hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in value, while others were convicted of possession of a \nfirearm in relation to a drug offense.\n  One of the things my office always did was it was sure to prosecute \ndrug dealers who used guns while they were doing their nefarious \ncrimes. I think it had an impact on the murder rate in America. Fewer \ndangerous drug dealers were carrying guns on a regular basis because \nthey knew if they got caught, they would be taken to Federal court and \nbe held another 5 years without parole for carrying a gun on top of \ntheir drug offense.\n  The President has announced that he plans to continue to grant \nclemency to Federal drug offenders through the end of his Presidency. \nAre we talking about thousands more?\n  All of this has led the Federal prison population to fall.\n  Now you have heard it said that we have this ever-growing number of \npeople in the Federal prisons and that somehow it is wrong--there are \nabout 200,000 people in Federal prisons.\n  We should talk about that. It is OK to talk about it, but we have to \nbe careful. What I would say to you and what is too little appreciated, \ncolleagues, is that we have already seen dramatic reductions in \nsentences in the last several years, far unlike what we had done in the \n1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n  So the prison population has now started dropping. It has reached the \nlowest levels since 2005, 10 years ago. According to the Bureau of \nPrisons, the prison population of 200,000 has decreased over the last 2 \nyears--by 5,300 in fiscal year 2014, last year. They project the \npopulation to ``further drop by 14,987 between FY2015 and FY2016''--\nanother 15,000 decline--``particularly as a result of the retroactive \nsentencing guidelines change.'' Admissions to Federal prisons have \ndeclined every year since 2011. The number of people being admitted to \nthe Federal prisons is going down, driven, I suspect, by the \nprosecutorial policies set by Attorney General Holder. They will \ncontinue to decline given the President's policy of directing \nprosecutors not to charge certain criminal offenses.\n  This is a very serious matter. We need to be careful as we analyze \nthe legislation today. Crime is already rising at an alarming rate, so \nmuch so that it has prompted an emergency meeting of the Major Cities \nChiefs Association in August. The New York Times recently reported that \nmurders have increased sharply in many cities across the country since \n2014, including Atlanta, up 32 percent--these are murders--Baltimore, \nup 56 percent, nearby; Chicago, up 20 percent; Houston, up 44 percent; \nLos Angeles, up 11 percent; New York, up 9 percent; Milwaukee, up 76 \npercent; Minneapolis, up 50 percent; New Orleans, up 22 percent; \nPhiladelphia, up 4 percent; Dallas, up 17 percent; and Washington, DC, \nwhere we are, up 47 percent--murders. This trend, in my opinion, will \ncontinue.\n  Property crimes have also risen sharply throughout the country and \neven in small cities such as Abilene, Carson City, Portland, Ithaca, \nand Binghamton, NY.\n  I am afraid we are watching a repeat of history. A couple of \ngenerations ago, when we had an indeterminate sentencing system with no \nguidelines or required minimum sentences, virtually identical \ndefendants received totally different sentences depending on the judge, \nand many received little or no incarceration. A nationwide crime wave \nensued. It was a revolving door. People were arrested. They were \nreleased on bail. They came to court, and the case got continued. It \ngot continued again, it got continued again, and the witnesses \ndisappeared. They had a plea bargain, they got a little bit of time, \nand they served less than a third of the time they got. That is what \nwas happening.\n  People say: Prison makes them worse. Do you remember those arguments? \nWell, in 1980, one out of four households in the United States had \nsuffered a rape, robbery, burglary, assault, larceny or auto theft in \nthe previous year. Crime was increasing in double-digits per year in \nthe 1960s and 1970s, and we did not respond to it.\n  So then the Congress passed legislation that imposed mandatory \nminimum sentences on criminals convicted of the most serious Federal \ncrimes and drug crimes to ensure that these perpetrators served at \nleast a fixed amount of time in prison. Every drug dealer knew it and \ncame to know that if they were caught, they were going to serve real \ntime and they were not going to talk their way out of it. The Anti-Drug \nAbuse Act was passed, and the Armed Career Criminal Act, which had \nmandatory 15-year penalties. Career criminals carrying guns and \ncommitting serious crimes were hammered. It targeted career criminals--\nthe kind of people who kill people to carry out their crimes. Drug \ntrafficking fell into that category. Congress also established \nsentencing guidelines that required judges to sentence within certain \nranges and calculate factors and create objectivity, so that one poor \nperson got the same sentence as some rich person with a highly paid \nlawyer. The rationale was and remains three-fold: to deter offenders \nfrom engaging in further criminal behavior, to ensure that a meaningful \nperiod of time elapsed for the offender to become rehabilitated, and to \nincapacitate the offender from harming law-abiding citizens.\n  How many people do you know that would rape someone? How many people \ndo you know that would likely take a gun and murder somebody? The more \nof those that are in jail serving time, the less people are going to \nget murdered. It is mathematics, and that is really what happened since \n1980 with the increasing number of people being incarcerated. This idea \nworked.\n  According to the FBI statistics, the rate of violent crimes--murder, \nrape, robbery, and aggravated assault--was reduced by more than 50 \npercent from 1991 to 2013. That is when these sentences were beginning \nto be understood and were impactful. Property crimes, burglary, murder, \nlarceny, and motor vehicle thefts dropped by a similar measure.\n  Over time, prison penalties fairly and systematically applied mean \nthat less crime and fewer innocent people are burglarized, robbed, \nraped or murdered. Scholars have estimated that the increase in the \nsize of our prison population has driven down crime rates by at least \n25 percent.\n  Professor Matt DeLisi of Iowa State University testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee that criminal justice research shows that \n``releasing 1 percent of the current [Federal prison] population would \nresult in approximately 32,850 additional murders,\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nrapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, thefts, auto thefts, \nand incidents of arson.''\n  Well, we have had more than a 1 percent increase already. The great \ncriminologist and Professor James Q. Wilson said:\n\n       A high risk of punishment reduces crime. It just does.\n\n  If you are talking about the classroom or on the football field, if \nthe flag is thrown every time somebody clips, they quit clipping. If it \nis not thrown, you will still see it.\n  In 2011 the Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling in Brown v. \nPlata, that California was required to reduce its prison population to \nease overcrowding. In dissent in that case, Justice Alito recalled a \nprisoner-release program in Philadelphia in the 1990s:\n\n       Although efforts were made to release only those prisoners \n     who were least likely to commit violent crimes, that attempt \n     was spectacularly unsuccessful. During an 18-month period, \n     the Philadelphia police arrested thousands of these prisoners \n     for committing 9,732 new crimes. Those defendants were \n     charged with 79 murders, 90 rapes, 1,113 assaults, 959 \n     robberies, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, not to mention \n     thousands of drug offenses.\n\n  I wish it weren't so. I wish we could have these programs. I have \nseen them since my time in law enforcement in 1975, as a young \nprosecutor. Year after year, people have come forward with plans that \nsound so good, and they have been tried before. But they never work out \nnearly as well as people promote. Trust me. If there was any quick fix, \nit would already have been done all over America. People don't--States \ndon't want to spend money on prisons. But the truth is that people who \ntend to be criminals tend to continue to be criminals and commit \ncrimes. We ignore too often the pain, the destruction and the damage it \ndoes to innocent people who are afraid to have their children \nexperience the turmoil of crime.\n  Now is not the time to move too fast to further reduce penalties \nwithout careful thought. Before we rush to judgment about undoing \nFederal sentencing laws, we must consider the results of what has \nalready happened--how much reduction we have already seen. We have a \nresponsibility to the public to examine every aspect of the legislation \nthat may be coming forward and be introduced in committee, which could \ngreatly impact the everyday lives of Americans for years to come. To \nthat end, we must have a good hearing on it. We need to study what \nexperts have told us and what history tells us about crime.\n  It would be so wonderful if we could do a drug treatment program and \npeople would not commit crimes again. It would be so wonderful if we \ncould have an in-prison educational program that people could take and \nsomehow have a significant reduction of crime rates. There are all \nkinds of ideas that have been tried over the years, and some of them \nmay have a benefit. Some of them have some benefit, but none of them \nhave produced dramatic alterations in the rate of recidivism or repeat \nof criminal acts. One study a number of years ago concluded that when a \nperson comes out of prison, they make a decision. It is an individual, \npersonal decision about whether they are going to continue with \ncriminal activity or not. Some of them make it because the prison was a \nbad place and they don't want to go back. Some of them make it because \nthey have had a religious experience. Some of them make it because they \ntook advantage of an online or education course and decided they are \ngoing to do something better for their lives. But it is an individual \ndecision, and we have not found it possible to somehow impact the \npsyche of people in prison so that we can consistently reduce the \nlikelihood that they will return to crime. We have to understand that.\n  If somebody has a plan that shows me that, I would like to see it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for allowing me to share these \nthoughts. We are at a very important time in criminal justice, and we \nneed to get it right.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Pension Protection\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to speak on the floor today about \nsomething that is incredibly important to families all across Michigan \nand all across the country--what we have talked about in terms of the \nimportance of having a middle class in this country. Folks who are \nworking all their lives, who get a good wage, and who pay into a \npension and expect it to be there. Those fundamentals are falling apart \nfor far too many people. Specifically, I want to speak about what is \nhappening regarding pensions and pension protections in this country.\n  I think all of us would agree that a pension is a promise and it is \nearned. A pension is earned over a lifetime of hard work, and it is the \nfoundation of retirement security for tens of millions of American \nworkers who have a pension and for their families. There is no question \nthat a number of pension funds in our country are suffering, due \nlargely to factors that they cannot control, such as what happened with \nthe Wall Street financial crisis, which took billions of dollars and \nwasn't the fault of any of the workers involved or of the businesses, \nfor that matter, that found themselves going out of business because of \nwhat happened during that financial crisis.\n  This took a huge toll on middle-class families. We have focused on \nhomes and the loss of homes, which was a disaster. But a second \ndisaster is now beginning to be felt, and that is the question of \npensions and the loss of pension benefits. Workers are now at risk of \nlosing their pensions because of cuts that are beginning to be \nannounced. This already includes 30,000 workers in Michigan--30,000 \nworkers in Michigan.\n\n  I understand the dilemma the pension funds are facing. Their funding \nis in critical status. They are becoming increasingly insolvent over \ntime. I understand the tough decisions they are having to make, but \nthey would not have to be making those decisions if protecting pensions \nwere a priority for Congress. This is a matter of whether we are going \nto continue to have a middle class in this country.\n  Frankly, it is an issue of fairness for the people who have paid in \ntheir whole lives and expect, as they come to retirement age--or they \nare already retired--as a matter of fairness, that their funds are \ngoing to be available for them, and they should be.\n  One of the things that is so outrageous when we look at the lack of \nfairness around priorities in this country is that we see companies \ntaking advantage of tax loopholes to move jobs overseas and avoid \npaying taxes. I have a bill called the Bring Jobs Home Act, which \nsimply closes one of those loopholes and says: If you are going to \nmove, at least you should not be able to write off the cost of the \nmove, and the workers who are losing their jobs and taxpayers should \nnot have to pay for the cost of the move.\n  We have not been able to close that loophole, so we see tens of \nmillions of dollars, billions of dollars, going overseas sometimes \nbecause companies stay here, they just move overseas on paper. So they \nare still breathing the air and drinking the water and driving on \nroads, but on paper they have moved so they don't have to pay taxes, \nand we have another gigantic tax loophole.\n  On the one hand, while we see the system rigged over and over again \nfor the wealthy and the well connected who pay less in taxes, we have \nhard-working citizens--whether they are truck drivers or teachers or \npolice officers or men and women in uniform or people all across our \ncountry--who are paying into pension systems, and we have not been able \nto get the support to fully fund those systems, to fully fund the PBGC, \nthe pension guarantee fund. So there is an issue around pensions and \npeople knowing their pensions will be protected going forward.\n  I believe it is up to us in Congress to put in place the resources \nnecessary to help protect the financial security of workers and \nretirees and their families. This is a matter of priorities. There are \nways for us to do that--by closing tax loopholes for special interests, \nfor the wealthy, for folks who want to avoid paying their taxes in a \nwide variety of ways. Take those dollars and make sure we shore up \npension protection in this country. It is pretty basic. People are \ncounting on us to take action. We need to fully commit to make sure \nevery worker gets the pension benefits they need, they deserve, and, \nmost importantly, they have earned.\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\n  That is why I am cosponsoring important legislation that Senator \nSanders has put forward. There are a number of us who are cosponsoring \nthis. Let me mention a few of the cosponsors. We have a number of \ndifferent people: Senator Baldwin, Senator Brown, Senator Franken, \nSenator Jack Reed, and others. I know my colleague Senator Peters cares \ndeeply about this as well.\n  There are a number of us who are coming together on legislation that \nwould prevent the proposed cuts to workers' earned pension benefits. \nThis bill would set our priorities straight by closing the tax \nloopholes, many of which I have talked about, to make sure we have the \nresources to put back into protecting workers' pensions. It would also \nmake sure workers and retirees in the Central State Pension Fund \nsystem, the largest pension fund facing severe and growing financial \ndifficulties, would be able to receive the full benefits they have \nearned--again, the full benefits they have earned.\n  It is outrageous to me to think that a promise as basic as a pension, \na lifetime of work paying into a pension--that that pension would not \nbe there and that we would not as a Congress consider it a priority to \ndo everything possible to protect pensions people have earned.\n  I am going to keep doing everything I can, looking for ways to stop \nthese cuts to the earned pension benefits. It is a basic issue of \nfinancial security. We have legislation, if passed right away, that \nwould make a big difference. We need to get that bill passed so we can \nput in place the pension protections and send a message to people \nacross our country that we get it, that we understand what is at stake \nfor so many families.\n  A pension is a promise that needs to be kept. We have a way to do \nthat in legislation before this body. I hope the leadership--the \nRepublican leadership--will view it as a priority and take it up so we \ncan get this passed as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Transportation Funding\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor--I don't come to \nthe floor every day, but every day that I come here you are presiding. \nEither I am coming here more often than I thought or you are presiding \nmore than most people do. Maybe you just drew the short straw, but at \nthe end of the day, I enjoy having these conversations with you, even \nwhen most of our colleagues have packed up and headed for places near \nand far--mostly far.\n  I have a couple of charts here today I would like for us to go over. \nThe first one is--I like these bar graphs. This is an interesting one. \nWe have Great Britain on this axis right here. We have information \nabout the relative amount of fuel taxes countries have. Great Britain \nis the world champ. They have the biggest fuel taxes of anybody, and \nthey have had for quite a while.\n  All the way over here is the U.S.A. There is an outfit called the \nOECD, which I would say is the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development. It doesn't have 41 nations; maybe it has about 37 or \n38. They are arrayed right here. There are Russia, India, and Brazil. \nThis gives you some sense of how different nations pay for their \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  A bunch of nations, like Great Britain, use their fuel taxes to help \nbalance the budget. Great Britain is here, and then we have these other \ncountries--Luxembourg, Spain, Argentina. You get all the way down here, \nand there is Brazil. They are like off the charts. They must not have \nany fuel taxes to pay for their transportation infrastructure at all. \nWe are pretty close to them. We are right here, the United States. We \nare right between Canada and Mexico.\n  I wanted to show that to give people a sense of--people think: Boy, \nwe charge a lot of money for a gasoline tax and diesel tax. Well, as it \nturns out, not so much.\n  Some people think we spend a lot of money in the Federal budget on \nforeign aid. A lot of time in my townhall meetings, people complain and \nsay: Well, we spend way too much money on foreign aid.\n  I say: Well, what percentage of the budget do you think actually goes \nto foreign aid?\n  People say about 20, 25 percent. And the answer is 1 percent. So that \nis a misperception.\n  I think the perception here is that we charge very high fuel taxes \ncompared to the rest of the world. No. We have among the very lowest \nfuel taxes when you combine State and local with all of the developed \nnations of the world.\n  Let's see what is next here. It says: How much do we pay in fuel \ntaxes? This is the cost of regular gasoline right here, August 2015, \nabout a month and a half ago. This right over here is diesel fuel in \nabout August of this year, a month and a half ago. The retail price at \nthat time, I guess on average across the country, was about $2.64 for \ngasoline, and the retail price for diesel was about the same, $2.60 a \ngallon.\n  It is interesting to see how much tax is collected in a $2.64 gallon \nof gas. In our State, in Delaware, I pulled up for gas last week. I \nwent to Wawa. I paid about $2.11 for gas. There are a bunch of \nstations--probably 1,000 or more--several thousand stations across the \ncountry last week where people paid less than two bucks a gallon. But \nthis was the average. We have a couple of big States where the prices \nare higher, California among them.\n  Anyway, what makes up the price of gas at $2.64? This was back in \nAugust. About 40 percent of that was the cost of crude oil. About \nanother 25 percent of that $2.64 was attributable to refining costs. \nAnother almost 20 percent--19 percent, actually--was for the cost of \ndistribution, for distributing and marketing. Add that all up, and it \nadds up to about 82 percent, 83 percent of the cost of gasoline was \ncrude oil, and refining, distribution, and taxes was about 17 percent.\n\n  Again, when you look at our taxes in this country, State and local, \nwe have among the lowest in the developed world. We just saw that in \nour first chart.\n  The numbers on diesel are pretty much the same--40 percent of the \ncost of the diesel when you fill up tanks if you have a car or a truck \nthat uses diesel. It is about 18 percent for refining and another 22 \npercent. So about 80 percent of the cost for a gallon of diesel fuel \n1\\1/2\\ or 2 months ago was, again, crude oil, the cost of crude, the \ncost of refining, and the cost of distribution and marketing.\n  Let's see what is on our next chart. It strikes me that gasoline \nprices are going down nationwide. Well, are they or are they not? Let's \nlook. The average price of gas on October 5, 2015--what is today? Today \nis October 8, my sister's birthday. Three days before that birthday--\nOctober 5--gas nationwide was about $2.32 a gallon. Compared to last \nyear, it is down by 98 cents again.\n  On the east coast, the price of gas where I come from in Delaware--I \nsaid I bought gas last week at Wawa for $2.11. The average price up and \ndown the east coast is about $2.17 a gallon, and that is down by over \n$1 from a year ago. In New England, the price is just about the same as \nthe Northeast--$2.23 a gallon. The Central Atlantic is pretty much \nVirginia, Maryland, and maybe North Carolina and South Carolina. In the \nCentral Atlantic, it is $2.22 a gallon. These are all down by over $1 a \ngallon from last year. The Lower Atlantic is pretty much the same. The \nMidwest is a little bit more. Gulf Coast States--down very close to $2 \nhere. The gulf coast is down to $2.03 a gallon. That is down by roughly \n$1 from a year ago. Go out to the Rocky Mountain States--if you move \nfarther to the West, prices go up a little bit. The Rocky Mountain \nStates are $2.47, $2.48. That is down by $1. The west coast is about \n$2.79. That is almost $1. Finally, the Pacific Northeast is about \n$2.50, again, down by $1. So I would say prices are down by about a \nthird across the country.\n  I like this poster. For folks who can't read it, there are a couple \nof guys who are sitting in a gas station. The passenger says to the \ndriver, ``I just found some loose change in the cup holder.'' And the \ndriver says, ``Awesome. Fill 'er up.'' Well, we are not quite at that \npoint, but we are getting a lot more for the loose change we find in \nour cup\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nholder than used to be the case. Now the question is, Is that going to \ncontinue?\n  Look at this next chart and see what it shows. It shows that the \nglobal price of oil continues to drop. Again, keep in mind that about \n40 percent of the cost of gas--40 percent at the pump, 40 percent of \nthe cost of diesel at the pump--is attributable to the price at the \nwellhead. This is the price of crude oil over a few years--2011, 2012, \n2013, 2014, and 2015. Here we are. This is starting at about the middle \nof 2014. There is a precipitous drop, some recovery, and then another \nprecipitous drop.\n  This is even better. This is the price of crude oil over the past 6 \nmonths. There is a big drop starting about in June. You see what we \nhave down here. It is about midforties per barrel.\n  That is history. The question is, Looking forward, what can we expect \nprices to look like?\n  I don't have a magic solar ball or anything like that, but I do know \nthis: The world in which we live is awash in oil, and the United States \nhas been a big contributor to that because of what we are bringing up \nout of the ground, on the land, and in the seas beside us, beside our \ncountry.\n  But there is another country that is, I think, No. 4 in the world in \nterms of their strategic reserves compared to the rest of the world. It \nis a country that has not been pumping a lot of late, but it is a \ncountry that has the ability to pump a lot of oil, and that country is \nIran. Today, this month, next month, they can pump maybe 100,000 \nbarrels a day, maybe 200,000 barrels a day. But if they abide by the \nagreement we struck with them, the Brits, the French, the Germans, the \nRussians, the Chinese, and us--if the Iranians keep their agreement, \nwhich is designed to ensure they don't end up with a nuclear weapon--if \nthey keep that agreement and the sanctions are lifted, they will be \nable to, probably starting more next year than this, begin to pump more \noil out of the ground. They have a lot of it to pump. They have a big \nreason to want to pump a lot of it because, as bad as our \ntransportation and infrastructure is, theirs is a whole lot worse. They \nneed to generate the money, and one of the ways they are going to do it \nis to pump a lot of oil.\n  Looking forward, can we say the price of gasoline is going to go \ndown? Is it going to stay the same? I would just say this: One of the \nbig factors for us to consider is that the fourth biggest oil reserve \ncountry in the world is going to start--all things being equal, they \nare going to start pumping a lot of oil, and that is going to come into \na world market of oil where, frankly, we are awash in oil. It is not \ngoing to drive the price up, I can assure you. It may keep it steady. \nIt could actually drive it down further.\n  All right. Let's take a look at the next chart. This is a chart that \nfocuses on what we are investing as a nation in our transportation \nsystems, our roads, our highways, our bridges. We are looking at, \nactually, some numbers provided by an outfit called the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers. These are people who make a living by \nbuilding infrastructure and helping design and figure out what we \nshould build and how we should build it. It is not just transportation, \nit is all kinds of infrastructure, but it certainly includes \ntransportation.\n  They actually grade how we are doing on transportation in this \ncountry on roads, highways, and bridges. I think the last time I saw, \nthe grade they gave us was a D-plus. The only thing I can say was good \nabout that is it was not a D-minus. But it hasn't been a C or even a C-\nminus for a long time. It certainly hasn't been a B for a lot longer. \nAnd one of the things that happens is when you have a transportation \nsystem--when our investments are at about a D-plus--``d'' as in \n``dog''--we end up spending a lot of time in traffic just sitting \nthere.\n  Every year, Texas A comes up with a study that says how much time \nwe spend in traffic just pretty much sitting there, barely moving. The \naverage across the country for the average driver is 42 hours a year. \nThink about that. That is pretty much almost 2 days that you just \nsitting there, maybe moving a little bit but not much.\n  For the bigger cities, such as Washington, DC; Houston, TX; Dallas; \nDenver; or L.A., the numbers are more like 82 hours per year. That is \nalmost 4 days just sitting there in traffic in your car, truck, van, \nbig truck, your diesel, rig, whatever, waiting to move.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers says our investment needs are \nabout $228 billion. Is that per year? That is per year. That is a lot \nof money. If we were pumping that kind of money into roads, highways, \nand bridges in our transit system, we wouldn't have a D-plus anymore; \nwe would have a B-plus--``b'' as in ``bravo'' as opposed to ``d'' as in \n``dog.'' So that is what $228 billion a year would get us. That would \nbe new revenues on top of the current revenues we are already \ngenerating from roads, highways, and bridges.\n  Over at the U.S. Department of Transportation, they have said their \nmagic number is $171 billion per year. They are talking about $171 \nbillion per year. They say that is just enough to begin to improve our \ntransportation system. Instead of seeing it continue to be degraded, if \nwe put in about $171 billion, we would see that is just enough to begin \nto improve our transportation system.\n  Over here, these are our civil engineers. These are smart people who \nhelp design roads. This is the U.S. Department of Transportation. One \nsays we need to put in about $228 billion a year and the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation says about $171 billion a year. Our \ncurrent highway trust fund spending out of our trust fund is $50 \nbillion a year. It is not even 20 percent, maybe not even 25 percent of \nwhat the engineers who build these systems are telling us, and it is \nnot even a third of what the Department of Transportation says we ought \nto be doing. We could begin--just begin to improve our transportation \nsystem.\n  What this chart says to me is we are going nowhere fast and we are \nwoefully underfunding. If we want to get better; if we want to reduce \nthe amount of time we are just sitting, going nowhere; if we want to \nreduce the amount of money we are spending to replace our tires or have \nour front ends aligned and other repairs on our vehicles--that adds up \nto about, on average, between $350 to $500 per driver. That is what we \nare spending now.\n  Let's see what this poster says:\n\n       The U.S. highway trust fund running out due to political \n     gridlock.\n       Where the highway ends.\n\n  Let me just say that we have had over the last, I don't know, 5, 6, \n7, 8 years any number of blue ribbon commissions that have been \ncommissioned. We commissioned them in the Transportation bill we passed \nmaybe 6 years ago. We said to all these smart people: We want you to go \nout and figure out how we ought to pay for transportation.\n  They came back and said: Well, here is why we think a big part of it \nought to be user fees, some for tolling and some for figuring out how \nmany miles are actually traveled, vehicle miles traveled, kind of \nmigrating toward that of system, but for the most part it should be \nuser fees.\n  A big piece of that, at least for now, should be user fees for the \namount of gas we buy and for the amount of diesel fuel we buy because \nthat generally ensures that the folks who are using our roads, \nhighways, and bridges are actually paying for them.\n  So there has not really been a lot of question among people a lot \nsmarter than I and even smarter than my colleagues--most of them, at \nleast--the folks who are most knowledgeable about this say this is the \nway we ought to pay for it, and it should be a user-fee approach.\n  The reason we are not doing that is because of political courage--not \nan overabundance of that; maybe a lack of it.\n  All right. Let's see what is next. The TRAFFIC Relief Act, which is \nthe Tax Relief And #FixTheTrustFund For Infrastructure Certainty Act of \n2015--that is a mouthful--was introduced by a fellow from Illinois \nnamed Senator Durbin and a fellow from Delaware. That would be me.\n  Dick Durbin and I came to Washington. I was a Navy guy for many years \nbefore I was treasurer of Delaware, Congressman for a while, Governor, \nand now in the Senate. Dick came to Washington in 1982. We both were \nelected to the House in 1982. We found out on the first day on the \njob--we were sworn in January 3, 1983--the\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nSocial Security trust fund was about to run out of money, I mean \nentirely. But in 1983 we were not going to be talking about reducing \nSocial Security benefits by 5 percent, 10 percent, or 20 percent; by \nthe end of 1983, we were going to run out of money and we wouldn't be \nable to pay anything for Social Security benefits.\n  Fortunately, in 1982 some very smart people got together. A blue \nribbon commission was chaired by Alan Greenspan, who went on to became \nFederal Reserve Chairman. They said: Here is how we ought to pay for \nit.\n  Dick Durbin and I--a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans--all \nof us together said: That makes sense. Let's do it.\n  It was a combination of reductions in benefits and additional \nrevenues. We got the job done. Social Security is not set forever, but \nit has lasted for another 30 years, 40 years. We need to do some more \nto fix it, but that is the kind of bipartisan resolve we need.\n  The legislation Senator Durbin and I introduced in this instance--\nmaybe a little more than a month ago--raises about $220 billion for the \nhighway trust fund over 10 years, and that is on top of the amount of \nmoney we are already going to spend anyway over the next 10 years. I \nthink that would be another maybe $400 billion, roughly, $450 billion, \n$350 billion. Add that to $220 billion, and that gives us $570 billion.\n  Does this get us from D-plus to an A or A-minus or even a B-plus? No, \nit doesn't, but it moves us in the right direction. It moves the needle \nin the direction it needs to go. It provides for $90 billion to fully \nfund the highways and transit programs and about $130 billion for new \ninvestments in repairs and upgrades. We need to do those new \ninvestments, and we certainly need to do the repairs and upgrades.\n  Let me close by thanking Senator Durbin for joining me in this \neffort. People vote for us to come to Congress and to make tough \ndecisions. People expect us to work together. People especially expect \nus to get things done. People especially expect us to do things that \nhelp strengthen the economic recovery, which is underway, to make it \nmore robust going forward in the future. We can do that. It doesn't \ntake a rocket scientist to figure out how.\n  A lot of smart people on these blue ribbon commissions have been \ntelling us for years that the way to do it is move toward tolling, \neventually move toward some kind of vehicle-miles-traveled system where \nbased on the actual miles we travel we pay some find of fee. But they \nhave also said for now, because those other two ideas are not fully \nrealized--and especially for vehicle miles traveled, we are not going \nto be there for probably 10 years, 20 years. In the meantime, we have \nall this work that needs to be done and to be paid for, and they have \nsaid the best way to do it is to ensure that we pay--those of us who \nare using the roads, highways, and bridges pay for that, and we have \nbeen using gas taxes and diesel taxes to do that.\n\n  I will close with this. I am not a big coffee drinker, but I stopped \nby a carryout we have downstairs in the basement. They are open \nwhenever we are in session, and you can go get a sandwich or some soup \nor yogurt or something, and they also sell coffee. Some days, \nespecially when we are in session late at night--we have not been doing \nthat much lately--but at night when we are in session late, they sell a \nlot of coffee. The coffee is anywhere from the smallest cup costing \nlike 70 cents, and the middle-sized maybe $2, $2.50, and the largest \ncups are maybe $3 or something like that. If you go to Starbucks you \npay a lot more for a cup of coffee than that. You pay as much as $5 at \nStarbucks, I am told by a friend of mine who buys his coffee there, but \nI bought a cup of coffee here today and it was a little more than $2 \nfor a middle-sized cup of coffee.\n  As it turns out, if we actually raised the user fee--the gas tax and \nthe diesel tax--for 4 cents a year, which is what Dick Durbin and I are \ncalling for, 4 cents a year for 4 years, and the Federal gas tax has \nbeen 18 cents for 22 years. Since 1993 it has been 18 cents. It is not \nworth 18 cents anymore because of inflation. It is worth less than a \ndime. The diesel tax is about 23 cents. It is not worth 23 cents \nanymore. It has been that since 1993. It is worth less than 15 cents. \nIn the meantime, the price of concrete is up, asphalt is up, steel is \nup, labor is up, and the major way, the principal way we pay for roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit frankly has greatly diminished in value.\n  If we were to actually raise, as Senator Durbin and I are suggesting, \nthe price of these user fees--gas tax, diesel tax--by 4 cents a year \nfor 4 years, that would add 16 cents to the price of gasoline. For the \naverage driver, that turns out to be on a weekly basis just about the \nprice of a cup of coffee. It works out to be just about the price of a \ncup of coffee.\n  Here is a question I would ask. I think if we asked most drivers in \nthis country of ours today when they are sitting in traffic trying to \nget someplace--whether here in the Mid-Atlantic area, up in the \nNortheast, out on the West Coast or other places--would you be willing, \n4 years from now, to be paying an amount of money equal to the price of \na cup of coffee in order to spend a lot less time sitting in traffic \ngoing nowhere or running into potholes that destroy your tires and your \nfront-end alignment? Would you be willing to pay on a weekly basis the \namount of money you spend on a cup of coffee? My guess is most people \nwould say that doesn't seem like a bad deal. You know what. They would \nbe right because it is not a bad deal.\n  I will close with this. I am from Delaware. People here are from all \nover the country representing their States. Guess what 12 of the 50 \nStates have done in the last 2 years--2013, 2014--and those States are \nmostly red States, with Republican Governors and Republican \nlegislatures. One dozen of those States have raised their user fees. \nThey have raised their user fees and not by a dollar all at once or \neven a half dollar or a quarter, but they have raised them in some \nplaces by pennies, a nickel or more over a couple of years.\n  Then last November in those 12 States they had elections. This is an \ninteresting story. Guess what happened to the State legislators who \nvoted to raise their user fees to actually pay for their roads, \nhighways, and bridges. When they ran for reelection they got reelected. \nAmazing. They showed political courage. They did the hard thing. \nNinety-five percent of them, Republicans, who were running for \nreelection last November, in those States where they raised the user \nfees--gas tax, diesel tax--they got reelected.\n  Do you know who didn't get reelected in some of those States? The \nlegislators who voted against raising the user fees, who did not \nsupport making investments in transportation.\n  How about the Democrats in those States? Well, the Democrats in \nStates where they raised the user fees to pay for their transportation \ninvestments, almost 90 percent of them won their primary last November, \nwon the general election, and they got reelected too. They did better \nthan the legislators who voted against those increases. Think about \nthat.\n  I like to quote Thomas Jefferson from time to time, and Jefferson \nused to say: If people know the truth, they won't make a mistake. I \nwould like to think the same thing is true here. If my colleagues and I \nknow the truth, we won't make a mistake either. People think it is \npolitical suicide to vote to raise these user fees and you can't get \nreelected by doing the right thing. But you know what. You can. You \ncan, and there is a lot of evidence to show it can happen.\n  I will close not with the words of Jefferson but of Mark Twain, who \nsaid a lot of things--a lot of funny things--and one of the things he \nsaid that I think is especially appropriate is: In the end, tell the \ntruth. You will confound your critics and amaze your friends.\n  The truth is we need to make these investments. The other truth is \nthis is not political suicide. At the end of the day, we are actually \ngoing to get, I think more often than not, rewarded for doing the hard \nthing and the right thing. My hope is we will do that, and I will \ncontinue to make that case.\n  One last great quote, Mr. President. Wayne Gretzky--I don't know if \nyou play much hockey down your way, we play some in Delaware--but Wayne \nGretzky said a lot of memorable things in his life--a great hockey \nplayer, now retired--and when people would say to him: Mr. Gretzky, why \nare you such a good hockey player? He would say: I go\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nwhere the puck will be, not where the puck is. Think about that. I go \nwhere the puck will be, not where the puck is.\n  One of the other things Wayne Gretzky said that I especially like is: \nI miss 100 percent of the shots--talking about taking a shot on the \ngoal--he said: I miss 100 percent of the shots that I never take. Think \nabout that. I miss 100 percent of the shots I never take.\n  I am convinced this is a shot worth taking. I am going to push very \nhard to make sure somebody is here, and Dick Durbin and my guess is \nsome others, too, will come along and will encourage folks to join us \nin this effort. This is a just cause.\n  I don't see anybody else waiting in line to speak, so with that, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize two incredible \nentertainers and individuals in the Las Vegas community, Siegfried \nFischbacher and Roy Horn, better known as Siegfried and Roy.\n  For more than 35 years, this duo shared their captivating magic show \nwith visitors and residents of Las Vegas. Their stage presence and the \nparticipation of their trained white tigers kept audiences coming back \nfor performances unlike any other. Siegfried and Roy's award-winning \nshow at the Mirage Hotel and Casino was enjoyed by children and adults, \nand it opened the door to family entertainment on the Las Vegas Strip.\n  Through their celebrity and love of animals, Siegfried and Roy have \nbeen working to raise awareness for animal conservation and are \neducating others about endangered species. The white tiger, an animal \nthat became an icon of Siegfried and Roy's performances, is among those \nlisted as endangered and facing extinction. By establishing the \nSiegfried and Roy Masters of the Impossible Foundation, they are taking \ntheir efforts to educate, protect, and conserve animals that are \nendangered and threatened across the globe.\n  For the first time in 5 years, Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden at \nthe Mirage is welcoming four tiger cubs, Hirah, Maharani, Liberty, and \nJustice. Siegfried and Roy are calling these cubs ``ambassadors of \nconservation,'' as they hope these animals will help them share the \nimportant message that we must continue to work together to protect \nendangered species.\n  I appreciate Siegfried and Roy's dedication to the Las Vegas \ncommunity and animal conservation. I wish them the best in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7260-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7260-S7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, much of our international focus in recent \nmonths has understandably been on Iran and Syria. Both will require \nfurther attention as we make sure Iran complies with the nuclear \nagreement and try to bring an end to the catastrophic human suffering \nin Syria. And we must continue to insist that Russia abide by the Minsk \nagreement in territory it so brazenly seized in eastern Ukraine.\n  But amid these important foreign policy challenges, I would like to \nmake sure we do not lose sight of smaller but also important battles \nfor human rights occurring around the world.\n  First, let me start with a small nation straddling the lines of \nEurope and Asia, which many had hoped would strengthen its ties with \nthe community of democracies--Azerbaijan. Since 2014, the government \nhas arrested close to a hundred political prisoners representing some \nof the strongest voices for democracy and transparency in the country.\n  Many of those who currently sit in prison on trumped-up charges such \nas tax evasion, fraud, and even treason include noted human rights \ndefenders like Leyla and Arif Yunus, Rasul Jafarov, Intigam Aliyev, and \nAnar Mammadli. They worked tirelessly before their arrests on issues \ntrying to strengthen the country's democratic institutions.\n  Just recently, the Organization of Security and Co-operation in \nEurope, or OSCE, announced that it is canceling its mission to monitor \nthe upcoming parliamentary elections due to restrictions imposed by the \ngovernment. Without the OSCE's mission, the likelihood for free and \nfair elections in November is obviously diminished.\n  The Azeri Government has been particularly aggressive in quashing \nfreedom of the press, notably arresting in 2014 Khadija Ismayilova, one \nof the country's top investigative reporters. For years she exposed \nsecret connections between President Alivey's immediate family and \nbusiness dealings, including the privatized state airline, the nation's \nbiggest telecom provider, and massive construction projects.\n  As a result of her work, she faced repeated threats, hidden cameras \nin her home, and even attempted blackmail by crudely posted videos of \nprivate moments with her boyfriend; yet as the Washington Post recently \nreported on its front page, she pressed forward, believing that the \nAzeri public had a right to know about corruption at the highest levels \nof their government.\n  Two weeks later, Khadija's employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, \nwas raided and shut down. Its staff has faced repeated harassment and \nsome have even left the country out of concern for their safety. \nRecently she was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison on what can only be \nseen as a blatant attempt to halt her work.\n  The U.S. State Department, the OSCE, and the European Union \nParliament have all called on Azerbaijan to release its political \nprisoners. And in July, 15 of my Senate colleagues joined me in a \nletter to Azeri President Aliyev expressing concern that the space for \ncivil society and the freedom of press within the country is \ndiminishing. I call on Aliyev here today to not further jeopardize his \nties to the West by continuing these authoritarian actions against his \nown people.\n  Next, let me turn to Latin America where we continue to see \ndemocratic backsliding in a number of countries.\n  First, Ecuador, where President Correa has seemingly no tolerance for \ncriticism and a troubling habit of harassing the media and restricting \nfreedom of association and the press. It is not clear why Correa, who \nhas a large majority in the parliament, has to take such draconian and \nundemocratic measures.\n  For example, over the years, the police have raided the homes of \njournalists working to expose government corruption and shut down an \nenvironmental organization critical of the regime's extractive \npolicies. Government thugs have harassed and intimidated Twitter users \nwho criticize the government. And Correa recently seemed set to force \nthe closure of Fundamedios, a respected NGO that promotes freedom of \nthe press.\n  The NGO's crime? Tweeting links to two political editorials critical \nof the Ecuadoran government.\n  Facing strong international condemnation, it now appears Correa has \ndecided to back off this ill-suited vendetta against Fundamedios.\n  And in Venezuela the other week, leading opposition figure Leopoldo \nLopez, who had already been sitting in jail for 19 months on absurd \npolitical charges, was sentenced to almost 14 years.\n  Equally troubling is what the Venezuelan regime has done to Judge \nMaria Lourdes Afiuni, who tried to maintain a semblance of judicial \nindependence. She was shamelessly jailed after releasing a defendant \nwho had been detained for 3 years without charges and swiftly charged \nwith corruption and abuse of authority. Afiuni sat in jail for 2 years \nnext to violent prisoners she had once sentenced.\n  While in prison, she was brutally raped and became pregnant--her body \nterribly destroyed by the violence. She was granted house arrest to \nrecover from emergency surgery. And today\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\nshe must still report to the authorities every 15 days and cannot leave \nthe country or speak to the news media. Incredibly, Venezuela's \nAttorney General denied in Geneva there was a complaint for sexual \nabuse and torture involving Afiuni.\n  I know U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power has taken on this case. I want \nto join that effort and call for her unconditional release and \nexoneration.\n  Venezuelan President Maduro is presiding over the near collapse of \nhis once proud nation, manufacturing internal and external enemies to \nexplain his own government's economic mismanagement.\n  Not only has his government sentenced Lopez to jail, but it has also \nstarted a border dispute with Colombia, embarrassingly trying to \nfurther deflect attention from its own disastrous policies.\n  Furthering more division and repression will only make things worse. \nI know this administration and others in the region have tried to offer \npaths forward for Maduro, but I fear he is heading in the opposite \ndirection with Lopez's sentencing.\n  Now, some of you may remember the international outrage that occurred \nwhen writer and activist Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 public \nlashes and 10 years in prison on blasphemy and apostasy charges in \nSaudi Arabia.\n  You may also recall his brother-in-law and lawyer, human rights \nactivist Waleed Abu al-Khair, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison \nby Jeddah's specialized criminal court for inciting public opinion and \nundermining the state.\n  These imprisonments--and both their dubious charges and inhumane \npunishments--were denounced around the world by reputable human rights \norganizations, foreign governments, and many others.\n  Our State Department called for the release of both Raif and Waleed, \nand in Congress, I was joined by seven of my Senate colleagues in \nwriting to the late King Abdullah urging their release. Sixty-seven of \nmy colleagues in the House did the same months later when King Salman \nbecame the new leader of Saudi Arabia. And just the other day, Badawi \nwas awarded the PEN Literary Award.\n  We have a longstanding friendship with the Saudi regime, and friends \ndo at times disagree. But it is because of the nature of our friendship \nthat I believe we have an obligation to encourage Saudi Arabia to do \nbetter--to uphold basic human rights for free speech, for women, for \nreligious minorities, for foreign workers, and countless others.\n  I hope the new King, King Salman, will show compassion and bring an \nend to Saudi Arabia's troubling human rights record.\n  And last, let me mention some hopeful steps in Belarus, where \nrecently the last candidate who ran in 2010 for President against \nstrongman President Lukashenko, was finally released from jail.\n  Michael Statkevich was released after nearly 5 years and, \ncoincidentally, just days after he had passed the deadline to be an \neligible opposition candidate for the next Presidential election.\n  You see on the eve of the 2010 election--an election that could have \nbrought an end to the distinction of being the last dictatorship in \nEurope--Lukashenko had seven candidates arrested and thrown in jail--\nnot much of an incentive to be a candidate.\n  Sadly, such repression and election manipulation has been the norm in \nBelarus which incredibly still operates its own KGB to enforce \npolitical repression.\n  However, Belarus has another election coming up next week on October \n11. I want President Lukashenko to know that the world is watching and \nhoping that this time it will be a free and legitimate election worthy \nof the Belarussian people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING PAT JOHNS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last month, Illinois--and America--lost a \nlegend. Pat Johns passed away at the age of 66. Pat Johns was from my \nhome State of Illinois. He was born in Aurora and raised in Plano. \nKnown as the ``Master of Disaster,'' Pat was employed with Catholic \nRelief Services, based in Baltimore, for 30 years. In that time he was \non the ground in some of the world's most dangerous war zones and \nhumanitarian emergency areas.\n  Pat Johns was a soldier, but not in the traditional sense--he didn't \neven carry a gun. He was a soldier of peace, armed only with the virtue \nof his mission. And his mission took him to places like the killing \nfields of Cambodia, the Ethiopian famine, the Rwandan genocide, \nSomalia, Kosovo, and Eritrea. And when natural disasters occurred like \nthe Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, or the earthquake in Haiti, Pat \nJohns was there--with energy, hope, and solutions.\n  In 1974, Pat joined Catholic Relief Services and was posted in \nCambodia. Two years later, he was managing a staff of 400 people. To \nsay that Pat faced a challenge in Cambodia would be a gross \nunderstatement. The Khmer Rouge Army was storming its way toward the \ncapitol of Phnom Penh and the Vietnam war was raging next door. Pat's \njob included working shifts of 50 hours or more and getting food and \nsupplies to nearly 2 million refugees seeking safe haven from the Khmer \nRouge's advances. He endured miserable tropical weather and survived \nmalaria, all while keeping tens of thousands of refugees alive. When \nasked about the experience, he said, ``The whole experience, in \nCambodia really drove home my niche in life.''\n  Many may have quit, but not Pat Johns. Instead, he dedicated his life \nto serving those in desperate need in the most dangerous parts of the \nplanet. In doing so, Pat Johns saved millions of people from war-torn \ncountries, fed the starving, and promoted peace and justice all over \nthe world--what an inspiration.\n  Last spring, I gave the commencement address at my nephew's high \nschool graduation. I asked the students to think about what they wanted \npeople to say about their lives. I asked them, ``What will you be \nremembered for? What service did you render to your community? Your \nnation? Your world?'' The great thing about living in America is we can \nchoose the answers to those questions.\n  Pat Johns will be remembered for many things: living through war, \nfamine, natural disasters, incredible human suffering; and for bringing \nhope to victims everywhere he went. But Sean Callahan, chief operating \nofficer for Catholic Relief Services, put it best. He said, ``Perhaps \nthe greatest thing about Pat was that he was a gentleman and a greatly \ncaring person. He could work nonstop for 50 hours in terrible \nconditions, but still have the heart to offer comfort and friendship to \nthose around him.'' That's a legacy to be proud of.\n  Today, the best way we can honor Pat Johns is by continuing his \nlife's work. We need this generation of Americans to live up to the \nexample set by Pat Johns. We have big shoes to fill, but Pat showed us \nthat, with the right commitment, we can get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7261-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7261-S7262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have all been deeply shaken by the \nhorrific tragedies in Charleston and Roseburg and by all the mass \nkillings that now occur with alarming regularity. The American people \noverwhelmingly support commonsense reforms that will keep firearms out \nof the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals; yet in response to \nmass shootings, too often Congress slips into a familiar cycle of \nshock, sorrow and, ultimately, inaction. Some in Congress pretend that \nthere are no solutions; others claim that any restriction aimed at \nkeeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people represents an affront \nto the Second Amendment. They are wrong.\n  Many, many Americans have had enough. We will not be satisfied by \nthose who only offer their sympathies. And we will not be lulled into \ninaction.\n  While I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee last Congress, \nwe addressed gun violence head-on. In the wake of the horrifying and \nsenseless murder of 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook \nElementary in Newtown, CT, I and all Democratic members on the \ncommittee resolved to pass sensible reforms to protect our communities. \nWe were moved by the powerful words of former Congresswoman Gabrielle \nGiffords calling on us\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\nto act, and we reported out legislation that would punish criminals who \ntraffic in firearms and would close background check loopholes. This \nincluded my bipartisan legislation to prevent criminals from using \nstraw purchasers who exploit weak background check laws in order to \nfunnel firearms to criminals. Our efforts were strongly supported by \nthe American public, but Senate Republicans blocked these commonsense \nreforms on the Senate floor.\n  It has been more than 3 months since Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee called for a hearing in the wake of the tragedy in \nCharleston, SC. I hope the majority will soon schedule this hearing so \nthat we can have a constructive discussion on gun violence that has \nshaken too many communities and too many families. But if we truly want \nto make a difference, we must work together to build consensus around \nsolutions to gun violence. I will work with anyone interested in \npreventing these tragedies, and I will soon reintroduce my legislation \nto strengthen our straw purchasing and firearm trafficking laws.\n  Like many Vermonters, I grew up with firearms, and I have enormous \nrespect for the freedoms the Second Amendment protects. None of the \nconcepts put forward by the Democratic caucus threaten the Second \nAmendment rights of lawful gun owners. But American lives are \nthreatened when our laws do not protect them. This need not be a \npartisan issue, and we must work together.\n  Our country desperately needs meaningful reform now. The toll that \ngun violence takes on our communities is too great. It is past time for \nCongress to act. The American people should not have to wait until the \nnext tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7262-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUSTICE FOR WAR CRIMES IN SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Cardin, spoke about \nthe opportunity for the United States and Sri Lanka to expand economic \nand security cooperation and the need for accountability for war crimes \nand reconciliation between ethnic and religious factions in that \ncountry. I want to join him in expressing support for the aspirations \nof the Sri Lankan people for reconciliation, justice, and equitable \neconomic development.\n  Last week the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a \nresolution which, if faithfully implemented, could be the basis for a \nmeaningful and long overdue international role in Sri Lanka to hold \naccountable those involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity \nduring that country's brutal civil war.\n  After so many false starts, so many investigations and reports that \ndocumented widespread atrocities by both sides in the conflict, \nincluding rape, arbitrary detention, torture, the use of child \nsoldiers, summary executions, shelling of civilians, and forced \ndisappearances were ignored; and after recommendations to bring those \nresponsible to justice were ignored, the U.N. resolution affirms that \nthe Sri Lankan Government needs to put in place a judicial mechanism \nwith international participation.\n  The resolution refers to the recent report by the U.N. Office of the \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, which documented horrific abuses by \nthe Sri Lankan Armed Forces and LTTE rebels and the government's \nfailure over decades to punish those responsible. Among the report's \nkey recommendations is the establishment of a special court \n``integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and \ninvestigators'' with an independent Sri Lankan investigative and \nprosecuting body. No other mechanism would have the credibility and \nindependence to deliver real justice.\n  Let me repeat that because it is so important: No other mechanism \nwould have the credibility and independence to deliver real justice. \nThe refusal of past Sri Lankan Governments to accept this premise and \nto recognize that no one, including the armed forces, is above the law, \nis why so far no one has been held accountable.\n  To its credit, President Maithrapala Sirisena's government \ncosponsored the resolution, which was presented initially to the U.N. \nHuman Rights Council by the United States, United Kingdom, Montenegro, \nand Macedonia. The resolution, regarding a ``credible judicial \nprocess,'' ``affirms the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan \njudicial mechanism, including the Special Counsel's office, of \nCommonwealth and other foreign judges, defense lawyers, and authorized \nprosecutors and investigators.'' Having cosponsored the resolution, the \ngovernment should establish without delay a special tribunal that \nbrings together international investigators, prosecutors, and judges \nwith Sri Lankan counterparts who are protected from outside pressure \nand intimidation, as well as a program to protect witnesses. The United \nStates could provide assistance for such an effort.\n  The government will also need to ensure that violations of \ninternational law, including war crimes, disappearances, torture, and \nthe concept of command responsibility, are incorporated into Sri Lankan \nlaw, so that charges brought reflect the severity of the crimes and \ntarget those most responsible.\n  I have spoken previously about President Sirisena's initial \naccomplishments, including the adoption of the 19th Amendment to the \nconstitution, which curtails the extensive powers enjoyed by the \nExecutive and vests more power in the parliament, limits the \nPresidential term to 5 years instead of 6, and allows the President to \nhold office only for two terms instead of an unlimited number of terms.\n  Unlike the previous government, which persecuted its critics and \nlocked up after sham trials journalists who exposed corruption, \nPresident Sirisena has taken steps to reaffirm freedom of the press. \nUnder the previous government, Sri Lanka's judicial system was \npoliticized and corrupted. The new government is taking steps to \nreestablish the independence of the judiciary, which is fundamental to \nany democracy. And, as has been reported, the Government of Sri Lanka \nhas accepted many recommendations to improve the human rights \nsituation, including a repeal of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism \nAct and reforms to the Witness and Victim Protection Law, both long \ncalled for by victims' rights groups. The government has agreed to \naccelerate the return of lands confiscated by the security forces; to \nend the military's involvement in civilian activities in the country's \nnorth and east; to investigate allegations of attacks on civil society, \nthe media, and religious minorities; and to work toward devolution of \nauthority from Colombo, consistent with the 13th amendment to the \nconstitution.\n  President Sirisena has sought to erase the worst excesses and abuses \nof his predecessor and put his country on a path to reconciliation and \nprosperity. For this he deserves our support. The sooner the government \nmakes good on these commitments, the better, as the Sri Lankan people \nhave waited a very long time for a government that is serious about \nreconciliation, which means addressing the ethnic, religious, social, \neconomic, and political divisions and inequalities that were at the \nroot of the conflict.\n  The U.N. resolution is far from perfect. It has been pointed out that \nit lacks adequate provisions for international oversight of \nimplementation of its terms. The resolution only calls for an oral \nupdate from the High Commissioner in June 2016 and a written \nimplementation report in March 2017. The United States should not wait \nuntil next June to report to Congress on the government's progress in \ncomplying with the terms of the resolution. Despite its shortcomings, \nthe U.N. resolution points the way forward. A great deal of work lies \nahead. More than 6 years have passed since the war ended. Physical \nevidence has been lost or destroyed, people's memories fade, and \nwitnesses die. But the Sri Lankan people, and particularly those who \nsuffered grievous losses in the war, should take solace from the fact \nthat the international community has not forgotten them and that their \nown government may be ready to take the necessary steps to restore \naccountability and the rule of law to Sri Lanka.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7262-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7262-S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PALESTINIAN TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers are with the Israeli \npeople who are enduring a new escalation of Palestinian terrorism.\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\n  Last Thursday evening, a mother and father were murdered in front of \ntheir four children ages 9, 7, 4, and 4 months when Hamas terrorists \nopened fire on their car. A few days later, another Jewish family was \nwalking in the Old City of Jerusalem after praying at the Western Wall \nwhen a Palestinian terrorist went on a stabbing attack. He murdered the \nfather, along with another courageous man who rushed to the scene to \nthe family's aid. Both men leave behind their wives and nine children. \nIn addition to the four murdered, many more Israelis have been \nseriously wounded from car-ramming, rock-throwing, and brutal knife and \nscrewdriver stabbing attacks in what appears to be a fresh horror--an \nepidemic of low-tech, brutal attacks by militants who are acting on \ntheir own initiative.\n  These attacks have been incubated by the continued incitement and \nglorification of violence by the Palestinian leadership, most recently \nby President Mahmoud Abbas during his address at the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. He still has yet to categorically condemn these \nattacks. It is long past time for the United States and the \ninternational community to hold the Palestinians accountable for their \nincitement and support for terrorism, including through the financial \npayment to Palestinian terrorists who are jailed in Israel for \ncommitting acts of terrorism.\n  In yet another stark reminder of how closely our nations are \nconnected in this fight, the father murdered last Thursday, Eitam \nHenkin, was a dual Israeli-American citizen. The terrorist who killed \nhim did not care, as his sole intent was to kill Jews, not to engage in \na political process. There is no moral equivalence between Palestinian \nterrorism and the obligation of Israel to act in defense of its people. \nTo the Israeli people, especially those who are victims of terrorism \nand their families: I proudly stand in solidarity with you during this \nchallenging time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7263-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OBSERVING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Hispanic \nHeritage Month, a time to honor the many traditions and contributions \nof America's vibrant Hispanic community. This special time is \ncelebrated from September 15 to October 15 and honors the many \nAmericans whose ancestors originate from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, \nCentral America, and South America. I am proud to recognize this month \nin honor of the many Hispanic Americans who contribute so much to \ncommunities across our state and country.\n  Hispanic Americans make up the largest ethnic minority throughout our \nNation, as well as in Nevada. This community is an integral part of our \nState, helping shape our economy, trade, culture, and intrinsic Nevada \nfootprint. I am thankful for the hard work and dedication of the many \nHispanic Americans whose perseverance has greatly impacted the success \nof the Silver State. That is why I recently cosponsored a resolution \nrecognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and the fundamental role Hispanic \nAmericans have in the accomplishments of the United States. I am proud \nto support legislative efforts that distinguish the immense efforts \nbrought forth by this community.\n  Hispanic Americans play a critical role in our Nation's identity, \nespecially in 2015. As of August 2015, Latino workers represented \nnearly 17 percent of the workforce and exhibited the largest percentage \nof labor force participation of any ethnic group with nearly 63 \npercent. This community is made up of hard-working physicians, \nsurgeons, chief business executives, lawyers, educators, and many other \nprofessionals crucial to the success of our country. Latinos represent \none in four public school students and 19 percent of college students \nbetween the ages of 18 and 24. Hispanic Americans have served the \nUnited States in every war, helping bring freedom and democracy to our \ncountry. As of July 2015, 164,000 Active-Duty servicemembers from the \nHispanic community served and continue to serve our country, \nmaintaining these principal values. The vast influence this community \nhas had on our great Nation warrants only the greatest gratitude.\n  I ask that today and throughout the rest of this time set aside for \nHispanic Heritage Month, we recognize the many contributions that the \nHispanic community brings. I join citizens across the Silver State in \nthanking the many Hispanic Americans who have brought greater strength \nto our State and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7263-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   OBSERVING THE 104TH NATIONAL DAY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Taiwan is a fine example of democracy in \nthe Asia-Pacific region and is a trusted friend and trading partner to \nthe United States.

Mr. President, Sunday, October 11, 2015, is the \nInternational Day of the Girl. Started 4 years ago, this day is an \neffort to raise awareness of issues of gender inequality around the \nworld. This year the theme is ``The Power of the Adolescent Girl.'' As \nthe father of three daughters and two granddaughters, I am keenly aware \nof the power of our girls, as well as the challenges that they face.\n  For these reasons, I was proud to welcome a delegation of young women \nfrom Arkansas to my office in July. These ladies were attending a \nleadership summit here in Washington, D.C., and came to my office to \nadvocate on issues related to human trafficking, gender-based violence, \nchildhood education, and more. I am very proud of them and their \nefforts to fight the problems girls face around the world.\n  Across the globe, girls and young women face incredible odds and \nchallenges. Over the last 15 years, work by the United States and our \npartners has resulted in real change. Girls are now more likely than \never to enroll in primary school and receive important vaccinations and \nare much less likely to suffer health and nutritional problems than \never before. It is important that we continue these efforts, along with \nour partners, to solidify the gains that we have made and reach for \neven greater successes.\n  I thank the young women from Arkansas and across the country who are \nmaking the crucial effort to advocate for those who do not have a \nvoice. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our \nchildren inherit a world of increased possibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7263-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7263-S7264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DETECTIVE WILLIAM J.

Detective Zimmerman \nserved as the first president of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the \nAssociation of Threat Assessment Professionals, and in 2004, he became \nthe inaugural recipient of the association's distinguished Meritorious \nService Award.\n  Throughout his career, Detective Zimmerman consistently went above \nand beyond the call of duty to protect and serve.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions at the hearing titled, ``Stealing the \nDream of Business Ownership: The NLRB's Joint Employer decision.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Joint Employer Decision\n\n       This morning we are having a hearing about the recent \n     National Labor Relations Board decision that threatens to \n     steal the American dream from owners of the nation's 780,000 \n     franchise businesses and millions of contractors.\n       We will also discuss the legislation I have introduced to \n     undo this decision.\n       Last week, I met a man named Aslam Khan. He is an immigrant \n     from Pakistan who started out as a dishwasher at Church's \n     Chicken and who today has become a very successful owner of \n     Church's Chicken franchises.\n       He talked about achieving the American Dream. He said it \n     was possible because of our nation's ``free enterprise, \n     entrepreneurial spirit.''\n       But on August 27, the National Labor Relations Board \n     released a decision that threatens to steal the American \n     dream from owners of the nation's 780,000 franchise \n     businesses and millions of contractors.\n       It threatens to destroy that free enterprise, \n     entrepreneurial spirit.\n       The labor board's new ``joint employer'' standard will make \n     big businesses bigger and make the middle class smaller by \n     discouraging larger companies from franchising and \n     contracting work to small businesses.\n       It is the biggest attack on the opportunity for small \n     businessmen and women in this country to make their way into \n     the middle class that we've seen in a long, long time--and I \n     am committed to fighting it with legislation that already has \n     45 cosponsors in the Senate and bipartisan support in the \n     House.\n       For three decades, federal labor policies have held that \n     two separate employers are ``joint employers'' if both have \n     direct and immediate control over employment terms and \n     working conditions.\n       That means two employers who are both responsible for tasks \n     like hiring and firing, setting work hours, issuing direction \n     to employees, determining compensation and handling day to \n     day record keeping.\n       Under the new ``joint employer'' standard adopted in August \n     in Browning Ferris Industries, a 3-2 NLRB majority said that \n     merely indirect control or even unexercised potential to \n     control working conditions could make a franchisee and \n     franchisor joint employers.\n       That means that for all these franchisees and contractors \n     who have worked so hard to build businesses in their \n     communities, hire the right people, and spend 12 hours a day \n     serving customers, meeting a payroll, dealing with government \n     regulations, paying taxes, and trying to make a profit--they \n     will no longer be considered their workers' sole employer. \n     Rather, they are just one of their workers' employers.\n       And for the businesses that have franchised their brand or \n     used subcontractors to haul their waste or clean their \n     offices--and are now considered one of the employers of those \n     companies' workers--there will be a huge incentive to retake \n     control of those franchises, and retake control of those \n     contracted tasks. Because if you're going to have all the \n     liability of being the boss, you're much better off actually \n     being the boss.\n       If those businesses stop using franchisees and \n     subcontractors, their costs go up. The system of letting \n     other businesses invest their capital in carrying forward \n     your business goal evaporates.\n       When costs go up, these businesses lose their ability to \n     grow and create more jobs.\n       As joint employers, business owners will be forced to \n     engage in collective bargaining and share liability for labor \n     law violations.\n       As this new standard is applied, we will learn just how \n     much liability an employer will face for another employer's \n     decisions. Will she be required to contribute to healthcare \n     costs, workers compensation and pension funds? Will this \n     scheme mean new ``joint employers'' will be on the hook for \n     notoriously underfunded multi-employer pension plans?\n       As if facing legal liability for another employer's labor \n     problems isn't bad enough, the Administration is about to \n     make it even more costly.\n       The President and his Department of Labor are currently in \n     the process of finalizing regulations that will increase the \n     impact of having labor law violations on your record if you \n     want to contract with the federal government.\n       Under the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulation, labor \n     law violations will be counted against federal contractors \n     when they bid for contracts.\n       This change also harms employees:\n       Millions of employees will lose the ability to negotiate \n     things like pay, hours and leave time with their direct \n     supervisor, because those decisions will now be made between \n     the larger employer and the union.\n       As one employee put it in an interview with a local Denver \n     news channel: ``I would be just another number to a \n     corporation. I'm a person to my employer now.''\n       Franchising will be particularly impacted by this decision.\n       In my opinion, this is one of the biggest attacks on the \n     opportunity for small businessmen and women in this country \n     to make their way into the middle class that we've seen.\n       There are 780,000 franchise establishments across this \n     country--and they create nearly 9 million jobs.\n       Last week I met with a Chattanooga, Tennessee, couple who \n     started their own franchisee location of ``Two Men and a \n     Truck,'' a moving company.\n       With hard work and commitment, they have been able to grow \n     that first franchise into 6 locations. They would like to \n     continue growing but this new NLRB decision is causing them \n     to put those plans on hold.\n       The Two Men and a Truck franchisor is an excellent example \n     of how franchising allow entry into business ownership and \n     the middle class. It was started in Michigan by a mom who had \n     two sons she was ready to put to work. Her first franchisee \n     was her daughter.\n       It has now grown to 220 franchisees, who have created 8,000 \n     jobs.\n       38 percent of their franchisees began by working on a \n     truck.\n       75 percent of Two Men and Truck managers began by working \n     on a truck.\n       Successfully operating a franchise business is today one of \n     the most important ways to climb the ladder of success.\n       The International Franchise Association estimates that \n     every $1 million in lending to starting or growing \n     franchisees creates 40 jobs.\n       Franchising has been a way for many women and minorities to \n     jump into business ownership.\n       Women own or co-own nearly half of all franchise \n     businesses.\n       Minorities own about 20 percent of all franchises.\n       Why would the NLRB want to cut off this business model, as \n     well as the opportunity of millions of small, local \n     subcontractors to work with larger companies?\n       The Protecting Local Business Opportunity Act (S. 2015) \n     would roll back the NLRB ruling and reaffirm that an employer \n     must exercise actual, direct and immediate control over \n     essential terms and conditions of employment.\n       This is the commonsense standard that has been applied for \n     decades.\n       We have 45 cosponsors on S. 2015 already, and 60 cosponsors \n     on the House bill, including 3 House Democrats. I hope we \n     will be able to add more.\n       This is an issue that is so important--I believe that \n     Congress must act as soon as possible to stop this \n     destructive policy change from damaging the middle class \n     growth that has made this nation what it is today.\n       I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7264-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7264-S7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING BOB WHEELER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and service \nof Bob Wheeler, whose passing signifies a great loss to Nevada. I send \nmy condolences and prayers to his wife, M.J., and all of Mr. Wheeler's \nfamily in this time of mourning. Mr. Wheeler was a man of great wisdom, \ncommitted to his family, his country, his State, and his community. He \nwill be greatly missed.\n  Mr. Wheeler joined the U.S. Air Force in November of 1962, serving in \nthe pararescue career field. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Wheeler \nremained\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\ndedicated and worked his way up to chief of pararescue. He was \nrecognized as a true innovator in his leadership position, opening the \ndoor for free-fall parachuting and combat tactics. He led by example, \nworking diligently and earnestly to help those around him and to \nprotect our country.\n  Mr. Wheeler is credited with saving 28 lives throughout his career, \nincluding vulnerable aviators who had crashed and distressed seamen in \nthe Vietnam war. He was distinguished in his military decorations, \nwhich included the Distinguished Flying Cross for Valor, the Airman's \nMedal, numerous commendation medals, 17 Air Medals, and SEA services \nribbons. During the Cold War, Mr. Wheeler participated in a high-risk \nscuba jump mission to save civilian lives. His courage and success \nthroughout the mission earned him not only Yugoslavia's ``Nation's Life \nSaving Award'' but also the admiration of the Government and people of \nYugoslavia. Mr. Wheeler retired from the U.S. Air Force in 1982. His \naccolades are well deserved, and his bravery in achieving them will \nnever be forgotten.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Wheeler personally, as he \nserved on my Northern Nevada Veterans Advisory Council. We worked as a \nteam, along with the rest of the council, to help improve resources for \nNevada's veteran community. Mr. Wheeler had a vast understanding of \nNevada's tight-knit veteran community and was always there to take a \nstand for those who served. His firsthand knowledge of combat and \nveterans needs could never be replicated--he was one of a kind, and I \nam thankful to have had him as an ally in helping Nevada's veterans.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to M.J. and all of Mr. Wheeler's \nfamily. We will always remember him for his courageous contributions to \nthe United States of America. His service to his country and dedication \nto his family and community earn him a place among the outstanding men \nand women who have valiantly defended our Nation. His legacy of \nunwavering bravery and genuine compassion will live on for years to \ncome.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Wheeler maintained a dedication to keeping \nthis great Nation safe and to helping Nevada's veteran community. I am \nhonored to commend his many contributions and achievements. His \npatriotism and drive will never be forgotten. Today, I join citizens \nacross the Silver State in celebrating the life of an upstanding \nNevadan, Bob Wheeler.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7265-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HAROLD CASKEY\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to honor Harold Caskey, \na former Missouri State senator of Butler in Bates County, MO, with \nwhom I had the great pleasure of serving in the Missouri General \nAssembly. Harold was one of Missouri's most influential legislators. \nHarold was known by many as ``the old lion''--a reference to his \ndoggedness in debating. A dedicated public servant, Harold will be \nremembered for his love of family, his community in western and west \ncentral Missouri, and the State. Harold was blind, but he never let \nthis prevent him from succeeding. Harold was a whip smart, strategic, \nloyal and hard-working man who conquered adversity. The State of \nMissouri has lost a special man, and he will be greatly missed and \nnever duplicated.\n  Harold was born in Hume, MO, in 1938. During childhood, Harold became \nlegally blind due to a genetic condition, but this did not prevent him \nfrom being a stellar student and becoming his high school's senior \nclass valedictorian. He attended Central Missouri State University at \nWarrensburg, now the University of Central Missouri, where he graduated \nmagna cum laude with dual majors in psychology and sociology. He then \nearned his law degree at the University of Missouri-Columbia, where he \nwas elected to the Order of the Coif.\n  After earning his law degree, Harold started practicing law in the \noffice of former Missouri State Senator William Cason in Clinton. In \n1965, Harold started his own law practice in Butler. He was elected \nprosecutor for Bates County in 1967 and served three terms, ending in \n1973. Harold continued his public service by serving as the city \nattorney for the communities of Butler and Rich Hill from 1973 to 1976. \nHarold was also an assistant professor in law enforcement and business \neducation at Northeast Missouri State University, now Truman State \nUniversity, in Kirksville.\n  Harold began his tenure in the Missouri Senate after winning election \nin 1976 and served for 28 years before retiring in 2004 due to newly \nenacted term limits. He was chairman of the Senate Civil and Criminal \nJurisprudence Committee and the Senate Ethics Committee and vice \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the Missouri Senate, he \nwas a tireless advocate for rural public education and sponsored \ninfluential public school laws, such as the 1993 Outstanding Schools \nAct, which significantly increased state public school funding and \nmandated higher school standards. As a member of the Missouri \nCommission on Performance, Harold advised the State Department of \nElementary and Secondary Education on education reform and school \nfinance. Harold had great influence over Missouri's criminal justice \nlaws by increasing sentences for the most violent and, at the end of \nhis term, sponsoring a sentencing reform bill that reduced some \nsentences for less serious offenders. He was also a passionate leader \nand advocate for the visually impaired and disabled. Harold served as \nvice chairman of the Missouri State Capitol Commission until his \npassing.\n  Harold received numerous honors for his legislative accomplishments, \nincluding recognitions from the Missouri Planning Council for \nDevelopmental Disabilities, the Public Telecommunications Association \nof Missouri, the Missouri Deputy Sheriffs Association, the Judicial \nConference of Missouri, the Missouri Association of Counties, the \nMissouri Association of Pharmacists, the Missouri Association of \nProsecuting Attorneys, the Missouri Cable Television Association, the \nMissouri Crime Commission, the Missouri Police Chiefs' Association, the \nAmerican Business Women's Association, and the Cooperating School \nDistricts of Suburban Kansas City.\n  Outside his work as an elected official, Harold's dedication to his \ncommunity was passionate and unselfish as he served in countless ways, \nincluding as a member of the Rotary Club of Butler, the Missouri Bar \nAssociation, the Crescent Hill Masonic Lodge No. 368 A.F. and A.M., the \nScottish Rite of Free Masonry in the Valley of Orient in Kansas City, \nMO, and the Ararat Shrine. He was also an honorary fellow of the Harry \nS. Truman Library Institute for National and International Affairs, a \nmember of the Bates County Memorial Hospital Board of Trustees, and a \nmember of Butler First Baptist Church.\n  Harold is survived by his wife, Kay; son, Kyle; sister, Velma Elaine \nMay; and brothers, Robert, Leon, and Ray Lee. I witnessed firsthand his \nstrong leadership and tenacious commitment to issues he cared about. I \nam grateful for the wisdom, knowledge, and lessons Harold shared with \nme. He made me a better legislator and public servant. While one might \nhave seen Harold as intimidating or stern, he was secretly a sweet \nsoftie--kind and gentle.\n  I am deeply saddened by his passing and join his family and friends \nin reflecting on his many life accomplishments. Harold touched the \nlives of many and will be remembered as an invaluable public servant to \nthe State of Missouri and an inspiration to all.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring Harold Caskey.\n  (At the request of Mr. Lee, the following statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7265-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7265-S7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE TAMPA BAY ESTUARY PROGRAM\n\n Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I recognize and commend the \nTampa Bay Estuary Program and its historic milestone in exceeding a 23-\nyear goal by restoring more than 40,000 acres of sea grass in Tampa \nBay. This outstanding accomplishment represents the great collaborative \nwork to restore one of the greatest treasures this Nation has to offer, \nFlorida's Gulf Coast. The improved estuary will have an immeasurable \nimpact on the future of the State's environment and economy.\n  Since its establishment in 1991, the Tampa Bay Estuary Program has \npartnered with the Southwest Florida Water Management District and \nother state and local municipalities and local\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\nbusinesses to restore and protect Florida's largest open water estuary. \nAs the Tampa Bay region is home to a population of more than 2 million \npeople, this valuable estuary serves as a diverse ecosystem for plant \nand wildlife and is an economic driver for the region.\n  After decades of voluntary effort, I am proud to learn how successful \nthe Tampa Bay Estuary Program was in its environmental restoration by \nexceeding its original goal in recovering seagrass, to improve fish and \nwildlife populations, and to maintain the highest quality of water \nsince the 1950s. From 2012 until 2014, the Tampa Bay Estuary Program's \nefforts were able to restore 5,000 acres of life-sustaining underwater \ngrasses in Tampa Bay, which now total 40,295 acres of seagrasses. This \namount significantly surpasses its original goal set in 1995 of \nharboring 38,000 acres.\n  Although Tampa and its surrounding cities have seen an increase in \npopulation since 1950, the Tampa Bay Estuary Program's Nitrogen \nManagement Consortium, which includes local governments and agencies \nsupporting voluntary environmental recovery, has invested over $500 \nmillion since the 1990s. The strategy developed by the Consortium \ncontinues to set standards that could serve as a model for and be \nimplemented across the nation in other estuary recovery programs.\n  I am proud that the Tampa Bay Estuary Program aided in recovering sea \ngrass in Florida's Tampa Bay. I whole heartedly commend the Tampa Bay \nEstuary Program on its accomplishments over the past 23 years and wish \nit further success in its continued endeavors to protect our natural \nresources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7266-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7266-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7266-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3192.

A bill to reauthorize the Scholarships for Opportunity and \nResults Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenator Ron Johnson, Senator Tim Scott, and Senator Cory Booker to \nintroduce the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act, bipartisan \nlegislation to extend the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n  I am a long-time supporter of this important program, which provides \nlow-income students residing in the District of Columbia the \nopportunity to improve academically by attending a private school of \ntheir choice.\n  Without this platform, D.C.'s most disadvantaged students would not \nhave access to a high-quality education, including smaller class sizes \nand effective curriculum. That is not right. All\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\nstudents should have the same opportunity to learn and thrive.\n  The Opportunity Scholarship is a successful and transformative \nprogram. It has shown promising results in raising student achievement. \nAccording to data released by the program administrator for the 2014-\n2015 school year, 90 percent of scholarship students graduated from \nhigh school and 88 percent of those graduates are enrolled in a 2- or \n4-year college or university. The Opportunity Scholarship Program's \ngraduation rate is more than 30 percentage points higher than D.C. \nPublic Schools' rate, which stands at only 58 percent, well below the \nnational average of 81 percent.\n  For the 2015-2016 school year, there were more than 8,500 names on \nwaiting lists at D.C. charter schools, an 18 percent increase over last \nyear. This shows the demand for high-quality education in this city and \nunfortunately, the shortage to meet that demand.\n  I have worked on this legislation with my House colleague, Speaker \nJohn Boehner, for many years. I also had my staff visit schools and \ntalk to administrators and parents about ways to improve the program so \nthat it can fully meet the goal of providing a better education to low-\nincome families in the District's lowest-performing schools.\n  I am pleased that this legislation strengthens the program by \nrequiring participating schools to acquire and maintain accreditation, \nand by ensuring that an evaluation study truly assess the effectiveness \nof the scholarship, including how it affects academic achievement for \nscholarship recipients.\n  I am pleased that Senators Johnson, Scott and Booker have joined me \nas original cosponsors of this bill. I remain fully committed to the \nsuccess of the program, and I believe this reauthorization bill makes \ncritical improvements to ensure that scholarships continue to transform \nthe lives of the District's most vulnerable students.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Tester, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 2172. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprotections for consumers against excessive, unjustified, or unfairly \ndiscriminatory increases in premium rates; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, great progress has been made in \nimproving oversight of health insurance companies, holding them \naccountable for how premium dollars are spent, and increasing access to \naffordable health insurance. Even so, there is still work to be done to \nprotect consumers from unreasonable and excessive health insurance rate \nincreases.\n  Through the Affordable Care Act, health insurance rate increases \ngreater than 10 percent must be publicly posted and include an \nexplanation for the increase. The increases are reviewed by States, and \nthe Federal Government steps in when States opt out from participating \nin the review process.\n  This is a good first step, which has helped reduce increases, but it \nisn't enough. The enforcement authority to block or modify unreasonable \nrate increases is key to providing strong consumer protection.\n  In 2011, 43 percent of requested rate increases for health insurance \nrates on the individual market were larger than 10 percent. In 2013, 25 \npercent of plans had an increase greater than 10 percent.\n  This shows progress, but not enough. Health insurance companies can \nstill get away with putting profits before patients. Affordability of \nhealth insurance is vital in continuing to decrease the number of \nuninsured Americans, and to ensure that families can access coverage.\n  Currently, 13 States still have little or no authority to block or \nmodify excessive rate increases in the individual and small group \nmarkets. Even when regulators in these States find an increase to be \nunreasonable and unjustified, they have no ability to block or modify \nthe increase.\n  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Rates Act creates a \nFederal fallback option for States currently lacking this authority. \nThis will protect consumers regardless of the State they live in, and \nimprove accountability for insurance companies attempting to raise \npremium prices without adequate justification.\n  This solution is simple: in States where the insurance regulator does \nnot have or use authority to block unreasonable rate increases, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services can do so.\n  In some States, like California, companies are not required to get \nprior authorization for rate increases to go into effect. California \ninsurance regulators with the Department of Insurance and Department of \nManaged Care review rates, but when they find rate increases to be \nunjustified and unreasonable, they have no authority to stop or adjust \nthe price increases.\n  Just a few months ago, Aetna raised rates for a small business plan \nthat, on average, was an increase of 21 percent and affected \napproximately 13,000 people. The California Department of Managed Care \nhad found the increase to be unreasonable, but couldn't stop it from \ngoing into effect.\n  In many States we can already see that this type of authority is \nworking, and this bill doesn't interfere at all with what they are \ndoing.\n  For example, in New York, insurers requested an average of a 13.5 \npercentage increase for 2016 premiums. Regulators disagreed and reduced \nthe increase by nearly half, so consumers in that State will see a 7.1 \npercent increase instead.\n  In Connecticut, a UnitedHealthcare plan wanted to raise rates by 12.4 \npercent for 2016. After regulators reviewed the request, they approved \na 5.5 percent increase instead. For one plan in the State offered by \nConnectiCare, a small increase was denied and consumers will actually \nsee a reduction in their premiums for 2016.\n  Regulators in Vermont reduced the increase that 65,000 residents of \nthe State would have faced in 2016--the proposed hike was 8.6 percent \nand the approved rate increase was 5.9 percent.\n  Any unreasonable rate increase that perpetuates year after year is \nunacceptable, and makes a big impact on a family's budget.\n  All consumers deserve to have fully effective health insurance rate \nreview and enforcement. This bill closes the final gap in this process \nand ensures that these protections are available for the entire \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Protecting \nConsumers from Unreasonable Rates Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Portman, and Mrs. \n        Capito):\n  S. 2174. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor the preparation of career and technical education teachers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, in today's increasingly competitive global \neconomy, America's success will depend on the talent of its workforce. \nIn cultivating the workforce necessary to succeed, we need to look at \nways to expand opportunities for students, and refocus our Nation's \neducation strategy to meet the demands of the industry in the 21st \ncentury. Career and technical education, CTE, programs play a vital \nrole in increasing student engagement, continuing our nation's economic \ncompetitiveness, and building the skills of our country's workforce.\n  We are beginning to see a renaissance of student interest in career \nand technical education, but school districts across the Nation are \nfacing critical shortages in high-quality CTE teachers. While the \nHigher Education and Opportunity Act of 2008 provides grants for \nteacher residency partnership programs to colleges and universities who \nwork with high-needs school districts to train prospective teachers, no \nCTE-focused partnerships exist.\n  That is why I am introducing with my colleagues, Senator Baldwin, \nSenator Portman and Senator Capito the Creating Quality Technical \nEducators Act, which would create a CTE teacher-training grant \npartnership to give aspiring CTE teachers the experience necessary to \nmirror their success in the business world with that in the classroom. \nThis legislation would foster teacher training partnerships between \nhigh-needs secondary schools and post-secondary institutions to create \na 1-year residency initiative for teachers and includes teacher \nmentorship for a minimum of 2 years. When CTE teachers have work \nexperience in a related industry before entering the classroom, \nstudents not only\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\nbenefit from their hands-on knowledge, but also look to them as career \nmodels.\n  The Creating Quality Technical Educators Act would amend the Higher \nEducation and Opportunity Act to give aspiring CTE teachers real-world \nexperience and develop credible skills to apply in the classroom. This \nbipartisan bill takes a proactive approach to recruiting and training \nmore high-quality CTE teachers. In addition to mid-career professionals \nin related technical fields, CTE teacher residencies would target \nteacher candidates who are recent college graduates, veterans, and \ncurrently licensed teachers with a need for technical skills training \nwho seek to become transition into CTE fields.\n  As co-chair of the Senate CTE Caucus, I am proud to introduce this \ncommonsense, bipartisan legislation to recruit and train talented \nteachers to meet the rising need for CTE. The Creating Quality \nTechnical Educators Act takes an important step to ensure students in \ncommunities of all sizes have access to high-quality CTE teachers and \ncareer-training programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Franken, and Mr. King):\n  S. 2176. A bill to expand the use of open textbooks in order to \nachieve savings for students; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a \n     barrier for many students in achieving higher education.\n       (2) According to the College Board, during the 2014-2015 \n     academic year, the average student budget for college books \n     and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher \n     education was $1,225.\n       (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new \n     textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012 \n     and that although Federal efforts to increase price \n     transparency have provided students and families with more \n     and better information, more must be done to address rising \n     costs.\n       (4) The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and \n     sharing of digital content, including open educational \n     resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and \n     members of the public.\n       (5) Using open educational resources in place of \n     traditional materials in large-enrollment college courses can \n     reduce textbook costs by 80 to 100 percent.\n       (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open \n     educational resources could significantly lower college \n     textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher \n     education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 284\n\n       Whereas on October 10, 2015, World Mental Health Day is \n     observed;\n       Whereas mental health is essential to achieve the full \n     potential of an individual and mental health disorders can \n     affect the ability of an individual to carry out daily tasks, \n     establish or maintain relationships, or pursue other \n     fundamental endeavors;\n       Whereas mental health disorders and substance use disorders \n     are the leading causes of disability globally;\n       Whereas depression is the third leading cause of disease \n     burden globally, and by 2030, depression will be the highest \n     cause of disease burden in low-income countries and the \n     second highest cause of disease burden in middle-income \n     countries;\n       Whereas depression has a particularly negative impact on \n     women, for whom depression is the leading cause of disease \n     burden independent of the income level of their countries of \n     residence;\n       Whereas approximately 3,000 suicide deaths occur each day \n     globally;\n       Whereas for each completed suicide, 20 more individuals \n     attempt to commit suicide;\n       Whereas up to 90 percent of individuals who commit suicide \n     have a diagnosable mental health disorder;\n       Whereas serious and persistent mental illness, such as \n     schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, affects up to 7 percent \n     of the population of the world and is extremely debilitating;\n       Whereas the global cost of mental health disorders was \n     $2,500,000,000,000 in 2010, and is projected to increase to \n     more than $6,000,000,000,000 by 2030, but the total amount of \n     development assistance for global mental health was only \n     $134,000,000 between 2007 and 2013, less than 1 percent of \n     all development assistance;\n       Whereas in high-income countries, approximately \\1/2\\ of \n     individuals afflicted with mental health disorders do not \n     receive appropriate mental health care;\n       Whereas in low-income countries, approximately 85 percent \n     to 90 percent of individuals afflicted with mental health \n     disorders do not receive appropriate mental health care;\n       Whereas traumatic events and losses are common experiences, \n     especially among refugees and internally displaced \n     individuals, and may--\n       (1) double the incidence of mental health disorders;\n       (2) result in intense suffering and dysfunction;

Res. 286\n\n       Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Pelican Island in \n     Florida;\n       Whereas, in 2015, the National Wildlife Refuge System, \n     administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     is the premier system of lands and waters to conserve\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\n     wildlife in the world, and has grown to approximately \n     150,000,000 acres, 563 national wildlife refuges, and 38 \n     wetland management districts in every State and territory of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the United States, and these protected lands offer a variety \n     of recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas, in 2015, 336 units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System have hunting programs and 275 units of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System have fishing programs, averaging \n     approximately 2,500,000 hunting visits and nearly 7,000,000 \n     fishing visits each year;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experienced \n     nearly 30,000,000 wildlife observation visits during fiscal \n     year 2014;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas, for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate nearly $5 in economic activity;\n       Whereas visitation to the National Wildlife Refuge System \n     increased by nearly 27 percent from 2005 to 2014;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences \n     over 47,000,000 visits each year, which generated more than \n     $2,400,000,000 and more than 35,000 jobs in local economies \n     during fiscal year 2011;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal \n     lands that foster production, migration, and wintering \n     habitat for waterfowl;\n       Whereas, since 1934, the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to \n     outdoor enthusiasts has generated more than $850,000,000 in \n     funds, which has enabled the purchase or lease of more than \n     5,700,000 acres of habitat for waterfowl and numerous other \n     species in the National Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas the recovery of 386 threatened and endangered \n     species is supported on refuge lands;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas nearly 36,000 volunteers and approximately 200 \n     national wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute \n     more than 1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent of nearly \n     700 full-time employees, and provide an important link to \n     local communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater \n     appreciation for the natural world;\n       Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges \n     located in several urban and suburban areas and a refuge \n     located within an hour drive of every metropolitan area in \n     the United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, \n     and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the United States have \n     held festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will \n     continue to seek stakeholder input on the implementation of \n     ``Conserving the Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next \n     Generation'', an update to the strategic plan of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service for the future of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 11, 2015, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service; and\n       Whereas the designation of National Wildlife Refuge Week by \n     the Senate would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States, raise awareness about the \n     importance of wildlife and the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System, and celebrate the myriad recreational opportunities \n     available to enjoy this network of protected lands: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 11, 2015, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) encourages the observance of National Wildlife

future generations;\n       (5) identifies the significance of national wildlife \n     refuges in advancing the traditions of wildlife observation, \n     photography, environmental education, and interpretation;\n       (6) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges \n     to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled \n     species and ecosystems, as well as compatible uses;\n       (7) acknowledges the role of national wildlife refuges in \n     conserving waterfowl and waterfowl habitat pursuant to the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act (40 Stat. 755, chapter 128);\n       (8) reaffirms the support of the Senate for wildlife \n     conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System; and\n       (9) expresses the intent of the Senate--\n       (A) to

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 285) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, just over a year ago, I attended a dual \ncelebration in the Town of Reston, VA--50 years since the town's \nfounding and 100 years since the birth of its founder. That founder, \nRobert E. Simon, Jr., whose initials were the basis for naming the \ntown, passed away on September 21st at the age of 101.\n  Bob Simon was a visionary who recognized that all humans ought to be \nable to live together and be neighbors. His vision was of a community \nin which people could live, work, and play in the same general area. He \nbelieved that features like natural landscaping, open plazas, and \npublic art were important to building a vibrant community and fostering \na sense of place. Today we would call that ``smart growth,'' but to \nBob, it was simply common-sense. His vision was ahead of its time in \nanother way. It was a vision of a community in which people of all \nraces and income levels could coexist--a vision that was not yet shared \nby all in the segregated Virginia of the early 1960s.\n  The legacy of Bob Simon will live on in the community he created and \nloved. I and my Virginia colleague Senator Mark Warner ask the Senate \nto formally commemorate Bob and the ideals he championed in his life's \nwork of a better and more just America.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/senate-section/article/S7281-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE WEEK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
