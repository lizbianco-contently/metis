Mr. President, last night, President Obama spoke in stark \nterms about the threat terrorism poses to the United States. He \ndetailed the extraordinary efforts our government is taking to protect \nAmericans. He also outlined a strong plan for continuing to combat \nterrorism at home and abroad. President Obama is right to say the first \nthing Congress should do is close the loophole that lets the FBI terror \nsuspects buy assault weapons such as those used in the San Bernardino \nshooting.\n  Senate Democrats support President Obama's plan to fight ISIS and \nprotect America. President Obama has made it clear that Democrats do \nnot believe we should put thousands of troops on the ground in the \nmiddle of another civil war in the Middle East. But we do support the \nPresident's strategy of continuing to go after ISIS in the air with our \ncoalition partners, targeting their leadership, oil infrastructure, and \nheavy weapons.\n  We know that it must be the local forces on the ground that \nultimately fight for and hold their ground because it is their land.\n  Senate Democrats understand that the Syrian war will only be resolved \ndiplomatically, with all parties supporting the removal of Assad. We \nalso know that we can do more to address the threats from terrorists. \nThat is why beginning today Senate Democrats will unveil a series of \nproposals to take the fight to ISIS while enhancing our protection of \nAmericans at home.\n  There are a few important steps we must take in order to combat \nISIS's terrorism. The Democratic plan would create a new ISIS czar, one \nperson who is fully empowered and unifies the Federal Government's \nefforts in fighting ISIS. We did it with Ebola. We certainly can do it \nwith this scourge that is facing our country, ISIS. I am pleased that \nPresident Obama has taken a first step in that direction.\n  To continue targeted airstrikes on ISIS strongholds and oil supplies \nand to increase support for anti-ISIS local fighters on the ground are \npart of the plan.\n  We must also cut off ISIS money through new sanctions.\n  ISIS runs its reign of terror in Iraq and Syria through extortion, \noil sales, and theft. Senate Democrats' legislation imposes new \nsanctions--and they are tough--including a cutoff from the U.S. and \ninternational financial systems if people knowingly facilitate \nfinancial transactions with ISIS.\n  One of the things that would help is that we have a person who has \nbeen waiting for hundreds of days to be confirmed. What is his job? He \nworks in the Treasury Department with the State Department to stop \nfinancing of terrorism. The Republicans--for reasons totally not \nunderstood by anyone--are blocking voting on this person. The job is \nvacant.\n  We also believe that we should improve intelligence training between \nthe United States and our allies in the fight against ISIS. Some of \nthat has started, of course.\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\n  We believe we must screen and support migrants in Europe and the \nMiddle East. Europe is facing an unprecedented number of migrants \nlanding on their shores, almost 1 million this year. Their screening \nsystems have been overwhelmed by the large number of migrants. Our bill \nwould respond to Europeans' request to provide them with technical \nassistance to screen migrants and improve their own border security and \nour security as well.\n  In the Middle East, the Democrats' plan will help Jordan, a strong \nU.S. ally at the forefront of the migrant crisis. Four million people \nare displaced in the region, creating instability in Jordan, our ally, \nand also harming the neighboring countries. Democrats' legislation \nincludes a new stabilization fund for Jordan and Lebanon, helping those \nfleeing the conflict in Syria stay in the region, closer to home.\n  These are just a few of the components of our plan to degrade and \ndestroy ISIS, but we are equally committed to thwarting terrorism here \nat home. The Democratic plan would close the terrorist's gun loophole.\n  As of today, there is a legal loophole that prevents law enforcement \nfrom verifying that potential gun buyers are not FBI terror suspects. \nThat means if a person has pledged allegiance to ISIS online and is \nbarred from flying due to the threat they pose, that man or woman can \nstill walk into any gunshop and purchase weapons and ammunition. They \ncan do that today, right now. That is wrong.\n  Last Thursday Democrats tried to pass legislation to give law \nenforcement the tools needed to prevent the sale of guns to suspected \nterrorists. Republicans blocked our commonsense measure. We are not \nfinished. We will bring this vote to the floor as often as we can. That \nis the way it should be.\n  We need to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program. It was amazing to see \nthe Republicans running for President waffle and weasel out of why \nsomeone who is on a flight-risk status, someone who cannot fly, should \nbe able to buy a gun. It was interesting to see on the Sunday shows the \nRepublicans waffle and weasel through answers on this subject.\n  We need to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program so ISIS fighters cannot \naccess the program and travel to our country. This includes requiring \nvisa waiver travelers to use machine-readable passports, requiring \ninformation sharing rules with visa waiver countries and requiring visa \nwaiver countries to enter into agreements regarding the air marshal \nprogram and to comply with U.S. aviation and airport security \nstandards.\n  We must improve aviation security. We must work to secure our \nairports. We saw all the news when ISIS brought down a Russian plane \nwith hundreds of passengers aboard.\n  A recent report from the Homeland Security inspector general found \nthat 73 workers with access to secure areas in airports had links to \nterrorism--stunning. Our legislation authorizes new vetting for \naviation workers and new security measures for the most important areas \nof our airports.\n  We must lock down radiological materials to stop a dirty bomb. With \nboth ISIS and Al Qaeda saying they want to get their hands on weapons \nof mass destruction, it is disturbing that there are 2,300 sites around \nthe United States with radiological material. Our legislation requires \na new plan for locking down those materials at the places where they \nare held, such as universities and hospitals, so we can reduce the \nthreat of a dirty bomb.\n  Our legislation is concerned--and we are going to do everything we \ncan--with preventing homegrown terrorists by creating an office within \nthe Department of Homeland Security tasked with countering extremism.\n  We must address encryption by directing the National Academy of \nSciences, the intelligence community, and the private sector to work \ntogether to identify new encryption technology and how it is used to \nmake sure that our national security needs and technology policies are \nnot working at cross purposes.\n  Finally, Senate Democrats are proposing legislation to provide law \nenforcement agencies with grant money to help prepare for active \nshooter situations. We know how critical first responders are to \ncontaining and ending active shooter attacks. So we should ensure they \nhave all the tools necessary.\n  This is the plan that we, Senate Democrats, are putting forward. It \nis comprehensive. It addresses international and domestic concerns. The \nconsequences of inaction are too grave for us to waste time seeking \npolitical gain.\n  The security of our Nation and the decimation of ISIS depend on the \nsteps we take now. So I hope Republicans will join us to implement \nthese logical reforms that place the security of Americans first and \naddress the threat of ISIS around the world.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor wishing to speak.\n  Would the Chair announce the program for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8428-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the tremendous \nwork that has been done over the course of this year to pass a \nbipartisan, 5-year, $305 billion highway bill, the Fixing America's \nSurface Transportation Act, known as the FAST Act. Transportation \ninfrastructure is an essential part of the U.S. economy. It serves as \nthe foundation to support our country's economic global competitiveness \nand connects communities, people, and markets.\n  Federal investment in transportation and other infrastructure has, \nunfortunately, lagged in recent decades, with public expenditures on \ninfrastructure as a percentage of GDP steadily declining to its lowest \nlevels in 20 years. I have consistently called for a highway bill that \nensures steady and reliable funding for States so they can make long-\nterm plans for improving our crumbling infrastructure. For too long, \nstopgap measures to prop up the highway trust fund for just a few \nmonths at a time have failed to provide the stability necessary to grow \nour economy.\n  The FAST Act comes at a critical time. This legislation will improve \nour Nation's infrastructure, make our Federal surface transportation \nprograms work better for States, and address our Nation's \ninfrastructure priorities by focusing on critical commerce corridors \nand emerging freight corridors as well.\n  The FAST Act also makes key investments in something I am very \npassionate about, and that is the future of mobility in the United \nStates. Today, the auto industry is working hand in hand with tech, \ntelecom, and software companies and their partners in academia and \nFederal agencies to collaborate and contribute to the transportation \nsystem of the future. This future will be dominated by connected and \nautonomous vehicles--on-demand services such as ride-sharing and car-\nsharing--and innovations in vehicle-to-infrastructure communications.\n  Vehicle-to-infrastructure communications technologies--known as V2I--\nhave the potential to deliver incredible safety, mobility, \nenvironmental, and operational benefits to the driving public. For \nexample, V2I technologies will allow bridges that are icing up to be \nable to communicate directly with an automobile before it gets to the \nbridge and, as a result, will prevent an accident before it even \noccurs. Today, stakeholders are working to develop and test V2I \ntechnologies, and widespread deployment is expected in the coming \nyears.\n  We have to make sure the States are making plans for their future in \nV2I technologies. That is why I introduced\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\nlegislation earlier this year with Senators Stabenow and Blunt that \npromotes investment in vehicle-to-infrastructure technology by \nauthorizing States to use existing surface and highway transportation \nfunding to invest in V2I projects as they upgrade their highway \ninfrastructure. It is called the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Safety \nTechnology Investment Flexibility Act of 2015, and today I am proud to \nsay this legislation passed as part of the FAST Act.\n  My vehicle-to-infrastructure provision and the broader bill's other \nmajor investments in research and development represent the type of \nforward-thinking policymaking on which Congress should be focused. By \ncommitting now to help usher in the future of mobility and by providing \nthe funding and time to execute these programs, we have the ability to \ntransform our society for the better.\n  The FAST Act also contains several provisions to improve rail safety \nin the United States. I am pleased that legislation I authored, in the \nwake of the devastating Amtrak No. 188 crash earlier this year in \nPhiladelphia that unfortunately took the lives of 8 people and injured \nover 200, was included in the FAST Act. My provision requires the \nDepartment of Transportation, Amtrak, and the National Transportation \nSafety Board to conduct a post-accident assessment of the Amtrak No. \n188 crash to determine if Amtrak followed its emergency preparedness \nand family assistance response plans and to determine if and how these \nplans can be improved for the future.\n  Finally, the FAST Act reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank. Since the \nbeginning of July, the jobs supported by the Ex-Im Bank have been \nunnecessarily jeopardized. The Ex-Im Bank helps level the playing field \nfor American companies in a tough global market. Last year it supported \nmore than $27.4 billion in U.S. exports and 164,000 jobs. More than $10 \nbillion of that total--nearly 40 percent--represented exports by small \nbusinesses, and 90 percent of its overall transactions directly \nsupported small businesses, including many that serve as suppliers for \nlarge companies.\n  In Michigan, for example, the Ex-Im Bank has supported 229 exporter \nbusinesses selling $11 billion worth of goods to places such as Saudi \nArabia, Mexico, and Canada. This support is particularly important for \nour manufacturing industry, and the majority of Michigan exporters \nusing Ex-Im Bank are manufacturers of motor vehicles and parts, \nmachinery and chemicals--basically the backbone of Michigan's economy.\n  I am proud to see that with the FAST Act's passage, we can get back \nto the business of doing what makes sense for the economy and for jobs \nin America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, while my colleague from Michigan is here, \nlet me say that we appreciate so much his participation in the commerce \ncommittee, especially the expertise he brings to the table with regard \nto all things automotive since, in fact, his State is the automotive \nState. He is a valued member of our commerce committee. I thank the \nSenator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8429-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8429-S8430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FIGHTING ISIS\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, Americans are understandably frightened by \nthe terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. As we mourn the loss \nof the victims, our hearts go out to their friends and families.\n  We were shocked 14 years ago, on September 11, when foreign \nterrorists struck our homeland. For the first time, two big oceans did \nnot protect us from foreign terrorists. Now we know we have to be \nprepared to meet the threat not only abroad but here at home.\n  First, that means we have to see the threat clearly. It doesn't just \ncome from shadowy foreign terrorist groups such as ISIS or Al Qaeda; \nnow we see that it comes from a lone wolf or wolves, individuals who \nget radicalized. We saw that in the case at Fort Hood. We have seen it \nin other cases. We saw it in the case that was averted in Times Square, \nfrom someone who had come all the way across the country. They are \nextremely hard to detect.\n  Of course, ISIS uses the Internet to spread its propaganda, its \ninfluence, and to try to inspire disaffected young people with its \npropaganda far beyond where ISIS is located over in the Middle East. \nThat means we have to use all the tools at our disposal to collect \nactionable intelligence, harden our defenses, counter radicalization, \ncounter propaganda, and stiffen our resolve.\n  We ought to ensure that terrorists can't exploit the Visa Waiver \nProgram. There are 38 countries with which we share this visa \nwaiver. We ought to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies have the access they need to the terrorists' electronic \ncommunications to disrupt the attacks--that is a big order--all the \nwhile protecting Americans' privacy and constitutional rights.\n\n  That is why this Senator thinks it was a mistake to change the \nprevious law, as we did earlier this year, which allowed telecom \nbusiness bulk records to be readily accessed to trace terrorist \ncommunications. We have done this. We do not have the ready access of \nthose bulk business records. Again, I remind our listeners we are not \ntalking about the contents of communications--telephone calls or \ncontent of the Internet messages. We are talking about the bulk records \nwhich are business records that such and such a number or such and such \nan IP address on such and such a date transmitted a message to another \nnumber or another IP address.\n  In the past, through a court order, those bulk records were held by \nthe NSA, granting ready access so that if we were trying to stop a \nterrorist by getting intel ahead of time, we could go back and see \nwhere those communications were and with whom and how many hops it had \ngone in order to try to break up the terrorist activity. The problem \nwith the lone wolf is that if they are disguising their operations, \nthey are not communicating with anybody. That is why it makes it so \nmuch more difficult to intercept the lone wolf who has been inspired by \nISIS.\n  Recently we saw that ISIS has claimed the responsibility for the \nbombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt, and it reminds us that our \nplanes and airports remain a target for terror attacks. That is why I \nam introducing, and will explain tomorrow, legislation to tighten \ninternal security at airports across the country. We had some good \nexamples of that a year ago in Atlanta. Unbelievably, for several \nmonths, guns were brought into the Atlanta airport by airport workers, \nwere transferred to a passenger who had already gone through TSA \nsecurity, and they were actually transported over a number of months \nfrom Atlanta to New York. It is the lack of security on the perimeter \nof allowing workers into the airport proper that needs to be tightened \nup at all of our 300 airports. Two have already done that over the last \nseveral years, and I am very proud of the Miami airport and the Orlando \nairport that they have done it and done it very successfully.\n  Because ISIS exploits war in Syria and the instability and sectarian \nconflict in Iraq, meeting the terrorist threat means the use of \nmilitary force as well. With the help of our coalition partners, as we \nspeak, our forces are striking ISIS from the air and training local \nforces to fight ISIS on the ground. We are intensifying airstrikes \nagainst ISIS leadership, against heavy weapons, against oil tankers and \noil wells, and have recently deployed U.S. Special Operations forces to \nhelp local forces build the necessary battlefield momentum to take back \nterritory.\n  Special Operations forces will be central to the fight in order to \navoid the large-scale deployment of U.S. ground forces. These forces \nare trained to conduct surgical strikes against terrorist leaders. \nThere are press reports that GEN Joseph Votel, the current commander of \nthe U.S. Special Operations Command, in the next year will become the \nnext commander of Central Command, responsible for operations against \nISIS. He already works side by side with General Austin--the commander \nof U.S. Central Command in Tampa at MacDill Air Force Base--and he will \nbring tremendous experience to the job.\n  The Congress is not doing our job. We should authorize the use of \nmilitary force. It is our responsibility. I believe the President has \nthe responsibility to fight ISIS in Iraq or Syria or wherever, but the \nunity of the Congress backing the President in law is constitutionally\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nrequired. We ought to debate these proposals and vote. The \nauthorization would show the world that the United States is united in \ndefeating ISIS.\n  The military fight is one piece of a broader effort to destroy ISIS \nand bring about a political transition in Syria to a government where \nfinally Bashar al-Assad will have finally left. That is critical to \nending the war, ending the resulting humanitarian crisis, and stemming \nthe flow of the refugees. Our efforts will take time and commitment, \nbut they are clearly necessary to protect our national security.\n  This is going to be a long, hard war. We can't do it overnight. There \nhas been success in the war effort. We brought together 65 nations. \nTwelve thousand terrorist fighters have been killed. We have shrunk the \nterritory ISIS occupies and has sanctuary.\n  I want to show the Senate this map. It has been shown before. It is \nnot classified. All the area in green is what ISIS used to occupy, \nalong with the area in orange--there along the Euphrates River. All of \nthat area in green ISIS occupied but no longer does because of the \ncoalition efforts. There has been success. Someone needs to talk about \nthat success. Going forward, we are going to have to use more Special \nOperations troops. We are going to have to insist on our Arab neighbors \npicking up the fight and doing the fighting on the ground, and we do \nnot need to make the mistake of tens of thousands of Americans on the \nground because that plays right into ISIS's hands because it looks \nlike--and ISIS would portray it as--it is the United States versus \nMuslims.\n  We should treat Muslims with respect here at home in America; treat \nthem with the respect they deserve. Don't overreact. Otherwise that \nplays to ISIS's advantage of the image of Americans; in other words, it \nis us versus them. We are accelerating the fight. We have more and more \nintense coalition partners. We have extensive intel sharing. We have an \noutreach to Muslims about the truth of ISIS, and we insist our partners \nshare their intel with us. That includes the visa waiver of those 38 \nnations.\n  Fear at this time--like San Bernardino--is a natural response. It \nhappens at times such as this, but we cannot let fear get the best of \nus. We must overcome the fear and not let it compromise who we are as \nAmericans by overreacting. We need to nail down a truth that our \ngovernment has no greater obligation than to keep us safe.\n  I want to share with the Senate, where is the unity that we used to \nhave? I know it is not in vogue to say ``the good old days,'' but I can \ntell you that when this Senator was a young Congressman and when it \ncame to national security, partisanship stopped at the water's edge. \nIsn't it time to unify? Isn't it the time to disagree without being \ndisagreeable? Isn't it time to think of ourselves as Americans instead \nof partisans? Isn't it time to remember that Latin phrase that is up \nthere above the President's desk, ``e pluribus unum''--out of many, \none. It is time to come together. God bless America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On a typical day, there are 31 murders and 55 suicides by \ngun, as well as several accidental shootings. And every day, on \naverage, 151 Americans are shot and wounded in an assault and 45 are \naccidently shot but survive. We have had over 350 mass shootings in \nAmerica just this year, meaning incidents where at least four people \nare shot, and we have had over 50 incidents this year where guns have \nbeen fired at a school--50 at a school.\n  These statistics are sobering and a call to action. Most shootings in \nAmerica have become so routine, they don't even make the news. Sadly, \nmany Americans believe this staggering level of violence is just a \nnormal day in America. But in recent weeks, horrific mass shootings at \na Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs, CO, and a holiday \nparty in San Bernardino have brought the issue of gun violence back \ninto the forefront.\n  After high-profile mass shootings, we often hear the gun lobby and \ntheir political allies say: Any effort to pass a new gun law is just \npoliticizing a tragedy. They say: We don't need any new gun laws; what \nwe really should do is enforce the laws on the books. We saw this \ndynamic play out just last week. The day after the San Bernardino \nshooting, the vast majority of Senate Democrats voted for an amendment \nby Senator Feinstein to close the loophole that lets suspected \nterrorists buy firearms in America. The vast majority of Senate \nRepublicans voted no. Senate Democrats also voted overwhelmingly for a \nbipartisan amendment offered by Senators Manchin and Toomey. This \namendment would close the loopholes that allow guns to be sold without \nbackground checks either on the Internet or at gun shows. Again, the \nSenate Republicans overwhelmingly voted against a background check to \nkeep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally \nunstable people.\n  Make no mistake--the whole world saw what happened last week in San \nBernardino, and the whole world now knows that people who want to \ncommit acts of mass violence or terror in the United States sadly have \neasy access to an arsenal of guns. There are major loopholes in the \nlaws on the books.\n  This is a serious vulnerability, and Americans know we need to \naddress it. The risk of terrorist-inspired mass shootings like Paris \nhas never been higher. What are most effective ways to guard against \nthis vulnerability? Well, I thought those two amendments we considered \nlast week were a good start. Won't we agree--even those who own guns, \nvalue them, use them for sport, hunting, or self-defense--won't we \nagree that keeping guns out of the hands of convicted felons and \nmentally unstable people is the starting point? I think we should.\n  The ATF did a review of the crime guns that were seized in the \nhighest crime areas in the city of Chicago. They found out that 40 \npercent of the guns used in the commission of crime in some of the \ndeadliest precincts of Chicago came from northwest Indiana gun shows. \nWhy? Well, because you don't go through a background check if you buy \nfrom certain people at a gun show. So the thugs, the drug gangs, the \ndrive-by shooters--all they have to do is take the Skyway over the \nborder into Indiana, go to one of those gun shows, fill their trunks \nwith guns, firearms, and ammunition, and drive back for a killing spree \nin Chicago. There are no background checks. Does that make sense?\n  When they say, ``Well, you know, it is a shame they have so much gun \nviolence in Chicago because you know they have some of the strictest \nlaws on the books,'' well, those strict laws don't apply when you cross \nthe State line into Indiana. Sadly, those laws don't apply as they \nshould across the United States.\n  So we called the amendment on the floor, a bipartisan amendment. \nPatrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia--\nneither one of them liberal by self-definition--have come forward and \nsaid--Joe Manchin said: I learned a long time ago that if you want to \nown a gun in West Virginia, in my family, you didn't sell it to a \nstranger, you didn't sell it to a criminal, and you certainly didn't \nsell it to someone who was mentally unstable. He said that is just \ncommon sense. Well, it is common sense that escaped the support and \nattention of the Senate Republicans. They voted against that provision \noverwhelmingly, against background checks to keep firearms out of the \nhands of convicted felons and those who are mentally unstable. How \nwould you explain that? Well, it might be easier to explain that than \nto explain the other amendment they voted against.\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\n  Listen to this one. If our government, in their investigation, comes \nup with the name of a person they believe is involved in terrorism and \nthey put them on a no-fly list so they can't get on an airplane, guess \nwhat--they can still go to a licensed gun dealer in America and buy a \nfirearm.\n  These mad people in San Bernardino had AR-15s, semiautomatic and \nautomatic weapons. They weren't on a terrorist watch list that I know \nof or a no-fly list, but if their names had been on a list, it wouldn't \nhave slowed them down one bit in making a purchase.\n  So Senator Feinstein of California offered this amendment, an \namendment which had previously been offered by the late Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey repeatedly. Senator Feinstein took up his \ncause and brought this amendment to the floor for a vote last week in \nWashington.\n  I went back and looked at the Congressional Record to see what the \nobjections were of the people who said they had to vote against the \namendment which would say if you are on a terrorist fly list, you \ncannot purchase firearms or explosives in the United States. I read \nsome of the statements that were made by the senior Senator from Texas. \nIn his argument against this, he said:\n\n       If you believe the Federal Government should be able to \n     deprive an American citizen of one of their core \n     constitutional rights without notice and an opportunity to be \n     heard, then you should vote for the Senator's amendment.\n\n  The Senator from Texas continued:\n\n       This is not the way we are supposed to do things in this \n     country. If you think that the Federal Government never makes \n     a mistake and that presumptively the decisions the Federal \n     Government makes about putting you on a list because of some \n     suspicions, then you should vote for this amendment.\n\n  So as far as he is concerned--and I suppose those who joined him in \nvoting against this amendment--if your name is on a terrorist watch \nlist in America as somebody we suspect is involved in terrorism, you \nstart off by presuming the government must be wrong and the government \nhas to prove it. You start off, in their position, by saying that the \nfirst thing we should do is let that presumed terrorist buy a gun and \nthen let's have a due process hearing. What? What is he thinking? If \nyou thought there was a dangerous person in your city or your community \nwho might engage in terrorism, would you want them to buy an assault \nweapon? Would you want them to buy explosives? I wouldn't.\n  Let's err on the side of safety and security and say: No, if you are \non that list, you cannot purchase a weapon or an explosive. If you \nprotest being on the list and don't think you belong there, so be it. \nThat is your right. You are entitled to a process to get your name off \nthe list, and the Feinstein amendment provides such a process. And if \nyou prove that our government is wrong, then proceed with buying the \ngun or the explosives.\n  But the presumption on the other side is that you are always entitled \nto buy a gun, you are always entitled to buy explosives, and if the \ngovernment says otherwise, they have to prove it. It doesn't sound like \na recipe for safety in America, but that is what happened on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  So we called this measure, and there were 45 who voted yes and 54 \nvoted no--45 to 54 on whether someone on the terrorist watch list \nshould be able to be prohibited from buying firearms and explosives.\n  There has been a lot of tough talk lately about terrorism, this \ndozen--13, 14; I forget the number--running for President on the \nRepublican side. They are trying to out trump one another and get \ntougher with terrorists. Yet when the moment came on the floor of the \nSenate and the Republicans in the Senate--including three or four \nrunning for President--had a chance to vote to keep firearms and \nexplosives out of the hands of suspected terrorists, they voted no. How \ndoes that make us any safer? Oh, they are tough as can be in their \nspeeches, but when it comes down to their votes, they are nowhere to be \nfound.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8431-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8431-S8432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there is also a question about what we \ncan do to keep our country safe in terms of people coming into our \ncountry.\n  Each year we admit about 70,000 refugees from all over the world. The \nNo. 1 country providing refugees to the United States--Burma. Most \npeople wouldn't have guessed that. About one-fourth of our refugees \ncome from Burma.\n  How do they get into the United States as refugees? They are first \nidentified by the United Nations Council on Refugees, and then they \nstart a process, a background check and process. This goes on for 18 \nmonths to 24 months. It involves repetitive fingerprinting and \nchecking, interviews, examinations, questions. Then, finally, after 24 \nmonths, they may be allowed to come to the United States as a refugee. \nAbout 70,000 a year come into our country. I have met a lot of them. \nThey are from all over the world--Africa, Asia, all over the world. And \nnow we have a focus on them, a laserlike focus on them.\n\n  Some are arguing that the way to keep America safe is to stop \nrefugees from coming in from Syria. Well, we know Syria has been \nengaged in a civil war for more than 4 years. We know some 4 million \npeople have been displaced. I was in Greece a few weeks back and saw \nnumbers coming across the Aegean Sea from Turkey into Greece. These \nSyrian and some Iraqi refugees are desperate people. You literally see \na family walking--mother, father, carrying babies, walking toddlers--\nwith all that they own on their backs. That is it. We stopped to talk \nto some of them, and they told the story of what it was like to live in \nSyria amidst a civil war, what it was like to have barrel bombs going \noff in your town--the damage that it did, the killing that it did. Many \nof them had lost members of their families. They were running away from \nthat violence--not only from Assad, the head of Syria, but from ISIL as \nwell.\n  Some of them decide to ask to become refugees in the United States. \nThey know that if they ask, they are in for a long, long haul--18 to 24 \nmonths. Some have made it, fewer than 2,000, during the last 4 years. \nSome have made it. Not a single Syrian refugee coming into the United \nStates since this war began has ever been charged with terrorism. It \njust hasn't happened.\n  What happens with other visitors to the United States? Well, we \nwelcome visitors. Certainly we do. Many of us look forward to visiting \ntheir countries too. About 55 million foreign travelers come to the \nUnited States each year; about 20 million are from visa waiver \ncountries--38 countries where we have a special relationship and say: \nYou don't need a specific visa to come to our country because we have \nthis agreement between us; you may freely travel to the United States \non what we call a visa waiver. That is about 20 million of the 55 \nmillion.\n  We can do better when it comes to these visitors on both sides--\nAmericans traveling overseas and foreigners coming into this country. \nWe need to make sure that before a person gets on a plane, we check \ntheir fingerprints, for example. That is a pretty easy thing to do \nthese days. Just put your hands down; it reads them and cross-checks \nagainst the data bank of suspected people, suspected criminals, and \nsuspected terrorists. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of people \nwill have no problem whatsoever, but it is a way, just like taking off \nyour shoes, to make sure that we are safer. It is a little inconvenient \nbut worth it.\n  What we have said on the Democratic side is that if you want to make \nAmerica safe--and we all do--it is far better to focus on foreign \ntravelers and visa waivers, and make sure we are doing the proper \nchecks before the person gets on the airplane. I believe we should do \nthat. When I travel to their countries, I am prepared to face the same \nfingerprint check. It is not too much to ask in the 21st century, with \nthe terrorism and violence that we face.\n  All these things will make us safer, but focusing on 70,000 refugees, \namong which a few hundred are Syrian, instead of looking at the larger \ngroup of 55 million foreign travelers--did you know that most of the \nterrorists in Paris, France, were carrying European passports which \nwould have allowed them to come to the United States without a visa? So \nif we want to make our country safer--and I do--let's do things that \nare practical and thoughtful.\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\n  Incidentally, those who come to the United States on visa waivers \nfrom 38 countries around the world can currently legally buy firearms. \nWhat is that all about? Our law prevents foreign visitors who come in \non a visa from buying firearms, but a loophole allows those who qualify \nunder the Visa Waiver Program to come as visitors to buy a firearm. I \nthink we can do better there as well.\n  Let's tighten up the Visa Waiver Program, and make sure we do the \nproper checks so dangerous people don't ever get on the plane to come \nto the United States. Let's make sure as well that if you have a visa \nwaiver and you come to the United States as a visitor, you are not \ngoing to be purchasing firearms. Finally, if you are on a suspected \nterrorist no-fly list, you should be disqualified from buying a gun or \nan explosive, period. Those are three practical steps. I think we ought \nto move forward and do that on a bipartisan basis. It will be something \nto keep in mind and make America much safer.\n  In closing, some of the suggestions being made as these Republican \nPresidential candidates try to out-trump one another are very sad. They \nreflect the ignorance of history and a willingness to ignore the values \nof this country. When I hear some of the awful things being said about \npeople of the Islamic faith--I think about a dinner I went to Saturday \nnight. It was in Chicago; it was by the Children's Heart Research \nFoundation. They were saluting a number of doctors in the Chicago area \nwho were extraordinary in saving the lives of children. One of them is \na current surgeon. He started with Children's Memorial Hospital; he is \nnow with the Advocate hospital system. He is considered to be the best \nin Chicago. If your baby--and 1 out of 100 are--is born with a \ncongenital heart defect, this is the doctor you want to see the child; \nthis is the surgeon you want to save your child's life. This doctor is \na Muslim. He is an American. He is an important part of America. Those \nwho are making negative statements about all people in the Islamic \nfaith, calling for registration or exclusion or whatever it may be--\ntheir statements and views are not consistent with who we are as \nAmericans.

Madam President, last evening President Obama \naddressed the Nation concerning the threat ISIL poses to our people. \nUnfortunately, the American people did not hear of a strategy or a plan \nto defeat and destroy this terrorist army. Instead, they heard a \nrestatement of a military campaign crafted to contain--contain--ISIL \nwithin Iraq and Syria.\n  Following the attacks in Paris and California, and the downing of a \nRussian airliner, about 60 percent of the American people disapprove of \nthe President's handling of terrorism. Nearly two-thirds disapprove of \nhis handling of ISIL.\n  The American people understand intuitively that ISIL and the wider \nterrorist threat have not been contained but, rather, that they have \nevolved into something increasingly more serious and more challenging. \nAmericans also know that the operational concept ordered by the \nPresident is insufficient to defeat ISIL. It is not just the American \npeople saying this. It is not just Republicans saying it, either. \nPresident Obama's last Defense Secretary recently criticized his \napproach; so have several other former Obama administration officials.\n  Here is a sampling of what they have said over just the last week or \ntwo: One called on the Obama administration to ``wake up'' to the \nthreat. Another said that the Obama administration ``seems to be really \nflailing and tone deaf to this latest challenge.'' A third called on \nthe President to ``change your strategy'' because ``by any measure, our \nstrategy in Iraq and Syria is not succeeding.'' And then there is \nPresident Obama's former Secretary of State, Secretary Clinton, who put \nit plainly: ``We're not winning.'' Hillary Clinton said: ``We're not \nwinning.''\n  The President had a real opportunity last night to show the American \npeople that defeating ISIL is his priority. He had an opportunity to \ndemonstrate his willingness to adapt to the threat. He had an \nopportunity to explain how he can better prepare our Nation for a fight \nthat will inevitably be passed on to his successor, but he didn't do \nthat. He didn't do it last night.\n\n  The American people were looking for a serious strategy and a real \nvision last night, not a recap of an approach that clearly hasn't \nworked. Last night was only the President's third Oval Office address, \nand by any measure a missed opportunity.\n  Look, throughout his time as Commander in Chief, President Obama has \nshown an inflexible adherence to policies he advocated as a candidate \nfor office in 2008, most specifically to end our Nation's War on \nTerror. In his first days in office he issued a series of Executive \norders designed to weaken the ability of our warfighter and \nintelligence community to gather targeted information, to capture \nterrorists, interrogate, and detain them to advance our understanding \nof terrorist networks and plans, as well as to protect the American \npeople. Although the President conceded that the complete withdrawal of \nour forces from Afghanistan would be harmful to our national security \ninterests and slowed our withdrawal in the face of Al Qaeda and Taliban \nresistance, he inflexibly clung to a fixed date for our drawdown of \nforces in Iraq, which allowed for the growth of ISIL. As the President \ninflexibly pursued an end to the War on Terror, the terrorist threat \nevolved and adapted as Al Qaeda affiliates advanced in presence and \ncapability and Al Qaeda in Iraq grew into the terrorist army we now \nknow as ISIL. ISIL's use of social media and encrypted communications \nburgeoned at the very moment the President and his allies were working \nto take away critical electronic surveillance tools from our \nintelligence community.\n  Here is what we need from the President now. What we need from the \nPresident is for him to clearly outline what it is he aims to achieve, \nhow he aims to achieve it, and what authorities he thinks he will need \nto make that happen. He needs to match strategic objectives to the \nmeans to reach the goals. The President needs to tell us what \nauthorities he needs to defeat encrypted online communications. The \nPresident needs to tell us what is needed to establish our capture, \ninterrogation, and surveillance capabilities. The President needs to \ntell us how the coalition or NATO will forge a ground force capable of \nnot only trying to contain ISIL but actually driving it from Raqqa. The \nPresident needs to tell us the force structure and the funding our \ncommanders will need to rebuild our conventional capabilities so we can \ncontinue and expand this fight while facing other global threats. The \nPresident should also explain why he will not use the secure facility \nat Guantanamo Bay to safely hold and interrogate newly captured \nterrorists in order to help prevent the next plot against Americans.\n  These are the kinds of things the American people are looking for, \nand by leading on them, President Obama\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\ncan demonstrate his commitment to protecting our Nation and leaving it \nbetter prepared for his successor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8433-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NEW CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on another matter, last November the \nAmerican people elected a new Congress to get Washington working again. \nNearly every day seems to bring more signs that we are. Over the \nweekend, President Obama signed the FAST Act, a multiyear highway bill, \ninto law. It represents a significant departure from years of short-\nterm extensions and congressional inaction. In fact, the FAST Act is \nthe longest term highway bill to pass Congress in almost two decades, \nproviding 5 full years of highway funding.\n  Here is what Kentuckians for Better Transportation--a top \ntransportation advocacy organization in my State--had to say about it:\n\n       After many, many years of short term continuing resolutions \n     we finally have a long term authorization that will give our \n     states the opportunity to plan for and implement major road \n     projects. . . . We can [now] plan for the future.\n\n  That is because in a new and more open Senate, Senator Inhofe, a \nRepublican, and Senator Boxer, a Democrat, were able to work together \nfor its passage. Senator Boxer herself called it ``a major \naccomplishment.''\n  Here is another major accomplishment: the Every Student Succeeds Act. \nIt is a bipartisan, reformist replacement for No Child Left Behind. \nPundits in Washington could never agree on how to replace No Child Left \nBehind. The issue went unresolved for many years, but in a new and more \nopen Senate, Senator Alexander, a Republican, and Senator Murray, a \nDemocrat, worked hard and found success in the bill before us. The \nHouse already passed it, 359 to 64. The Senate previously passed a very \nsimilar version of the bill, 81 to 17.\n  Tomorrow we should work together to pass it for a second and final \ntime and send it to the President for his signature. It will be the \nlatest important achievement for the American people from a new \nCongress that is back to work and back on their side.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last night the President addressed the \nNation. It was one of the few times during his Presidency that he \naddressed the Nation from the Oval Office, signifying that this was \ngoing to be an important address by the Commander in Chief. \nUnfortunately, what the President communicated was that little, if any, \nchange will be made in the current administration's approach on \nterrorism following the attack on San Bernardino last week. The \nPresident's approach to eradicating this terrorist threat has only \nresulted in a tactical stalemate that has kept the morale of ISIS high \nand their recruitment efforts robust, as we have seen.\n  In the wake of the shootings last week, an event the President \nhimself called an act of terrorism, the American people deserve a \ncredible and aggressive strategy to combat this terror threat that \nclearly poses a danger not just over there but over here. A good start \nwould be for the President to listen to his own military leadership as \nwell as members of the intelligence community. If the reports are \ntrue--and they certainly haven't been denied--the President has turned \na deaf ear to his own military leadership and leaders of the \nintelligence community on how to fight and defeat the ISIS threat. \nDespite the President's rhetoric on his so-called strategy against \nISIS, one thing is clear: It is not working. So our country clearly \nneeds to change course, and that should start with a real plan and real \ncandor from the Commander in Chief on how he intends to defend our \ninterests abroad and at home to keep our people safe.\n  While I was eager to hear what the President might say about the bad \nresults from his current strategy, unfortunately, we didn't hear it \nlast night. However, what we did hear was this recent theme from some \nof our colleagues across the aisle--as we voted on the repeal-ObamaCare \nset of votes last week--as well as from the President himself during \nhis weekly address, the Democratic leader, and some other Members of \nthe Senate, that what they are basically trying to do is to change the \nsubject. You will recall that one way they tried to do that was by \noffering an amendment that said people on watch lists would be denied \ntheir core constitutional rights under the Bill of Rights, and in this \ncase it happened to be the Second Amendment; that is, you are presumed \nto be guilty without the necessity of having to go to court and \nactually prove what you are claiming is true.\n  I was struck by the fact that the New York Times, back in 2014, noted \nin an editorial entitled ``Terror Watch Lists Run Amok'' that ``A 2007 \naudit found that more than half of the 71,000 names on the no-fly list \nwere wrongly included.'' This is the New York Times making the case \nthat basically I and others argued for, which is that there cannot be \nany presumption of guilt just because the government includes your name \non a list, particularly when it comes to denying your core \nconstitutional rights. If the Second Amendment isn't strong enough to \nwithstand this so-called presumption, neither is the freedom to worship \naccording to the dictates of your conscience, the First Amendment \nrights to free speech and freedom of association. You get my drift.\n  Rather than address the real problem, which flowed from another \nspeech the President gave a few years ago out of the Oval Office where \nhe announced the precipitous withdrawal of our troops in Iraq that \ncreated the vacuum that is now being filled by ISIS and Al Qaeda--\nrather than talk about the lessons learned and how a new and different \nstrategy was going to be employed after consultation with our military \nleadership and members of the intelligence community, the President and \nhis supporters decided to try to change the subject and produce a red \nherring that has nothing to do with the fight to degrade and defeat \nISIS. Of course the threat is not only about people traveling from \nabroad to our country, it is about Americans here and other people on \nvisas, perhaps from visa waiver countries, traveling from the Middle \nEast to the United States. Perhaps the most dangerous of all is the \nradicalization of people already in the United States. If the \npreliminary indications prove to be true, that seems to be the thread \nthat connects so many of these attacks, whether it is in San Bernardino \nor Garland, TX, a short time back, or MAJ Nidal Hasan at Fort Hood back \nin 2009.\n  What we need and what the American people deserve from their \nCommander in Chief is candor and the willingness to show a little \nhumility and say: You know what. The way we have been handling things \nreally isn't working very well. Instead, the President tries to play \npartisan politics, and he tries to distract the American people by \nsuggesting that our Constitution is too generous when it comes to the \nright to keep and bear arms.\n  For the sake of all Americans, I hope the President reconsiders his \nflawed strategy and produces a more effective one to eradicate ISIS \nsoon because the safety of the American people is clearly at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8433-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8433-S8435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we are on the downward trajectory of \nthis year's Congress, the 114th Congress, and I thought it would be \nappropriate to take a few minutes to talk about what this Chamber has \nbeen able to accomplish since we convened in January. I know there is a \nlot of cynicism and indeed outright fear about the way the Federal \nGovernment has been operating, and unfortunately I think a lot of that \nis attributable to the fact that this President has shown a complete \nunwillingness to work with Congress in many areas; for example, such as \nimmigration reform. So when people see the President acting \nunilaterally--thank goodness the courts have stopped it,\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\nbut it causes them to lose confidence in the Federal Government's \nability to address the problems they live with day in and day out and \nwhich they have a right to see us do our very best to address.\n  I can't help but think about this time last year and how, with great \nanticipation and high expectations, the American people decided to give \nour side of the aisle, the Republican side, the opportunity to serve in \nthe majority. Our task was a daunting one. The Senate had basically \nbeen ground to a halt, and I think Members on both sides of the aisle \ncame back in January ready to change the way we do things around here. \nI think some of our friends across the aisle found that the do-nothing \nstrategy didn't work for them either, even though they were in the \nmajority, because a number of Senate incumbents--having to face the \nvoters without anything to show--ended up being defeated in last \nNovember's election. It didn't work for the American people. So it \ndidn't work for the American people, and it didn't work for those \nSenators. As I said, the American people deserve better.\n  We tried to do better, and I think we have made some progress. We \nhave been getting a few things done, delivering on promises made to the \nAmerican people and working to find real solutions to the problems \nfaced by those whom we are honored to represent. One of those areas \nthat has been particularly important to me is doing something about an \nissue that plagues every State in our country; that is, human \ntrafficking. At the beginning of last year, I was honored to lead a \nbipartisan effort to pass legislation designed to help victims of human \ntrafficking get a helping hand and hopefully find a path to healing.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which is now the law of \nthe land, will help these victims, who are too often children, be \ntreated like the victims they are instead of common criminals. After \nabout a month on the floor of the Senate, that bill ultimately ended up \npassing, 99 to 0, and it was signed into law by the President. It \npoints out that the Congress can work with the President on a \nbipartisan basis to fight some of the most tragic and troubling issues \nthat face our Nation.\n  There are other examples. In the fall we passed a major cyber \nsecurity bill that will help protect the American people from cyber \nattacks. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act fosters information \nsharing to help address the growing cyber threats we face. Of course we \nread about them in the news, if we haven't experienced them in person \nourselves. The need for this legislation couldn't have been more \npressing because over the summer the administration confirmed that \nhackers had accessed sensitive background information of more than 21 \nmillion people on the computer systems of the Office of Personnel \nManagement--21 million Americans. That followed a similar breach at the \nInternal Revenue Service in which the personal data of more than \n100,000 taxpayers was stolen. So passage of the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act was the right thing to do, and it was done on a \nbipartisan basis. We are now engaged in a conference discussion with \nthe House to try to reconcile the differences between those bills \nbefore it goes to the President.\n  That is the way we ought to be doing business around here--trying to \nfind solutions that make America stronger and make our cyber \ninfrastructure more resilient.\n  Another example was from last week. Last week we passed a multiyear \nhighway bill for the first time in more than a decade. My State is \nblessed to be a fast-growing State, and of course that has encouraged a \nlot of people to move there--voting with their feet, as I like to say, \nand coming from places where jobs aren't being produced because the \neconomy is not growing.\n  This bill helps Texas on the State and local level to prepare for \nthose growing infrastructure needs that come with this increased \ngrowth. Just as significantly, it will help the rest of the country as \nwell by creating jobs to build and maintain that infrastructure as well \nas the commerce that travels on that infrastructure and the environment \nwhich will be served by avoiding unnecessary congestion.\n  This bill also specifically grants States like Texas the flexibility \nto invest in infrastructure projects--in our case, along the border. We \nhave a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico. It is a unique part of our \ncountry. I like to kid my constituents back home. I say: What most of \nmy colleagues in Washington know about the border they read in novels \nor saw in a movie somewhere. It is a unique and wonderful part of our \nState, but it is also one that deserves our undivided attention because \nof the security threats, drug trafficking, and other illegal activity. \nIt is no small thing for the Nation's top exporting State, one that \nshares almost 1,200 miles with Mexico, to be able to direct some of \nthese funds to help build and maintain that infrastructure.\n  By the way, I know people frequently talk about Mexico and our \nrelationship with Mexico in a negative way, but we also understand \nthere are enormous benefits to our proximity to Mexico and our shared \nborder. There are about 6 million jobs in America that depend on \nbinational trade with Mexico. While Mexico has its problems--and they \ncertainly have serious problems--we are working with them on their \nsecurity and corruption issues and the like. It will take all of our \nefforts in order to address them. By promoting better border \ninfrastructure, Texas can build on our strong trade record, which \nalready includes the export of more than $100 billion in goods to \nMexico each year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs--6 million \njobs nationwide.\n  This multiyear highway bill will also give Texas and other States \nacross the country more certainty. Before this we had been looking at \ntemporary patches, which makes it impossible to plan, and it also makes \nthe expenditure of those dollars enormously inefficient. This bill \ngives us greater certainty to make sure our States can deliver projects \nto facilitate greater volumes of trade and travel along interstates and \nother critical transportation corridors.\n  An area where we have not yet achieved success but where I think \nthere is great promise--there are other areas, such as criminal justice \nreform, where I believe we can in the months ahead register another \nsuccess, again for the benefit of the people we represent.\n  Last week, at the President's invitation, I joined a bipartisan, \nbicameral group of legislators to come to the White House to discuss a \nway forward for bringing substantive criminal justice reform to our \ncountry.\n  For too long, in my State we learned that we treated prisons like \nwarehouses, warehousing people and ignoring the fact--or perhaps just \nnot recognizing the significance of the fact--that sooner or later most \nof them were going to get out of prison. So what we decided to do in \nTexas in 2007 was to get smart on crime, not just tough on crime. \nNobody doubted how tough we were on crime. But what we realized is that \nsome of the money we spent on corrections could be plowed back into \neducational programs that would help willing inmates actually learn job \nskills, deal with their drug and alcohol problems, if they had those, \nand, in short, better prepare for life on the outside so they didn't \nend up a frequent flyer or in that turnstile, going from prison to the \noutside and then back again.\n  So we have been working on this issue for some time, based on the \nsuccess we enjoyed in Texas and in other States. The product is a bill \ncalled the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which passed out of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee 15 to 5. I know Chairman Goodlatte in \nthe House of Representatives is working on a bipartisan bill in that \nChamber as well. So I think this is one of those pivotal moments where \nfolks across the political spectrum see the advantage of working \ntogether in favor of bringing real progress that will benefit the \nAmerican people by making our criminal justice system more effective \nand our communities safer. By the way, we can save money at the same \ntime.\n  On another matter where we have seen significant progress, this week \nwe will be voting on the conference report that accompanies the Every \nChild Achieves Act. This is the bill that actually fixes No Child Left \nBehind. This legislation was passed here in the Senate by wide margins \nover the summer. Chairman Alexander and the conference committee and \nRanking Member Murray were able to achieve an\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\namazing thing in this divided, polarized political environment we are \nin, with, I believe, a 39-to-1 vote in the conference committee for a \nbill that combines both the House and the Senate product. This is \nreally landmark education legislation that will help parents and local \ncommunities take control of their children's education instead of \nceding to the Federal Government. Certainly, this bill is another win \nfor the American people.\n  Where I come from, people like the fact that we essentially have \nrepealed the common core mandate, that we have eliminated the Federal \nGovernment as a national school board, and that we have sent the power \nback where it belongs, which is to parents and teachers and local \nschool districts, and ceded more of that authority from here in \nWashington, DC, back to them.\n  I could continue with this list of legislative accomplishments by \nnoting that the Chamber has also passed legislation that replaced the \nflawed Medicare payment system for physicians. This is the notorious \ndoc fix. This is another example where for years and years we passed \ntemporary patches and never solved the underlying problem. But Congress \ndid, and I think that is another thing we can be proud of, along with \nthe first budget passed since 2009, and there is more I could add to \nthe list. But my point is there is a difference in the new 114th \nCongress, and elections do make a difference. We have worked together \non a bipartisan basis where we can to make progress to solve problems \nfor the American people during this first year of the 114th Congress. A \nlot of this is due to the steady leadership of the majority leader, the \nSenator from Kentucky, and all the hard work our colleagues have put in \nto make this such a productive year.\n  So we are on track to continue with this momentum into the new year, \nand with just another week or so of work to do before we break for the \nholidays, I think we can take some pride in these accomplishments but \nyet know that there is a lot more we have to do, not only for the \nremainder of this year but into next year as well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, in the United States Senate, I \nwish to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the founding of Cave City, \nKY. Next year in 2016, 150 years will have passed since Cave City was \nfirst incorporated in 1866.\n  Located in the south central region of the Commonwealth, Cave City is \nproud to be known worldwide as the home of Mammoth Cave, the world's \nlongest known cave system with more than 400 miles explored \nunderground. It is one of the oldest tourist attractions in the United \nStates.\n  Cave City may only have about 2,500 residents, but more than 2 \nmillion visitors flock to Mammoth Cave National Park every year. Cave \nCity is proud to host so many visitors from across the globe and \npresent to them their special brand of Kentucky hospitality and charm.\n  Cave City is not only the gateway to Mammoth Cave, but also home to \nfine shops and restaurants, privately owned caves open for tours, and \nmany other tourist attractions and places of interest. It is the zip \nline capital of Kentucky, with three zip line tours close to town. And \nthe Cave City Convention Center is one of the premier meeting and \nconvention venues in the region.\n  The year 2016 will be a busy year for Cave City. Not only is it the \n150th anniversary of the town's founding, it is also the 200th \nanniversary of the earliest known organized tours being given at \nMammoth Cave, the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, and \nthe 75th anniversary of the establishment of Mammoth Cave National \nPark.\n  Therefore, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing that \n2016 is the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Cave City and in \nextending a heartfelt congratulations to the people of Cave City as \nthey celebrate this important milestone. I am proud to be their voice \nhere in the Senate as Cave City represents the very best of what \nKentucky has to offer our Nation and the world.\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8436-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TED BEATTIE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to \nacknowledge Ted A. Beattie, president and chief executive officer of \nthe Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, IL. Earlier this year, Ted announced \nthat he would be retiring from the world's largest indoor aquarium in \nlate 2016.\n  The Shedd Aquarium is home to 32,500 fish habitats and attracts more \nthan 2 million people every year. It is an educational and cultural \ntreasure in Chicago--and the most popular family and tourist attraction \nin the city.\n  Under Ted Beattie's leadership, the Shedd Aquarium was Chicago's top \nattended paid cultural attraction for 17 of the last 21 years, \nwelcoming more than 33 million guests. It is an extraordinary \naccomplishment. After a 35-year affiliation with Shedd, Ted is leaving \nthis beloved institution in good shape. Since joining Shedd in 1994 as \nthe third president and CEO in the aquarium's history, here are just \nsome of his many accomplishments: Ted developed and opened six \npermanent exhibits, only the second expansion since the aquarium opened \nits doors in 1930. He created eight special exhibits, the latest being \n``Amphibians,'' opening next May, and established the Daniel P. \nHaerther Center for Conservation and Research, which has grown to \ninclude 18 global field research programs. Ted also oversaw the \naddition of Shedd's onsite animal hospital and lab facilities housed in \nthe A. Watson Armour III Center for Aquatic Animal Health and Welfare.\n  Throughout his time at Shedd, Ted Beattie demonstrated an exceptional \nability to engage and inspire the next generation. As president, Ted \nopened a teen learning lab, a free, collaborative space for teens--\ndeveloped by teens--to enhance critical thinking skills while exploring \nenvironmental interests and science.\n  Prior to joining Shedd, Ted Beattie served as director for both the \nKnoxville Zoo and Fort Worth Zoo and held positions at the Chicago \nZoological Society's Brookfield Zoo and Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical \nGarden. During his tenure as president of the Association of Zoos and \nAquariums, AZA, he spent 15 years teaching management courses as part \nof AZA's professional management schools and received AZA's highest \naward for professional excellence--the R. Marlin Perkins Award for \nProfessional Excellence.\n  Time and time again, Ted found creative ways to get around obstacles \nand make good things happen for Shedd and other zoos and aquariums \nacross the country. I know this is not the final chapter for Ted \nBeattie. He will continue to be a passionate advocate for conversation \nand educational initiatives through the Penny Beattie Leadership Fund, \na professional development scholarship program established in honor of \nTed's late wife.\n  I congratulate Ted Beattie on his distinguished career and thank him \nfor dedicating a large part of his career to the Shedd Aquarium and the \npeople of Chicago. It has been a pleasure to support his work, and I \nwish him all the best in the next chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8436-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING CENTERTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY.

EUGENE McKAY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor today Chancellor \nEugene McKay of Arkansas State University-Beebe. Chancellor McKay will \nbe retiring at the end of December after nearly half a century of \ndedication to education, the university, and the State of Arkansas.\n  Chancellor McKay has been a fixture at ASU-Beebe since 1966. He \nstarted as a professor of English and French, became vice chancellor of \nacademic affairs and, in 1994, was named chancellor.\n  During his time with ASU-Beebe, Chancellor McKay oversaw an extensive \ncampus renovation and expansion. Under his leadership, enrollment \nnearly tripled, and the ASU-Beebe campus had the highest student \nsuccess rate of any Arkansas institution of higher education.\n  His passion helped improve higher education across Arkansas. In 1999, \nhe founded ASU-Heber Springs, and he worked with ASU-Newport to become \na stand-alone institution in 2001.\n  Chancellor McKay's dedication to his community extended beyond the \ncampus. In addition to serving on the Arkansas Community College Board, \nhe also served with the Beebe Chamber of Commerce, the Beebe Economic \nDevelopment Commission, and United Way of White County, to name a few.\n  Retirement won't slow him down. Chancellor McKay plans to continue to \nchallenge himself by taking yoga and mathematics classes.\n  I congratulate Chancellor McKay for his outstanding achievements in \neducation and thank him for his service to ASU-Beebe and the countless \nstudents he impacted. I was proud to support his efforts to foster \ngrowth at the university and help make his vision for a campus \nemergency alert system a reality. I greatly appreciate his commitment \nto the university and higher education and wish him continued success \nin all of his endeavors. ASU-Beebe has benefited greatly from his \nleadership and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8437-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8437-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8437-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 8.

A bill to improve the administration of certain programs in \nthe insular areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise with Senator Cantwell of \nWashington State to introduce the Omnibus Territories Act of 2015, \nwhich relates to the U.S. territory of American Samoa, as well as the \nFederated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \nand the Republic of Palau--collectively known as the Freely Associated \nStates. Sections 2 and 3 of the legislation are introduced at the \nrequest of the administration and section 4 at the request of the \ngovernments of the three Freely Associated States.\n  Section 2 would permit the use of resettlement and relocation funds \nprovided to the people of Bikini Atoll to be used within or outside of \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands. As a result of nuclear weapons \ntesting by the United States in the northern islands and atolls of the \nMarshall Islands, Congress, through Public Law 97-257 in 1982, provided \nthe people of Bikini Atoll a relocation and resettlement trust fund to \nbe used by the people of Bikini to resettle from their traditional \nhomeland of Bikini Atoll to other islands within the Marshall Islands. \nCurrently, most members of the\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\ncommunity live on the islands of Kili and Ejit. Today, however, the \npeople on these islands have limited living space, lack suitable \nsustainable resources to provide water and food for their population, \nand they are exposed to tidal flooding on an increasingly frequent \nbasis. Under current Federal law, citizens of the Freely Associated \nStates, including the people of Bikini, are able to enter into, reside, \nwork, and study in the United States as nonimmigrants without visas. \nThis section would allow the people of Bikini to use the resettlement \nand relocation trust funds for relocation and resettlement outside of \nthe Marshall Islands, whether in the United States or elsewhere, if \nthey so choose.\n  Section 3 seeks to improve air service capabilities in American \nSamoa. There are currently no U.S. airlines that provide flight service \nwithin American Samoa between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a. The \nU.S. Department of Transportation has granted a foreign air carrier \nemergency service capability to provide this service, but that \ndesignation must be renewed every thirty days under statutory \nrequirement. This section would amend current statute to allow for a \nforeign carrier to operate between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a \nwithout the need for an emergency service capability designation.\n  Section 4 would amend the REAL ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-13, to \nallow citizens of the Freely Associated States to document their lawful \nresident status in the United States in conformance with the Compacts \nof Free Association between the United States and each of these three \nnations. Section 141 of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act \nof 2003, Public Law 108-188, and the law that implemented the Compact \nof Free Association with Palau, Public Law 101-219, permits citizens of \nthe FAS to enter into the United States to lawfully engage in \noccupations and establish residence as nonimmigrants. However, the REAL \nID Act of 2005 did not provide a means for FAS citizens to document \ntheir lawful status in the United States. As a consequence, FAS \ncitizens are denied anything more than a temporary ID valid only for \none year, resulting in practical difficulties in their ability to \nmaintain employment and engage in other lawful activities where they \nreside. Giving FAS citizens the ability to document their lawful status \nand obtain a State-issued driver's license or identification card would \nfacilitate employment and provide more stability and certainty as they \nengage in lawful activity as legal residents in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/senate-section/article/S8440-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 329--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN \nAGREEMENT REACHED AT THE UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE HELD \n                       IN PARIS IN DECEMBER 2015\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Manchin, and Mrs. Capito) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 329\n\n       Whereas on May 9, 1992, the Senate gave the advice and \n     consent of the Senate regarding the United Nations Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change, with annexes, done at New York \n     May 9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 1994 (referred \n     to in this preamble as the ``Convention''), a treaty that was \n     intended to address the global emissions of greenhouse gases;\n       Whereas the Convention was ratified under the express \n     limitation ``that a decision by the Conference of the Parties \n     to adopt targets and timetables would have to be submitted to \n     the Senate for its advice and consent.'';\n       Whereas after the Convention entered into force, parties \n     began negotiating a subsidiary agreement to contain binding \n     greenhouse gas emissions reductions, which resulted in the \n     Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on \n     Climate Change, done at Kyoto on December 10, 1997;\n       Whereas the United States is not a party to the Kyoto \n     Protocol;\n       Whereas the Clinton Administration did not submit the Kyoto \n     Protocol to the Senate for the advice and consent of the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas on July 25, 1997, the Senate agreed to S.

Res. 330\n\n       Whereas on October 10, 2015, the Norwegian Nobel Committee \n     (referred to in this Resolution as ``the Committee'') awarded \n     the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet (referred to in this \n     Resolution as ``the Quartet'') the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for \n     its work in building on the promise of the 2011 Jasmine \n     Revolution and preventing Tunisia's democratic transition \n     from descending into violence in 2013;\n       Whereas the Jasmine Revolution in January 2011 was the \n     spark that led to the Arab Spring protests across the Middle \n     East and North Africa, ultimately leading to the departure of \n     President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali and the end of his \n     authoritarian rule;\n       Whereas the Quartet is a coalition of 4 civil society \n     organizations: The Tunisian General Labor Union; The Tunisian \n     Confederation of Industry, Trade, and Handicrafts; The \n     Tunisian Human Rights League; and The Tunisian Order of \n     Lawyers;\n       Whereas the Quartet offered a path away from violence, \n     political assassinations, and civil unrest by promoting \n     mediation and a peaceful political process led by civil \n     society actors committed to the rule of law and human rights;\n       Whereas an elected National Constituent Assembly adopted a \n     new, progressive constitution in early 2014, and Tunisia held \n     peaceful and fair elections in late 2014, formally ending a \n     series of transitional governments;\n       Whereas in response to the March 18, 2015 terrorist attack \n     on the Bardo National Museum that killed 21 people, Tunisian \n     citizens and political leaders have reaffirmed their \n     commitment to dialogue, pluralism, and democracy;\n       Whereas a terrorist attack on July 26, 2015 on a beach in \n     the town of Sousse, left 38 people, including 30 British \n     nationals, dead, and dealt a blow to tourism in Tunisia, an \n     important industry upon which the Tunisian economy depends;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama stated on October 9, 2015, \n     ``With the Quartet's support, Tunisians voted in free \n     elections, forged a new constitution that upholds human \n     rights and equality for all people, including women and \n     minorities, and formed a national unity government, including \n     secular and Islamist parties, showing that democracy and \n     Islam can indeed thrive together.'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry stated on October 9, \n     2015, ``The Tunisian model of inclusivity and respecting \n     fundamental freedoms of all its citizens is the best answer \n     to the violence and extremist ideologies that have torn apart \n     other countries in the region'';\n       Whereas Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi stated on \n     October 9, 2015, that the Nobel Peace Prize signified ``a \n     tribute not only to the Quartet and its organizations but\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n     is also a crowning of the principle of consensual solutions \n     adopted by Tunisia'';\n       Whereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee stated on October 10, \n     2015, ``The broad-based national dialogue that the Quartet \n     succeeded in establishing countered the spread of violence in \n     Tunisia . . . the prize is intended as an encouragement to \n     the Tunisian people, who despite major challenges have laid \n     the groundwork for a national fraternity which the Committee \n     hopes will serve as an example to be followed by other \n     countries'';\n       Whereas Tunisia continues to face serious threats to its \n     security from violent extremist groups operating within \n     Tunisia as well as in neighboring countries;\n       Whereas a terrorist attack on November 24, 2015 on \n     Tunisia's Presidential Guard killed 12 people and represents \n     another effort to undermine democracy and stability in \n     Tunisia;\n       Whereas Tunisia faces economic challenges, including high \n     inflation and high unemployment, especially among young \n     Tunisians;\n       Whereas the United States is committed to continuing a \n     strong economic partnership with Tunisia as it undertakes \n     reforms to transform its economy to meet the aspirations of \n     all of its citizens;\n       Whereas the United States and Tunisia have enjoyed friendly \n     relations for more than 200 years;\n       Whereas in accordance with the United States-Tunisia \n     Strategic Partnership, both countries are dedicated to \n     working together to promote economic development and business \n     opportunities in Tunisia, education for the advancement of \n     long-term development in Tunisia, and increased security \n     cooperation to address common threats in Tunisia and across \n     the region;\n       Whereas in July 2015, President Obama designated Tunisia a \n     Major Non-NATO Ally;\n       Whereas Tunisia is a member of the Global Coalition to \n     Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL);\n       Whereas at the second United States-Tunisia Strategic \n     Dialogue in November 2015, Secretary Kerry reaffirmed the \n     historic friendship and growing strategic partnership between \n     the United States and Tunisia and praised the role of civil \n     society organizations in Tunisia's democratic transition;\n       Whereas the United States Government allocated \n     approximately $580,000,000 in foreign assistance during \n     fiscal years 2011 through 2014, which is 10 ten times the \n     bilateral assistance appropriated for Tunisia during the \n     previous 4 fiscal years;\n       Whereas the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2016 \n     included a substantial increase in bilateral assistance to \n     support Tunisia's democratic transition;\n       Whereas it is in America's interest to see that a pluralist \n     democracy and a vibrant economy develop in Tunisia;\n       Whereas the United States should provide a level of funding \n     to strongly assist and reinforce Tunisia's transition to \n     democracy, stability, and prosperity:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet on \n     winning the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize;\n       (2) commends the leaders of The Tunisian General Labor \n     Union; The Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade, and \n     Handicrafts; The Tunisian Human Rights League; and The \n     Tunisian Order of Lawyers for negotiating solutions to \n     political crises;\n       (3) commends Tunisian political leaders for their \n     willingness to compromise and work together in the interest \n     of the Tunisian people;\n       (4) encourages the Government of Tunisia to build upon its \n     successes and move swiftly to implement necessary political \n     and economic reforms that will benefit the Tunisian people \n     and consolidate Tunisia's democratic transition; and\n       (5) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to \n     support the Government of Tunisia and its people as they \n     continue on the path to democracy and fulfill their desire \n     for a stable and prosperous country.\n\n

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Travis Randall \nMcDonough, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of \nTravis McDonough to be a Federal district judge in the Eastern District \nof Tennessee. He was nominated over a year ago, and his nomination was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote nearly 5 \nmonths ago. Despite having the support of his home State Republican \nSenators, Mr. McDonough's nomination has nevertheless been held up by \nRepublican leadership for no good reason.\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\n  I will further note that, while Mr. McDonough's vote is long overdue, \nRepublican leadership has skipped over Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo--who \nis ahead of Mr. McDonough on the Executive Calendar. I recall \nRepublican leadership promising regular order when they took over the \nmajority, so they should explain how skipping over a consensus and \neminently qualified nominee with bipartisan support is following \nregular order.\n  Judge Restrepo was nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nthird circuit over a year ago. If confirmed, he would be the first ever \nHispanic judge from Pennsylvania on the third circuit. Judge Restrepo \nhas the strong support of the Hispanic National Bar Association and has \nbipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and \nSenator Casey. Senator Toomey has said not only that he strongly \nsupports Judge Restrepo's confirmation, but that he also recommended \nhim to the President. I cannot explain why Senate Republicans are not \nallowing Judge Restrepo to be confirmed today.\n  As we approach the end of the year, the Senate Republican majority is \ncoming closer and closer to matching the record for confirming the \nfewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. While \nmost Senators I have served with over the last 40 years would shudder \nat this fact, the current Republican leadership seems content to \naccomplish as little as possible when it comes to confirming nominees \nto our third branch of government.\n  In the 11 months that Republicans have controlled the Senate, only 11 \njudges will have received a confirmation vote, including today. When \nSenate Democrats were in the majority during the seventh year of the \nBush Presidency, we had already confirmed 36 judges by this point. We \nshould take action right now and hold confirmation votes on the 19 \nother judicial nominees pending on the floor. Confirming the remaining \n19 nominees would fulfill a basic duty of the Senate and would result \nin a total of 30 judicial nominees confirmed this year. That number is \nstill short of the 36 nominees that Senate Democrats confirmed at the \nsame point of the George W. Bush administration, but it would mark a \nsignificant effort by this Senate to reduce vacancies. There is no \nreason not to do this. All 19 of the nominees were voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee by voice vote, but Republicans still refuse to \nbring them up for a vote.\n  This obstruction has resulted in needless delays for hard-working \nAmericans who seek justice in our Federal courts. Currently pending on \nthe Senate floor are nominees who would fill judicial emergency \nvacancies in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, New \nYork, and California. Senate Republicans have not responded to the \nurgent needs of those States to the detriment of their own \nconstituents.\n  Throughout his tenure, President Obama has worked with Senators to \nhave the Federal judiciary better reflect the people they serve. Today \nthere are more women and minorities than ever before on the Federal \nbench. This is an accomplishment that helps ensure the public's \nconfidence in their court system. Unfortunately, that meaningful \nprogress has slowed down under the Senate's Republican control. Today, \nseveral nominees of color with outstanding qualifications are being \nheld up for no good reason, including Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo.\n  Senate Republicans are also holding up four exceptional African-\nAmerican district court nominees and an exceptional Hispanic district \ncourt nominee. Two of the African-American nominees--Waverly Crenshaw \nand Edward Stanton--have been nominated to district court positions in \nTennessee. Both have the support of their home State Republican \nSenators and were unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote; yet they continue to wait for the majority leader to \nschedule their votes. The three other nominees of color being held up--\nWilhelmina Wright to the District of Minnesota, and John Vazquez and \nJulien Neals to the District of New Jersey--are all nominated to \njudicial emergency vacancies. They also all have the support of their \nhome State Senators and were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote.\n  In addition to the article III nominees, five nominees to the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims, who were all nominated more than a year ago, \ncontinue to be held up by a single Republican Senator--the junior \nSenator of Arkansas. The Court of Federal Claims has been referred to \nas ``the People's Court'' because it allows citizens to seek prompt \njustice against our government. Of the five nominees, one is a Cuban \nAmerican who has devoted his entire career to public service at the \nU.S. Department of Justice; another is an African-American woman who \nspent over two decades serving as a judge advocate general and as a \nmilitary judge. All five were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by \nunanimous voice vote, but Senator Cotton continues to object to any of \nthem receiving an up-or-down vote. He claims to have concerns with the \ncaseload, but a recent letter from the chief judge of the Court of \nFederal Claims to the Judiciary Committee has indicated that only one \nof the nine senior judges is willing to be recalled for full-time duty, \nand the other three would only agree to be recalled on a limited basis. \nMoreover, the court's overall caseload has increased 9 percent over the \nlast year. There are no good reasons for Senator Cotton to continue \nblocking these nominees. They deserve to have their confirmation votes \nscheduled. Senators can vote for or against them, but they should not \nbe denied a simple up-or-down vote.\n  In a letter dated December 2, 2015, from the American Bar Association \nto Majority Leader McConnell, the president of the ABA states that \n``our courts are unfortunately worse off today than they were at the \nstart of this Congress.'' The letter urges the majority leader to \nschedule votes on the confirmation of all the article III judicial \nnominees currently pending on the Executive Calendar. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The process of confirming judges is about ensuring that the American \npeople have a fully functioning judiciary. Because of Republican \nobstruction, judicial vacancies have increased by more than 50 percent \nsince they took over the majority, and caseloads are piling up in \ncourts throughout the country. Judicial emergencies have more than \ndoubled since the beginning of this year.\n  I am concerned that the Republican leadership's refusal to confirm \njudicial nominations this year is undermining the judicial branch and \nharming the American people who seek justice. I urge Senate Republicans \nto conclude this year by showing leadership and by scheduling \nconfirmation votes on the remaining judicial nominees pending on the \nExecutive Calendar.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, December 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Democratic Leader, Capitol Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid: \n     On behalf of the American Bar Association, I write to urge \n     you to schedule votes on the confirmation of 15 nominees \n     pending on the Senate floor before the Senate recesses for \n     the year. Seven of the pending nominees have the backing of \n     their Republican home-state senators and all 15 have been \n     reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by unanimous \n     voice votes. Most importantly, if confirmed, nine of the \n     pending nominees would fill vacancies that have been declared \n     judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \n     Courts. Courts with emergency vacancies have too few judges \n     to handle their workload effectively and deliver timely \n     justice.\n       Regardless of how one views confirmation data comparisons \n     among recent presidents or the fact that the vacancy rate has \n     not reached crisis proportion, our courts are unfortunately \n     worse off today than they were at the start of this Congress. \n     There are 22 more vacancies (with three more in the pipeline \n     this month) and more than twice the number of judicial \n     emergencies today than there were this past January. In some \n     of our courts with judicial emergencies, litigants have to \n     put their businesses or private lives on hold indefinitely \n     while waiting for their day in court. This is unnecessary and \n     unfair.\n       Action on the 15 pending nominees has proceeded slowly to \n     date. Most of them received their nominations over 200 days \n     ago and had to wait over 4 months to be voted out of \n     committee without objection.\n       Even though we appreciate the Senate's full agenda and the \n     short amount of time remaining in the session, we urge you to \n     give\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\n     every pending nominee a floor vote before you leave for your \n     recess. Absent legitimate concerns over a nominee's \n     qualifications, we believe that this can best be accomplished \n     over the next few weeks by voting on multiple nominees at a \n     time.\n       We know from the daily experience of our more than 400,000 \n     members that vacancies must be filled promptly so that courts \n     have the resources to deliver timely, impartial justice. By \n     putting politics aside, an opportunity is provided for the \n     Senate to use its time in the next two weeks to afford \n     considerable relief to the federal courts.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the \n     American Bar Association.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paulette Brown,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                        Embracing All Religions\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, earlier today Donald Trump called for the \nUnited States to ban all Muslims from entering our Nation. This is the \nsingle worst idea I have heard from any Presidential candidate, ever. \nIt is inconsistent with our American values. It is inconsistent with \nour national history.\n  The Nation has looked back on events in our past--for example, the \nChinese Exclusion Act or the internment of Japanese American citizens--\nand realized it was a huge mistake to make one significant group our \nenemy. It is inconsistent with the vision of our Constitution, in which \nall came to the United States seeking to escape persecution and to be \nable to practice whichever religion they chose. The Founders of the \nUnited States did not seek to make our Nation one in which only a \nsingle religion could be practiced. They did not seek to establish one \nreligion as a preeminent religion. They instead wanted a safe haven \nwhere people could worship as they pleased, which is the heart of our \nFirst Amendment.\n  This idea is wrong and wrongheaded. It is wrong in the context that \nwe are not at war with Islam. In fact, we are working in partnership \nwith Islamic nations to take on a terrorist group known as ISIS. It is \nwrong in that all patriotic Americans of every religion are working \ntogether to take on this terrorist group known as ISIS. In addition to \nbeing wrong, it is wrongheaded in that making Islam the enemy is \nplaying straight out of ISIS's playbook, which wants to create a war \nbetween America and Islam. In that sense, this type of irresponsible \nstatement endangers our national security rather than strengthens it.\n  So let others stand up and embrace our citizens of every religion and \nrecognize the partnership we are in together to take on terrorist \nforces, that we are working in partnership with a variety of nations \nthat have a whole variety of religions, including Islam, to take on the \nterrorist force known as ISIS.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will be voting on \nthe President's nominee to fill a vacancy in the Eastern District of \nTennessee.
