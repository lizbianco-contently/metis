Mr. President, deep in shadow, there is a specter that \nhaunts our country. In dark corners it claims thousands of victims \nevery year--quietly, stealthily, maliciously. It is hard for many \nAmericans to believe that human trafficking could happen where they \nlive, but it does, right here in the United States--in all 50 of our \nStates. And many of these victims are children.\n  In Kentucky alone the Commonwealth has been able to identify more \nthan 100 victims since it began keeping relevant records in 2013. While \nthis kind of abuse often begins around the age of 13 or 14, there have \nbeen reports of victims in Kentucky as young as 2 months old. It is \njust about the most morally offensive thing you can imagine.\n  These victims need a voice, they need justice, and the new Congress \nis determined to give them both. That is just what the bill we are \nconsidering this week, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, aims \nto do.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Cornyn for his hard work on this \nlegislation. He has been a tireless advocate for it. I also want to \nnote that this legislation has always been a bipartisan exercise. I \nwant to thank the 13 Democratic cosponsors of the bill.\n  It is a bill that received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee \nearlier this year and was reported without a single negative vote. It \nhas been thoroughly vetted and carefully crafted, which explains its \nbipartisan support in the Senate. That also explains the long list of \nendorsements outside the Senate, with organizations such as Shared Hope \nInternational, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children among its many \nsupporters.\n  Here is what one of the broad coalitions backing this bill had to say \nabout it. ``The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act provides \nunprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking, who are too \noften invisible and underserved,'' they wrote. ``This legislation is \nvital.''\n  I hope now that it has been brought to the floor, this bill continues \nto enjoy its strong record of constructive bipartisan support. It is \nsimilar to a measure that was passed by the House of Representatives.\n  The version before us also contains some additional provisions as \nwell. For instance, Senator Portman has offered ideas to improve the \nway we find missing kids and to strengthen law enforcement efforts to \ninvestigate and prosecute those who commit sex trafficking crimes.\n  It is good to see such a strong and bipartisan piece of legislation \nbecause victims of human trafficking should be treated as victims--not \nas criminals--because they should have the services and resources they \nneed to rebuild their lives and because law enforcement should have the \ntools it needs to protect them and to combat these crimes. This bill \naims to ensure these things actually happen, and I look forward to the \nSenate's good work to pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1343-6", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1343-S1344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING EDWARD W.

Mr. President, all over the country today in newspapers and \nelectronic media there is a story. I will just pick one of them out \nfrom the front page of the Washington Post today. The headline reads: \n``CBO: Health law will cost less than expected.'' It says: ``President \nObama's health-care law will cost taxpayers substantially less than \npreviously estimated, congressional budget officials said Monday, in an \nupbeat note for a program that has faced withering criticism since its \npassage five years ago.''\n  I would just note here that the opposition has come from my \nRepublican colleagues in the Senate and the House. They voted 67 times \nto repeal it in the House. Of course, each time it has failed.\n  Continuing on in this article, it says:\n\n       The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office attributed the \n     savings to spending on medical care in coming years that will \n     not be as great as previously forecast. As a result, the \n     agency said, insurers are not expected to charge Americans as \n     much for coverage, and the government will save on subsidies \n     for low- and moderate-income people.\n       What's more, the CBO has concluded that companies are not \n     canceling health insurance policies as often as had been \n     anticipated earlier this year. Fewer Americans consequently \n     are planning to sign up for insurance under the Affordable \n     Care Act, generating more taxpayer savings.\n       In total, the health-care law will cost taxpayers . . . 11 \n     percent less over the next decade than estimated in January. \n     The cost of providing subsidies for people to buy insurance \n     on the state and federal marketplaces--the centerpiece of the \n     law--will be 20 percent lower than projected.\n\n  The article goes on and on about the good things that are happening \nwith health care in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1344-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the official mission statement for the U.S. \nAttorney General reads:\n\n       To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United \n     States according to the law; to ensure public safety against \n     threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership \n     in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment \n     for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and \n     impartial administration of justice for all Americans.\n\n  That is a tremendous responsibility.\n  The U.S. Attorney General is more than just a lawyer or an \nadministrator. An Attorney General is a defender, a crime fighter, and \nan advocate for Americans' rights. It is not an easy job, but President \nObama's nominee Loretta Lynch is up to the task.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have seen many qualified \nnominees, Republicans and Democrats--people such as Janet Reno, \nMadeline Albright, Colin Powell, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Loretta \nLynch, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is as qualified as any \ncandidate I have ever seen in my 33 years in Congress.\n  Ms. Lynch currently serves as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York. She has been confirmed unanimously for that \noffice by the Senate twice, most recently in 2010. During her time in \nthe U.S. attorney's office, Loretta Lynch has proven herself to be a \ntough crimefighter. She has vigorously prosecuted drug dealers and \ncriminals, corrupt politicians, and greedy Wall Street bankers.\n  Loretta Lynch is also a guardian of the Constitution. She takes the \nprotections afforded to Americans in the Bill of Rights seriously. \nAlmost two decades ago she helped bring to justice a Haitian immigrant \nwho had been physically and sexually assaulted by police officers \nacting outside the law.\n  She has also defended human rights abroad. She was part of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, where she prosecuted \nsuspects accused of one of the most heinous crimes in world history, \nthe genocide carried out in Rwanda.\n  Whatever the case, whatever the crime, Loretta Lynch has protected \nthe innocent and fought the guilty. She has been exemplary in defending \nthe interests of the United States and its people. She is an ideal \ncandidate to be America's top law enforcement officer. That is why she \nwas nominated 121 days ago by President Obama.\n  I look forward to the Senate finishing this confirmation as soon as \npossible. The American people need Loretta Lynch in their corner.\n  Mr. President, what is the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1344-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every year millions of human beings around \nthe world are forced into slave labor and sold for sex. This includes a \nlarge number of children. While these crimes are especially prevalent \nin countries where prosecution of trafficking is lax or essentially \nnonexistent, the truth is that human trafficking occurs in every \ncountry, including right here in the United States. Every year \nthousands of Americans--most frequently women and children--are \ntrafficked within the borders of the United States.\n  A large number of the victims are children who are bought and sold to \nfeed the twisted desires of sexual predators. That is a key phrase, \n``bought and sold,'' because to the criminals who prey on these \nchildren, that is what it is about--buying and selling. It is a \nbusiness. That is right--the sexual exploitation and brutalization of \nchildren, some of them not yet teenagers, is a business to the \ntraffickers who ensnare them, and many of them get rich off of the \nhorror these children endure.\n  Traffickers identify vulnerable targets--often children who are \nalready living in difficult circumstances or come from broken homes. \nThey then engage in calculated campaigns to win the trust of these \nvulnerable children and lure them into their orbit. After the child has \nbeen trapped, he or she is brought into a lifestyle whose horrors are \ndifficult to adequately describe. These children are forced into a life \nof prostitution, their innocence repeatedly and brutally violated \nhundreds or thousands of times in a year. They are controlled by a \ncombination of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse at the hands \nof their traffickers. Many of them become hooked on drugs as well \nthanks to their captors, who see drug dependence as a useful means of \ncontrol.\n  Some children never escape from this life. They end up dead before \nthey have even left their childhood behind, the victim of a dangerous \nencounter with a sexual predator or too violent a beating at the hands \nof a pimp. Those children who do escape can take years or decades to \nrecover from the trauma. Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, \nand lasting physical injuries are just some of the challenges victims \ncan face as they attempt to rebuild their lives. Some never recover.\n  All of this is nothing more than a business to the traffickers, who \nenrich\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nthemselves off the violation of the innocent. I am reminded of the \nverse in the Gospels ``For what does it profit a man to gain the whole \nworld but forfeit his soul?''\n  If there is any crime against which the human person revolts, it is \nthe sexual brutalization of children. It is well known that even \nhardened criminals despise those who have hurt children in this way. \nGoing after those who traffic in children should be a priority for \nlocal, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies.\n  This week we are considering the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct, a bill put together by my colleague, the senior Senator from \nTexas. I cosponsored this legislation because I believe it provides a \nnumber of important tools to strengthen our efforts to eradicate \ntrafficking in this country and to help its victims.\n  This legislation would give law enforcement additional resources for \ntargeting traffickers, including increased access to wiretaps for State \nand local task forces conducting human trafficking and child \npornography investigations, authorization for programs targeting child \nexploitation, and offering law enforcement training for returning \nveterans who want to focus on combating human trafficking.\n  A large portion of the bill is focused on providing assistance to \nvictims as they seek to regain their lives. Among the bill's many \nvictim-related provisions are, first, a deficit-neutral domestic \ntrafficking victims fund to increase the Federal support available to \ntrafficking victims, financed by increased penalties for those \nconvicted of trafficking-related crimes; second, a new block grant \nprogram to help State and local governments expand the resources they \noffer to trafficking victims and strengthen their law enforcement \nefforts; third, a provision written by my colleague from South Dakota, \nRepresentative Kristi Noem, that would help expand the extremely \nlimited housing available to recovering underaged trafficking victims; \nfourth, a notification requirement to ensure that trafficking victims \nare told of any plea bargains or deferred prosecution agreements in \ntheir case; fifth, a provision to give victims of child pornography \naccess to the same services available to trafficking victims by \nclassifying child pornography production as a type of human \ntrafficking; and sixth, a human trafficking advisory council made up of \ntrafficking survivors to make recommendations to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by some of the leading \norganizations in the fight against human trafficking, including the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Shared Hope \nInternational, Rights4Girls, and the National Association to Protect \nChildren. It is also supported by a bipartisan majority here in the \nSenate, and I am looking forward to passing it in the very near future.\n  The sooner we get these tools in the hands of law enforcement, the \nbetter. If we succeed in anything as a society, it should be in \nprotecting the innocent. I hope this legislation will help advance the \nfight against trafficking in this country and help promote the healing \nof human trafficking's many victims.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 474, the Protecting \nStudents from Sexual and Violent Predators Act. This is a bipartisan \nbill. It is a bill I introduced with Senator Joe Manchin in the last \nCongress, and we recently reintroduced this bill. We also intend to \noffer this bill as an amendment to the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act that the Senator from South Dakota was just discussing.\n  This is a bill which provides some crucial protections to our \nchildren, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this underlying bill. I \nam confident it is going to pass, and I certainly hope it will pass \nwith our amendment.\n  The bipartisan amendment I will be introducing, the Protecting \nStudents from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, amends the underlying \nbill to protect even more children. That is what it does. It provides \nspecific protections against convicted child molesters infiltrating our \nschools.\n  I will say up front that I fully recognize that the vast majority of \nschool employees would never consider sexually or violently abusing the \nchildren in their care. We all understand that, but we also understand \nthat there are pedophiles in this country and they seek out vulnerable \nchildren. That is what they do. They know the kids are concentrated in \nschools with no parents around, and that is what we have to protect \nthese kids against.\n  I have been fighting for this for over a year now--together with \nSenator Manchin and others--and I will not stop fighting until we get \nthis done. I have three very personal reasons that this fight is one I \nhave taken on and I will continue with, and the personal reasons are my \nown kids. They are 14, 13, and almost 5 years old. I need to know, just \nas every parent needs to know, that when we put our child on a \nschoolbus that child is going somewhere where they are going to be \nsafe, they are going to be protected, and they are not going to be \nvictims, they are not going to fall prey to some of the very people who \nare supposed to be looking after them.\n\n  Unfortunately, for too many kids that is not true today, as is the \nstory of one particular child who inspired this legislation. For a \nchild named Jeremy Bell, the story begins in Delaware County, PA. One \nof the schoolteachers there molested several boys and raped one. \nProsecutors decided they didn't have enough evidence to bring a case \nagainst this monster. The school knew what was going on, so they \ndecided to dismiss the teacher for sexually abusing his students, but \nthen, appallingly, the school decided to make sure he went off and \nbecame someone else's problem.\n  The Pennsylvania school wrote a letter of recommendation for that \nteacher, who took that letter of recommendation and brought it to the \nschool he applied to work at in West Virginia. He got hired, and over \ntime he became the principal. Well, these kinds of pedophiles do not \nchange their ways, and he didn't change his ways in West Virginia. He \ncontinued to prey on kids. Eventually, he raped and then murdered a 12-\nyear-old boy named Jeremy Bell.\n  Justice eventually caught up with the killer, and he is now serving a \nlife sentence for that murder. But for little Jeremy Bell that justice \ncame too late. And, sadly, Jeremy Bell is not alone. Last year we had \n459 school employees across America arrested for sexual misconduct with \nthe very children they are supposed to be protecting and teaching and \ncaring for. That is more than one per day. And those are just the ones \nwhere there was enough evidence to actually prosecute, to make an \narrest and to pursue charges. How many others were getting away with \nthis?\n  Frankly, 2015 is not off to a much better start. So far we are 69 \ndays into the new year and there have already been 82 school employees \narrested across the country for sexual misconduct with the \nschoolchildren in their care.\n  These are not just statistics. These are not just numbers on a page. \nThese are children's lives, every single one of them; such as the \nlittle girl whose sexual abuse began at age 10 and only ended when at \nage 17 she found herself pregnant with the teacher's child; a teacher's \naide who raped a young mentally disabled boy in his care; a \nkindergarten teacher who kept a child during recess and forced her to \nperform sexual acts on him.\n  It is hard to even talk about these changes, but they are happening--\none school employee after another caught with child pornography. \nSometimes these images are of kids who are just 1 year old. This is \nunbelievable. It is outrageous. But it is happening.\n  We in Congress have to do what we can to stop this, and we can do \nsomething. The Toomey-Manchin protecting students bill takes an \nimportant step in the direction of stopping these outrageous acts, and \nit does so by relying on two mechanisms to accomplish this. The first \nmechanism is to require schools to do appropriate criminal background \nchecks so we are not knowingly hiring pedophiles in our schools; and \nthe second is to ban this terrible practice by which schools knowingly \nsend a letter of recommendation for\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\none of these creeps to go somewhere else. They are recommending them so \nthey become someone else's problem.\n  Neither of these mechanisms should be controversial. The House of \nRepresentatives unanimously passed a bill in the last Congress that has \nboth of these mechanisms. I am proud of the fact we have three former \nHouse Members who voted for this bill last year who are now cosponsors \nof our legislation, including the junior Senator from West Virginia, \nfrom Colorado, and from Arkansas. I appreciate their support for this \ncommonsense legislation.\n  Furthermore, a few months ago, every Member of the House and Senate \nexcept one voted for even more expansive background checks when we all \nvoted in favor of the Child Care Development Block Grant bill. The \ncombined vote in the House and Senate was 523 to 1. This is not \ncontroversial stuff.\n  So what would we actually do? What does the legislation accomplish? \nNo. 1, criminal background checks. Every State has some kind of \ncriminal background check now, that is true, but it is pretty obvious \nthat many of them are not adequate. For instance, too often there are \nwhole categories of school employees who are not covered by the \ncriminal background check, and too often States don't check all of the \ncriminal databases that are available to them, and so these pedophiles \nare slipping through the cracks.\n  The protecting students act requires a school district that wants to \ntake Federal funds to pay its teachers' salaries to perform background \nchecks on all the workers who have unsupervised contact with the \nchildren. That would include new hires and existing hires.\n  Another reality is that many States have only recently adopted these \nbackground checks. They have hired employees prior to the legislation \nrequiring the criminal background checks, and some of these employees \nhave this kind of criminal background. Take the case of William Vahey, \n64 years old. He taught for decades at some of the world's most elite \nschools. He started in California and then started working his way \nacross the country. Do you know what he used to do? He used to give his \nyoung students Oreo cookies laced with sleeping pills, and when the \nboys fell asleep he molested them and he photographed it. Scores of \nchildren were sexually abused.\n  This teacher had been convicted for sexual abuse of children when he \nwas in his twenties, but these school districts weren't doing a \nthorough background check so they weren't discovering these things. \nWell, the protecting students act ensures sex offenders such as William \nVahey will not fall through the cracks. They will be discovered by a \nmore thorough and rigorous background check system that our bill \nrequires.\n  I should also point out our bill--the protecting students act--\nrequires the schools to do the criminal background checks not just for \nteachers but for contractors as well--some schoolbus drivers, coaches, \nsubstitute teachers, anyone who comes in unsupervised contact with the \nkids. There are currently 12 States that have no such requirement at \nall. They do not check on the backgrounds of their contractors, despite \nthe fact these folks come in regular contact with kids.\n  Case in point: In Montana, parents got a very rude awakening \nrecently. An audit of Montana's schoolbus drivers found they have 123 \ndrivers with criminal histories, including one driver whose conviction \nlanded him on the Sexual and Violent Offender Registry and one with an \noutstanding arrest warrant.\n  Running these background checks on school workers is only going to be \nhelpful if it is thorough, if it is adequate. So what the Toomey-\nManchin bill does is it requires the background check include all four \nof the major crime databases that are available. There is the FBI \nfingerprint database, the National Sex Offender Registry, the State \ncriminal registry in each State, and the State Child Abuse and Neglect \nRegistry.\n  This past August parents in Alaska learned that Alaska has an \ninadequate background check system, and it resulted in a known child \nrapist teaching in Alaska schools for 4 years. This is unbelievable, \nbut this is what is happening. On August 29, Alaska State troopers \narrested a middle school teacher in Kiana, AK. The teacher had fled \nMissouri 4 years earlier in order to escape an arrest warrant. Multiple \nwitnesses accused the teacher over a decade of sexual and physical \nabuse of his own adopted children. He had raped and starved these \nchildren--his own children. This is unbelievable. The children \nliterally had to burrow a hole in the wall and steal frozen food and \nwarm it up, heat it on a furnace, just to survive.\n  This monster was able to leave the State and obtain a teaching job in \nAlaska for 4 years. When asked how in the world this could happen, the \nDepartment of Education of Alaska explained: Well, the Alaska \nbackground checks looked at the State criminal registry but not the \nFederal registry. So they had no idea he was a wanton, despicable \ncriminal and had such a record in other States. Had our bill been in \nforce, Alaska would have been required to check the Federal registry. \nThey would have discovered this before ever hiring this monster.\n  This is the first part of our bill--this requirement we have these \nbackground checks. And again, there is nothing controversial here. The \nHouse of Representatives passed more expansive language unanimously in \nthe last Congress. And a few months ago, as I mentioned, we had a \ncombined House and Senate vote of 523 votes in favor and 1 vote in \nopposition to the Child Care Development Block Grant Act which imposes \nappropriate and rigorous background checks on those caring for our kids \nin daycare. That makes perfect sense. We should be screening out \npedophiles from working in our daycares, but we also should be \nproviding the same level of protection to kids who are a little bit \nolder, who are in grade school or middle school or high school.\n  There is a second part to our legislation, and it addresses this \noutrageous practice of what is known as passing the trash. This is that \nunbelievable act that resulted in the death of Jeremy Bell, when a \nletter of recommendation allowed a known pedophile to be employed in \nWest Virginia.\n  Our bill simply says if a State wants to receive Federal taxpayer \nmoney, it can't knowingly help a child molester get a job somewhere \nelse. How can this even be controversial? But the fact is this is an \nall too prevalent practice, and it is long past time we do something \nabout this.\n  Two weeks ago, WUSA News 9 reported some shocking news on the public \nschool system of Montgomery County, MD. Since 2011, 21 Montgomery \nCounty public school employees or contract workers have been \ninvestigated for child sex abuse or exploitation. The news station \nlearned that the Montgomery County public school system ``keeps a \nconfidential database of personnel who demonstrate inappropriate or \nsuspicious behavior towards children.''\n  This school system has this watch list of suspected abusers who are \nworking in the area's schools, and WUSA 9 learned the school system had \na record, a known record, of passing the trash. For example, elementary \nschool teacher Daniel Picca had been abusing children for 17 years. The \nschool system knew about it. What did they do? The teacher's punishment \nwas to move him from one elementary school to another, again and again \nand again. There was 17 years of passing a known child molester from 1 \nschool to another. How many kids did he victimize?\n  This has to stop. It is long overdue we do something about this, and \nthere is a way we can. We can make it illegal to knowingly recommend a \npedophile for employment somewhere else. That is what our bill does.\n  Another example: Recently, in Las Vegas, NV, a kindergarten teacher \nwas arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her with a \nsexually transmitted disease. This same teacher had molested six \nchildren--all fourth and fifth graders--several years before, but he \ndid it in the Los Angeles school district. While the Los Angeles school \ndistrict knew about the allegations in 2009, the school district \nrecommended settling a lawsuit that alleged the teacher had molested \nthese children. The Nevada school district specifically asked: Have \nthere been any criminal concerns regarding this teacher? The Los \nAngeles school district didn't only hide the truth, they provided three \nletters of recommendation--three references--for this teacher.\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\n  Now for those people who say: Well, the States can fix this problem \nall on their own, I ask you: What could Nevada do to protect itself \nfrom what teachers or school districts are doing in Los Angeles? What \ncould West Virginia have done about a Pennsylvania school district that \nsent a teacher across the State line with a letter of recommendation? \nThere is nothing one State can do to bind another State. This requires \na Federal solution.\n  Let me sum this up. The Toomey-Manchin bill offers a very simple \nproposition. If a school district wants to use Federal tax dollars to \nhire school employees, it has to make sure they are not hiring \npedophiles in the process. I think that is pretty reasonable. \nSpecifically, they need to perform background checks on any worker who \ncomes in unsupervised contact with children, and they need to stop \npassing the trash.\n  I can't believe this is even controversial. There is nobody who can \nstand here and say protections against child sex predators are not \nurgently needed, not in light of the daily revelations we are \ndiscovering.\n  Again, this legislation has overwhelming bipartisan support. It \npassed the House unanimously. How many bills pass the House unanimously \nthese days? This did. And every Member of the House and Senate except \none voted for even more extensive background checks to protect our \nyoungest kids in childcare. Can't we provide the same protection to \nslightly older kids? The legislation has been endorsed by innumerable \nchild advocate and law enforcement groups, including the National \nChildren's Alliance, which accredits and represents the Nation's 777 \nchild advocacy centers. Yet I am afraid we are probably going to have \nsome opposition voiced about this legislation when we offer the \namendment.\n\n  Let me be clear. First, we are not opposing a mandate on the States. \nWe don't have the legal authority to do that. What we are simply saying \nis if States want to take Federal funds, they need to protect children \nfrom violent and sexual predators. If States don't want to take those \nmeasures, then they can choose not to take Federal funds. If a State \nhas no interest in having a rigorous system for protecting kids, well, \nthat is their decision, but we don't have to send Federal tax dollars \nto pay the salaries of pedophiles.\n  Let me conclude. This is a commonsense bill. It is long overdue. It \nhas very broad bipartisan support. It passed the House unanimously. As \nI said, in this body, all but one Member voted for an even more \nexpansive background check.\n  Several Senators have voiced some specific concerns, and I am working \nwith several of them. I am willing to work with Senators who want to \nfind ways to constructively improve this bill, but I am not going to \nsupport a bill that waters down our ability to protect our kids from \npedophiles in school.\n  I hope this body will overwhelmingly adopt the legislation that \npassed the House unanimously, and we can begin to have a more thorough \nand effective process of protecting our kids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Is my understanding correct that it is the time for the \nminority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1347-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1347-S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, when 47 Republican Senators signed a \nletter sent to the Ayatollah Khomeini, it was a letter that although \nsupposedly instructive of the constitutional provisions of the \nseparation of government in the United States, in effect, it was a \nletter to erode the negotiating position of the President of the United \nStates and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to not \nhave a nuclear weapon capability of building a bomb in Iran.\n  I think history will show the strength of American foreign policy has \nalways been bipartisanship when it comes to the interests of America as \nwe look out and have to defend ourselves against our enemies. Indeed, \nIran with a nuclear bomb would be one of the gravest threats to our \nnational security as well as to our allies. It saddens me that we have \ncome to the point where we are so divided that nearly half of the \nSenators, on a partisan basis, in this great institution of the U.S. \nSenate, would in effect try to cut the legs from underneath the \nPresident and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to \navert a nuclear bomb.\n  So much has been said about this issue, but one common theme runs \nthroughout, and it is that people seem to know what the agreement is as \nit is being negotiated in secret. This Senator will reserve judgment. \nThis Senator is also an original cosponsor of the bill we filed to have \nCongress weigh in on any future lifting of economic sanctions that have \nbeen imposed by the Congress, and this Senator feels that is an \nappropriate role, under the separation of powers, of our job as \nCongress. But when we see a major part, on a partisan basis, of our \ngovernment try to undercut and kill the negotiations while they are \ngoing on at this very moment in Geneva, then that goes a step too far.\n  I am saddened. I think about what this Senator would have done when \nthe President was not Barack Obama but George Bush. I cannot imagine \nthat I would have tried to undercut the President of the United States \nrepresenting this country and trying, on matters of war and peace, to \nkeep peace. We can disagree about the specifics, but we still have to \nhonor the institution of the Presidency, and when it becomes matters of \nwar and peace, then we have to unify. That is why I am so saddened that \nwe have come to the point at which we appear to be so divided.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida for his \ncomments and I echo those this morning.\n  To the Presiding Officer and to the Members of the Senate, it was 70 \nyears ago this year, in this very Chamber, that the Republican Senator \nfrom Michigan, Arthur Vandenberg, gave a speech which has been called \nthe speech heard around the world. Here is how Senator Vandenberg \nopened that speech:\n\n       Mr. President, there are critical moments in the life of \n     every nation which call for the straightest, the plainest, \n     and the most courageous thinking of which we are capable. We \n     confront such a moment now. It is not only desperately \n     important to America, it is important to the world. It is \n     important not only to the generation which lives in blood. It \n     is important to future generations if they shall live in \n     peace.\n  This was after World War I and World War II, facing the Cold War and \nmany challenges.\n  Senator Vandenberg was no friend of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He \nwas, in fact, the biggest thorn in the President's side. He opposed \nevery New Deal program. He was bitterly opposed to U.S. engagement in \nEurope before World War II. He was the Nation's most famous \nisolationist and only moderated his stance after the bombing of Pearl \nHarbor.\n  But 70 years ago Senator Vandenberg spoke on the floor of the Senate \nto warn his colleagues about what would happen if the United States of \nAmerica allowed partisan politics to interfere in our Nation's \nleadership in the world. He later became the chair of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, where he coined the phrase ``politics \nstops at the water's edge.''\n  Politics stops at the water's edge.\n  His wisdom when it came to foreign policy--his understanding that for \nAmerica to be strong, we must convey strength on the world's stage--\nearned him a rare recognition, in fact, in this body.\n  My colleagues will recognize this picture because it is a painting \nhanging in the room right outside this Chamber. I was honored to be \nthere when it was unveiled--Senator Levin and myself--a few years ago. \nWe are proud of this Republican Senator from Michigan. He has been \ngiven an honor that is shared by only a handful of Senators. In our \nSenate history, out of 1,963 Senators--men and women who have served--\nonly a small group have been honored with a painting, a portrait just \noutside this Chamber, and he is one of them.\n  I can only imagine what Senator Vandenberg would say if he were alive\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\ntoday. How would he react to a letter signed by 47 U.S. Senators, all \nof his own party, addressed to the leaders--those we have called \nenemies--of Iran? How would he react to Members of the U.S. Senate \nempowering Iranian hard-liners--those whom we have called enemies time \nand time and time again--just to score political points against a \nPresident they do not like?\n  To be clear, Senator Vandenberg loathed President Roosevelt, and by \nall accounts the feelings were mutual. Senator Vandenberg was no model \nof bipartisanship himself. He was not at all what we would call a \nmoderate in his time. He may be considered a moderate today, but at the \ntime he was extremely partisan as a Republican, and he was very \nprominent. He disagreed with the President's policies relating to \nJapan, but he didn't send a letter to the Emperor of Japan undermining \nthe foreign policy of the President of the United States. He disagreed \nwith the President's policies relating to Germany, but he did not send \na letter to the chancellor of the Third Reich expressing his \ndisagreements with the President of the United States.\n  To be clear, one of the great things about America is that we can and \nshould and must disagree with the President when we disagree with \ndirections and policies. But when war hangs in the balance--and \nspecifically when nuclear war hangs in the balance--should Members of \nthe U.S. Senate be in a position of publicly undermining the President \nof the United States to our enemies? I do not believe Senator \nVandenberg would have become pen pals with a group of extremists whose \nstated goal is ``death to America.''\n  It is shocking, dangerous, and deeply troubling to me that 47 Members \nof this body decided to throw away 70 years of wisdom to stand on the \nside of the Ayatollahs and the most extreme voices in Iran.\n  When President Bush decided to invade Iraq, I voted no. I voted \nagainst his policies. I spoke out publicly about my concerns about that \nwar, but I never would have sent a letter to Saddam Hussein undermining \nthe President before that war happened.\n  The chairs of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the chairs of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and the chair of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee at that time all opposed President Bush's invasion \nof Iraq, but none of them penned a letter to Saddam Hussein.\n  I do not have to wonder what Senator Vandenberg would have thought \nabout all this because he told us. He told us 70 years ago in this very \nroom when explaining how partisanship and division would undermine our \nefforts in Europe.\n  Senator Vandenberg said:\n\n       It must mean one for all and all for one; and it will mean \n     this--unless somewhere in this grand alliance the stupid and \n     sinister folly of ulterior ambitions shall invite the enemy \n     to postpone our victory through our own rivalries and our own \n     confusion.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to hear the words of the Republican Senator \nfrom Michigan, Arthur Vandenberg. I urge them to stop the politics at \nthe water's edge.\n  We are talking about the possibility of a nuclear Iran. We all agree \nthat must not happen. We all agree that must not happen. We all agree \nthat must not happen. We must stand together with the smartest, most \neffective strategy to make sure that does not happen. That is even more \nreason why this is not the time nor the place to score political points \nagainst the President of the opposite party. This is deadly serious for \nthe United States, for Israel, and for the world.\n\n  As the Senate saw fit to give Senator Vandenberg a place of high \nhonor, reserved for only a few Senate leaders, just a few steps from \nhere in the U.S. Capitol, I hope my colleagues will hear and take heed \nof his words now.\n  He said:\n\n       We cannot drift to victory. We must have maximum united \n     effort on all fronts. . . . And we must deserve, we must \n     deserve the continued united effort of our own people. . . . \n     politics must stop at the water's edge.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me commend my colleagues Senator \nNelson from Florida and Senator Stabenow from Michigan for their \nstatements. Senator Nelson spoke from his heart and spoke for many of \nus on both sides of the aisle who feel this letter sent by 47 Senators \nundermines the efforts of the President of the United States to avoid a \nnuclear Iran and to avoid a military response.\n  I particularly want to thank my colleague Senator Stabenow from \nMichigan for recalling that moment in history which any student of the \nSenate knows was something that made a difference in the foreign policy \nof the United States of America for 70 years. It is seldom that any of \nus comes to the floor and thinks that our speeches will be remembered \nfor 70 minutes, but 70 years later Arthur Vandenberg, Republican of \nMichigan, set a standard for foreign policy which has guided our \ncountry since. At a time of deep political division after World War II, \nthis self-described isolationist and extremely conservative enemy of \nthe New Deal stood and called for unity when it comes to foreign \npolicy. His admonition that politics should stop at the water's edge \nhas largely guided us.\n  When we look at all the controversies that have ensued since then--\nthink of the Vietnam war and what was going on in this body during that \nwar, the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans, those who \nwere against the war and for the war. Yet there was never, ever \nanything like we have seen with this letter sent by 47 Republican \nSenators.\n  I am glad it didn't occur then, even though I had deep misgivings and \ntrouble with the Vietnam war in its execution. I would have had to have \nbeen reckless to endorse an idea that our Nation, through its Senate, \nwould reach out to the Vietnamese during the course of that war, when \nso many lives were at stake and so many lives were lost.\n  So here we are today--a letter sent by 47 Republican Senators. We \nhave talked about the impact of that. Reflect for a moment on the \nimpact of that letter on our allies who are sitting at the table in \nGeneva, our allies who joined us in imposing the strictest sanctions in \nhistory on Iran to force them into negotiation, our allies, sitting \nwith Secretary Kerry and representatives of our government, who must \nlook at this letter from 47 Republicans and say: Why are we wasting our \ntime? What they are saying is no matter what we do--because no \nagreement has been announced--no matter what we do, the Republican \nSenate is going to reject it. That is what the letter says.\n  It goes on to say--and this is a little bit of chutzpah according to \nthe New York Times. The Senators signing the letter go on to remind the \nAyatollah, who is not term-limited, that they have 6-year terms and may \nbe around for decades--decades--and basically say to the Iranians: \nDon't even waste your time thinking about negotiating.\n  It is not a waste of time because the alternatives are absolutely \nhorrifying. The alternative of a nuclear Iran would be a threat not \nonly to the Nation of Israel and many other Middle Eastern States and \ncountries beyond, in Europe and other places, but it would invite a \nnuclear arms race in the Middle East. The ending is totally \nunacceptable and unpredictable.\n  So is it worth negotiating? Is it worth trying to find a way to avoid \na nuclear Iran? Of course it is. Should the negotiations fail--and they \nmight. I hope not because of this letter, but they might--then what do \nwe face; bringing Iran to its knees with more sanctions? Whom will we \ncall on for these sanctions? Whom will we turn to and say: Will you \njoin us in a more strict sanctions regime? The very same allies who sat \nat this table and saw this letter from 47 Republican Senators saying to \nthem: Don't waste your time; we have the last word when it comes to \nIran.\n  I don't believe the Republican leadership was thinking clearly when \nthey signed on to this letter. I don't think they understood the \ngravity of their action. They certainly were premature, at the minimum. \nWe don't have an agreement. We are days away from understanding whether \nthere is a possibility of an agreement. Yet these 47 Senators have \nbasically said: Don't waste your time; we are not going to accept it no \nmatter what it is.\n  This is a sad outcome. Similar to the Senator from Michigan, I was 1 \nof 23\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\nwho voted against the invasion of Iraq. I never dreamed for one minute \nof sending a letter to Saddam Hussein before that vote instructing him \nabout the politics of America. It turns out that in the history of the \nSenate that has rarely, if ever, occurred.\n  I hope now that those 47 Republican Senators will reflect on their \nactions and reflect on the impact it will have. I hope the American \npeople understand the President is embarking on a very difficult and \ndelicate mission to try to negotiate a verifiable end to the nuclear \narms race in the Middle East and specifically to end nuclear capability \nin Iran. He may not achieve it, but I respect him for trying. He is the \nCommander in Chief of the United States of America. He is the elected \nleader of our Nation. Though many in this Chamber cannot accept it, he \nis the President of the United States, and he deserves our respect.\n  I respected President George W. Bush, even when I disagreed with him \non his policies on Iraq, and we should expect nothing less of the loyal \nminority when it comes to this President as well.\n  I conclude by saying the Senate has an important role to play. But \nthe President's role, speaking for the United States--trying to avoid a \nnuclear Iran, trying to avoid a military conflict, another war in the \nMiddle East--is something that should not be undermined for political \nambition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to completely align myself with \nviews of the distinguished Senator from Illinois. This isn't a case of \nwho can score political points for the evening news broadcast. We are \ntalking about potentially the lives of millions of people. We are \ntalking about the possibility of a cataclysmic mistake that could \ncreate havoc long after any of us has left this body. I have had the \nhonor of representing Vermont in the Senate beginning at the time when \nGerald Ford was President.\n  We have had Presidents I have agreed with--in fact, with every \nPresident there have been things I agreed with and with every \nPresident, Democratic or Republican, there have been things I have \ndisagreed with. But one thing I have always done when there are such \nnegotiations going on, I am willing to talk to the President privately, \nbut I am not going to state my position, for or against, publicly. We \ncan only have one person negotiating for the United States. Can you \nimagine if everybody who wanted to rush to the cable news shows to get \non TV were to say, well, here is our negotiating position--and we are \ngoing to force the President to leave the negotiating table? What do \nyou think those countries that joined us in imposing multilateral \nsanctions would do?\n  Many of those countries that joined us are doing so at great economic \ncost to themselves, but they responded--when President Obama went to \neach of them and asked: Will you join us in imposing sanctions, they \nagreed. That made the sanctions far more effective. If they think we \nare not serious, they are going to be very tempted to ask: Why should \nwe join you in supporting sanctions in the future? If the United States \nwere alone in supporting sanctions, no matter what those sanctions are, \nit would not create any real pressure on Iran.\n  Have we not made enough mistakes in the Middle East? I remember some \nwho said we must go to war in Iraq because it would protect Israel or \nbecause they had nuclear weapons or because they had weapons of mass \ndestruction. None of that was true. None of it. I remember people \nstopping me on the street, angry that I voted against the war in Iraq. \nThey said: We heard Vice President Cheney say they have nuclear \nweapons. I said: There are none.\n  The senior Senator from Michigan, in quoting Arthur Vandenberg--he \nwas no fan of Franklin Roosevelt, quite the opposite, but he did say, \nas we were going into World War II, ``politics must stop at the water's \nedge.'' That has been the view in my own State of both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Let's stop rushing for the cameras and potentially hurting the \nSenate, potentially hurting the country. Let's think about what is best \nfor the country.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nthe floor, so I will yield the floor so he can speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1349-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 \np.m. will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 686 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on this bill before the Senate, for a \nfew days we will continue to debate legislation to fight crime and \nrestore dignity to its survivors. I thank the majority leader for \nscheduling floor action on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nThis important bill is authored by our assistant majority leader, \nSenator Cornyn of Texas.\n  Human trafficking is a serious crime that is too often overlooked in \nits various forms, which include both labor trafficking and sexual \nservitude. It causes drastic harm to its victims. A form of modern-day \nslavery, human trafficking includes both adults and children, as well \nas noncitizens and citizens of our country. Experts tell us it is not \nlimited to big cities or our Nation's coasts but stretches across the \nwhole Nation, even to the rural parts of our country, including my \nMidwest. Indeed, it happens every day, everywhere in this country.\n  The Judiciary Committee met 2 weeks ago to hear testimony from a \nvictim advocate, a law enforcement official, and a sex trafficking \nsurvivor about the challenges we face in fighting human trafficking. \nOne witness, a criminal investigator from my State of Iowa who works \nfor our Democratic attorney general Tom Miller, told us about a 20-\nyear-old from my State who in December was abducted and forced into \nsexual servitude.\n  We have made progress in curbing human trafficking since the passage \nin 2000 of the Federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection \nAct--a measure I supported at that time--but there is still much work \nthat remains to be done on this front. This bill before the Senate \ntakes a creative and comprehensive approach to what is a pervasive and \nvery troubling problem. The measure has been endorsed by over 200 \ngroups, and it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee without a \ndissenting vote.\n  The centerpiece of this bill is its creation of a new fund called the \nDomestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which will be used to support a \nhost of programs and services for human trafficking and child \npornography survivors. The fund will be financed not by taxpayers' \ndollars but by fines collected from individuals convicted of human \ntrafficking and human smuggling crimes, making it deficit neutral.\n  If enacted, this bill will also equip law enforcement with new tools \nto fight trafficking. For example, it would make it easier for State \nlaw enforcement officials to wiretap human trafficking suspects without \nFederal approval. It also would expand the categories of persons who \ncan be prosecuted for human trafficking. In addition, it clarifies that \nchild pornography is a form of human trafficking.\n  This bill takes an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive approach, \ntackling not only the supply of human trafficking victims but also the \ndemand for these victims. Tackling the problem on both fronts is \nsomething the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service tells us is \nabsolutely necessary if we are to successfully curb human trafficking. \nIf enacted, this bill will ensure that both the trafficker and the \nbuyer will be prosecuted for their crimes.\n  We had an open and productive markup of this bill. I offered an \namendment, which was accepted by voice vote, clarifying that Federal \ngrant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking \nvictims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those \nwho serve runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth.\n  This amendment also updates the reauthorization language for the \nCyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nto ensure that child trafficking is specifically mentioned as a form of \nInternet-related child exploitation.\n  Finally, this amendment would require the Interagency Task Force to \nmonitor and combat trafficking to identify best practices to prevent \nhuman trafficking.\n  Senator Blumenthal from the State of Connecticut also offered an \namendment based on a bill he and Senator Kirk filed earlier this year, \nwhich was accepted in committee by a voice vote. Their bill, S. 575, \nknown as the HERO Act, provides authorization for a program at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that trains wounded warriors to assist \nin the effort to locate missing children.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill now before if Senate. I \ncommend Senator Cornyn, the lead sponsor of this measure, for his \nefforts to refine the bill and build such a substantial, very \nbipartisan coalition supporting it. I hope we will show the same \nbipartisan cooperation and support on the floor as we consider \namendments. I look forward to a vote on this bill as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in \nsupport of S. 178 from various organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 23, 2015.\n     Senator Chuck Grassley,\n     Chair, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Amy Klobuchar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Cornyn, and \n     Klobuchar: We write to you, the leaders of the U.S. Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, and to three committee Senators who have \n     been particularly sensitive to our (often ignored) \n     perspective. We write to you as survivors of sex trafficking \n     and commercial sexual exploitation. We write as survivors who \n     know, profoundly and personally, the harm caused by this \n     crime. And we write to you as survivor leaders of \n     organizations trying to prevent sex trafficking before it \n     victimizes others.\n       We write to express our support for legislation that makes \n     progress in three essential areas:\n       1. Identify new funding streams for victim services. \n     Current public budgets are stressed. Victims of sex \n     trafficking typically suffer multiple harms, requiring a \n     range of services from medical and psychological assistance \n     to treatment for the drug and alcohol addiction that so often \n     accompanies trafficking (addictions that make people \n     vulnerable to trafficking; addictions that develop or worsen \n     as people try to cope with the pain of this intimate form of \n     abuse). We've been told by law enforcement in numerous \n     jurisdictions that when services don't exist (mainly because \n     they are expensive) there's a disincentive to enforcing anti-\n     trafficking laws and identifying victims.\n       The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA), S. 178, \n     is innovative for creating a new fund to finance victim--\n     services an essential goal. It also achieves a second \n     principle we stand for: Making sex buyers accountable for the \n     harm they cause.\n       2. Prevent sex trafficking by targeting the buyers who \n     create demand. Logically, trafficking will never end until we \n     shrink the demand that creates the market. People still in \n     the life, still being exploited, sometimes avoid this \n     conclusion because they see no other options but the cycle of \n     violence in which they are trapped. We are strong witnesses \n     to the necessity of making the buyers pay, to make the crime \n     end.\n       Two bills in particular strength accountability in the sex \n     trafficking legal regime: S. 178 and Combat Human Trafficking \n     Act of 2015, S. 140. By clarifying congressional intent that \n     sex buyers be considered parties to the trafficking crime, by \n     compelling the Department of Justice to incorporate training \n     and technical assistance on investigating and prosecuting \n     buyers in its anti-trafficking programming, and by making the \n     crime more ``costly,'' we can finally begin to shrink its \n     incidence.\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\n       3. Treat victims as victims, not criminals, and let \n     survivor voices inform anti-trafficking policy. Two bills in \n     particular recognize these realities: the Stop Exploitation \n     Through Trafficking Act, S. 166, which gives states \n     incentives to approve ``Safe Harbor'' laws as well as job \n     training options for victims and the Survivors of Human \n     Trafficking Empowerment Act, which creates a survivors-led \n     U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal \n     policy and programs.\n       Other proposals may also make valuable contributions, but \n     these are the three most important principles to incorporate \n     in new legislative initiatives.\n       Thank you for your consideration. Please let us know if you \n     have specific questions or would like more information on our \n     program activities.\n           Sincerely,\n       Windie Lazenko, 4her--North Dakota, ND; Brooke Axtell, \n     Allies Against Slavery, TX; Aliza Amar, Breaking the Silence \n     Together/Sole Sisters Project, San Diego, CA; Vednita Carter, \n     Breaking Free, St Paul, MN; Leah J.

Chuck Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We are a \n     coalition of organizations from across the United States \n     dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable women and \n     children and write to express our support for the Justice for \n     Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 178 (JVTA). The JVTA \n     would provide much needed services and support to domestic \n     victims of trafficking and provide a tool for law \n     enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces \n     throughout the country to effectively target the demand that \n     fuels the sex trafficking market.\n       The JVTA provides unprecedented support to domestic victims \n     of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, \n     by creating grants for state and local governments to develop \n     comprehensive support programs for victims. In addition, the \n     Act will directly assist domestic victims of trafficking by \n     finally allowing them access to the same services and support \n     systems that have been previously available only to foreign \n     victims of human trafficking in the U.S. The legislation \n     prioritizes victim assistance by training federal prosecutors \n     and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering \n     restitution, and training law enforcement on facilitating \n     physical and mental health services for trafficking victims \n     they encounter.\n       Every day in this country, thousands of women and children \n     are bought and sold. The unfettered demand for sex, with \n     underage girls in particular, has caused pimps and exploiters \n     to resort to more extreme tactics in order to meet the \n     growing demand. Women and children, especially girls, are \n     advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, \n     anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every \n     state.\n       The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked \n     to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Any effort to \n     prevent sex trafficking must focus on the sex buyers and \n     facilitators. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex \n     trafficking would not exist.\n       This legislation is vital. The Justice for Victims of \n     Trafficking Act of 2015 represents an effort to provide the \n     necessary support services to our domestic victims of \n     trafficking in the U.S. and to target the culture of impunity \n     for those who seek to purchase sex, especially with children. \n     As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, child \n     welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human \n     rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical \n     piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Rights4Girls, ECPAT-USA, NAACP, National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline, National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges \n     (NCJFCJ), National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA), \n     Minnesota Indian Women Resource Center, National Women's Law \n     Center (NWLC), American Psychological Association, National \n     Children's Alliance, Equality Now, Shared Hope International, \n     Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (APA), Survivors for \n     Solutions, Breaking Free Inc., Coalition Against Trafficking \n     in Women (CATW), PROTECT, National Crittenton Foundation.\n       First Focus Campaign for Children, Girls Inc.

Chuck Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: As \n     organizations representing law enforcement leaders, officers, \n     and state and local prosecutors from across the United \n     States, we write to express our support for S. 178, the \n     Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (JVTA). The \n     JVTA would provide much needed services and support to \n     domestic victims of trafficking. More importantly, this bill \n     provides necessary tools for law enforcement, courts, and the \n     anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to \n     effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking \n     market.\n       The JVTA provides unprecedented resources to address the \n     issue of domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often \n     invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and \n     local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address \n     these crimes and provide services for victims. In addition, \n     the legislation allows wire-taps obtained through state \n     courts to be used for child sex trafficking, trains federal \n     prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and \n     ordering restitution, and trains law enforcement on \n     facilitating physical and mental health services for \n     trafficking victims they encounter.\n       According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited \n     Children (NCMEC), at least 100,000 American children each \n     year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and \n     child trafficking. Women and children, especially girls, are \n     also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, \n     anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every \n     state.\n       The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked \n     to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Without buyers of \n     commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. It is for \n     this reason and others stated above that we, as \n     representatives of law enforcement and the courts, support \n     this bill.\n       The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 \n     addresses a critical need by providing the necessary tools \n     and support services for domestic victims of trafficking in \n     the U.S. We urge Congress to pass this critical piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n       National District Attorneys Association, Association of \n     State Criminal Investigative Agencies, National Association \n     of Police Organizations, Federal Law Enforcement Officers \n     Association, National Fusion Center Association, National \n     Black Prosecutors Association.\n       National Troopers Coalition, Major Cities Chiefs \n     Association, Major County Sheriffs' Association, National \n     Sheriffs' Association, Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I also take this opportunity to thank the organizations \nRights4Girls, Shared Hope International, the Polaris Project, and the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among many other \nsupporters of the bill, for their effort in assisting in our refinement \nof this legislation so it could move forward in this manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a question, there is so much \nof this bill I strongly support. In fact, a lot of it reflects \nlegislation I have written and actually passed through the committee \nbefore. I have a couple of concerns, but one that comes to mind is that \nwe don't want to hold out false promises to victims, and I know the \nSenator doesn't want to either.\n  I certainly support having any money that the traffickers are fined \ngo to supporting this, but my experience earlier as a prosecutor and my \nexperience now in talking to prosecutors around the country is that \nmost of these people, when they get prosecuted, are basically judgment-\nproof--they don't have any money or they have a very small amount of \nmoney. They will go to prison. Who pays for that? Of course taxpayers \npay for the prison, whether it is Federal or State. They will pay for \nthe prisons, but there is no money for the victims.\n  What happens if the fine money does not materialize? We have talked \nabout up to $30 million, I think, in fines, but let's suppose we only \ncome up with a few thousand dollars in fines. Are we making a promise \nto these victims that can't be met? Is there an alternative for them in \ncase the fines don't pay for it?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I guess, based upon the experience of the supporters of \nthe legislation and the expert advice they got in coming to the \nconclusion of how to fund this fund, they feel the money is going to be \navailable to do that.\n  You ask a legitimate question. I suppose I ought to have an answer \nfor it, and I don't have from this standpoint. I think that I have \ngreat faith in the figures they have presented us and that we will have \nto deal with the issue you bring up at some future time because I think \nwe will want everybody to be made whole if what you say happens.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I know in the \nHouse of Representatives they have been concerned that the money might \nnot be there.\n  I think we all want to accomplish these things for the victims. I \njust want to make sure we are not holding out a promise that we can't \ncomplete. Do I agree with all the fines going into this fund? \nAbsolutely. But the experience of a lot of prosecutors I have talked \nwith is that the court may say: I fine you $20,000 or $30,000, but this \nis never paid. They go to prison. They have no assets. We are spending \n$25,000 to $35,000 a year as taxpayers keeping them in prison, and I \nwant them to be in prison, but there is no money for victims.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I can say to the Senator that he raises a legitimate \npoint because I know in other areas we have set up such funds and \nsometimes they come up short. But we have to remember that sometimes \nsomething is not paid out because a lot of times excess money is used \nfor something else in the Federal budget and not paid out entirely the \nway it was intended originally.\n  But I would urge my colleague to take the word of the people who have \ndone the research on this legislation to bring it together and the \nconsensus it has from 200 or more organizations and feel that it will \nbe successful. If it isn't, then I pledge to help you deal with that at \nthat particular time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the issues raised in this are serious \nmatters, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cornyn, \nand others should be concerned about this.\n  I think of a victim I have talked with, Holly Austin Smith. She was \n14 years old when she ran away from home and quickly became a victim of \nhuman trafficking. She met a man in a shopping mall who told her she \nwas pretty, and promised he would give her a glamorous life in \nCalifornia. Remember, she was 14 years old. Then he sold her for sex. \nThe first man she was sold to commented that she reminded him of his \nown granddaughter--but then he paid $200 to rape her.\n  Thankfully, Holly escaped and has rebuilt her life. She is now a \nfierce advocate of ending all forms of human trafficking because she \nknows what happens to those who are trafficked. But many are not so \nlucky. The physical and psychological scars of being bought and sold, \nof being raped multiple times a night by different men, are \ndevastating. This terrible crime destroys lives.\n  As we consider legislation to combat human trafficking, we must \nremember Holly and the thousands of other vulnerable and victimized \nchildren she represents, and we must do everything we can to keep it \nfrom happening in the first place.\n  Last Congress, in 2013, I led the effort to reauthorize the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act. That historic bipartisan \nlegislation and the funds it authorized signaled our country's \ncommitment to ending all forms of human trafficking, both here at home \nand around the world. So I am glad, after the attention we gave to my \nbill last Congress, to see the Senate return its attention to this \nissue. Stories such as Holly's make clear we have more work to do.\n  I support the bill we take up today, the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, but I believe we must do more to prevent trafficking \nin the first place. We have to act to protect our young people before \nthey become victims. It is one thing to say now that you have become a \nvictim, we are here to help you. It does even more if we can stop them \nfrom being victims in the first place.\n  The legislation that Senator Collins of Maine and I have introduced \nseeks to do just that. Homeless and runaway kids are exceptionally \nvulnerable to human traffickers. A recent survey\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nfound that one in four homeless teens was a victim of sex trafficking \nor had been forced to provide sex for survival needs.\n  These vulnerable children, alone and on the street, are walking prey. \nHuman traffickers lurk around bus stops and parks where homeless \nchildren congregate. They offer promises of something to eat and a \nnight off the streets. They exploit the very sad reality that most of \nthese children have no place to go. The weather may be cold. Far too \nmany of our cities have no shelter for kids, and those who do face a \nchronic shortage of beds. Then somebody comes up and says: I will offer \nyou food, I will offer you a warm place to sleep for the night.\n  As Representative Poe recently said at an event on ending human \ntrafficking: We have more animal shelters in this country than places \nfor young people to find a safe place to sleep. What does that say \nabout our priorities? I have nothing against having the animal \nshelters, but shouldn't we have more for our children than we do for \nthe animals?\n  If we are serious about preventing human trafficking, we must protect \nthese kids. We have to provide better outreach to them, more beds for \nthem to sleep in, and more counseling to get them on the path to a \nstable life. This kind of prevention costs money, but it saves lives \nand prevents the far more costly effects of human trafficking--not just \nthe effects of human trafficking on the victims' part, but the cost to \nall of us. This is smart money we ought to be proud to invest in our \nchildren. We must include the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act in our efforts here to prevent more of our \nkids from becoming victims. I look forward, at the appropriate place, \nto offering our bipartisan legislation as an amendment.\n  I know other Senators have amendments they wish to see considered. \nSenator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has \nan important piece of legislation to combat sex and labor trafficking \nin countries around the world. I thank him for working with me to make \nsome improvements to its funding provisions and I hope this bipartisan \nlegislation will be considered as an amendment by the full Senate.\n  I mentioned earlier Senator Klobuchar has been working for years to \nsee the safe harbor bill get passed, to make sure victims are treated \nas victims and not as criminals. I am proud to cosponsor her bill. \nAfter all, as I said about the Violence Against Women Act, a victim is \na victim is a victim. They are not criminals. They are victims.\n  Senator McConnell has long promised a full amendment process. I take \nhim at his word and I expect we will have the opportunity to strengthen \nthe underlying bill with a variety of ideas from Senators. We owe it to \nsurvivors such as Holly to pass the strongest possible bill.\n  We have to provide the resources desperately needed by those on the \nfront lines protecting young people every day, such as those in my home \nState of Vermont at Spectrum Services and the Vermont Coalition of \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Programs service providers. We owe it to all \nthe survivors who bravely come forward and tell their stories, hoping \nto prevent just one more child from falling prey to this terrible \ncrime.\n  The Senate has to pass a strong, comprehensive bill that includes \nprevention and prosecution, but also services for victims. We haven't \naccomplished as much as we should if we are only able to prosecute the \nperpetrator after the fact and forget about helping the victim. We have \nto stop trafficking from happening in the first place; but if it does \nhappen, we have to help the victims.\n  An editorial in the New York Times last week noted that:\n\n     . . . a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront \n     this human-rights problem and help its victims, often \n     runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or \n     coerced into prostitution.\n\n  I agree with that editorial, and I look forward to working with every \nSenator here to ensure we get this done for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, March 5, 2015]\n\n                 Steps Against Juvenile Sex Trafficking\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       The impression that America's sex-trafficking problem \n     mostly involves young people smuggled from overseas has given \n     way to broad recognition of a cruel homegrown reality: the \n     tens of thousands of juveniles who are exploited each year by \n     traffickers in this country.\n       On Capitol Hill, a consensus is emerging on new initiatives \n     to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, \n     often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or \n     coerced into prostitution.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously \n     approved a pair of anti-trafficking bills with wide backing \n     from victim advocates and other experts, and the full Senate \n     is expected to take up the package soon.\n       A bill championed by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of \n     Texas, would create a new pool of financing--through \n     additional fines on people convicted of sex and labor \n     trafficking, child pornography and other crimes--for \n     restitution, victim services and law enforcement. The idea of \n     aiding victims without committing more tax dollars has drawn \n     support from Republicans, and any new money for this badly \n     underfinanced cause would help.\n       The Cornyn bill would also encourage prosecution of the \n     ``johns,'' or buyers of juvenile sex, who typically escape \n     criminal charges even though they are paying for what amounts \n     to the statutory rape of children and teenagers. Their demand \n     is what's fueling the highly lucrative human slavery \n     business.\n       The second bill, put forward by Senator Amy Klobuchar, \n     Democrat of Minnesota, would give a preference for Department \n     of Justice law enforcement grants to states that adopt ``safe \n     harbor'' laws.\n       These laws help ensure that young people sold for sex are \n     treated as victims and offered support services instead of \n     being prosecuted. The House has approved similar bills, so it \n     should not be hard to hammer out a strong final package.\n       A preventive measure that would help ensure housing and \n     services for homeless juveniles, who are often prey to \n     traffickers, unfortunately stalled in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. One obstacle was the resistance of some \n     Republicans to its nondiscrimination provision guaranteeing \n     fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \n     youths.\n       No young person should ``have to choose between selling \n     their bodies and a safe place to sleep,'' said Senator Susan \n     Collins, Republican of Maine, who introduced the bill with \n     Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Undeterred, they plan to \n     seek consideration from the full Senate.\n       Trafficking abroad remains a tremendous problem, so it is \n     fitting that a promising approach comes from the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, which last week unanimously \n     approved a measure to create an international public-private \n     fund dedicated to the issue, similar to the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. More resources could do \n     a lot to help trafficking's victims at home, too.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We talk about the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking \nand Prevention Act.

Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nTexas on the floor seeking recognition. I wonder if we could suggest \nthe absence of a quorum for just 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia will \nbe giving her first speech in the Senate here shortly and I look \nforward to listening to that, but I wanted to say a few words about the \nlegislation we will be debating and hopefully passing this week, and \nthat is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  This is without a doubt one of the most shocking and troubling issues \nfacing our country today. It is no exaggeration to say modern-day human \nslavery, at a time when we believed as a country that slavery was a \npart of\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nour past and something we only read about in our history books.\n  Many people are under the impression that human trafficking is a \nproblem somewhere else or at some other time in history, but the fact \nis human trafficking is a problem right now in all 50 States, right \nhere in the United States of America, the most affluent country in the \nworld. It is not just a problem in Texas, it is not just a problem in \nArizona, it is not just a problem in West Virginia, it is a problem in \nall 50 States.\n  Thousands of young girls, many of them middle school age, are trapped \ninto a life of bondage where they are abused and sold for sex every \nday. It is not easy to say, but it is true, and we must say it and we \nmust acknowledge it.\n  This is of course unconscionable. As the father of two daughters \nmyself, it is simply heartbreaking to hear the stories of young women \nwho have been trapped in this system. Of course, we can imagine it is \nevery parent's worst nightmare.\n  One woman I have had the privilege of meeting and who shared her very \npersonal story about this is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort \nWorth area in Texas. When she was 12 years old--12 years old--she was \nsold into the sex trade by a family member, somebody whom she had every \nright to assume cared for her, loved her, wanted her to grow up being a \nloved and productive person. But she was sold into the sex trade by a \nfamily member. Eventually she was pulled out of school and trafficked \nfull time when she was in sixth grade. Her life became a prison.\n  She was chained to a bed in a warehouse. She endured regular beatings \nand, of course, she was sexually assaulted with regularity. She was \neven set on fire by one of her captors. All the while, she was forced \nto serve between 5 and 30 men every day.\n  Melissa has said that she wished she were dead. Her story of her time \nin captivity is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking, but just as sad is the \nway she was treated once she escaped from her captors. As is the case \nwith so many victims, Melissa struggled for years to distance herself \nfrom her past. But instead of being treated as the victim she was, the \ncriminal justice system actually treated her as the criminal. That is \nan all too common outcome for victims of trafficking, who are labeled \nas prostitutes and are left with few options but to return to the \nnightmare that so sadly exists in our country.\n  That needs to change. That is why I am glad the Senate is taking up \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, because this begins the \nprocess of making that important change. The bill helps law enforcement \ncrack down on criminal trafficking rings and perpetrators of these \ncrimes.\n  Instead of a slap on the wrist and a fine, the so-called johns--the \ndemand side for this terrible trade--will be treated as the child \nrapists and the criminals they are. No longer are we just going to deal \nwith the supply side. We are going to pay attention to the demand side \ntoo.\n  Critically, this bill takes fines from the perpetrators of these \nawful crimes and redirects them into a crime victims fund which will \nhelp people such as Melissa and others get a fresh lease on life, to \nbegin to heal and to get the help they so badly need in order to get on \nwith their lives.\n  This week we have a wonderful opportunity in the Senate, in a town \nthat is too often divided by ideology and partisanship, to do something \ntogether on a bipartisan basis that can help people such as Melissa and \nthe thousands of young girls like her waiting to be saved. All of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, are committed to working together to \ndo everything we can to help these victims and to put an end to this \nabhorrent practice.\n  This particular legislation we are taking up today passed unanimously \nout of the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago. That doesn't happen \nvery often, but it did for this legislation. More than 200 groups \naround the country--such as the NAACP, the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, \nand the National Conference of State Legislatures--have all endorsed \nour work on this issue.\n  I want to particularly thank some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who joined me on this effort: the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and the senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden. They have been great partners in this fight--not just this year \nbut for many years. And there are many others. Another great partner \nhas been the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, who has worked for \nyears to get antitrafficking legislation to the floor. He introduced a \nbill called the HERO Act which authorizes a program to recruit wounded, \ninjured, and returning veterans and provides them with training in \nhigh-tech computer forensics and law enforcement skills to help fight \nchild exploitation.\n  I also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the junior \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, who has a bill called the Bringing \nMissing Children Home Act, which improves the way cases of missing \nchildren are handled, strengthening law enforcement reporting and \nresponse procedures.\n  Both the HERO Act and the Bringing Missing Children Home Act have \nbeen incorporated into the underlying bill, and I want to thank both of \nthem for their efforts and willingness to work with us to make the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act even stronger.\n  I know there are Members who are interested in offering amendments to \nthis legislation. Thanks to the majority leader, we are going to have \nan open process where anybody with a better idea who wants to add to \nthis base of work that is contained in this bill will have the \nopportunity to do so, both offering amendments and seeking votes on \nthose.\n  This is a fight that sadly must be fought, but it is a fight we will \nwin. When we do, we will finally have done our part to help deliver our \nNation's promise of freedom to those who are enslaved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                making washington work for west virginia\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to deliver my maiden speech \nas a Senator from West Virginia. I am deeply humbled by the confidence \nplaced in me by fellow West Virginians. To serve as West Virginia's \nfirst female Senator is a true honor and one that comes with great \nresponsibility. I hope to serve as an example for that next generation \nof West Virginians, including my own grandchildren Celia and Charlie, \nand hopefully for many others. I find myself in a unique place in \nhistory, and I am grateful to and inspired by my own loving family, my \nhusband Charlie and our three children, Charles, Moore, and Shelley, \nand their spouses.\n  For 14 years I have proudly served the people of West Virginia's \nSecond Congressional District in the House of Representatives. I bring \nthat experience to the Senate combined with a strong desire to make \nWashington work for West Virginia.\n  West Virginia has a time-honored history of exceptional Senators, \nincluding my predecessors, Senators Jay Rockefeller and Robert C. Byrd. \nI am appreciative of their efforts to better West Virginia during their \nmore than 80 years of combined public service in this great body.\n  I am proud of our State's rich history, culture, and natural beauty. \nBut it is our people that I hold dearest in my heart. West Virginians \nare strong and resilient. We are the embodiment of our State's history. \nBorn of the Civil War, West Virginians fought for freedom in the face \nof great turmoil. As a result, President Abraham Lincoln signed the \nproclamation making West Virginia the 35th State admitted to the Union.\n  Today, our State's forceful motto, ``Mountaineers are always free,'' \nremains emblazoned in Latin on our State flag. We will never forget the \nprinciples on which our great State was founded. The Mountain State is \nhome to unmatched scenery and natural resources that can power our \nNation's economy. A State filled with small towns, Main Streets and \ntight knit communities, West Virginians come together to solve problems \nand help neighbors in need. I have often said that West Virginia is one \nbig small town.\n  West Virginians expect the Senate to find pragmatic solutions to the \nmomentous problems confronting our\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\ncountry. That is particularly true now during this period of divided \ngovernment. There are clear differences among the American people, and \nthese differences are certainly reflected in the Senate.\n  West Virginia is represented by both parties in the Senate, and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with my friend Senator Joe Manchin \nin the months ahead, and I thank him for being here with me as a source \nof support today. Together, I hope we can reinstate respect for the \ninstitution, a place where deliberation and debate are valued and all \nvoices are heard. We owe it to the American people to do better.\n  Throughout my time in Congress I have heard a clear and consistent \nmessage from West Virginians: Improve the economic opportunities for \nour State, stop the bickering, and fight for our jobs. As Leader \nMcConnell has stated, to do this the Senate must work more, have an \nopen amendment process--which we are going to be having here in the \nnext several days--and take the tough votes. After all, that is why we \nare here.\n  Today I will outline how I plan to produce bipartisan, commonsense \nsolutions in the Senate to make West Virginia communities stronger. \nThis plan will create economic opportunities by bridging the gap and \ntackling America's infrastructure crisis, better connecting West \nVirginia and rural communities through increased broadband access, \ncaring for our Nation's veterans, and ensuring a bright future for \nyoung West Virginians, and implementing a commonsense energy policy \nthat utilizes our vast natural resources to provide affordable and \nreliable energy.\n  First, addressing our country's crumbling infrastructure is an area \nthat can bridge the partisan divide and further economic growth. \nAmerican communities need a strong Federal highway program and a full \n6-year bill to meet the needs of our growing population, to ensure \nsafety for travelers, and to offer opportunity for growth in areas that \nstruggle economically.\n  West Virginians, like many across the Nation, rely heavily on roads, \nbridges, and highway transit to fuel our economy, to access hard to \nreach areas in our State, to get to and from work, and to transport \nnecessary goods and services.\n  U.S. Route 35 will drastically improve safety for residents in Putnam \nand Mason Counties. Corridor H will unleash the economic potential of \nour State's eastern highlands. U.S. Route 340 will help address \ncongestion in our eastern panhandle, and the Coalfields Expressway and \nthe King Coal Highway can help isolated communities attract businesses \nand provide jobs. Point Pleasant's Charles Lanham, a well-respected \ngentleman, had a vision. With his friend Jack Fruth, they began a \ncrusade for their community.\n  For many years Charles has worked to build the case for a 4-lane U.S. \nRoute 35, a project that will provide a secure route to school for our \nchildren and serve as a regional transportation artery between \nInterstate 64 and the Great Lakes region. Charles understands the \neconomic and safety benefits the road provides and has fought for them.\n  Working with Charles we have made significant progress on Route 35, \nbut all of our States need certainty to invest in our transportation \ninfrastructure. That certainty comes with a long-term surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill, which brings these projects to \nreality across the country. Working together we can and we must achieve \nthis goal. Now is the time to move our transportation system forward.\n  Second, I am committed to expanding access to broadband in \ncommunities across West Virginia, and I will be a champion for \nconnecting our State. High-speed Internet access is a pillar of our \n21st century infrastructure and a gateway to growth in rural America. \nHigh-tech businesses can power our small communities. The world \nliterally can be at your desktop. Unfortunately, for all the potential \nopportunities that broadband can offer to rural America, not having \nthis important service can place an almost insurmountable barrier to \neconomic development, and there are many areas in my State and the \nleader's State that still do not have adequate access. These areas are \nat risk of being left behind. In Capon Bridge, WV, a lack of broadband \naccess is an obstacle to attracting jobs and economic development. \nSadly, Capon Bridge is not unique in this regard.\n  Small communities across West Virginia and elsewhere in rural America \nlack fundamental infrastructure and lack access to vital opportunities \nas a result.\n  The answer for Capon Bridge is not a regulated Internet. Too much \ngovernment control would be counterproductive, choking off private \nsector expansion projects and hindering new technologies. But we have \nto recognize that there is a role for government in helping broadband \nreach those hard-to-serve communities. We should leverage resources at \nall levels of government and encourage public-private partnerships to \nexpand access to rural Americans. This is a necessary and achievable \ngoal. It may sound like a small desire, but connectivity is essential \nto compete and thrive.\n  Health care access is critically important to West Virginians. We \nmust continue to provide access to our veterans and to our children. \nWest Virginians have a strong history of service to our Nation. These \nbrave men and women have put themselves in harm's way to defend our \nfreedoms. It is our solemn responsibility to care for them when they \nreturn home.\n  These American heroes deserve the best possible treatment and top-\nnotch mental health services.\n  Access to care can be especially challenging for our veterans who \nlive in rural communities. Many West Virginia veterans must travel \nsignificant distances to get to a VA hospital. In many cases, allowing \nveterans to receive treatment closer to home is more convenient for the \npatient and more efficient for the VA. While we have made strides to \nimprove access for our veterans, the current program is not working as \nwell as it should. More must be done.\n  Expanded access to private medical providers will help improve the \nquality of care we offer to our veterans. Our children in the Mountain \nState also deserve quality health care. If our children, the next \ngeneration of leaders, are going to realize their potential, they must \nhave a healthy foundation. A solid education and good health are \npillars for success of future generations. As a parent and grandparent, \nthis is personal. We must work together to continue funding the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  I started my legislative career in the West Virginia House of \nDelegates where I served on the committee that first implemented the \nSCHIP program in our State. Today this program provides access to \nhealth care for tens of thousands of West Virginia's children. \nMaintaining this program is a priority I share with my predecessor, \nSenator Rockefeller, who was a tireless advocate for children's health \ninsurance during his three decades of service in this body. I am \nencouraged that Senators in both parties have recognized the importance \nof providing continued funding for the bipartisan SCHIP program.\n\n  Finally, and of critical importance to the State of West Virginia and \nthe country, we need to work together to implement a commonsense energy \npolicy. We need an affordable and reliable energy policy that utilizes \nour State's vast natural resources. We need a policy that grows the \neconomy and creates new job opportunities. We need a policy that \nsupports a strong middle class. We need a policy that ensures we \ncontinue to improve safety and our environment even as we expand energy \nproduction.\n  The administration's overreach has contributed to thousands of coal \nminers losing their jobs in West Virginia and our neighboring States, \ndevastating--I can't overstate this enough--local communities and \nfamilies.\n  Last year I met a recently laid off coal miner from Raleigh County. \nAfter losing his job, his church came together to prepare meals for \nother coal miners and their families while they searched for work. \nNeighbors helping neighbors--the West Virginia way. This is a stark \nreminder of the impact misguided Federal policies can have on the lives \nof real people.\n  Anti-coal policies impact more than miners and their families. In \nWest Virginia the attack on coal mines reduces\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\nrevenues for education programs, roads, and other public services. \nHigher utility prices caused by overregulation means fewer jobs in \nenergy-intensive manufacturing. And sadly, lower income families and \nsenior citizens who live on fixed incomes are disproportionately \nimpacted by higher energy costs. As chairman of the Subcommittee on \nClean Air and Nuclear Safety, I will lead the fight against excessive \ngovernment regulation that has been devastating my State.\n  There are many areas of energy policy where we can find common \nground. While the EPA's proposed greenhouse gas standards are \nmisguided, we should continue to make the use of fossil fuel cleaner \nand more efficient. We must continue to support important research at \nMorgantown's National Energy Technology Lab and other labs that allows \nus to make environmental progress even as we continue to use our \nnatural resources.\n  Natural gas is a large and growing part of West Virginia's economy. \nAs a child of Marshall County, which is the heart of the Marcellus \nShale development in West Virginia, I am delighted to see these \ncommunities come alive with opportunity. It is proof positive that an \nenergy economy is a jobs economy. We need improved infrastructure in \norder to make full use of these gas reserves. We need new natural gas \nand oil pipelines that safely connect producing regions with \nmanufacturers. We need new markets that can make use of these vital \nresources. We need a pro-exports policy that will benefit our country \nin multiple ways. The Nation will see more jobs and investment, more \nsecurity, and a more independent future, and at the same time we can \nstrengthen our relationships with important allies overseas by \nproviding them with the energy they need.\n  These are just a few of the ideas I hope to refine and accomplish \nduring my first term in the Senate. Notably, there are many other very \nimportant issues--such as national security, fiscal responsibility, a \nbalanced budget, and replacement of the Affordable Care Act--on which I \nwill be focusing. Our plate is full, and expectations are high, as they \nshould be. We need to roll up our sleeves and deliver. I am optimistic \nthat we can find solutions that move our country forward. There will be \ndifferences of opinion and philosophy along the way, but Americans \nexpect us to bridge those gaps.\n  Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator, said it best:\n\n       I love this Senate. I love it dearly. I love the Senate for \n     its rules. I love the Senate for its precedence. I love the \n     Senate for the difference that it can make in people's lives.\n\n  Fighting for West Virginians always has been and always will be my \ntop priority. I am honored--I can't overstate that--to represent the \ngreat people of the Mountain State as we strive to create a strong and \nprosperous future. Now is the time for Washington to work for West \nVirginia, and I stand ready to do my part.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n             Congratulating The Senator From West Virginia\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say to our new Senator from \nWest Virginia what an outstanding speech not only for her State but the \nway forward for our country, and I congratulate her for an outstanding \nset of comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate my colleague \nfrom West Virginia. We spoke earlier about how she and I can show the \nway to have a better relationship-building effort here in the Senate by \nworking together in order to better serve the people of West Virginia \nand also the country. I congratulate my colleague on her great speech \nand look forward to working with her. I think she has done a great job \nfor the people of West Virginia, and I again thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                  Tackling National Security Questions\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to address a question to myself and \nevery Member of this body, and the question is a serious one: Is the \nSenate capable of tackling challenging national security questions in a \nmature and responsible way?\n  We have many hard national security challenges before us now. Three \nof those challenges are urgent: the discussions about a potential \nnuclear deal with Iran, the discussions in this body about military \naction by the United States against ISIL, and the deliberations that \nwill take place this month about the American budget, which will \ndetermine whether we have the resources we need to meet our security \nchallenges. We have to show the American public--and I would argue the \nworld--that we can give these issues the careful consideration they \ndeserve, but I am forced to admit that recent events have caused me to \nhave some significant doubts about our institutional capacity to tackle \nthese issues in a responsible way.\n  We recently--at the end of February--ran up to the very brink of \nshutting down the Department of Homeland Security at a time when \nterrorist threats and other threats to our homeland security are so \nobvious on our borders and throughout the world. Thank goodness, after \na week's extension of funding for Homeland Security, we pulled back \nfrom the brink. But that did not lead to an increase in confidence in \nthis body, that Congress would contemplate not funding the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  Last week there was a joint address to Congress by Prime Minister \nNetanyahu. I spent many hours conversing with Prime Minister Netanyahu \nin his office about Iran and other topics, but I am sad to look at that \njoint address and basically say it was history-making in some \nunfortunate ways.\n  Congress has heard from the Prime Minister or President of Israel \nseven times in the last 50 years--eight times if you count last week. \nLast week's address was unusual because it was designed in a partisan \nway. It was an invitation by the leadership of one party with an \nintentional decision not to let the White House know, not to let the \nminority party in Congress know, and to schedule the speech days before \na contested foreign election, leading many to conclude that it was an \neffort by Congress to affect a foreign election, which we should never \ndo.\n  Following that speech, a carefully worked bipartisan bill that has \nbeen introduced in Congress to give Congress an appropriate review role \nover any potential Iranian nuclear deal was basically hijacked. Instead \nof allowing the bill to go through Congress, there was a decision to \nforce the bill to the floor for an immediate vote, which was seen by \nall as a partisan move. It was described by one of the Republican \nsponsors of the bill as an effort to embarrass Democrats. Thank \ngoodness that at the end of the day that effort to accelerate \nconsideration of what was a bipartisan bill was pulled back, and we \nwill not be doing that this week. We will be allowing a normal \ncommittee process. But the fact that the effort was made did damage to \nreasonable bipartisan consideration of this important issue.\n  Then yesterday we all awoke to the news that there had been a \npartisan letter signed by 47 Senators--47 of my colleagues, many of \nwhom I work with very closely--not to the President saying ``We have \nconcerns about a deal, and we are going to weigh in'' but instead to \nthe leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state. This \nletter presumed to instruct the nation about what Congress might or \nmight not do. The letter was widely viewed as an effort to undercut or \ndilute diplomatic negotiations that are in the best tradition of our \ncountry, the notion of diplomacy.\n  I just came from hearings this morning in the Armed Services \nCommittee where we heard what we have heard for 2\\1/2\\ years: advice \nfrom our military leadership to the Senate that sequester is hurting \nour national defense. Will you finally listen to us? Will you do \nsomething about it?\n  All of these events over the last few weeks when taken together \nsuggest the sad possibility of a Senate that will elevate partisan \npolitical division over careful and constructive deliberation, even on \nthe most critical security issues that affect the security of our \ncountry and the world. I deeply believe that this body--the Senate and \nCongress generally--has to pull back from the brink of irresponsible \nand partisan action with respect to these critical security questions \nbecause the stakes are simply too high.\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\n  With respect to the Iranian nuclear negotiation, I share many of the \nconcerns of my 47 colleagues who wrote the letter. I share many of the \nconcerns of the Prime Minister that were shared in his speech last \nweek. But I deeply believe we should not try to tank a deal, critique a \ndeal, or undercut a deal before there is a deal because to the extent \nthere are efforts to stand and say this is a bad deal before there is a \ndeal, the message that is communicated to the American public and to \nthe world is: We will never accept any deal. We are not interested in \ndiplomacy. We are not interested in negotiation.\n  That attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of Iran, \nwhich is currently engaging in terrorist activity. They want to be able \nto blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent United States that \nis unwilling to negotiate in good faith.\n  We should not tank a deal before there is a deal. Instead, why don't \nwe do what we are supposed to do as the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world? Why don't we allow negotiators who have been working in the \nbest traditions of American diplomacy to see if they can find a deal \nand then put it on the table for the review of Congress, as has always \nbeen contemplated?\n  I am a proud original cosponsor and worked on the draftsmanship of a \nbipartisan bill that was introduced under the key sponsorship of \nForeign Relations chair Senator Corker and ranking member Senator \nMenendez to guarantee to Congress an appropriate review of any final \ndeal with Iran over their nuclear program if such a deal was reached. \nThis is a bill which is rigorously bipartisan--not partisan, not \npolitical, not rushed, not accelerated, but rigorously bipartisan. It \nrespects the ongoing process by allowing the negotiators to do their \nwork and see if they can find an outcome. It guarantees Congress a \ndebate and vote if a deal includes relief under the congressional \nsanctions Congress has enacted over the years. It is appropriately \ndeferential to the Executive, allowing the Executive the flexibility to \ndo sanctions relief under Executive or international sanctions that \nhave not been part of any congressional statute.\n  This is a bipartisan bill which provides some assurance to allies. \nOur allies in the region--allies that are most affected by the Iranian \nnuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, whether you are talking \nabout Israel or Gulf State nations or Jordan. The nations most affected \nby Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, and the Corker-\nMenendez bill would give them some comfort that a deal, if announced, \nwould receive some careful scrutiny in this body.\n  Finally, I believe the Corker-Menendez bipartisan approach even \nprovides some important assurances to Iran in the negotiation. We want \nIran to make not small concessions, we want them to make big and bold \nconcessions and give up any intent to develop nuclear weapons. But what \nis the likelihood that Iran will make those concessions if they have no \nknowledge about what Congress's intent is vis-a-vis the congressional \nstatutory provisions?\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to approach these matters. To \nrush it, to label a deal as a bad deal before there is a deal, to make \nit entirely partisan rather than bipartisan, reflecting the will of the \nbody, is an effort to undercut negotiations that weakens our President, \nweakens our country, and weakens our credibility; whereas if we proceed \nin a bipartisan way, we can make the deal stronger.\n  Similarly--and then I wish to cede the moment to my colleague, the \nSenator from Maine--we are about to start work on another critically \nimportant issue--whether Congress should finally, after 7-plus months, \nhave a debate to authorize an ongoing war against the Islamic State in \nthe Levant that was begun on August 8 by the President. We are now in \nthe eighth month of a unilateral war, and aside from a Foreign \nRelations Committee vote in committee in December, Congress has not had \na meaningful vote or debate on this fundamental responsibility. We owe \nit to ourselves and to this institution, we owe it to the important \nnational security interests at stake, and especially we owe it to the \npeople who are risking their lives in this war--and we have already had \ndeaths of American servicemembers as part of Operation Inherent \nResolve--we owe it to them to show we can have a meaningful debate that \nis not partisan, that is not rushed, but that is careful and \ndeliberate. They have been waiting for 7-plus months to see whether \nCongress even cares.\n  We are at war by a Presidential act. Does Congress even care enough \nto have the debate on the floor of the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives? Is it just partisanship now? Is it just delay now? \nDoes the fact our service men and women are risking their lives even \nmatter to us now?\n  This is the debate we will be entering into within the next few days, \nstarting with the hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \ntomorrow. We can't afford, on important issues of national security \nsuch as Iran or such as the war against ISIL, to send the impression to \nour troops, to our citizens, to our global citizens around the world, \nthat on these important matters Congress is now just a partisan sort of \nsideshow rather than the deliberative body we were set up to be. We \nhave to find a bipartisan path forward on these important security \nissues or we weaken confidence in this institution and in the \nleadership of this country.\n  In conclusion, the national security interests that are at stake \nright now before us are fundamental, whether it is about Iran, whether \nit is about the battle against ISIL, or whether it is about the \nbudgetary deliberations we will be undertaking this month--a budgetary \ndeliberation that will determine whether we can meet our commitments in \nthese national security challenges. We have to get these debates right \nfor the good of our country and the world, and we have to get them \nright to demonstrate to all that this institution does have the \nmaturity to tackle these issues in a reasonable way.\n  With that, I yield the last minute or so of my time to my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator King.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, there is little I can add to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Virginia on this issue.\n  I think this institution is being tested this week, this month, and \nover the next several months in a way that is really somewhat new. The \ntest, the question, is: Can we deal with the most serious of issues \nfacing this country and the world in a responsible, reasonable, and, \nyes, bipartisan, nonpartisan way?\n  I also worked with Bob Corker, Senator Kaine, and the whole group \nthat worked on putting together--Senator Menendez--a bipartisan bill to \nprovide Congress a role in the approval of whatever deal is struck with \nIran. I believe Congress should have that role. But in those \ndiscussions, my concern was that some of our Members will not be able \nto resist the temptation to politicize and make a partisan issue--even \nthis grave issue of war and peace, this grave issue that faces this \ncountry and the entire world--of the possibility of a regime such as \nthat in Iran achieving nuclear weapons.\n  This is not an ideological debate. This is a serious debate about the \nfuture of this country. This is one of the most serious negotiations of \nour adult lives. I want Congress to have a role, but I want it to play \nthat role weighing the merits, pro or con, the actual materials that \nare in the treaty--in the agreement. I want us to have that role, but I \nwant to be sure we can respond to that in a responsible way. Frankly, \nthe actions of the last few days have shaken that confidence, because \nwe have seen what appears to be an effort to gain political and \npartisan advantage from this gravest of national issues.\n  I understand there are differences about what the deal should look \nlike and what the terms should be. That is OK. That is what we should \nbe discussing. But to turn this into a partisan issue I think does a \ngrave disservice to this entire country, and to undercut the President \nin the last stages of the negotiation to me is unprecedented and \nunthinkable.\n  I was a young man at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. I cannot \nimagine the Congress of the United States writing a letter to Kruschev \nin the midst of those discussions and saying, Don't worry about this \nguy Kennedy, he doesn't speak for the country. Yet that essentially is \nwhat took place yesterday. I don't understand the need or the\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nhelpfulness of such a statement at a time when we were already moving \ntoward a bipartisan--I believe probably veto-proof--bill to provide \nthis institution with a check on the quality of the deal that is being \nstruck.\n  It is not productive or helpful to turn issues of this kind into \npartisan issues. I hope we can step back from this partisan posture and \nmeet this solemn responsibility to assess what the President and the \nadministration and the other five countries--the agreement they come to \nwith Iran--to determine whether, indeed, it is in the best interests of \nthe region and the world. That is our responsibility. I hope we can \nmuster the ability to meet that responsibility in a serious way and \nnot, for once, turn it into a partisan issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Federal Employees\n\n     Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Nancy Sullivan, And Dr. William Gahl\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today to \nspeak about Federal workers in general and some of the people at the \nNational Institutes of Health in particular.\n  Government workers guard our borders, protect us from terrorists, \ntreat our wounded veterans, dispense Social Security checks to our \nretirees, find cures for diseases, guide the Nation's air traffic, \nexplore the tiniest particles and the vast expanse of outer space, \nensure our air is safe to breathe, our water is safe to drink, our food \nis safe to eat, support our service men and women in harm's way, and \npromote our interests and ideals abroad. For whom does the government \nwork? Government works for America.\n  The Washington Post recently reported that since reliable data first \nbecame available shortly before World War II, the percentage of all \nemployed people working for the Federal Government hit an all-time low \nin December. Fewer than 2 percent of the total U.S. workforce is \nemployed by the Federal Government. Over nearly the past half century, \nfrom 1966 to 2012--the most recent year for which comparable data is \navailable--the number of Federal workers in the executive branch \ndropped by 83,000. During that time, the U.S. population increased from \nunder 200 million to over 300 million people and the gross domestic \nproduct nearly quadrupled.\n  We can argue over whether we want bigger government or smaller \ngovernment, but we should all agree we want better government. We can't \nhave better government when Federal workers are constantly under \nassault. We need to stop treating the Federal workforce like a rented \nmule. We need to treat the Federal workforce like the critical asset it \nis.\n  A 2011 report by the National Academy of Public Administration and \nthe Kettering Foundation concluded that programs operated by civil \nservants receive ``significantly higher'' scores for management and \neffectiveness than those run by ``grant- and contract-based third \nparties.''\n  I think part of the problem is that Americans have come to accept \nthat Federal workers are nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They aren't. \nThey are people who are patriotic Americans and dedicated to public \nservice. They have families and support their communities. They have \nbeen asked to do more and more with less and less while being subjected \nto pay freezes, sequestration-related furloughs, government shutdowns, \nand threats to their benefits. They have contributed $150 billion to \ndeficit reduction while still working hard on behalf of all Americans.\n  Today, as I mentioned, I wish to focus on the Federal workers at the \nNational Institutes of Health. I wish to introduce my colleagues and \nall Americans to a few of the Federal workers who are making life \nbetter for all of us. But first a description of the NIH so people can \nunderstand its mission.\n  I can sum up its mission in two words: saving lives. The NIH is the \nworld's premier biomedical and health-related research facility. Its \njob is to perform and fund the research that helps improve the Nation's \nhealth--a job it has carried out for over a century.\n  I am proud the NIH is headquartered in Maryland, but it is important \nto understand that NIH support of medical research at other research \ninstitutions has created jobs and fostered economic growth in each and \nevery State, while establishing and maintaining the United States as \nthe global leader in the life sciences. NIH-supported research added \n$69 billion to our GDP and supported 7 million jobs in 2011 alone.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, Congress and the administration will \nhave to decide whether they have to replace sequestration with a more \nlogical, coherent, strategic, and responsible form of budgeting.\n  While we will have disagreements over the details, if anyone needs to \nbe convinced about the value of replacing sequestration, look no \nfurther than the situation at NIH. Funding constraints there not only \ncost people their jobs, they are costing people their lives.\n  NIH funding has multiple drivers, but comparing the fiscal year 2013 \nfigures with the fiscal year 2012 figures, largely because of \nsequestration, approximately 640 fewer competitive research project \ngrants were issued and approximately 750 fewer new patients were \nadmitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Each these affects a person's \nlife. Each of these has consequences when we do not move forward as we \nshould.\n  A recent survey determined that nearly 20 percent of the biomedical \nscientists have considered leaving the United States due to \nsequestration. We are losing our best. Nearly one-half of the \nscientists surveyed said they have laid off staff in their laboratories \nor are considering laying off staff due to losing NIH grants. More than \n50 percent of the researchers say they have colleagues who have lost \nhis or her job.\n  What is the impact? Delays in lifesaving medical progress. Medical \nbreakthroughs do not happen overnight. In almost all instances, \nbreakthrough discoveries result from years of incremental research to \nunderstand how diseases start and progress. Cuts to research are \ndelaying progress in medical breakthroughs, including developing better \ncancer drugs that zero in on a tumor with fewer side effects; research \non a universal flu vaccine that could fight every strain of influenza \nwithout needing a yearly shot; preventing debilitating chronic \nconditions that are costly to society and delay development of more \neffective treatments for common and rare diseases affecting millions of \nAmericans.\n  NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins recently wrote the column \n``Exceptional Opportunities in Medical Science'' in which he describes \nthe excitement over ``personalized medicine,'' the BRAIN initiative, \nand development of the Ebola vaccine. He has also shared his concern \nabout the budget challenges NIH faces.\n  Let me quote from Dr. Collins:\n\n       Although all of these ambitious scientific endeavors offer \n     exceptional promise for advancing human health, the effect \n     that unprecedented budget pressures are having on biomedical \n     research cannot be ignored. Due to inflation, the NIH budget \n     has lost almost 25 percent of its purchasing power over the \n     last decade. The decline has had important consequences. The \n     NIH once funded one in three research proposals, but now only \n     has enough resources to support one in six. As a result, a \n     great deal of excellent science is being left unfunded.\n\n  Last October Dr. Collins stated that cuts in Federal funding slowed \nthe development of vaccines and therapies for the deadly Ebola virus, \nsaying: ``Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in \nresearch support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this \nthat would have gone through clinical trials and would have been \nready.''\n  Think about the lives that could have been saved.\n  To Americans who wonder what their tax dollars do--well, some go to \nNIH to find treatments and cures for cancer, depression, arthritis, \nsubstance abuse, addiction, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. To date, \n145 NIH-supported researchers have received or shared 85 Nobel Prizes.\n  Not everyone wins a Nobel Prize, so let me talk about people who \naren't in the spotlight--people some of our colleagues might refer to \nas ``nameless, faceless bureaucrats.'' I will highlight the work of two \nof them today who are making a tremendous contribution as public \nservants.\n  Dr. Nancy Sullivan, Chief of the Vaccine Research Center, has been \nworking on an Ebola vaccine for nearly two decades, dating back to when \nshe was an investigator at the University of Michigan with the then-NIH \ngrantee\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nand now former Director, Dr. Gary Nabel. Most vaccines spur production \nof a person's immune system's antibodies that block a virus from \nentering the cells, but that approach doesn't work for Ebola.\n  Gene-based vaccines can induce additional virus fighters called T-\ncells, so that is what Dr. Sullivan created, using pieces of Ebola \ngenetic material. It is the most promising approach yet, and it is \nbeing tested in the parts of West Africa that have been hit the hardest \nwith Ebola, where more than 9,000 people have died.\n  The concept for Dr. Sullivan's vaccine has been 16 years in the \nmaking, beginning back when few people outside the global infectious \ndisease community had even heard of the deadly disease. Over the years, \nDr. Sullivan and her team continued to tweak her ideas, constantly \nimproving on them. Eventually she followed Dr. Nabel to NIH.\n  Many experts in the vaccine research community had begun to believe \nEbola was insurmountable. They thought it was too aggressive for a \nvaccine to ever protect against it. But Dr. Sullivan never lost heart \nthat her work would one day prove successful.\n  The Ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there \nare no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments. Consequently, \nwork with these viruses requires highly specialized BSL-4 containment \nlabs--the highest biosafety labs. Dr. Sullivan is a leader in the field \nand has personally conducted many of the most critical experiments. Her \nwork on immunology and vaccine development is widely considered as some \nof the very best in the field. In spite of the difficulties associated \nwith access to BSL-4 labs, her work has consistently been the source of \nnovel observations.\n  Dr. Sullivan received her Ph.D. in cell biology from Harvard \nUniversity in 1997. She received her master of science in environmental \nengineering in 1989, also from Harvard University.\n  I brought a poster to the floor where we see President Obama visited \nNIH to personally congratulate Dr. Sullivan for her incredible work on \nbehalf of world health.\n  Some people may be familiar with the TV show ``House.'' The main \ncharacter, Dr. Gregory House, is brilliant at diagnosing conditions and \nillnesses that baffle everyone else. The real-life Dr. House is Dr. \nWilliam Gahl, the founding Director of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program \nat NIH. He is America's leading medical detective, a physician \ndedicated to finding answers for long-suffering patients with \nmysterious illnesses that long eluded diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has brought \ntogether a unique combination of elite medical specialists, \nresearchers, and Federal resources to solve baffling illnesses and \nprovide desperate patients and their families with information and \npossible solutions and treatments for their often life-threatening \nailments.\n  Results include diagnosis and treatment of diseases so rare they \ndon't even have names, plus new genetic discoveries, improved disease \nmanagement, and the advancement of medical knowledge. NIH Director Dr. \nCollins said the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, which Dr. Gahl conceived \nand started, serves as a kind of court of last resort for patients \nwithout a diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has convinced some of the best, \nbrightest, and busiest physicians to participate, and has devoted \ntremendous energy to examining patient records, selecting cases for in-\ndepth analysis, and helping people who are seriously ill.\n  Under Dr. Gahl's stewardship, the program regularly involves a \ncollective effort by more than 25 attending physicians of different \nspecialties. The cooperation by a diverse group of experts has helped \ncreate a coherent view of each patient instead of the organ-by-organ \norientation taken by most specialists. Patients are brought to the NIH \ncampus in Bethesda for an intensive week. They meet with a parade of \nspecialists who study their medical histories, perform thorough exams, \nand take numerous tests.\n  The doctors then meet to discuss what they have seen, discovered, or \nmay have missed. They also debate various theories, trying to connect \nthe dots, and come up with a possible diagnosis and treatment.\n  Scientists working with Dr. Gahl discovered the genetic cause of a \nvascular disorder not previously identified in the medical literature. \nThe rare condition, identified in nine individuals, arises in adulthood \nand causes arterial calcification in the hands and feet, but does not \naffect arteries in the heart. The symptoms include acute pain after \nwalking more than a short distance. The disorder previously baffled the \nmedical field and evaded diagnosis when conventional methods were used.\n  In another instance, physicians working with Dr. Gahl identified the \nreason why a woman's muscles had grown painfully large and hard \nunderneath her skin, making it increasingly difficult for her to \nperform daily activities. This turned out to be an extremely rare, \ngenerally fatal complication of multiple myeloma, and the diagnosis by \nthe NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program resulted in a stem cell bone \nmarrow transplant that allows her to lead a normal life. These are \npeople who had no hope, no hope at all. They came to NIH, and they have \ngotten government-supported help to give them hope and to give them \nlife.\n  Dr. Gahl earned his B.S. in biology from the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology in 1972 and his M.D. from the University of Wisconsin in \n1976. He obtained a Ph.D. degree in oncology research from Wisconsin's \nMcArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research in 1981. He has published more \nthan 350 peer-reviewed papers and trained 36 biochemical geneticists.\n  Dr. Gahl has made a number of seminal discoveries regarding rare \ndiseases during his career. He said deciding who to admit into the \nUndiagnosed Diseases Program is always very difficult and much like \ntriage on the battlefield. You have to make decisions about where you \nthink you can do some good.\n  The Undiagnosed Diseases Program serves people who feel helpless, \nhave suffered greatly, have waited many years for answers, and must be \ntreated with respect and attention. According to Dr. Gahl, the NIH \ncaregivers understand the desperation the patients and their families \nfeel and try to balance the difficulty finding solutions with a \nrealistic measure of hope.\n  Dr. John Gallin, Director of the NIH Clinical Center, said Dr. Gahl \ntakes cases after everyone else has given up. He said that in a short \ntime the program has developed new approaches for investigating, \nunderstanding, and diagnosing rare disorders, and has added to the body \nof medical knowledge. As Dr. Gallin put it, as a result of the NIH \nUndiagnosed Diseases Program, the language of medicine is changing. The \ndifferent specialists working together now are beginning to find common \nways.\n  Nancy Sullivan and Bill Gahl are just two of the dedicated people who \nwork in the Federal Government. They are not nameless, faceless \nbureaucrats. They are dedicated, hard-working Americans trying to make \nlife better for all of us under difficult circumstances.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious crime \nand a violation of human rights that must be stopped--human \ntrafficking. It is a form of modern-day slavery, people profiting from \nthe control and exploitation of others.\n  I rise as a doc, a fellow who has practiced in the public hospital \nsystem for 32 years, understanding the unique role nurses, physicians, \nand other health care providers play in this issue.\n  Health care providers are frontline and one of the few to interact \ndirectly\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\nwith trafficked women and children. A recent survey published in the \nAnnals of Health Law reports that 28 percent of trafficked women sought \na health care professional while being held captive.\n  Now, this does not mean that the nurse, the doctor or other health \ncare provider had the training to recognize it, but because of the \nunique and critical involvement with these victims, it is important \nthese health care providers do have the tested tools and training to \nidentify and help those being trafficked.\n  The Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care amendment would \nsave lives and, as importantly, would begin the rebuilding of lives \ndestroyed by modern-day slavery. It would provide for the development \nof best practices to enable health care workers to recognize and assist \nvictims of human trafficking.\n  It is proven that many trafficking victims report receiving health \ncare from federally funded clinics and emergency rooms while in \ncaptivity yet, as I mentioned earlier, they go undetected. This \nlegislation would improve the awareness of health care workers, \nultimately helping these victims.\n  Senator Tim Kaine recently spoke about a missive that Pope Francis \ngave on Ash Wednesday, calling for us to be ``islands of mercy in a sea \nof indifference.'' The ethic of nurses, physicians, and other health \ncare workers is to be that merciful creature. This would give them the \ntraining to better enable them to be that ``island'' in what for that \nwoman or child caught in captivity must seem a ``sea of indifference.''\n  Having passed the House by unanimous consent, this amendment \nrepresents a bipartisan effort that will enable the medical community \nto bring relief to those suffering in ways that those of us who have \nnever been there cannot imagine.\n  Senator Peters is joining me in this bipartisan effort. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and help transform victims of \ntrafficking into survivors and people who blossom.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.\n\n\n         Authorizing The Use Of Force Against The Islamic State\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \ncritical national security challenges facing the Senate: specifically, \nhow we should craft an authorization for the use of military force \nagainst the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State.\n  I have spoken before on the floor about what I believe the outline of \nan authorization should contain. Now that the President has released \nhis proposal--and with Secretary Kerry, Secretary Carter, and General \nDempsey slated to testify tomorrow on behalf of this proposal--I feel \ncompelled to address this topic in greater detail.\n  Before delving into the specifics of the administration's proposed \nauthorization, we should consider how this institution has grappled \nwith these vital questions throughout our Nation's history. Dating back \nto 1798, Congress has on several occasions enacted legislation short of \na formal declaration of war authorizing the use of military force by \nthe President. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Congress \nauthorized U.S. naval action against both state and non-state actors \nwho attacked U.S. commercial vessels. More recent authorizations \nformally passed by the Congress include those intended to protect the \nMiddle East, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia from communist aggression in \nthe 1950s and 1960s. And since the end of the Cold War, we have passed \nauthorizations concerning Lebanon, the September 11 attacks, and Iraq--\nall in 1991 and in 2002.\n  I voted for those latter four authorizations here in this Chamber. \nEach case was unique, but in every case the White House did not send \nthe Congress ``take it or leave it'' language. Rather, the Senate and \nthe House fashioned text that represented a negotiated outcome with the \nWhite House and within Congress.\n  For example, Presidents Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush worked \nclosely with Congress to obtain strong authorizations for the use of \nmilitary force, despite Democrats controlling both Chambers. President \nGeorge W. Bush twice did the same with a Democrat-led Senate. This \napproach yielded concrete benefits--a more thoughtful debate and \nstrategy around our use of force, greater unity in supporting our \nmilitary, and congressional willingness to fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  Historically, the Senate has fulfilled its role as a place of \nintelligent, informed debate in moving authorizations for use of \nmilitary force. We must do so again as we consider this authorization \nto combat the Islamic State. Thirteen years ago, as the Senate began to \ndeliberate over an authorization to rid Iraq of its violent dictator, I \nsaid: We all must leave our political party affiliations at the door \nwhen it comes to our national security and supporting our troops in the \nfield.\n  It is time for Congress to come together, to hold a public debate, \nand to craft the right authorization to defeat the Islamic State.\n  Turning to the proposed authorization before us today, I agree with \nthe legal interpretation offered by the Obama administration that the \nexecutive branch has the power to conduct operations against the \nIslamic State under article II of the Constitution and the existing \nauthorizations from 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, the administration \nhas undermined the credibility of its own proposal by continuously \nchanging its position as to how the 2001 and 2002 authorizations should \nbe employed. Therefore, in order to settle any legal questions about \nthe power to use force against the Islamic State--and to demonstrate \nAmerica's resolve in this fight against terror--I firmly believe that a \nnew authorization should be enacted.\n  Accordingly, the senior Senator from Oklahoma and I discussed in this \nChamber last month three principles that we believe should be included \nin a new authorization for the use of military force against the \nIslamic State.\n  First, the authorization must clearly articulate that the executive \nbranch is authorized to use force--employed in accordance with the law \nof war--against the Islamic State.\n  Second, the authorization must be flexible enough to be used against \nthe Islamic State as it appears today but also in whatever form the \nIslamic State transforms into in the future. This flexibility must \ninclude the authority to use force against organizations that associate \nwith or support the Islamic State.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the authorization must not impose any \nartificial and unnecessary limitations, such as those based on time, \ngeography, and type of force, which could interfere with our strategic \nobjective of defeating the Islamic State.\n  Unfortunately, the President's draft authorization does not fully \nadhere to these principles.\n  First, the President's proposal ``does not authorize the use of the \nUnited States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground operations.'' \nObviously, this is an unwise artificial limitation on what type of \nforces we can employ. But the President's proposed operative text \noffers little to define what this restriction entails. Therefore, my \ninitial reaction, one that is widely shared, is: What does this \nrestriction mean?\n  To be fair, the President's introductory letter that accompanied his \ndraft does provide some insight into the administration's \ninterpretation of this phrase. Specifically, the President argues that \nthe authorization would provide him with the power to conduct rescue \noperations, to provide advice and assistance to partner forces, and to \ndeploy the use of Special Forces in missions against the Islamic \nState's leadership, intelligence collection, and targeting missions.\n  But in laying out his vision, the President's proposal also tells our \nenemies what he is not prepared to do. Knowing these limitations would \nprovide the Islamic State with a critical advantage: The terrorists \nwould exploit this information in crafting their strategies. Why would \nwe telegraph our strategy to our enemies?\n  The President's proposed legal limitations will also limit our \nability to adjust our strategy as needed based on the military \nsituation on the ground. For example, when our counterterrorism \nstrategy in Iraq faltered during the mid 2000s, we changed it and we \nadopted a new counterinsurgency strategy commonly called the surge. As \nwe all know, the surge was a great success.\n  Therefore, ensuring any authorization has the flexibility to allow \nour\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\nforces to change and adapt their strategies and tactics is essential. \nImposing the President's proposed artificial and unnecessary, yet \nlegally binding, restrictions on our forces would be a colossal \nmistake.\n  Indeed, General Jack Keane, who devised the principles of the surge, \nrecently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about his \nown proposal as to how to conduct operations against the Islamic State. \nIn his testimony, the general did advocate using Special Forces in a \nsimilar manner to what the President discussed in his letter \naccompanying his proposal. But the general went further. He stated that \nthe United States and our coalition partners should position combat \nbrigades in Kuwait if our current operation ``stalls or is defeated.''\n  Obviously, the use of combat brigades would be prohibited under the \nPresident's proposal. Therefore, if the President's limited operations \nare not successful and additional ground forces are required, adopting \nthe President's proposal would create significant uncertainty.\n  This raises the question: Would Congress need to debate and pass yet \nanother authorization before those units could be used in combat? On \nits face, this would be completely impractical and hardly in our \nnational security interest.\n  Another area in which the President's proposal does not provide \nsufficient flexibility is its 3-year time limitation. Simply put, if we \nadvertise when the authorization expires at an arbitrary date and time, \nwill our enemies not hunker down and wait for that date?\n  Secretary of State John Kerry stated in his previous testimony before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the administration does not \nbelieve a new authorization should include a geographic limitation. To \nits credit, the President's proposal does not. Specifically, the \nSecretary argued: ``In our view, it would be a mistake to advertise to \nISIL that there are safe havens for them outside of Iraq and Syria.''\n  Undoubtedly, the Secretary was concerned about creating artificial \nlimitations that could negatively affect our ability to conduct \nnecessary military operations. He is right. But his concern should \nextend to the other artificial restrictions that appear in this \nproposal. How else can we read the prohibition of ``enduring offensive \nground combat operations'' and a 3-year time limitation?\n  In conclusion, we can do better. Our forces must have the flexibility \nto use, or the ability to threaten to use, whatever tools and \nstrategies are necessary to defeat the Islamic State. When America \nenters into a fight, we should enter to win. And we should not just do \nthis in a halfhearted, stupid way.\n  So I hope the White House will reconsider some of the things that \nthey have advocated and that they have set forth and get this thing \ndone right so that if we are going to enter into warfare, we ought to \nknow what we are doing and ought to have the tools and the legal \nlegalities to be able to do it well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 178.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the \nroll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer has other \nplaces to be, and I am going to be presiding in the chair in a moment.\n  I will not offer amendments because my understanding is that even \nthough we are on the bill, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndon't want me to offer noncontroversial amendments. So I will wait \nuntil they are ready for that just to keep the peace on the floor, but \nI will talk about the amendments because they are incredibly important \nto the underlying legislation.\n  We are talking about the human trafficking legislation. This is \nsomething that as cochair and cofounder of the Human Trafficking \nCaucus, as a father, and as someone who represents the citizens of \nOhio, who are directly affected by this, I have a strong interest.\n  I am delighted the Senate is taking up this legislation. I do hope it \nwill be not just bipartisan but nonpartisan. I do not see any reason \nfor it not to move forward in the Senate, changing some of these laws \nthat are in desperate need of changing to ensure that this horrific \npractice of human trafficking and sex trafficking can be curbed. It can \nbe minimized by legislation that this Chamber should have taken up, in \nmy view, some time ago.\n  We really haven't been at this subject for a decade. We know a lot \nmore about the problem now. We know, unfortunately, that about 300,000 \nof our youth are subject to human trafficking--about 1,000 in my home \nState of Ohio alone.\n  The amendments I will offer--once someone on this side comes to the \nfloor who will allow me to offer them--have to do with human \ntrafficking in the broadest sense.\n  The first amendment has to do with those people who are, \nunfortunately, trapped in sex trafficking being treated not as \ncriminals but as victims and with ensuring that those victims get the \nproper care they need and the help to be able to get back on their \nfeet. These are young people--we are told many times--who are between \nthe ages of 11 and 13 when they are first exposed to human trafficking, \nin this case sex trafficking. In fact, that is the average age, we are \ntold.\n  Having talked to some of the victims at home, having talked to some \nof those who are in the trenches working, trying to help these young \nwomen, girls, young men, and boys, this legislation is badly needed to \nensure we are looking at this--not again as a criminal matter but--as \nvictims who deserve our support.\n  Specifically, it requires that every State put together a plan to \nimprove child protection services--containing, among other things, \nprovisions and procedures requiring identification and assessments of \nall reports involving children known or to be suspected victims of sex \ntrafficking--with better information and better data, a description of \nefforts to coordinate State law enforcement, child welfare agencies, \nand juvenile justice agencies such as runaway and homeless youth \nshelters to help serve these victims.\n  Finally, this legislation calls for an annual State report on the \nnumber of children identified as known or suspected to be a victim of \nsex trafficking.\n  The other amendment I am going to offer will be an amendment with \nregard to homeless children and youth. As has been discussed on this \nfloor before, the HUD definition of homelessness practically excludes \nthe most common situations for families and unaccompanied youths--and \nthat would be staying in motels or temporarily with others because \nthere is no place else for them to stay. Even if local communities \nidentified these families or youth as having the most pressing unmet \nneeds, communities can't use the HUD homeless assistance funds to serve \nthem except in extremely limited or near-impossible conditions.\n  This is related to human trafficking and also to sex trafficking in \nthat, unfortunately, many of these young people involved in these \nsituations--where they are homeless, where they are not on the street \nbut are going from house to house or perhaps staying in a motel--are \ntargeted by these traffickers.\n  I believe these two amendments, which are not only bipartisan--and \nthey are; I have support on both sides of the aisle--but are also \nnonpartisan and are ones that would be appropriate to include in the \nlegislation.\n  At the appropriate time I will offer those amendments.\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the homeless and youth amendment \nI spoke about a moment ago. I thank everyone for their indulgence. I am \npleased to have these amendments offered, and we will have an \nopportunity to speak on these amendments and another amendment I plan \nto offer later.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. PORTMAN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the \nunderlying legislation we are considering on the floor today. This is \nthe most significant antitrafficking legislation to come before the \nSenate in over a decade. As I said earlier when I offered a couple of \namendments, I am very pleased to be in this body on a nonpartisan \nbasis, not just a bipartisan basis, to be able to address this issue, \nand I would like to thank the Senators who have worked hard in their \ncommittees to make that possible. I thank Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar \nfor their work. I see Senator Wyden is here, Senator Leahy is here, \nSenator Grassley is here, and others who have been involved with this. \nThey and their staffs are to be commended. It has been a good process.\n  It is an issue a lot of us care about. Why? Because it is one that \naffects our States and our constituents in very significant ways.\n  Last year I cofounded and I now cochair the Caucus on Human \nTrafficking with Senator Blumenthal, and we have had a number of good \nmeetings and conferences here on the Hill bringing experts together and \nraising awareness of this issue.\n  Unfortunately, this horrible crime affects every single part of our \ncountry. In Ohio this came to my attention initially because in parts \nof Ohio, along the I-75 corridor, particularly in Toledo, there were \nhigher incidences of prosecutions of human trafficking. A school group \nactually brought this to my attention several years ago. The more we \nlooked into it, the more we realized that this affects so many of our \nconstituents, and it particularly affects the most vulnerable in our \nsociety--children, runaways, the missing. In the greatest country on \nthe face of the Earth, almost 300,000 of our American children are at \nrisk of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, more than 1,000 \neach year in Ohio alone.\n  In 2000 I did support the last major bill that directly addressed \nthis growing problem of human trafficking. It was called the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act. And I supported the reauthorization \nin 2011. But since that time we have learned a lot more about the \nproblem. We now know more about how to eradicate what is really a \nmodern form of slavery. Our new legislation, which is called the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, builds on what we know \nworks, and it strengthens protections for the victims.\n  I would like to take a moment, if I could, to talk about two of the \nbills that are contained within this underlying legislation that are \nthe product of a lot of bipartisan work that exemplifies some of the \nfinest traditions of this body.\n  The first is the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. The Bringing \nMissing Children Home Act is something I coauthored with Senator \nSchumer on the other side of the aisle, and we did it because we know \nthere is unfortunately a strong correlation between victims of sex \ntrafficking and children who have recently been in and out of the child \nwelfare system. We also know that children who have run away or who are \nmissing are the most vulnerable to being abused, trafficked, and \nexploited.\n  In 2014 an FBI sting recovered 168 children who were victims of sex \ntrafficking. Nearly each one of those children--nearly all of them had \nbeen involved in some kind of foster care or the child welfare system. \nMany of them had been reported missing--by the way, with insufficient \ninformation to find them.\n  It is a strong correlation, and it is one that any effort to stop \nhuman trafficking must also address. That is what my legislation does. \nThe Bringing Missing Children Home Act strengthens law enforcement \nreporting and response procedures, making it easier to communicate and \nwork with child welfare agencies. It accomplishes this in a number of \nways.\n  First, it amends the current Missing Children's Assistance Act so \nthat Federal law makes clear that children who are trafficked or \nsexually exploited are treated as victims and not as criminals. You \nwill hear this in this debate, and this is one of the great underlying \naspects of this legislation, we are changing the way we look at this, \nto understand that there is simply no such thing as a child prostitute.\n  Second, this legislation requires law enforcement to update their \nrecords of missing children within 30 days with all the relevant \ninformation obtained during the initial investigation. This is very \nimportant because this new information will allow us to find these \nchildren more easily and more quickly, to avoid them falling into the \ntrap of sexual trafficking and traffickers.\n  Specifically, the bill requires new dental and medical records, as \nwell as photograph, if available. For almost all of these children, \nthere is a photograph available if you take the time to try to find it. \nI can't stress this last part enough. It is so hard to find these kids, \nand without having a photograph, it is made much more difficult. Yet in \nmost instances we apparently don't.\n  We tracked this in Ohio. Let me give an interesting statistic. Since \nJanuary 1 of this year there have been 87 children reported missing in \nthe State of Ohio--87 kids. We only have photographs for 21 of them, so \nfor 66 of these young people we have no photographs. It is tough to \nfind them when you don't know what they look like. This bill will help \nchange that.\n  Third, it requires law enforcement to work directly with State and \nlocal child welfare systems after someone is reported missing so that \nall the relevant information can be obtained as quickly as possible.\n  Finally, it removes all the roadblocks that prevent State attorneys \ngeneral from modifying records in the National Crime Information \nCenter. We want these records to be updated\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nconstantly as new information is provided.\n  To put it simply, we think it is a commonsense bill that streamlines \nhow missing children cases are handled. It makes it easier to share \ninformation that could lead to recovery.\n  The second bill I wish to talk about that is part of this underlying \nlegislation is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act which I \ncoauthored with Senator Feinstein. The Bringing Missing Children Home \nAct is about helping victims. This legislation, the Combat Human \nTrafficking Act, is about punishing the traffickers.\n  We start by giving prosecutors expanded tools to put traffickers \nbehind bars. Our legislation enlarges the number of charges Federal \nprosecutors can level against traffickers and those who conspire with \nthem. It also makes those engaged in trafficking strictly liable for \ntheir crimes. We also expand the training available for our Federal law \nenforcement tasked with investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and \nwe require that the Bureau of Justice Statistics prepare an annual \nreport detailing our success in this fight.\n  Just as importantly, this bill strengthens victims' rights by \nproviding more information to victims on ongoing prosecutions, \nrequiring them to be informed in a timely manner of any plea agreements \nor prosecution agreements in cases in which they are involved.\n  The legislation we are considering passed out of the committee \nunanimously for a reason. There are things that do divide us in this \nplace. We talk about those a lot, and everybody reads and hears about \nthem. But this is an exception. This is about bringing us together, in \nthis case to protect our kids from human trafficking. Human traffickers \nand sexual trafficking are issues on which we should not have any \ndivide. This is legislation both Republicans and Democrats can \nenthusiastically support.\n  Earlier today I joined with some of my colleagues in introducing some \namendments to the legislation because although I support the underlying \nbill--it is a good bill--it can be made even better, and I am looking \nforward to the debate. In the process, I hope we will raise awareness \nabout the issue, raise consciousness about the issue not just among our \ncolleagues and around Capitol Hill but around the country because \nultimately, if we are going to solve this problem in our communities, \neveryone needs to be part of it, everyone needs to be vigilant, and \neveryone needs to understand that this happens in your community, it \nhappens in your State, and it happens, unfortunately, in our country.\n  If we can raise awareness about this wicked practice of human \ntrafficking and sex trafficking, that would do a lot to try to curb it, \nto reduce it, and eventually to stop it. This is what we came to \nWashington to do--to pass legislation that actually helps back home. \nWith this legislation, we can stand together to protect the most \ninnocent among us from the most heinous of crimes.\n  I thank you the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks \nI am going to make now not be part of the remarks on the bill that is \nbefore the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid, told us that Democrats and Republicans could finally agree on one \nthing; that is, we ought to focus not on the partisan politics and the \nideology that so often divides us, but we ought to focus on the victims \nof human trafficking, largely middle school-age girls who are bought \nand sold like commodities.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and said that I believe we are all \ncreated in the image of God, and it is a sin, it is the very \npersonification of evil for people to treat those same human beings as \nif they were things. That is what the scourge of human trafficking is \nall about.\n  I was very glad to see that finally we seemed to be chipping away at \nthe dysfunction of the Senate that we have experienced over the last \nfew years and, in the new majority, given an opportunity for an open \namendment process on a subject that we all agree needs to be dealt with \nthat we could work on together. So imagine my surprise when earlier \ntoday the same Democratic leader said the Democrats were going to \nfilibuster this anti-human trafficking legislation. Why in the world \nwould they take a 180-degree turn? Why would they do such an about-face \nor flip-flop? Well, they said because there was language contained in \nthe bill they disagreed with. No, they didn't say they would use this \nopen amendment process to file an amendment and have a vote to strip it \nout or to modify it or otherwise change it; they said: We are going to \nblock the bill; it is dead unless this language comes out. Yet they do \nnothing to try to effect that outcome.\n  We might wonder what this language is that they are so upset about \nthat they would literally kick the tens of thousands of children and \nother victims to the curb because of their outrage that this language \nis contained in this legislation. Well, imagine my surprise to find out \nthat the reason why the Democratic minority is going to filibuster this \nantitrafficking bill is because they object to language that has been \nthe law of the land for 39 years--39 years. So I guess they woke up \nthis morning and thought, well, we better do something about it. What \nis the provision that causes them so much discomfort, that they are so \nupset about that they are willing to block this legislation? Well, it \nis something called the Hyde amendment. Basically what that does is it \nprohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions.\n  I realize that in America we are of different minds on the subject of \nabortion. I am proudly pro-life, but others in our Senate are pro-\nchoice, and we probably have a whole spectrum of views on this very \npersonal issue. But we have had a bipartisan consensus--unanimity \nalmost--for the last 39 years that whatever else the law is, as handed \ndown by the Supreme Court or by Congress, we are not going to use \ntaxpayer funds for abortion.\n  So imagine my surprise when that very language and very reference was \nincluded in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act bill that now \ntoday I find out for the first time our Democratic friends object to.\n  Imagine my surprise when that very language was part of the bill that \nwas filed in mid-January and a month later was marked up and voted on \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee and all members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for it. They voted \nfor it unanimously. Well, I don't believe that was a mistake. Our \nfriends across the aisle have outstanding staff. They are very talented \npeople. I don't always agree with them, but they are good at what they \ndo. I don't believe for a minute that they would have missed a \nreference in this legislation to a restriction on funding taxpayer-\nprovided abortions, and I don't believe that those staff members, being \nthe diligent professionals they are, didn't tell their principal, their \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So this idea that there has \nbeen some kind of ambush is preposterous. It is just not credible.\n  Well, imagine my surprise when not only did we have a 15-to-0 vote, I \nbelieve it was--in other words, a unanimous vote of the Judiciary \nCommittee--for this bill, we have Democratic cosponsors of this bill. \nNot only do they support the bill, they have been actively working with \nus on the legislation. Just looking at the face of the bill, I count 10 \nDemocratic cosponsors. Do you think they didn't read the\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nbill before they put their names on it? Do you think their staffs \ndidn't tell them what is in the bill?\n  Well, as we all know, this sort of thing is ordinarily very hotly \ndebated. There are no shrinking violets in the U.S. Senate, no people \nwho sit passively on the sidelines and say: Well, I better not speak up \nand express my views. That doesn't happen. We have strong-willed, \ntalented people on both sides of the aisle, and there are no shrinking \nviolets. Let's just lay that to rest. People are willing to speak up, \nand they do speak up every day, every hour, virtually every minute on \nthings they feel strongly about.\n  So this idea that we have created an ambush, that we have surprised \nour colleagues by including this language in a bill that is on the \nfloor, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--voted unanimously \nout of the Judiciary Committee, all Republicans and all Democrats, with \n10 Democratic cosponsors--that we have somehow surprised them by \nincluding this restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion that has been \nthe law of the land for 39 years is patently ridiculous. It is just not \nbelievable.\n  Let me provide a little more information. The reference in the bill \nis on page 50 under limitations. It says: ``Amounts in the Fund, or \notherwise transferred from the Fund''--that is, the crime victims \ncompensation fund created by this legislation, $30 million that goes to \nhelp treat victims and help them heal and get on with their lives--this \nbill says that this fund ``shall be subject to the limitations on the \nuse or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of \ndivision H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 . . . to the \nsame extent as if amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated under \ndivision H of such Act.''\n  I went to see how many Democrats voted for that consolidated \nappropriations act in 2014 that contained the Hyde amendment language \nand the limitations on taxpayer-funded abortions. Imagine my surprise \nwhen I saw that 55 Democrats voted for that language in the 2014 \nconsolidated appropriations bill that is referred to on pages 50 and 51 \nof the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  This is the same bill the Democratic leader said Democrats were going \nto filibuster because they were so outraged, they were surprised, they \nwere bushwhacked, they were ambushed, they were tricked. Twenty-three \nDemocrats voted for that same appropriation language in 2014.\n  But it gets better--or worse, as the case may be. Democrats have \nsupported legislation consistent with the Hyde amendment for a long \ntime. As I have said, it has been the law of the land for 39 years. \nWhen was the last time? Well, the Department of Homeland Security \nfunding. Remember this back-and-forth we had over the defunding of the \nPresident's Executive action on immigration that so many on our side of \nthe aisle are upset about because it is not within the President's \nauthority to do it--and that is not just my opinion; it is the Federal \njudge's in Brownsville who has issued a preliminary injunction--but how \nmany Democrats voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding \nbill that contains that same limitation on taxpayer funding for \nabortions? Forty-five Democrats voted for it.\n  So imagine my surprise when 45 Democrats recently voted for that \nappropriations bill to come to the Senate today and be told: We are \noutraged. We are never going to support that. And, by the way, we \ndidn't know it was in the bill when we voted for it in the Judiciary \nCommittee or when we cosponsored the bill.\n  Well, they presumably knew about it when they voted for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding in February of 2015, when 32 of \nthem voted for the CR omni or CRomni in December of 2014. And, oh, by \nthe way, remember ObamaCare? Every single Democrat voted to support \nObamaCare which contained the same restriction on taxpayer funding for \nabortions.\n  They have also voted for the Children's Health Insurance Program, the \nso-called SCHIP, for Defense authorization bills. In other words, our \nDemocratic friends have voted time and time and time again for the \nexact same language they now say they are going to filibuster on the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, language they said they weren't \naware of when they voted for it--they didn't read it, their staff \ndidn't tell them about it.\n  Well, if that is true, I would get new staff. But I know the staff on \nthe Democratic side, like the staff on the Republican side, are highly \nprofessional people and they wouldn't fail to identify offensive \nlanguage that their Senator could not and would not and never has voted \nfor, or they would be out of a job.\n  So I plead with our Democratic friends, please don't make this \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act another political football. For \nheaven's sake, if we can't agree to protect the most vulnerable victims \nof this heinous crime, what can we ever agree on? If we can't agree on \nthat, if we are going to try to find a way to flyspeck legislation and \nsay, well, I won't allow this bill to go forward if that language is \nincluded in there--even though it has been the law of the land for 39 \nyears, even though routinely Democrats have voted for that restriction \non taxpayer-funded abortion time and time and time again--why start \nnow, when we are talking about the most vulnerable victims of this \nheinous crime, and say: Well, we are going to punish you. We are not \ngoing to provide you the services you need in order to heal and get \nbetter and get on with your life, because we woke up this morning, \nMarch 10, 2015, and after 39 years we decided this is where we draw the \nline. We are drawing the line here. Never again will we ever vote for \nthe Hyde amendment to be applied to any funds appropriated by or in the \npossession of the Federal Government.\n  So I really would ask my colleagues: Please reconsider. Please let's \nnot do this. Don't do this to these children and these victims of \ntrafficking. Don't do it to this institution.\n  We all understand that Washington can be a pretty tough place. All of \nus are volunteers, and we understand politics can sometimes be a tough \nbusiness. But let's not take it out on these victims of human \ntrafficking. That should be beneath us. They don't deserve that. They \ndeserve better.\n  If we pass this legislation and we get it to the President's desk and \nhe signs it--which I believe he will--hundreds, if not thousands, of \nvictims of human trafficking have a safe place to sleep, they will have \npeople who love them and care for them try to help them heal and get \nbetter. We will take the money from the people who perpetrate these \ncrimes and we will use that money to help provide needed services to \nthese children and other victims of human trafficking.\n  We will say ``no more'' to the teenaged girl who is arrested for \nprostitution, because she is a victim of trafficking--we will tell her, \nno more are you a criminal. We will recognize her for the victim she \nis, and we will treat her appropriately.\n  We will deal not only with the supply side of this terrible crime, we \nwill deal with the demand side--people who get off the hook too easily \nwith impunity, people who purchase these illicit services, and somehow \nalways seem to avoid responsibility and continue to participate in this \ncrime with impunity.\n  So the domestic trafficking victims fund in our legislation \nsupplements existing authorized grant programs that are already subject \nto appropriation laws such as the Hyde amendment. They are already \nsubject to the same provisions. Our legislation clarifies that the Hyde \namendment also applies to any funds that are used to supplement those \nexisting grant programs. Our legislation does not in any way expand or \nchange the scope of the Hyde amendment. It just says these funds \noperate under the same rules that cover the existing grant programs \nthey supplement.\n  Everyone agrees the programs we supplement in this legislation need \nmore funds. I know the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from \nVermont, has made an impassioned plea to add more money beyond the \nvictims compensation fund that we created. He is saying there needs to \nbe more money. As a long-time member of the Appropriations Committee, I \nhope the Appropriations Committee looks at that and makes a decision \nwhether they ought to supplement what we do. But these funds are being \nsubjected to the same limitation on spending as\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nevery dollar the Senate Appropriations Committee has appropriated \nduring the last 39 years.\n  So my hope is this, that Members of the Senate will rise above this \ndisagreement, this posturing, this attempt to try to play ``gotcha'' at \nthe expense of these victims of human trafficking. No Member should \nattempt to make this bill a debate about extraneous issues and policies \nthat have been settled on a bipartisan basis for 39 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have listened very carefully to my good \nfriend from Texas. We have worked together on many pieces of \nlegislation over the years. In fact, I hoped we could have gotten this \ntrafficking bill up during the last Congress, as he knows. \nUnfortunately, there were objections raised and we couldn't. I hope we \nare not going to get into a question where we compare apples and \noranges and forget what we are supposed to be doing.\n  The distinguished Senator says on the one hand during the debate on \nthe Affordable Care Act, according to him--and I will take him at his \nword--that this language was in there and every Democrat voted for it--\nwhich meant, of course, that every Republican voted against it. If you \nare going to use and follow his argument that the language in the \nAffordable Care Act was voted for by Democrats, it was voted against by \nRepublicans.\n  I am not suggesting they don't care about the Hyde amendment because \nthey voted against it, according to the Senator from Texas. But let's \ntalk about things that should be on appropriations bills.\n  I am one of the few Members of either party in this body who has \nactually prosecuted child molesters. I am one of the few Members of \nthis body who has actually gone to crime scenes and seen the results of \nchild molestation. I am one of the few people in this body who has \nprosecuted a child molester, not with evidence from the child, but \nbecause the child was dead. The young boy had been raped by the man \nwhom I prosecuted, and molested over a long period of time.\n  So I don't need to have people tell me about the horrors of child \nmolestation. I have seen it. I remember being in a room and looking at \nthat dead child, the same age as one of my children. And I remember the \nman who did it who would have done anything to escape my prosecution, \nand I worked day and night around the clock for weeks. I was a young \nprosecutor in my twenties, and I prosecuted him and convicted him. He \nwent up on appeal to the Supreme Court--our Supreme Court--and I argued \nthat appeal myself, and his conviction was upheld.\n  So I know the need for this. Let's not let political ``gotcha'' games \nstop us from legislation that might protect these people.\n  The Senator from Texas suggests I want more money. That is not quite \nwhat I said. He said he wanted $30 million based on fines. I said I \njust want to guarantee that $30 million was there. I think again of \nthat child molester, that child murderer. He was just one of the many \ncases I prosecuted. We could have fined him $1 million or $20 million \nor $1 billion--or $200--and he would not have been able to pay it and \nwouldn't have paid it. If the victim had lived, there would be no \nmoney.\n  All I want to make sure of--and I would be happy to see--is that if \nthere are fines collected, that they go to help victims as they should. \nBut if no money is collected from fines, I want to make sure there is \nmoney. We will prosecute somebody who has been involved with child \ntrafficking or child molestation. We will prosecute them, as we should. \nThey will go to prison and we will spend $25,000 to $35,000 a year of \ntaxpayer dollars to keep them in prison, and we should. But we will say \nto the victim: I am sorry; we fined him $100,000 to go to the victims' \nfund, but he is basically judgment proof. I just want you to know we \nhad good intentions. If he had paid that $100,000 fine, we would have \ngiven it to you to help you. But, gosh, go in peace. Have a good life.\n  All I am saying is this: If there is money from a fine, sure. The \nSenator from Texas and I agree that it should be put in the Fund. But \nif there are no funds, don't promise a $30 million pot of money that \nwill never be filled if there are no fines, if there is no money in it. \nIf there is money from fines, put the money from fines in, but where \nthere is a difference between the amount that is in there and the $30 \nmillion, then shouldn't we, as a country that spends trillions of \ndollars, give the difference between the fines and the actual $30 \nmillion? Shouldn't we care about these victims? Shouldn't we care about \nthe people who are victimized?\n  Shouldn't we also do this: If we have the money in there, we could \ntake increased steps to prevent victims from becoming victims in the \nfirst place. I would have given anything if there had been some \nprogram, some money, to have found out that this child I talked about \nwas being victimized, and then we could have stopped it before the \nState's attorney got called in to look at the dead body. How much \nbetter it would have been if we could have stopped it to begin with.\n  So all I am saying is this: I am happy to work with the senior \nSenator from Texas on this bill, just as I was last year. We had a bill \nwithout this provision, and I was hoping and trying to get consent to \nbring it up and pass it when we had a bill without this provision. It \nis important to note, though, that when it didn't have this provision \nlast year, I wish we could have passed it. Now let's work on a bill \nthat will pass. If you want to score political points, do it on \nsomething that doesn't involve vulnerable children. Let's work together \nto get a bill passed that helps them. And let's make sure that on the \npoint I raised, that we address this at some point. If there is going \nto be $30 million worth of fines that go in there, I am all for it. My \nguess is that we would be lucky to get a small percentage of that.\n  Back when this came up in the House of Representatives, they rejected \nthis method of funding, and they called it budgetary gimmickry. \nActually, what the House did in authorizing the bill--they did what \nthey were supposed to do. They authorized actual funding so we could \nstand up for the victims of human trafficking, not just stand here \ntrying to score political points.\n  In other words, let's have the money. Let's make sure the money is \nthere. This is like saying: If you commit a crime, we are going to fine \nyou $100 million or $300 million or $1 billion. But if the person never \nhad more than a net worth of $1,000, what difference does it make? Put \nreal teeth in here. Stop the traffickers, and ensure there is money to \nhelp the victims. Have money to help the victims.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer was one of the senators who \ntestified at the Judiciary Committee hearing on human trafficking last \nmonth. Other senators testified as well. Their testimony had people \ntearing people up. The distinguished Presiding Officer was attorney \ngeneral for her State. She understands the reality of this, as I do and \nothers do.\n  It has been years since I was State's attorney, but, I say to my \nfriend from Texas, I still wake up some nights from nightmares about \nthe crime scenes I went to. I would wake up from them at night when we \nwere debating the Violence Against Women Act, and I am glad that \nRepublicans and Democrats joined together on that both here and in the \nother body so we could pass it. A victim is a victim is a victim, not a \nnumber, not a concept. Those of us who have spent time with victims and \nthose of us who have been at crime scenes of victims understand this. \nToo often victims could no longer speak, could no longer testify. We \nwould hear about them at their funeral.\n  We can do better. So let's not talk about who scores points or who \ndoesn't score points. There are good people who worked on this, good \npeople in both parties. We are not going to be voting on something \ntonight, I imagine. Let's spend the time between now and tomorrow \nsitting down and trying to work out a way forward. Save the political \npoints for something where the most vulnerable in society do not \nsuffer. We can talk about what we will do on stock frauds or who gets \ntaxed or what regulations we will have for corporations. There, raise \nyour points. Make political points there. But for anyone who has seen \nthese victims and anyone who has talked with these victims and anyone \nwho has been with these victims, they know this is not the time for \npolitics.\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\n  Let's get together this evening or tomorrow. Let's work it out so we \ncan have something that will really protect victims, something that \nwill have real funding to protect them--not something illusion, but \nreal funding. And maybe if we can do that, I might have less nightmares \nabout some of those victims I saw.\n  My friend from Texas was a judge; he certainly saw those cases. The \nPresiding Officer was attorney general; she saw those cases. We have a \nnumber of former prosecutors on both sides here. Any one of us who has \nhandled these cases has to remember every single aspect of them.\n  I remember preparing for trial in these cases, having young children \nat home. I would work late in the office. I wouldn't bring the \nmaterials home at all because I didn't want my kids to see what I was \nlooking at. I will admit there is another reason: I didn't want my \nchildren to see their father cry as I read these police investigations. \nThese aren't statistics; these are real people. Let's work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I have an amendment at the desk which has been slightly modified from \nits original form, and I ask unanimous consent that it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will object until I have had a chance \nto see the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have now filed my slightly modified \namendment--I will explain the modification in a minute--and it is at \nthe desk.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so my \namendment can be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I object. Some Members on my side of the \naisle have concerns about certain aspects of the Senator's amendment, \nso on their behalf, I object to setting aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will explain and speak on this \namendment even though it is not pending as we speak.\n  I will also file an ongoing objection to anyone setting aside the \npending amendment for another or for any votes being scheduled until \nthis matter can be worked out.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, the amendment I have at the desk is \nabout a very important issue. Before I explain what it is, I will say \nthat I strongly support the underlying bill.\n  I compliment Senator Cornyn and others who have worked on a \nbipartisan basis on this bill. I certainly look forward to supporting \nthis bill irrespective of how the vote goes on my amendment, but I \nobviously hope my amendment is adopted in the context of this bill.\n  Clearly, this issue of human trafficking is a very serious one. It \ntakes many forms, all of them ugly. One form is a phenomenon I am going \nto talk about today, which is the issue of birth tourism and \ntrafficking in women and families who want to get into this country in \norder to physically have their children in this country because present \npolicy recognizes those children immediately as U.S. citizens simply \nbecause they were born in this country.\n  This phenomenon of birth tourism is a very real one, and it often \nputs these birth mothers and families in very dangerous situations, \nquite frankly, at the hands of human smugglers or the equivalent.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have two news reports \nwhich illustrate this phenomenon printed in the Record.\n  The first news report is an article entitled ``No vacancy at \nCalifornia birth hotels,'' which underscores some of the abuses and \nhorrendous conditions that go on as a result of this, and the second \narticle is from the Washington Post, which is entitled ``Inside the \nshadowy world of birth tourism at `maternity hotels.' ''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From WorldMag.com, March 12, 2013]\n\n                 No Vacancy at California Birth Hotels\n\n                  (By Alaina Gillogly and Les Sillars)\n\n       It started last summer. Neighbors of a tan, sunbaked \n     mansion in Chino Hills, Calif, knew something was going on in \n     the large Spanish-style home with stucco walls and a tiled \n     roof overlooking the community. Cars sped up and down the \n     quiet little road:And a remarkable number of pregnant Asian \n     women came and went throughout the day.\n       Then in September, disgruntled neighbors became anxious \n     citizens when 2,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled down the \n     hillside.\n       City authorities discovered in the subsequent investigation \n     that the seven-bedroom house had become a 17-room ``birth \n     hotel.'' The 7,964-square-foot residence on Woodglen Drive \n     had been housing up to 30 pregnant Chinese women who wanted \n     to give birth to their children on American soil. Each room \n     had matching bedding and furniture, room keys, monogrammed \n     towels, and a portable hot water kettle.\n       Last month, a local court shut down the operation, owned by \n     Los Angeles Hermas Hotel Inc., for building code violations \n     that included exposed wires, missing smoke alarms, improper \n     ventilation, and carpet stretched over a 3-foot-wide hole in \n     the floor. The owners have six months to fix the problems and \n     get the proper business permits, or they face permanent \n     closure.\n       This operation was just one of about 15 baby hotels in the \n     heavily Asian Chino Hills area, with dozens more around the \n     country.\n       ``Birth tourism'' has made the news recently, but the Chino \n     Hills incident touched off a crackdown in California as local \n     authorities apply zoning and building codes in an effort to \n     control the operations.\n       It's also reopened the debate over the Fourteenth \n     Amendment. Birth hotels are legal in the U.S. because the \n     Fourteenth Amendment gives citizenship to children born on \n     American soil. They have the right to vote, immigrate from \n     their parents' home country, and apply for permanent visas \n     for their parents once they turn 21.\n       Birth tourism is a rising industry in countries like China, \n     South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. A three-month stay, plus \n     medical fees, can easily run more than $50,000. Although the \n     Chino Hills operation had a variety of safety and health \n     issues, other birth hotels offer luxurious accommodations \n     with chefs to prepare food from the home country.\n       Recent studies by the National Center for Health Statistics \n     have reported the number of babies born to non-resident women \n     topped 7,000 per year, up 50 percent since 2000, although \n     it's not clear how many are the result of birth tourism.\n       That is a tiny fraction of the number of children born with \n     at least one parent in the country illegally--350,000 in \n     2009, according to the Pew Hispanic Research Center. But \n     critics say ``birth tourism'' is an abuse of an American law \n     designed to enfranchise slaves born on American soil.\n       ``The practice is a misinterpretation of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment,'' said John Fonte, Hudson Institute senior fellow \n     and director of the Center for American Common Culture. \n     ``U.S. citizens should be very concerned.''\n       Some Californians are concerned. Rosanna Mitchell started a \n     group called Not in Chino Hills to protest against the \n     facility. ``Our mission is to keep a vigilant eye and use all \n     our efforts necessary to do so,'' wrote Mitchell on the \n     website.\n       She told WORLD that, aside from worries about sanitation, \n     traffic, and under-the-table businesses, she doubts those \n     patronizing birth hotels are genuinely pursuing the American \n     dream. ``Something needs to be done,'' she said. ``It's \n     outrageous that they would take advantage of the U.S.''\n       Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill in \n     January to amend the Fourteenth Amendment to ``clarify'' that \n     citizenship applies to those born in the U.S. provided at \n     least one parent is a U.S. citizen, a lawful immigrant, or \n     serving in the military. The bill, with 13 co-sponsors, is \n     currently in committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5]\n\n   Inside the Shadowy World of Birth Tourism at ``Maternity Hotels''\n\n                           (By Abby Phillip)\n\n       In luxury apartment complexes in Southern California and in \n     grand, single-family homes in New York, ``maternity hotels'' \n     are brimming with pregnant women and cooing newborn babies.\n       For wealthy foreign women, the facilities offer the promise \n     of a comfortable, worry-\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n     free vacation complete with a major perk: a U.S. passport for \n     their newborn.\n       One such maternity hotel in New York resembled a nursery: \n     Newborn babies rested in a row of bassinets that lined the \n     wall, according to an NBC News report that offered a look \n     inside the facility.\n       Women who book rooms at these properties can expect to live \n     in well-stocked apartment complexes or large suburban homes \n     with laundry and catered food as part of the package. Once \n     their babies are born in an American hospital, they are cared \n     for by nurses while the mothers rest for at least a month. \n     They can pass their time with shopping trips to luxury \n     stores, trips to amusement parks or poolside at the ``hotel'' \n     while attentive caretakers look after the infants, feeding, \n     bathing and putting them to sleep on a regimented schedule, \n     NBC News found.\n       The cost--$40,000 to $80,000 per stay--is worth it for the \n     prospect that the visitor's child will automatically be \n     afforded the benefits given to U.S. citizens--and perhaps \n     will have an easier time gaining legal residency in the \n     United States when that child turns 21.\n       ``For my baby, it's a chance to, a step to two countries'' \n     cultures . . . Chinese culture and American culture,'' one \n     woman told NBC.\n       There's nothing illegal about foreign nationals giving \n     birth in the United States. But traveling to the hotels \n     requires the illegal practice of lying about the real reason \n     for visiting the United States. Pregnant women purporting to \n     be tourists enter the country in the latter stages of \n     pregnancy, some overstaying their visas to recover in the \n     comfort of the ``maternity hotels.''\n       Birth tourism companies have flourished in recent years, \n     according to federal officials--and many of them prefer hard-\n     to-track cash to fuel their operations.\n       That money, federal officials allege, is being pocketed by \n     a group of individuals who have skirted tax law, flouted \n     immigration laws and helped their clients defraud U.S. \n     hospitals of tens of thousands of dollars for each baby born.\n       On Tuesday, federal agencies, including Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement and the IRS, along with the Los Angeles \n     Police Department, conducted a massive operation to raid more \n     than 30 California locations operated by ``birth tourism \n     businesses.'' Officials collected piles of evidence that will \n     likely be used against some of the ``maternity hotel'' \n     operators in future prosecutions.\n       The companies advertise their services online--and no \n     foreign language skills are necessary to guess the subtext.\n       What are the benefits of a U.S. passport for a foreign \n     national's unborn child?\n       ``Too many,'' the Web site of StarBabyCare explains to \n     prospective clients. ``You can enjoy the free education from \n     junior high school to public high school. . . . You can apply \n     loans or grants which is only for the U.S. citizen. . . . You \n     can receive your senior supplement benefits when you are \n     living overseas. . . . To the parent, after the baby becomes \n     an adult, he/she can petition the parents for a green card.''\n       According to court documents, an undercover investigator \n     was told: ``The baby will then have a birth certificate and \n     `freedom.' The baby will have a bright future having United \n     States citizenship.''\n       Federal officials say that Chao Chen and Jie Zhu, the \n     couple that operated the You Win baby tourism company, \n     engaged in ``sham marriages'' to get green cards for \n     themselves. In documents filed in federal court this week, \n     officials said that the two ``divorced'' in 2012, but married \n     U.S. citizens in Las Vegas months later.\n       Both applied for permanent residency, and an immigration \n     officer reviewing the cases noted that the marriages were \n     ``suspect'' based on the timing.\n       Such companies have openly encouraged women willing to pay \n     for the service to commit visa fraud as well. They were \n     counseled not to tell customs and immigration officials that \n     they were pregnant, to wear loose clothes and to avoid \n     traveling to the United States while looking visibly \n     pregnant.\n       ``U.S. might refuse entry due to the belly is too big,'' \n     StarBabyCare's Web site informed potential customers. \n     ``Therefore the size of the belly is quite important to \n     determine when you should arrive in Los Angeles.''\n       According to court documents, birth tourists were told to \n     avoid traveling directly.to Los Angeles International Airport \n     from overseas, to avoid raising suspicion. They might even \n     consider studying U.S. culture and booking recreational \n     visits in order to make their travel seem more legitimate, \n     the company advised. Alternate arrival ports such as Hawaii \n     or Las Vegas were preferable.\n       You Win paid more than $60,000 a year to rent Southern \n     California apartments that housed the women, according to \n     court documents. Federal officials believe that StarBabyCare \n     operated a ``maternity hotel'' from at least 10 units at one \n     complex.\n       As more attention has been trained on the practice in \n     recent years, the outrage has--predictably--followed.\n       Los Angeles County officials have cited the ``hotels'' for \n     illegally operating business in residential homes in 2013. \n     Angry neighbors at a Chino Hills ``hotel'' picketed as the \n     report became public. Among its findings: The 17-bedroom, 17-\n     bathroom operation was blamed for overloading the septic tank \n     in the community.\n       Usually, the women participating in the programs paid \n     several thousand dollars up front as a deposit and thousands \n     more upon arrival in United States, according to \n     investigators. The balance was paid after childbirth.\n       But ``some or all'' of that money--which for You Win likely \n     amounted to over $1 million--went unreported to federal \n     authorities in 2013.\n       ``Chen failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in \n     income on his 2013 federal tax return,'' according to federal \n     officials.\n       As women went into birth, they were taken to local \n     hospitals and declared jobless. As many as 400 babies \n     associated with just one of these companies were born after \n     2013 in Orange County, Calif., hospitals. Despite the fact \n     that many of these women paid tens of thousands of dollars to \n     participate in the ``maternity hotel'' scheme, they claimed \n     to be unable to pay the hospitals, which typically charged \n     about $25,000 per birth.\n       Some paid nothing at all, while others paid a fee closer to \n     $4,000.\n       No one was arrested during Tuesday's raids. But Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement agents collected evidence and \n     potential witnesses for use in future prosecutions on tax, \n     immigration and fraud charges.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, recently the Obama administration \nconducted a raid on some of these shadowy operations. I compliment them \nfor doing that. There needs to be a crackdown on these operations, but \nthe ultimate crackdown and ultimate solution is to change the policy of \nthe Federal Government that recognizes these children immediately as \nU.S. citizens simply because they are physically born in this country \neven though both of their parents are here illegally. No parent is here \nunder any sort of legal status, and that is the ultimate response and \nultimate solution we need, and that is what my amendment--that I will \ncall up as soon as that is allowed and get a vote on--is about.\n  My amendment would change the present practice, policy, and law to \nsay that only somebody born in this country who has at least one parent \nwho is a U.S. citizen, a legal green card holder, or a serving member \nof the U.S. military, immediately gets that recognition as a U.S. \ncitizen.\n  As I suggested, this issue and practice--including this shadowy world \nof birth tourism and human smuggling--is a very serious issue. In fact, \nit is an exploding issue, as these recent cases in the press have \nbrought to light.\n  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, each year about \n300,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal aliens in the United \nStates, and under our present practice, all of them are immediately \nrecognized as U.S. citizens. This is a huge magnet for more illegal \ncrossings into our country, often at the hands of very dangerous \npeople.\n  Birthright citizenship draws women from Mexico and Central America to \nmake that dangerous trek north, often in the hands of coyotes and drug \ncartels. These women put their lives into the hands of criminal gangs \nwith a demonstrated pension for sexual assault and sex trafficking.\n  In addition, there is a huge business of birth tourism, including \nthose who market to women and families in China. As I mentioned, on \nTuesday, March 3, Federal agents broke up an alleged birth tourism ring \nin southern California, raiding several homes and apartment complexes \nwhere pregnant Chinese women, who were here on fraudulent visas, paid \nup to $80,000 in some cases so their babies would be born here.\n  DHS and IRS investigators were seeking evidence and statements \nagainst those alleged in the scheme. Besides visa fraud, authorities \nare looking into possible tax and money laundering charges. As I \nreferred to the news reports that are now part of the Record, in some \ncases this involves horrendous conditions and a very shadowy world in \nterms of this so-called birth tourism.\n  The ultimate solution to this enormous magnet for illegal crossings--\noften at the hands of very dangerous people--is to not recognize \neveryone who is simply born in the United States to be a citizen of the \nUnited States because of that fact alone. Again, that is what my \namendment would do. That is far more effective than any set of raids on \nthese operations or on any enforcement provisions.\n  If we move toward this, we would be in the company of a huge majority \nof countries in the world. Of advanced economies, only Canada and the \nUnited States grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal \naliens. No European country does that. No other advanced industrialized \ncountry does\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nthat, nor should we. As I suggested, it is a huge magnet for more and \nmore illegal crossings, and my amendment would fix that.\n  Some people will argue this is not possible with a statutory change. \nThis is embedded in the U.S. Constitution through the 14th Amendment \nand any change would have to be a constitutional amendment. I believe \nthat is not the case and is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the Constitution in this regard, including the 14th Amendment.\n  The 14th Amendment does not say that all persons born in the United \nStates are citizens, period, end of story. If we look at the precise \nlanguage, it is very instructive. It states that citizenship extends to \n``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to \nthe jurisdiction thereof.'' That latter phrase--``and subject to the \njurisdiction thereof''--was included because it means something, and \nits original meaning clearly refers to the political allegiance of an \nindividual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that \nperson.\n  That is exactly why American Indians and their children were not \nimmediately recognized as U.S. citizens simply because of their birth \nin this country. There was actually litigation about that going \ndirectly to this language of the 14th Amendment. The courts decided, \nno, the fact that these American Indian children were born in the \nUnited States in and of itself did not make them U.S. citizens because \n``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' had a meaning. It meant \nthese children could not be subject to any other governmental or quasi-\ngovernmental authority and an American Indian tribe was such an \nauthority.\n  Because of that litigation and interpretation, in order for those \nAmerican Indian children to be recognized as American citizens, it \nactually took specific congressional action, and Congress passed the \nIndian Citizenship Act of 1924. I believe that goes directly to this \nissue that this practice is not embedded in the Constitution and in the \n14th Amendment, and so that allows the statutory fix my language would \noffer.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, actually introduced a bill \nin 1993 titled the ``Immigration Stabilization Act,'' which included \nnearly identical language to my amendment and stand-alone bill. This \nlanguage has broad support in the country, including broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  In Senator Reid's bill--now that is going back a ways--it stated ``in \nthe exercise of its powers under section 5 of the 14th article of the \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Congress has \ndetermined and hereby declares that any person born after the date of \nenactment of this title to a mother who is neither a citizen of the \nUnited States nor admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent \nresident will not be a U.S. citizen.'' So there we have language from a \nleading Democratic Member that goes to the same issue.\n  There is broad bipartisan support, not just in the Congress but in \nthe country for this fix, particularly in the context of these huge \nillegal alien flows into the country. I believe Americans recognize \nthat we cannot continue to adopt and recognize this policy. It is an \nenormous magnet for the continuing flows of illegal aliens into the \ncountry.\n  It brings up industries such as this shadowy world of birth tourism \nwhich was recently raided by Federal authorities. It puts those mothers \nand families in the hands of very unsavory criminal elements in many \ncases, and we should not allow this to continue.\n  My amendment would stop that practice, stop those abuses, and stop \nencouraging those flows of illegal aliens. I strongly encourage the \nSenate to directly consider this amendment, vote on it, and to adopt it \nas part of this very important underlying bill.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have two letters that were \nwritten by leading groups on immigration reform, FAIR and the Eagle \nForum, printed in the Record.\n  They are in strong support of this measure. I will submit additional \nletters of support as they develop over the next day or two.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Federation for American\n\n\n                                           Immigration Reform,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2015.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: I am writing to thank you for your \n     efforts as a United States Senator to end birthright \n     citizenship--the practice of automatically granting U.S. \n     citizenship to anyone born in the United States, regardless \n     of the parents' immigration status.\n       Your amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \n     Act of 2015 (S. 178) would close this loophole that is based \n     on a misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment. Specifically, \n     your amendment would amend the Constitution so that children \n     born in the U.S. only gain citizenship automatically if one \n     parent is either a U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident, or \n     a non-immigrant active member of the Armed Forces. Your \n     language is consistent with the intent behind the ``subject \n     to the jurisdiction thereof' clause of excluding from \n     automatic citizenship American-born persons whose allegiance \n     to the United States is incomplete.\n       Even the Obama Administration recognizes that the current \n     practice of birthright citizenship encourages unlawful \n     behavior and abuse of the system. Indeed, just last week \n     federal and local law enforcement officials raided the \n     Southern California offices of a company that encourages \n     foreign pregnant women to come to the U.S. to give birth, \n     promising them benefits like citizenship and free education. \n     Known as ``birth tourism,'' these companies arrange for \n     pregnant women to come to the U.S. and advise them to provide \n     false information on visa applications. This particular \n     Irvine business made approximately $2 million in 2013, with \n     fees ranging from $15,000 to $50,000.\n       Your amendment would end this magnet of illegal immigration \n     because the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens will not be \n     eligible to sponsor family members for legal permanent \n     resident status (green cards) once they reach the age of \n     twenty-one. Again, we thank you for sponsoring this \n     commonsense legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Dan Stein,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Eagle Forum,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2015.\n       Dear Senator Vitter, On behalf of Eagle Forum and the \n     families we represent, we express our support for your \n     amendment to S. 178 ending the practice of birthright \n     citizenship. Automatically granting citizenship to any child \n     born on U.S. soil, even if the child's parents are temporary \n     visitors or illegal aliens, cheapens the value of American \n     citizenship. Action by Congress to clarify the long-\n     misinterpreted intent of section 1 of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment is both necessary and appropriate.\n       Birthright citizenship is an invitation to exploit the \n     benefits of American citizenship. Simply being born in our \n     country, whatever the citizenship of the parents, entitles a \n     child to government aid. It circumvents the lengthy process \n     of naturalization, including the pledge of new citizens to \n     ``support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \n     States.'' This loophole encourages illegal immigration and \n     even ``birth tourism,'' which brings pregnant women to this \n     country just in time to give birth. Both illegal immigration \n     and birth tourism fuel human trafficking, which stems from a \n     desire to claim the protections of our laws and the support \n     of the welfare state.\n       Permitting birthright citizenship is a misreading of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment states that U.S. citizens \n     are ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States \n     and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' Those final five \n     words are critical and clearly limit the application of the \n     amendment. Visitors who are not U.S. citizens are ``subject \n     to the jurisdiction'' of their country of origin, not the \n     United States. Furthermore, the Constitution vests control \n     over immigration law to Congress. It is past time for the \n     legislative branch to exercise its power to end birthright \n     citizenship. Eagle Forum thanks you for your leadership on \n     this critical issue and stands ready to assist you.\n           Faithfully,\n                                                 Phyllis Schlafly,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to consider my amendment No. 273.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I have to object.\n  The Senator has the right, of course, to file his amendment, but \nthere is an amendment presently pending and it would have to be set \naside. There is\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nsomeone on this side who does not want it set aside, so I will object. \nOf course, the Senator can file his amendment, but the request, as I \nunderstand it, is to set aside the pending amendment. On behalf of \nseveral Senators on this side, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Vermont if he \nopposes the amendment that was also cosponsored by Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't know who is cosponsoring the amendment.\n  Madam President, addressing the Senator through the Chair, as we are \nrequired to do by the Senate rules, I would say that my objection is to \nsetting aside the pending amendment. I would further address the \nSenator from Illinois--but through the Chair--that when the amendment \nis up, I will be glad to look at it and take a position on it. Of \ncourse, he and I have known each other for a long time. I will be happy \nto tell him whether I will vote for it or not.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I would say that this amendment is \ndirected at backpage.com, probably the largest provider of online \nslavery services in the United States. I would hope the Senator is not \ndefending Lacey and Larkin, who make $30 million a year off of slavery.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to respond to the Senator, I may very \nwell support his amendment. The technical question is, Should the \namendment of the Senator from Ohio be set aside so that this one may be \nthe one pending? On that issue, there is objection. When the Senator's \namendment is pending before the Senate, it may very well be one I will \nvote for, and I will be happy to discuss it at that time.\n  Mr. KIRK. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, this is an amendment that is directed at attacking \nbackpage.com, which stands on the principle that was well established \nin the Civil War--that we Americans have freedom and we should not be \nfree to enslave other Americans. I think, as the largest provider of \nonline slavery services, Lacey and Larkin should be put out of \nbusiness.\n  I think it is incumbent on us, in the underlying legislation--I would \nremind the Senator from Vermont that we would live up to the full \nspirit of this legislation to make sure that just because the Internet \nwas invented, slavery should not be empowered by the Internet.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KIRK. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, through the Chair, I ask my friend from \nIllinois, who has been a warrior on these issues, particularly with \nthis backpage.com and this advertisement of children and other people \ntrafficked as part of this modern day slavery, if the Senator's \namendment, the HERO Act, is actually included, if I am not mistaken.\n  Mr. KIRK. Amendment No. 273 would include the SAVE Act, which has \nalready substantially passed with huge bipartisan support of the party \nof the Senator from Vermont in the House of Representatives. If we \nlook, we will find that backpage.com is active in every State, \nproviding online services to the public.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My question and point was that the SAVE Act, I \nunderstand, is the subject of the amendment that the Senator is seeking \nto offer and for which I hope our friends on the other side will relent \nand allow us to go forward, debating and amending this important piece \nof legislation. As distinguished from the SAVE Act, which is the \nsubject of the Senator's your amendment, the HERO Act, I believe is \nalready a part of the underlying legislation. I just wanted to \ncongratulate the Senator from Illinois and thank him for his \nlongstanding dedication to this issue and the contribution he has made \nto the underlying piece of legislation.\n  Mr. KIRK. As a Senator from Illinois, our true gift to the people of \nthis country has been individual freedom and dignity, epitomized by the \nLincoln candidacy for the Senate, and by the victory in the Civil War. \nWe should not allow the freedom of the Internet to allow freedom to \nenslave others. These two men have made tens of millions of dollars.\n  I yield back to the distinguished majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would just ask the Senator to yield for one final \nquestion.\n  Would the Senator please outline his bill, his amendment, the SAVE \nAct?\n  Mr. KIRK. The critical issue is how to restrict the ability of \nAmericans to enslave each other. I don't think we should have that \nfreedom. We want to make sure we thread the needle very carefully here, \nto make sure the freedom and commerce available on the Internet is not \ngoing to help people such as Lacey and Larkin to enslave others. We \nwant to make sure that there is an ever-widening sphere of freedom \ninside the United States that is not inhibited by the Internet.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask, is the Senator's amendment targeted in a way \nthat respects the freedom of the Internet and the right of the people?\n  Mr. KIRK. Very much so. The way we thread the needle here is to make \nonline providers of slavery services liable for the costs that local \ngovernments incur in cleaning up the mess they create.\n  In the case of Cook County, IL, we have had our crusading sheriff, \nwho I would note is also a Democratic sheriff, establish a great effort \nto recover the young, underage girls involved and to make sure the \ncosts incurred in helping out these young women--these citizens of the \nUnited States--to make sure they can charge it against the online \nprovider, which makes eminent sense.\n  I would say that our freedoms are protected because Tom Dart was \nelected by the people of Cook County. As an elected official, he is \ntrying to simply carry out his goal there. This makes eminent sense to \ndo this.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KIRK. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Remembering Jonathan Myrick Daniels\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, this past weekend we saw a huge \ncommemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery voting \nrights march. I rise to honor the work and sacrifice of Jonathan Myrick \nDaniels. He was a young Episcopalian seminary student from Keene. The \nPresiding Officer certainly knows his name and Keene, as well. He was \nfrom Keene, NH, and he answered the call of Rev. Martin Luther King, \nJr., for clergy to travel to Alabama to join him on that march.\n  Jonathan lost his life 5 months later, in an act that Reverend King \ncalled ``one of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard \nin my entire ministry.'' Although Jonathan had originally intended to \nspend a short time in the South and then return to his studies at the \nEpiscopal theological school in Boston, he felt compelled by events to \nremain in Alabama through the spring and summer to register voters with \nthe Episcopalian Society for Cultural and Racial Unity.\n  On August 14, 1965, Jonathan was arrested along with a number of \nother civil rights activists at a demonstration in Fort Deposit, AL, a \nsmall town outside of Montgomery. They had gone there to protest \nsegregation in the town's stores. But their demonstration was over \nwithin minutes. Armed white men from the town descended on them and \ntook them to jail.\n  Jonathan and his fellow activists spent 6 days in the Hayneville \njail. Many in the group were still teenagers. Despite the conditions, \nJonathan somehow maintained an unflaggingly upbeat attitude and good \nhumor. He wrote his mother in New Hampshire a brief letter from the \njail, apologetically describing it as a peculiar birthday card for her. \nHe wrote:\n\n       The food is vile and we aren't allowed to bathe (whew!) . . \n     . As you can imagine, I'll have a tale or two to swap over \n     our next martini.\n\n  He declined an offer of bail money from an Episcopal organization \nbecause the amount would not have covered the release of the rest of \nhis group. On Friday, August 20, the whole group was suddenly released. \nStrangely, their bail had been waived, but no one was there to meet \nthem or take them home. The town seemed completely deserted.\n  Jonathan and a few others walked a block away to a store to buy \nsomething to eat and drink. As he climbed the steps of the porch to the \nstore, he suddenly heard someone shout from inside\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nand threaten to shoot if they didn't leave. Jonathan barely had time to \nreact before the man opened fire, but somehow he managed to jump in \nfront of his friend Ruby Sales, a 17-year-old African-American girl. He \nsaved Ruby's life, but Jonathan was killed by the close-range shot that \nwas intended for her. He was just 26 years old.\n  The shooter called the murder in to the sheriff's office himself. He \nsaid: I just shot two preachers. You better get on down here. An all-\nwhite jury later acquitted the man, taking just 2 hours to find him not \nguilty. While Jonathan was sacrificing his life for civil rights in \nAlabama, here in the Senate debate raged over the Federal Government's \nrole in protecting the voting rights of disfranchised American \ncitizens.\n  Since 1870 the 15th Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited \nState governments from denying a citizen's right to vote based on race. \nHowever, in precincts throughout the South, Black Americans were \nsubjected to discriminatory poll taxes, literacy tests, and other forms \nof voter intimidation. In many places, town clerks outright refused to \nregister Black voters.\n  Just 2 weeks before Jonathan was killed, Congress finally passed the \nVoting Rights Act, which outlawed electoral practices that \ndiscriminated against minority groups. Well, 2015 marks the 50th \nanniversary not just of that march in Selma but of this landmark law. \nWhile this anniversary presents an obvious time for reflection, it is \nalso a time to look forward and address the challenges still facing our \ncountry.\n  The impact of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. \nHolder, which struck down a critical section of the law requiring \nFederal approval for electoral law changes in districts with the \nhistory of discrimination, is particularly troubling. This ruling now \nallows States to implement restrictive voting requirements that will \nmake it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots. In fact, since \nthis ruling, almost all of the affected States have already begun \nattempts to restrict voting, targeting seniors, students, minorities, \nand threatening their access to the polls.\n  The right to make your voice heard as a citizen of this Nation is a \nfundamental principle of our democracy, and it should never be \ninfringed upon. We have a responsibility to protect this right and \naddress these injustices.\n  While our Nation has made a lot of progress since the 1960s and \n1970s, the struggle is far from over. Inequality and racism remain in \nour society. As long as discrimination and racial disparities exist, \nthe full protections of the Voting Rights Act are necessary to \nguarantee the rights of citizenship for every American.\n  Jonathan Daniels should be turning 76 years old in March. He is \nwidely recognized as a martyr of the 20th century. In Keene, his \nhometown, an elementary school bears his name. As we mark the 50th \nanniversary of his passing, as well as the passage of the Voting Rights \nAct, we must strive to honor his legacy by ensuring that all current \nand future American citizens can exercise the rights he died to \nprotect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1378-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1378-S1380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on a number of occasions I have had to \ntake to the Senate floor to note my opposition to the so-called Smarter \nSentencing Act. Does that mean I am against all sentencing reform? No. \nBut there are some issues that are particularly wrong with the \nsuggestions that have been put in bill form so far.\n  My speeches on this issue have been necessary because there are so \nmany misconceptions about that legislation and Federal drug sentences \nand prisoners. Before addressing them, I want to let my colleagues know \nthat I do believe there are some inequities in the criminal justice \nsystem, and the Judiciary Committee will be looking at ways to address \nthem. I will set out that part of the committee's agenda after \ndiscussing sentencing.\n  The Smarter Sentencing Act would arbitrarily cut in half the \nmandatory minimum sentences which are imposed on a host of serious--\nvery serious--drug offenses. Those offenses include the importation, \nmanufacture, and distribution of serious drugs, such as heroin, PCP, \nLSD, and meth.\n  As an example, the Governor of Vermont devoted an entire state of the \nState address to the heroin epidemic. The Governor of Maryland just \nlaunched an anti-heroin initiative following the near doubling of \nheroin overdose deaths in that State in the 2 years between 2011 and \n2013.\n  The Smarter Sentencing Act would cut mandatory sentences in half for \nimporting, distributing, and manufacturing heroin. It would cut the \nsentences for the same activities with respect to LSD, a drug that \ncauses psychosis and suicide. It would reduce sentences for the drug \ntrade that two of President Obama's appointees in the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and in the Justice Department have warned that the \nworld's most dangerous terrorist organizations are engaged in this \ntrade to fund their operations. It would harm the ability of \nprosecutors to obtain cooperation from lower level offenders to obtain \nintelligence regarding terrorist-planned attacks.\n  As President Obama's own U.S. attorney for the Southern District of \nNew York has warned, ``[T]here is a growing nexus between drug \ntrafficking and terrorism, a threat that increasingly poses a clear and \npresent danger to our national security.'' The threat should determine \nthe response. It would be foolhardy to meet the threat of \nnarcoterrorism by cutting drug sentences.\n  Under Federal sentencing law, those who are low-level offenders avoid \nmandatory minimum offenses. Just under half of all drug courier \noffenders were subject to mandatory minimum sentences, but fewer than \n10 percent received mandatory minimum sentences. One reason for the \ndifference is that offenders who cooperate in prosecuting high-level \ndrug conspirators avoid the mandatory minimum sentences.\n  As a Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association wrote:\n\n       [A]ny change in the mandatory minimum sentencing standard \n     does a disservice to the brave men and women who are asked to \n     put their lives on the line to protect us from terrorists and \n     criminals.\n\n  Currently, the system in place allows Federal law enforcement agents \nto infiltrate and dismantle large-scale drug trafficking organizations \nand to take violent armed career criminals off of the street. In turn, \nthis allows progression up the scale of criminal organizations from \nlow-level subjects to higher ranking members through the effect of the \nmandatory minimum sentencing act.\n  A second reason mandatory minimum sentences are not imposed on many \neligible drug couriers is the so-called safety valve. Defendants can \nqualify if they have no or a very light criminal history. That means \nthose who are convicted but are not violent do not serve mandatory \nminimum sentences.\n  The average sentence for a Federal drug courier offender is only 39 \nmonths. The offenders who qualify for the safety valve are drug \ncouriers and drug dealers. They are not people who are in prison for \nthe possession of drugs. That is because drug possession does not \ntrigger Federal mandatory minimum sentences, and it is also because, \naccording to the sentencing commission, almost no citizen is in Federal \nprison for mere drug possession.\n\n  Eighty-eight percent of the drug possession prisoners were \napprehended along the Southwest border, and the median amount of drugs \nin their possession was 48 pounds. I wish to emphasize ``48 pounds.'' \nThese, then, with 48 pounds are not low-level, casual offenders. Only \n270 mere Federal drug possession cases were brought anywhere else in \nthe country in the most recent year for which the sentencing commission \nhas statistics. And the average sentence for drug possession for \ncitizens is\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\n1.3 months. That is months, not years. Most citizens convicted of \nFederal drug possession charges receive probation.\n  The proponents of the bill say there are too many people in prison \nand that the bill would save the taxpayers money. Well, it turns out \nthat is not true. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \nbill, even while releasing hundreds of thousands of prisoners earlier \nthan under current law, would increase direct spending by about $1 \nbillion and would reduce revenues by $42 million over 10 years.\n  The supporters of the so-called Smarter Sentencing Act do not even \nattempt to contest my points in opposition--and I have made these \npoints more than once before the Senate. The supporters do not say \nthere is not a heroin epidemic. They cannot say citizens are serving \nFederal mandatory minimum sentences for possession. But they do say \nthis: Their major ploy is to paint a picture that poor, innocent, mere \ndrug possessors are crowding our prisons.\n  They do not argue that Obama administration officials did not warn of \nthe link of drug crimes to terrorism and national security threats. \nThey don't challenge the statistics from the sentencing commission or \nthe existence of the safety valve or the effect of mandatory minimum \nsentences in enhancing prosecution of very serious drug offenders. They \nwon't take on the Congressional Budget Office's cost estimates. They do \ncite CBO's discretionary cost savings of $3 billion, but, in the long \nrun, entitlement spending can be more costly because entitlement \nspending must be paid.\n  They don't do any of these because they simply can't. They are \ncommitted to a bill as a matter of ideology. The facts simply do not \nmatter to the supporters. They try to change the subject. All they can \ndo is resort to rhetoric. In fact, the supporters of that legislation \nare even Orwellian in their rhetoric. I mean that literally. George \nOrwell wrote a famous essay called ``Politics and the English \nLanguage.'' He said: ``In our time, political speech and writing are \nlargely the defense of the indefensible.''\n  The arguments for the Smarter Sentencing Act are merely a weak \nattempt to defend the indefensible.\n  What I have called the leniency industrial complex refers then to the \npeople who are sentenced to drug mandatory minimum sentences as \n``nonviolent.'' They use that term even though any truly nonviolent \noffenders would qualify for the safety valve. They gloss over the fact \nthat even if an offender was not violent in a particular case, he may \nhave committed a prior violent offense that would make him, in fact, a \nviolent person. And, of course, many drug-related crimes occur through \nforce or the threat of force, or are conducted by people in a criminal \nenterprise that relies on violence.\n  The bill's supporters even refer to some drug offenders as \n``nonviolent,'' and these people are serving mandatory minimum \nsentences for carrying a firearm in the commission of a crime. Few \nAmericans would call someone who carries a gun while committing a drug \ncrime nonviolent. And the leniency industrial complex wants people to \nthink that people who are sentenced to mandatory minimum sentences are \nsomehow low-level offenders. They neglect to mention that the true low-\nlevel offenders receive the safety valve and avoid mandatory minimum \nsentences and that many others avoid them by providing substantial \nassistance to law enforcement.\n  Many of the cases they cite involve repeat offenders. Repeat \noffenders are not low level. Lenient sentences did not stop them from \ndealing dangerous drugs, and another lenient sentence won't stop their \nnext drug deal.\n  When it comes to terms such as ``low level'' and ``nonviolent,'' \nagain quoting Orwell, the bill's supporters have their own private \ndefinition, but allow the hearer to think they mean something quite \ndifferent.\n  Their political language has to consist largely of euphemisms, \nquestion-begging, and sheer cloudy vagueness.\n  I regret to say that the elements in the media have uncritically \naccepted the Orwellian rhetoric surrounding this bill. A recent New \nYork Times editorial swallowed the ``low-level'' rhetoric whole hog. It \nchallenged my well-supported conclusion that high-level offenders would \nbenefit from enactment of the Smarter Sentencing Act, without even \nmentioning the serious crimes and drugs the bill applies to. It \neditorialized that my opposition to the bill ``defies . . . empirical \ndata,'' even though my sources are the sentencing commission and the \nObama administration appointees.\n  When the Times attempted to back up its support for the bill, it \nlinked not to any authoritative evidence but to the report of an \nideological advocacy group. This is the so-called empirical data that \nthe Times finds worthy.\n  Why should taxpayers fund the sentencing commission if the self-\nproclaimed paper of record shuns its statistics in favor of those \noffered by lobbying groups? The Times said the Federal policymakers \nshould rely on State experience in reforming sentences, so I would like \nto do that.\n  Only 270 citizens are prosecuted for drug possession in the Federal \nsystem each year, and most receive probation. The States have many drug \npossession offenders in prison, so the actions they take for that class \nof offenders do not bear on Federal prison populations, nor do the \nStates prosecute anyone for importation of heroin or LSD or meth or \ncocaine. But the Federal Government does, as my colleagues know. So \nState drug sentencing changes are not relevant to those prisoners as \nwell. And it is the Federal Government, much more than the States, that \nuses lower level offenders to take down the most serious drug \noffenders.\n  Meanwhile, I have offered to consider legislation that would lower \nsome mandatory minimum sentences if others could be imposed or raised. \nFor instance, the sentencing commission has identified child \npornography and financial crimes such as insider trading as areas where \nFederal judges are particularly lenient and where no mandatory minimum \nsentences exist. But it is the proponents of the Smarter Sentencing Act \nwho refuse to take me up on that good-faith offer. Their ideology does \nnot include compromise.\n  The White House says they want to work with this Senator on these \nissues, but then invites other Members of Congress, but not the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to a meeting to discuss the \nsubject. Since then, I have had a discussion with the President \ninviting me to come down there and visit with him some time.\n  But in the New York Times' Orwellian world, this Senator is a \nroadblock to sentencing reform. That is upside down and backward. \nProblems do exist in the criminal justice system. I plan to have the \nJudiciary Committee address some important ones. But rather than \nmarking up ill-considered and dangerous legislation such as the so-\ncalled Smarter Sentencing Act, we will take up bills that can achieve a \nlarge measure of consensus. I would like to take this opportunity to \naddress some of the committee's criminal justice agenda, which will \nshow my commitment to real problem solving through consensus. The first \narea we will address is reform of asset forfeiture.\n  Asset forfeiture can serve a valuable purpose for law enforcement and \nsociety by helping to deprive criminals and criminal organizations of \ntheir money--money from proceeds of their crimes and the \ninstrumentality of that crime. It also helps to compensate victims who \nare injured or who suffer as a result of criminals' wrongdoing. It can \nalso return that money to law enforcement, which can use it to continue \nto combat serious crime and put more bad guys behind bars.\n  But current law provides perverse incentive that have led to abuses. \nLaw enforcement can sometimes directly benefit from property that they \nseize, sometimes contrary to State law. Those whose property is taken \noften do not have access to fair procedures or law enforcement to help \nthem get that property back. These processes and procedures need real \nstructural reform. Innocent property owners must be able to challenge \nseizures and protect their property from government abuses.\n  I am also looking into reversing a Supreme Court decision that denies \nproperty owners the opportunity to use their very own money to hire a \nlawyer to help defend them against the government. Even though the \nadministration has made some administrative changes to these practices \nand policies in response to widespread criticism, I believe real \nlegislative reform is needed. I look forward to working with my\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\ncolleagues in a bipartisan way to make those necessary changes.\n  Second, as a way of looking at reform, I am very concerned that too \nmany times in America equality under the law is not a reality; that the \npoor do not receive the same justice in many instances. For more than \n50 years, the Supreme Court has ruled that indigent people accused of \nfelonies must be afforded counsel. And for more than 40 years, starting \nwith the decision of Argersinger v. Hamlin, the Supreme Court has found \nthat the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution requires that Federal, \nState, and local governments provide counsel to indigents who are \naccused of misdemeanors if their convictions could potentially lead to \nimprisonment.\n  I regret to say that although I am aware of instances where the \nFederal Government is responsible, it is particularly at the State \nlevel where the Sixth Amendment is violated numerous times on a daily \nbasis. I cannot think of any Supreme Court decision that has ever faced \nsuch resistance in magnitude and time as that Hamlin case.\n  Indigent misdemeanants are being pressured to waive counsel. \nSometimes they are threatened with imprisonment if they seek to have \ncounsel appointed. There are other ways the decision is violated. Then \nthere is the question of the competence of the counsel actually \nappointed, given how many cases are assigned to an individual lawyer \nand how quickly judges resolve them.\n  I fear some innocent people are being sentenced to prison. There are \nother consequences as well. We should make sure there are collateral \nconsequences imposed on people who are guilty of domestic violence \nmisdemeanors, for instance. We do not want collateral consequences \nimposed on people who did not actually commit misdemeanors.\n  If people later get in trouble with the law, we don't want them to \nqualify for the safety valve because some of their previous convictions \nwere for misdemeanors in which they did not receive the right to \ncounsel. We don't want people to have criminal records when they seek \nemployment when they did not have counsel who could have prevented a \nconviction.\n  In some situations, a misdemeanor will automatically become a felony \nif the accused has committed it repeatedly. We don't want a misdemeanor \nconviction to render a later crime a felony if questions of innocence \nsurround the earlier crime.\n  Third, I want to address databases for criminal records. Those \ndatabases can serve useful purposes, such as enabling background \nchecks, background checks on people who are being considered for a job \nor for volunteering to work with children. There are proposals to \nexpand the purposes for which the databases can be used, but I am \nconcerned about the quality and the completeness of the records in the \ndatabase. If the database contains erroneous or outdated material, then \nthe people being checked may unfairly lose out on a job or the ability \nto help children.\n  There are procedures at the Federal level to challenge the \ninformation in the database if the person knows their records are \ninaccurate, but that is a very steep climb. The States have their own \nprocedures for people to challenge the accuracy of criminal records, \nbut success there may be even harder and may cost more than people can \nafford. Records are also sometimes not expunged, even when the law said \nthey must be expunged.\n  I do not want to see the arrest record turn up in a background check \nand deny someone the ability to work, deny the economy the benefit of \nthat productivity, and deprive the government of tax revenue from that \nwork because a background check turned up a record of an arrest from \nlong ago that never resulted in a conviction.\n  This is a widespread problem. According to press reports, when \narrests are included, 32 percent of adults in this country have \ncriminal records that are contained in databases. I am sure we can \nreach bipartisan agreement on legislation to address this problem in \nsome form.\n  There are dangerous and poorly considered proposals to change the \ncriminal justice system that are divisive, are not based on reality, \nand will never become law. There are also problems in the criminal \njustice system that are clear, widely recognized, have serious \nconsequences, and can be the subject of effective bipartisan \nlegislative efforts. I will do what I can to make sure the Committee on \nthe Judiciary devotes its energy to the second category.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1380-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PASSENGER RAIL REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the House of Representatives recently \npassed H.R. 749, the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015.\n  I am pleased to see the House take bipartisan action on this bill. \nIntercity passenger rail is a critical part of our transportation \ninfrastructure. People in many regions of the country are in desperate \nneed of better ways to travel between fast-growing cities, and \npassenger rail is our best hope at relieving congestion on highways and \nrunways that don't have additional room to expand.\n  The House bill is a good step forward. H.R. 749 would maintain \ncurrent levels of Federal support for Amtrak to operate routes that \nconnect the country. It would also authorize some additional funding to \ninvest in passenger rail projects and improve a Federal loan program \nthat can be used for rail infrastructure. This is a productive place to \nstart.\n  The authorization levels in this bill are too low to get our \npassenger rail network where it needs to be, let alone to keep up with \nthe rest of the world by bringing high-speed rail to the United States. \nH.R. 749 also fails to address critical rail safety priorities or even \nreauthorize funding for the Federal Railroad Administration's safety \noversight activities.\n  We can and must do better than a flat-funded authorization bill that \nturns a blind eye to safety and to the growing needs of our country. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to improve \nthis bill and make some real progress toward developing modern, safe, \nand efficient passenger rail options that America deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1380-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1380-S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish today to honor Bob Hufford, \nan icon in the Missouri food industry for the past 63 years. He \nannounced his retirement from the Associated Wholesale Grocers, AWG, \nboard of directors after four decades of service with the last 11 years \nhaving served as its chairman. AWG is a retailer-owned cooperative \nserving over 2,300 retail member stores with a complete assortment of \ngrocery, fresh meat, fresh produce, specialty foods, health care, and \ngeneral merchandise items.\n  During Bob's tenure as chairman, AWG sales grew from $4.5 billion in \n2004 to almost $9 billion in 2014, while patronage paid to members grew \nby 155 percent. Bob helped direct the addition of the Fort Worth \ndivision in 2007, the replacement of the Oklahoma City distribution \ncenter in the same year, and the addition of the gulf coast division in \n2013. During the same period, Bob grew his own company, Town and \nCountry, in Fredericktown, MO, to be one of the largest employers in \nsoutheast Missouri with over 10,000 employees.\n  Bob's passion for the food business was sparked early in his life by \nhis father's work for a meatpacking company. Bob's first job was \nworking in a local supermarket, while going through high school and \nlater college. He became a sales representative for the National \nBiscuit Company, otherwise known as Nabisco, in 1958. While working for \nNabisco, Bob called on two grocers, Max Penner and Wayne Gott, who \nrecognized his leadership skills and work ethic. In 1970 they invited \nhim to become a third partner in a new 5,000-square-foot store in \nFredericktown, which Bob accepted.\n  From that modest beginning Bob grew his business to 44 stores \ncurrently operating. Recently, Bob converted his company into an \nemployee-owned company, allowing his employees to share in the store's \nprofits. Today Bob serves as the CEO of the company, which operates \nstores in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky. He and his wife \nMarsha have a wonderful family of five children, eight grandchildren, \nand two great-grandchildren. Many of his family members have worked in \nthe business next to Bob.\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\n  Bob was named Missouri grocer of the year and inducted into the \nMissouri Grocers Association Hall of Fame, along with his good friend \nand former partner Wayne Gott.\n  I ask that all my colleagues join me in congratulating Bob Hufford on \nhis decades of success. I wish him the best in his well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1381-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING AARON ANDERSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I honor the life of Aaron \nAnderson, a longtime resident of San Francisco, a passionate advocate \nfor education, a devoted and loyal friend, and most of all a dedicated \nfamily man, who passed away on February 7, 2015. He spent 25 years in \nhigher education as a learner, educator and contributor, most recently \nas an administrator and instructor at San Francisco State University's \nCollege of Business. He was 50 years old.\n  Aaron was originally from Old Saybrook, CT, and attended the \nUniversity of Connecticut, where he was captain of the men's cross \ncountry team. He began his career in higher education in student \nservices at California Polytechnic State University and University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, and went on to receive his Ph.D. in higher \neducation from the University of Michigan. He was an expert and author \nin the area of organizational behavior and change, and brought this \nexpertise to his passion for advancing education at all levels.\n  At SFSU, Aaron served as director of strategic organizational \ninitiatives, following stints as executive MBA program director and \ngraduate business programs acting director. As an instructor in \norganizational change and psychology, he inspired and fostered \ncreativity in his students and colleagues and served as a mentor to \nmany of the graduate students in his classes. His passion for education \nextended outside the classroom as well, where he found time to serve as \na Board member for Educate Our State and as President of the McKinley \nElementary School PTA.\n  In addition to the passion he brought to his profession, Aaron had a \nlove for life that could not be suppressed. He remained physically \nactive, biking wherever he went and never missing an opportunity to run \nup Mt. Tam or windsurf at Chrissy Field. He played weekly at \ntraditional Irish music sessions in Berkeley and San Francisco and was \nan avid photographer and a prolific user of social media. Most \nimportantly, however, he was deeply committed to his family, and \nembraced his early role as a stay-at-home dad.\n  Aaron will be deeply missed by all those lucky enough to have known \nhim. I send my heartfelt condolences to his loving wife, Darby \nDavenport, as well as his two sons, Clayton and Jeremy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1381-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING DR.

Mr. President, I wish to commend Dr. Murdock John \nCullinane, Jr., for his 46 years of service to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  Dr. Cullinane, who will retire this month, is Deputy Director of the \nU.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC, in Vicksburg, \nMS, a position he has held since 2010. He is culminating his public \nservice career as the second in command of one of our Nation's most \ndiverse research and development institutions. As Deputy Director, he \nhas led the ERDC program management board, which is responsible for \ndeveloping and implementing the organization's strategic mission. He \nhas earned the respect of his colleagues and others for his commitment \nto the best interests of ERDC and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Prior to becoming Deputy Director, Dr. Cullinane served as a senior \nscience technical manager and spent 9 years as the technical director \nfor ERDC's Environmental Quality and Installations business area, which \nconducts research on installation transformation, operations, and \nenvironmental issues, as well as remediation and restoration, land \nplanning, stewardship and management, threatened and endangered \nspecies, and cultural resources. He previously served as the technical \ndirector of military environmental engineering and science, as well as \nprogram manager of restoration research, a position that saw him direct \nall aspects of the Army restoration research program.\n  Dr. Cullinane has also led ERDC in several successful corporate \ninitiatives to optimize the generation of unique technical solutions \nfor a diverse customer base and to develop effective, efficient, and \nsustainable ERDC business operations and processes. He has also \nchampioned the ERDC Business Sophistication, Employee Success, Superior \nSolutions, Strategic Communication, and the Transition Stratagem, \nBESST, Initiative, a strategic framework designed to guide the \norganization into the year 2020.\n  Dr. Cullinane has had a distinguished career of exemplary service to \nthe U.S. Army and the Army Corps of Engineers.

His contributions \nare in keeping with the finest traditions of military and civilian \nservice and reflect great credit upon the Army Corps, the Army, and our \nNation.\n  I am pleased to commend Dr. Cullinane for his service and to wish him \nwell in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1381-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING NORTH DAKOTA FARM SERVICE AGENCY EMPLOYEES\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 302 U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture Farm Service Agency--FSA--staff in North \nDakota and thank them for their hard work and dedication to serving our \nState's farmers and ranchers.\n  The farm bill is perhaps the most important piece of legislation we \ncan pass for North Dakota, and I am proud to have been a part of \nwriting and passing it. But the work doesn't end when the President \nsigns the bill. In fact, that is when the real work begins for hundreds \nof FSA employees.\n  Our farmers are faced with a big decision this month, when they will \ndecide on both base acre reallocation and yield updates as well as \nelect which farm program they will participate in for the next 5 years.\n  This is a big decision for farmers, and one that will have effects on \ntheir bottom lines for the next 5 years. It is also a complicated \ndecision. The 2014 farm bill gave producers the opportunity to tailor \nfarm programs to their specific operation by choosing between revenue \nprotection--at the county or individual farm level--or price protection \ncoverage, or a combination of the two.\n  These important decisions are compounded for farmers with declining \ncommodity prices and producers facing greater economic uncertainty than \nthey have in recent years.\n  And that is why the FSA staff are so important. They held 307 \ninformational sessions attended by 15,469 individuals across our State \nthroughout the winter to update as many producers as possible on their \noptions. And they have had long days with our farmers at the local \nlevel helping folks with base reallocation, yield updates, and program \nelection. Producers recognize and appreciate their hard work and \ndedication, and I thank them for their service to our State. I have \nheard from farmers more than once that ``the ladies in the office know \nwhat they're doing and have been very helpful.''\n  I would also like to thank the North Dakota State University \nExtension Service staff for the countless hours they have put into \neducating producers about their options and walking them through how \neach program and economic scenario could affect them for the next 5 \nyears.\n  Farmers and ranchers are the backbone of my State and this country. \nIt is important that we continue to provide them with the tools and \ncertainty they need. I thank the dedicated men and women of the Farm \nService Agency who work daily to make this a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1381-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1381-5", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1381-S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nStates submitting a nomination which was referred to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1382-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1382-S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-856.

A bill to extend the principle of federalism to State drug \npolicy, provide access to medical marijuana, and enable research into \nthe medicinal properties of marijuana; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Compassionate \nAccess, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act CARERS Act. This \ncommonsense legislation would make our Federal marijuana criminal laws \nfairer and more in line with our values and ensure that medical \nmarijuana is more accessible to the millions of Americans who need it \nfor treatment purposes. I thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator \nRand Paul for joining me on this bill, and I appreciate their hard work \non this legislation.\n  The CARERS Act would clarify how the Federal Government handles \nmedical marijuana in the States. Currently, 23 States and the District \nof Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana for qualified \npatients. But the Federal Government still bans medical marijuana and \ntreats the people who use it with contempt. It is time we end this \nbackward approach toward a substance that helps treat millions of \nAmericans, including veterans, who suffer from debilitating diseases.\n  Today, the Federal Government classifies marijuana as a schedule I \ndrug, meaning it lacks a recognized medical value and it has a high \npotential for abuse. Incredibly, marijuana shares the same \nclassification with such drugs as heroin or LSD-substances that no one \ndisputes are incredibly dangerous and harmful. Schedule II is the next \ncontrolled substances category for drugs deemed to have some medical \nuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. The view that marijuana has \nno medical use whatsoever, but the methamphetamine has some medicinal \nuse is troubling and contrary to science. We can do better.\n  In 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to Federal \nprosecutors and regulators to refrain from prosecuting individuals that \nuse, purchase or sell marijuana in States where it is legal as long as \na State regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, \nsuch as a ban on sales to minors. As a result of this guidance, more \nand more States have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana.\n  Sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of Federal and State law \nto be on the same page regarding the legality of medical marijuana has \nresulted in confusion and uncertainty for State regulators and the \npublic about what the law requires. This lack of clarity is only part \nof the problem. Individual users of medical marijuana in States with \nlegalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the Drug \nEnforcement Agency. That is unacceptable and must change. Individuals \nwho use medical marijuana in States where it is legal should not fear \nprosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion. We can do better.\n  I am encouraged that the winds of change are blowing at the Federal \nlevel on whether to prosecute medical marijuana, but confusion remains. \nWhile the 2013 guidance likely trumps the prior two memorandum, what \nmessage do these documents send? Is medical marijuana legal or not? Is \nit right that the law can be changed at a moment's notice by an \nunelected Federal prosecutor? And what protection does State law afford \nmedical marijuana users when State and Federal law collide, especially \nwhen marijuana is classified by the Federal Government as a schedule I \ndrug? This legislation brings certainty and uniformity to these issues.\n  Another problem with current law is that medical marijuana operates \nlargely in the shadows because financial institutions are scared to do \nbusiness with legitimate marijuana businesses. Banks and other \nfinancial institutions are hesitant to do business with legitimate \nmarijuana businesses because they are concerned about losing their \nFederal depository insurance or facing Federal prosecution. As a \nresult, the medical marijuana industry operates largely as a cash \nbusiness which is bad for the economy and endangers public safety. \nDealing with high quantities of cash and having to transport it leaves \nthese businesses and their operatives as easy targets for criminals.\n  The current medical marijuana situation in America is untenable. It \nis unfair for the Americans that operate legitimate marijuana \nbusinesses. It is unfair to people with disabilities, including \nveterans with post-traumatic\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\nstress, traumatic brain injury or missing limbs who rely on medical \nmarijuana for treatment. It is unfair to children with intractable \nepilepsy who need cannabidiol-known as CBD-to control their seizures.\n  This issue has a real impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. \nRecently, my staff met with Jennie Stormes, a woman recently forced to \nleave my home State of New Jersey because of our restrictive medical \nmarijuana laws. Ms. Stormes' son Jackson suffers from Dravet syndrome, \na severe and debilitating form of epilepsy. Without medication, Jackson \ncan have multiple seizures in a day. This condition has affected \nJackson's development and put him through a tremendous amount of pain.\n  Jeannie Stormes and her family shared with my staff the hardships of \nliving in a State where it is hard to gain access to the medication \nJackson needs. Jackson has tried 23 different drugs in 60-plus \ndifferent combinations, but nothing worked to control his seizures. She \ntalked about how medical marijuana was the first drug that controlled \nhis seizures and changed their lives. Unfortunately, Jennie announced \nher family was moving to Colorado because it was too difficult in New \nJersey to access the medicine Jackson needed to stay alive.\n  We need this legislation to help the Jackson Stormes of the world. No \nchild in America with a debilitating disease deserves to live a life of \npain without access to the medication that he or she needs. Jennie and \nJackson's story pains me. It tells me that we have a long way to go. \nBut their story also gives me hope. It gives me hope because despite \nall the hardships they have gone through, they remain strong and \ncommitted to their cause. It is people like Jennie and Jackson who make \nour country great. It is for them that we need to continue to fight to \nmove our country forward.\n  The CARERS Act would take significant steps towards addressing the \nsituation that Jackson and Jennie went through.\n  First, the bill would end the Federal prohibition of medical \nmarijuana. Millions of Americans need to gain access to the medicine \nthat works best for them. The Federal Government's current stance on \nmedical marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. This bill \nwould prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting persons who are \nin compliance with State medical marijuana laws and let people, like \nJackson, gain access to the care they need.\n  The bill would reschedule marijuana as a schedule II drug. The Drug \nEnforcement Agency insists that medical marijuana is a fallacy. It \ninsists that marijuana is a dangerous substance and it is properly \nclassified as a schedule I drug. Doctors know that is wrong, I know \nthat is wrong, Jennie and Jackson know that is wrong. It is time we \nfinally properly classify marijuana.\n  The bill would also allow States to import CBD. CBD is an oil \nsubstance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no THC-\nmeaning you experience no high from the drug. CBD is the medicine \nJackson needs-along with thousands of other individuals with Dravet \nsyndrome-to control his seizures. We must make this important drug more \navailable so people can access the medication they need.\n  The bill would create a safe harbor for banks and financial \ninstitutions that want to do business with legal medical marijuana \nbusinesses. It is not safe that these businesses are forced to deal \nonly in cash. It is bad for our economy and it is bad for law \nenforcement. The bill would institute protections that these \ninstitutions need to feel comfortable doing business with medical \nmarijuana establishments.\n  The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is \nthat not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We \nknow there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn \nmuch more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests \nand clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how \nit can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors who \nprescribe it, the lawmakers who regulate it, and the people who need \nit.\n  Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to prescribe medical \nmarijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana. \nMany men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come \nhome with invisible wounds of war and they deserve the best care \navailable. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to \nheal or control their condition. Those who have served our country \ndeserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care \navailable.\n  I want to thank Senators Paul and Gillibrand for working on this \nlegislation with me and I urge my colleagues to work with us to help \nensure the CARERS Act is signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Perdue, Mr. Scott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Risch, Mr. \n        Boozman, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 686. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na limitation on certain aliens from claiming the earned income tax \ncredit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenator Enzi and a few other Senators to close a tax loophole that \ncould mean billions of dollars in tax benefits going to individuals \nbased on work they performed illegally in the United States.\n  The tax benefit I am referring to is the earned-income tax credit. \nThe earned-income tax credit was established as a work incentive to \nhelp move more individuals from the welfare rolls to the payrolls. The \npolicy behind the EITC is one I and many of my colleagues support as it \nis intended to foster betterment and personal responsibility by giving \nthose on the lowest rungs of the labor pool an extra incentive to jump \nin and stay in the workforce rather than rely on welfare programs.\n  It does this by providing a tax benefit to low-income individuals \nbased on the amount of earned income they have.\n  The earned income tax credit is refundable, so it benefits even those \nwho don't earn enough money to have a Federal income tax liability by \nproviding them a cash payment.\n  In 1996 Congress as a matter of policy determined that the earned \nincome tax credit should be ``denied to individuals not authorized to \nbe employed in the United States.'' That is the exact language used in \nthe title of the relevant provision that was enacted in 1996. Congress \ncarried this policy out by requiring those claiming the earned income \ntax credit to provide a Social Security number for themselves, their \nspouse, and their children.\n  From a policy perspective, this rule made a lot of sense to me and \nmany of my colleagues, as it passed both the House and the Senate with \nbroad support. Obviously, if the object of the earned income tax credit \nis to encourage work, it makes no sense to provide such an incentive to \nthose who are not legally allowed to work. Why would we want to \nencourage individuals to break our immigration laws?\n  What Congress didn't know at the time was that at an unknown future \ndate, a President, with the stroke of a pen, would essentially grant \nmillions of undocumented workers amnesty. Under the President's action, \nthose previously working illegally in the United States will be \neligible for work authorization and a Social Security number.\n  Based on an IRS interpretation of the earned income tax credit \neligibility requirements, those who obtain a Social Security number \nwill be eligible to claim the earned income tax credit not only for \nfuture years but for previous years while they were living and working \nin the United States undocumented. Based on the statute of limitations, \nthose obtaining deferred action could then go back and amend or file \nreturns for up to 3 previous tax years to take advantage of a credit \nthat can be worth several thousands of dollars each year.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Enzi will fix \nthis loophole by making it clear that those granted deferred action are \nnot eligible to claim the earned income tax credit for the years they \nworked in the United States as undocumented workers. This proposal is \nsimply an extension of current policy. Those granted deferred action \nwill still be able to claim the earned income tax credit in years going \nforward for work they perform legally. This proposal reflects the \ncommonsense proposition that American taxpayers should not subsidize\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nwork they performed illegally in the United States.\n  This bill should be a no-brainer for any of my colleagues who agree \nthat we should not reward individuals for breaking our immigration laws \nand our employment laws. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this commonsense piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 691.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Exposure to \n     Asbestos Database Act of 2015'' or the ``READ Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human \n     carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a \n     substance;\n       (2) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has \n     classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;\n       (3) despite the enactment of the Asbestos Information Act \n     of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577), which \n     sought to improve transparency and public awareness of the \n     presence of asbestos in commercial materials and products, \n     many people in the United States still incorrectly believe \n     that--\n       (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and\n       (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the \n     use of new commercial products;\n       (4) asbestos is still being imported and used, and is \n     otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and \n     industrial products in the United States;\n       (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in \n     commerce of many asbestos-containing products are not banned \n     in the United States, including--\n       (A) cement corrugated sheet;\n       (B) cement flat sheet;\n       (C) clothing;\n       (D) pipeline wrap;\n       (E) roofing felt;\n       (F) vinyl floor tile;\n       (G) cement shingle;\n       (H) millboard;\n       (I) cement pipe;\n       (J) automatic transmission components;\n       (K) clutch facings;\n       (L) friction materials;\n       (M) disc brake pads;\n       (N) drum brake linings;\n       (O) brake blocks;\n       (P) gaskets;\n       (Q) non-roofing coatings; and\n       (R) roof coatings;\n       (6) consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure, \n     and families of workers are also put at risk because of \n     asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, \n     skin, and hair of the workers;\n       (7) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many \n     as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from \n     mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;\n       (8) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress \n     that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, \n     and treat;\n       (9) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional \n     chemotherapy, and although new combination treatments for \n     mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits--\n       (A) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 \n     year after diagnosis of the disease; and\n       (B) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 \n     years of diagnosis of the disease; and\n       (10) until asbestos is completely banned from being used in \n     or imported into the United States, transparent and \n     accessible information about the location and identity of \n     asbestos and asbestos-containing products in the United \n     States is necessary to better protect consumers, workers, \n     families, and the people of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT \n                   DATABASE.\n\n       The Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; \n     Public Law 100-577) is amended--\n       (1) in section 4--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (7) as \n     paragraphs (4) through (8), respectively; and\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Asbestos-containing product.--The term `asbestos-\n     containing product' means any product (including any part) to \n     which asbestos is deliberately or knowingly added or in which \n     asbestos is deliberately used or knowingly present in any \n     concentration.'';\n       (2) in section 2, by inserting ``(referred to in this Act \n     as the `Administrator')'' after ``Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5.

Res. 99\n\n       Whereas United States citizen Robert Levinson is a retired \n     agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a \n     resident of Coral Springs, Florida, the husband of Christine \n     Levinson, and father of their seven children;\n       Whereas Robert Levinson traveled from Dubai, United Arab \n     Emirates, to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007;\n       Whereas, after traveling to Kish Island and checking into \n     the Hotel Maryam, Robert Levinson disappeared on March 9, \n     2007;\n       Whereas, in December 2007, Robert Levinson's wife, \n     Christine, traveled to Kish Island to retrace Mr. Levinson's \n     steps and met with officials of the Government of Iran who \n     pledged to help in the investigation;\n       Whereas, for more than eight years, the United States \n     Government has continually pressed the Government of Iran to \n     provide any information on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson \n     and to help ensure his prompt and safe return to his family;\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Iran promised their \n     continued assistance to the relatives of Robert Levinson \n     during the visit of the family to the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran in December 2007;\n       Whereas, in November 2010, the Levinson family received a \n     video of Mr. Levinson in captivity, representing the first \n     proof of life since his disappearance and providing some \n     initial indications that he was being held somewhere in \n     southwest Asia;\n       Whereas, in April 2011, the Levinson family received a \n     series of pictures of Mr. Levinson, which provided further \n     indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest \n     Asia;\n       Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry stated on August 28, \n     2013, ``The United States respectfully asks the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us in \n     our efforts to help U.S. citizen Robert Levinson.'';\n       Whereas, on September 28, 2013, during the first direct \n     phone conversation between the leaders of the United States \n     and Iran since 1979, President Barack Obama raised the case \n     of Robert Levinson to President of Iran Hassan Rouhani and \n     urged the President of Iran to help locate Mr. Levinson and \n     reunite him with his family;\n       Whereas, on August 29, 2014, Secretary of State Kerry again \n     stated that the United States ``respectfully request the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran work cooperatively \n     with us to find Mr. Levinson and bring him home'';\n       Whereas the United States Government is currently engaged \n     in regular, direct negotiations with the Government of Iran \n     over its nuclear program;\n       Whereas March 9, 2015, marks the 2,922nd day since Mr. \n     Levinson's disappearance, and he is now the longest held \n     United States civilian in our Nation's history; and\n       Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation has announced a \n     $5,000,000 reward for information leading to Mr. Levinson's \n     safe return: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that Robert Levinson is the longest held \n     United States civilian in our Nation's history;\n       (2) notes the pledges by current officials of the \n     Government of Iran to provide their Government's assistance \n     in the case of Robert Levinson;\n       (3) urges the Government of Iran, as a humanitarian \n     gesture, to intensify its cooperation on the case of Robert \n     Levinson and to immediately share the results of its \n     investigation into the disappearance of Robert Levinson with \n     the United States Government;\n       (4) urges the President and the allies of the United States \n     to continue to raise with officials of the Government of Iran \n     the case of Robert Levinson at every opportunity, \n     notwithstanding serious disagreements the United States \n     Government has with the Government of Iran on a broad array \n     of issues, including human rights, the nuclear program of \n     Iran, the Middle East peace process, regional stability, and \n     international terrorism; and\n       (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Robert Levinson for \n     their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be \n     brought to an end in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/10/senate-section/article/S1388-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1388-S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 273.

Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Brown) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice \nfor the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; \nas follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n         TITLE IV--PREVENTING DEMAND FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING\n\n     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``International Megan's Law \n     to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, \n     sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New \n     Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from \n     her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, her \n     attacker had been convicted previously of a sex offense \n     against a child.\n       (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104-\n     145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by \n     identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing \n     the means to monitor their activities.\n       (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child \n     Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to \n     protect children and the public at large by establishing a \n     comprehensive national system for the registration and \n     notification to the public and law enforcement officers of \n     convicted sex offenders.\n       (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex \n     offenders are traveling internationally, and that the \n     criminal background of such individuals may not be known to \n     local law enforcement prior to their arrival.\n       (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child \n     sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The \n     International Labour Organization has estimated that \n     1,800,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex \n     trafficking and pornography each year.\n       (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a \n     foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child \n     in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where \n     commercial, child sex trafficking.\n       (7) According to research conducted by The Protection \n     Project of The Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School \n     of Advanced International Studies, sex tourists from the \n     United States who target children form a significant \n     percentage of child sex tourists in some of the most \n     significant destination countries for child sex tourism.\n       (8) In order to protect children, it is essential that \n     United States law enforcement be able to identify child-sex \n     offenders in the United States who are traveling abroad and \n     child-sex offenders from other countries entering the United \n     States. Such identification requires cooperative efforts \n     between the United States and foreign governments. In \n     exchange for providing notice of child-sex offenders \n     traveling to the United States, foreign authorities will \n     expect United States authorities to provide reciprocal notice \n     of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries.\n\n     SEC. 403.
