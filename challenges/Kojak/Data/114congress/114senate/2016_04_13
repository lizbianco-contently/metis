Mr. President, whether traveling for business or \nleisure, American passengers want to feel safe and informed when \nflying. They also want to feel assured that in light of recent terror \nattacks, more is being done in our airports and in our skies. Chairman \nThune knows this, and that is why he has worked attentively with \nMembers from both sides to put forth this bipartisan FAA \nreauthorization and security bill. I appreciate his work with the \nAviation Subcommittee chair, Senator Ayotte, and their counterparts, \nSenator Nelson and Senator Cantwell, to move this important bill \nforward.\n  There are several good security measures included in the bill, such \nas increased efforts to prevent cyber security risks and efforts to \nhelp better prepare us when it comes to communicable diseases. But \nthese Senators didn't stop there; they worked to include additional \nsafety measures in an amendment that passed by a bipartisan majority.\n  Here is what we know the amendment will do: It will help prevent the \n``inside threat'' of terrorism by enhancing inspections and vetting of \nairport employees. It will require a review of perimeter security. It \nwill also improve various efforts to secure international flights \ncoming into our airports.\n  In addition to these steps designed to ramp up security, we also \nadopted an amendment from Senator Heinrich that would increase security \nin prescreening areas which could be vulnerable to terror attacks. And \nSenators Toomey and Casey have worked tirelessly to get the Senate to \npass an amendment addressing the security of cockpit doors.\n  These three amendments, put forth by Republicans and Democrats, \nemphasize the bipartisan nature of this issue and of this bipartisan \nFAA reauthorization and security bill.\n  Nearly 60 amendments from both sides were accepted in committee, and \nmore than a dozen from both sides were accepted here on the floor. I \nencourage Members to continue working across the aisle to move this \nbill forward.\n  As the chairman reminded us yesterday, this bill contains the most \ncomprehensive set of aviation security reforms in years. So let's take \nthe next step in passing this legislation and getting it one step \ncloser to becoming law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S1983-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1983-S1984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINE CATUCCI\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 40 years ago this week, Christine \nCatucci set out to spend her summer as a tour guide at the Capitol. She \nstill remembers her first day in the summer of 1976. It was a much \ndifferent time back then, without the screening protocols and \nlimitations on where visitors could go as we have today. Christine \nparked her car and walked straight up the main Rotunda steps, ready to \nwork.\n  She didn't have intentions of staying past the summer, much less for \nfour decades. But today, some 16 Sergeants at Arms and 7 Presidential \nadministrations later, Christine is still a smiling, friendly face to \nthose who enter, which is important because, as director of the Senate \nAppointment Desk, she is often the first person a visitor sees when \nvisiting the Capitol.\n  As the years have gone by, Christine's responsibilities and \nadmiration for the Senate have grown. She still considers it an honor \nand a privilege to help those visiting the Capitol, and that is true, \nshe says, ``whether it is an official business visitor or a `starry-\neyed' tourist.'' She says that she loves seeing the awe people have \nwhen they visit the Capitol and she is proud to be a part of that \nexperience.\n  The joy this institution and this career have brought to Christine \nobviously made a pretty big impact on the love of her life, her \ndaughter Nichole. Nichole works just one floor up from her mom, and in \nChristine's words, she is ``a constant reminder . . . that family comes \nfirst.''\n  Today, Christine's Senate family would like to congratulate her on \nthis notable milestone. We thank her for her four decades of steadfast \nservice, and we look forward to seeing the impact she will continue to \nmake here in the Capitol.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S1984-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We can leave here--\nit really doesn't matter what time; usually the games are at night--and \nwe can watch the Nationals play baseball. The Republican leader and I \nhave talked about this often--how much we enjoy the games--and we have \nenjoyed the games much more since this young man from Las Vegas, Bryce \nHarper, is on the baseball team, the Washington Nationals. He comes \nfrom a great family, a working family. His father was an ironworker. \nThey are a close family.\n  Prior to the Nationals even having a team here--I have been here a \nlong time--I followed the Orioles, and just as a side note, I should \nmention how happy I am for Peter Angelos, the owner, that fine man, \nthat his team is doing so well this year. They are 7 and 0.\n  So Senator McConnell and I enjoy baseball season. It gives us an \nopportunity to focus on things other than what is going on in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S1984-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINE CATUCCI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join with the Republican leader today in \nhonoring Christine Catucci on the occasion, which has already been \nmentioned, of her 40th anniversary of working for the U.S. Senate.\n  In any given year, about 2\\1/2\\ million people visit this beautiful \nbuilding. Bill Dauster, who is here with me and is with me virtually \nevery day, every place I go, was just commenting before the prayer was \ngiven how fortunate we are to work in this magnificent building. And as \nthe Republican leader mentioned in his comments about Ms. Catucci, \npeople become starry-eyed looking at this building. We are here all the \ntime, and we may not appreciate it as much as we should every day. It \nis a beautiful building.\n  For those of us who are fortunate enough to venture over to the place \nwhere she works--down on the first floor is where she spends most of \nher day, and that is where most of the people come into that floor--you \nwill see a great smile. That smile belongs to her. I first saw that \nsmile many years ago. We had a Senate retreat. She was there to help \nstaff us, and she played a vital role in making sure the retreat worked \nwell. I have always remembered her from that one experience. She does \nhave a disarming smile, for which we should all be grateful. I know I \nam.\n  She has been here for 40 years. The only person who has been here as \na Senator longer than Christine is Pat Leahy from Vermont. She has \nseniority over everybody except Senator Leahy.\n  Her career began in the last year of Gerald Ford's Presidency. She \nworked as a tour guide, chaperoning people through the Capitol and \ngiving people explanations as to what they were looking at at the time. \nIn 1980 she moved to the Office of the Doorkeeper of the Senate and \nmoved through a number of positions there for 11 years.\n  In 1991, she arrived at the Senate Appointment Desk, where she has \nworked for the last 25 years. She is the director, overseeing a staff \nof nine.\n  Over the years, she has developed a close relationship with Senators \nand staff, and she can recount with pleasure the times that Senator \nRobert Byrd--the legendary Robert Byrd from West Virginia--would invite \nher and some of her coworkers to have lunch with him in his Capitol \noffice. He didn't eat much, if anything, but he talked all the time, \ntelling stories. I was the recipient of a number of the stories of the \nlate, great Senator Byrd.\n  The Senate is her family, literally. Her father was a Senate \ndoorkeeper from 1967 to 1977. Her daughter Nichole works in the \ncloakroom right behind us. That is three generations of Senate \nstaffers.\n  It was Nichole who summed up everything great about her mother for me \nwhen she said: ``My mom raised me all by herself and did an amazing job \nas a single mom while working full-time.''\n  So this is Christine Catucci. It is her work ethic and caring \ndedication that she has brought to the Senate every day for the last 40 \nyears--four decades. Thank you very much for being a part of our Senate \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S1984-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1984-S1985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, throughout his career in the Senate, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa has styled himself as an advocate for \ntransparency in government. A number of years ago he said:\n\n       I believe in the principle of open government. Lack of \n     transparency in the public policy process leads to cynicism \n     and distrust of public officials. . . . As a matter of \n     principle, the American people need to be made aware of any \n     action that prevents a matter from being considered by their \n     elected Senators.\n\n  He reiterated his beliefs just a few days ago here in this Chamber, \nand here is what he said last week:\n\n       The principle of government transparency is one that does \n     not expire. . . . Open government is good government. And \n     Americans have a right to a government that is accountable to \n     its people.\n\n  So Senator Grassley's commitment to transparency is as shallow as the \nshallowest puddle you could find.\n  All it took was one phone call, obviously, from the Republican leader \nfor Senator Grassley to abandon any pretense of transparency and shut \nthe American people out of the Supreme Court nomination process--shut \nthem out.\n  This is the same Senator who once said, ``As a matter of principle, \nthe American people need to be made aware of any action that prevents a \nmatter from being considered by their elected Senators.''\n  Nothing that Senator Grassley has done with respect to the Supreme \nCourt vacancy meets his own standard for transparency.\n  There was no transparency when the Judiciary Committee chairman and \nhis Republican committee members shut Democrats out and met with the \nRepublican leader behind closed doors. There was no transparency when \nhe twisted the arms of his own committee members to sign a loyalty \noath, again behind closed doors. There was no transparency when he \nsought to move a public committee meeting behind closed doors just to \navoid talking about the Supreme Court nomination. And there was \ncertainly no transparency on Tuesday--yesterday--when at 8 o'clock in \nthe morning he met downstairs with Judge Merrick Garland in the private \nSenate Dining Room moments before slipping out the back door to avoid \nreporters. This is how CNN reported it: ``The Iowa Senator left the \nhigh-profile but out-of-sight meeting via a backdoor that leads to his \nprivate `hideaway.' ''\n\n  One television station in Iowa put it this way: ``Grassley evaded \nreporters.''\n  This is the same Senator who once supported cameras in Federal \ncourtrooms, including the Supreme Court. Why? To increase transparency, \nso he said. But Senator Grassley only wants transparency to apply to \nothers, I guess not to himself. When it comes to transparency, his \nattitude is strictly: ``Do as I say, not as I do.''\n  He won't even apply a degree of that same openness as he blocks a \nnominee to the highest Court in the land. There will be no transparency \nif Senator Grassley fails to call an open hearing where Chief Justice \nGarland can present himself to the American people.\n  I have had people ask me: Why wouldn't there be a hearing? Well, it \nis obvious. They are all afraid. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is afraid that this good man, if the American people see him, \nwill understand why he is a nomination that couldn't be better. They \nare afraid to allow this man to be seen by the American public. Talking \nabout transparency, there won't be any if the Republican Senators \naren't going to be able to even have a vote on the nomination.\n  All of this that has been going on is not like the Senator Grassley \nwho I have served with for more than three decades. By carrying out the \npresent leader's failed strategy to undermine\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\nthis Court, the Senator from Iowa is undermining years of his own hard \nwork in pushing for more open government. All that he has done talking \nabout transparency is gone.\n  Senator Grassley should take his own medicine and stop retreating \nbehind closed doors with private conversations that shut the American \npeople out of the important confirmation process. If the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa truly believes in transparency, he should simply do his job \nand give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote.\n  Mr. President, there appears to be no one seeking the floor.

Mr. President, I rise in support of designating the \nShreveport Federal Building as the ``Tom Stagg Federal Building and \nUnited States Courthouse.'' The Honorable Thomas or ``Tom'' Eaton \nStagg, Jr., of Shreveport passed away last June. He was an \ninspirational figure.\n  He graduated from Byrd High School in Shreveport and joined the U.S. \nArmy preparing for World War II. He rose to the rank of captain, \nearning the Combat Infantryman Badge, a Bronze Star for valor, another \nBronze Star for meritorious service, the Purple Heart with oak leaf \ncluster.\n  At one point, he was saved from death when a German bullet was \nstopped by a Bible he carried in his pocket. It was as if he was fated \nto live. After World War II, Tom attended Cambridge and then LSU Law \nCenter and then served in private practice.\n  Tom's reputation was described as a combination of ``intelligence, \nspirit, patriotism, wisdom and wit'' and resulted in his nomination to \nserve on the Federal bench for the Western District of Louisiana in \n1974. He was named chief judge in 1984, a position he held until 1991. \nMany testimonials, one of which a close colleague said of Judge Stagg:\n\n       Without a doubt he was the finest trial judge I have ever \n     met. Without ever knowing it, he had served as my silent \n     mentor, a role model. . . . To have served the job with Judge \n     Tom Staff on the federal bench for 12 years is a singular \n     honor. A giant has fallen . . . this remarkable man left a \n     legacy of love of family, of duty and honor and love of this \n     nation, its judicial system and the rule of law.\n\n  The colleague continues:\n\n       Tom Stagg loved being a federal judge. We will all miss \n     him.\n\n  Judge Stagg assumed senior status on the court in 1992, but he didn't \nretire. He maintained a full caseload, serving on Federal circuit \ncourts of appeals panels. Judge Stagg loved being a judge, but his love \nfor the job also came second after his love for his family. Judge Stagg \nmarried the former Mary Margaret O'Brien in 1946 and is survived by her \nand their two grandchildren, Julie and Margaret Mary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly to the legislation \nbefore us, the FAA reauthorization.\n  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which I \nchair, was instrumental in bringing this bill to the floor. Our \ncommittee has a long and proud history of bipartisan cooperation on \nimportant matters under its jurisdiction. This extends to the bill \nbefore us today, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization \nAct of 2016, which I, along with my colleagues, introduced and marked \nup in front of our committee.\n  The legislation before us today includes the most passenger-friendly \nprovisions, the most significant aviation safety reforms, and the most \ncomprehensive aviation security enhancements of any FAA reauthorization \nin recent history. This bill helps passengers and Americans who use the \nnational airspace for many different transportation needs.\n  For example, since the last reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration in 2012, the use of drones has increased dramatically. \nAccording to its most recent aerospace forecast, the FAA estimates that \nannual sales of both commercial and hobby unmanned aircraft could be \n2.5 million in 2016--a number they estimate may increase to 7 million \nunits annually by 2020. But the FAA has an outdated legislative \nframework being used to shape the use of this rapidly growing \ntechnology for both hobbyists and commercial operators. This is slowing \ndown innovation and advancements in safety. Our bill gives the FAA new \nauthority to enforce safe drone usage. This includes efforts to make \nsure drone users know and follow basic rules of the sky to avoid \ndangerous situations.\n  To support job growth in the aerospace industry, our legislation \nreforms the process the FAA uses for approving new aircraft designs. \nOur goal is to shorten the time it takes for U.S. aerospace innovations \nto go from design boards to international markets while maintaining \nsafety standards.\n  For the general aviation community, we are also streamlining redtape \nand adding safety enhancements for small aircraft by including \nprovisions from the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2.\n  Finally, we increase authorized funding for the Airport Improvement \nProgram, which pays for infrastructure like runways, by $400 million \nwith existing surplus funds. This allows us to help meet pressing \nconstruction needs without raising taxes or fees on the traveling \npublic.\n  We developed this bill through a robust and open process that allowed \nevery member of the Commerce Committee to help guide the content of \nthis critical aviation legislation. Last year the Commerce Committee \nheld six hearings on topics that helped inform our legislation. At the \ncommittee markup last month, we accepted 57 amendments, 34 of which \nwere sponsored by Democrats and 23 of which were sponsored by \nRepublicans.\n  Since debate began on the bill last week, we have successfully \nincluded an additional 19 amendments here on the floor of the Senate. \nTen of these amendments are sponsored by Democrats and nine by \nRepublicans.\n  This bill deserves the Senate's support. I urge Members to remember \nall of the important improvements this legislation puts in place for \naviation security, consumer protection efforts, American innovation, \nsafety, and job\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\ncreation. I hope we will be able to send this bill to the House soon. \nWe are on a pathway that will enable us to do that. As I mentioned \nbefore, we have had a number of amendments that have been disposed of, \nprocessed here on the floor already. Nineteen amendments have been \nadded to the bill since it came to the floor, in addition to the 57 we \nadopted at the committee level.\n  I want to credit the hard work that has been done by the staffs on \nboth sides. The Commerce Committee staff obviously has been very \ninvolved on the majority side as well as the minority side in helping \nto shape this as it came out of the committee and to the floor. Lots of \nhours were put into getting us to where we are today. I think where we \nare is we have a bipartisan bill which has been broadly supported \ncoming out of the committee, which has numerous safety enhancements in \nit--the most we have seen in a decade--and a bill which is worthy of \nall Senators' support.\n  Having said that, there are other amendments that have been filed. I \nam not sure what the number is today, but we had 198 amendments filed \nto the bill, and we are continuing to work with the sponsors of those \namendments to try to get additional amendments adopted. We obviously \nhave to have cooperation from Members on both sides in order for that \nto happen. We have a list of another 10 or a dozen amendments we think \ncould be cleared and could be added to the legislation, but we are \ngoing to need Members who currently have holds on that process to lift \nthose holds.\n  We are on a glidepath to getting this bill to votes coming up \ntomorrow, so we have today and perhaps part of tomorrow in which to \nprocess additional amendments. I hope Members will decide to work with \nus. We think this bill has obviously been very well vetted. As I said, \nit was debated heavily at the committee level, and we have now had \nopportunities to offer amendments on the floor. But there are always \nways in which it can be improved. There are a lot of worthy amendments \nthat Members have interest in adding to this legislation, some of which \nare germane to the legislation, some of which are not. Obviously, once \nwe get to cloture on the bill, only those amendments that are germane \nwill be able to be voted on, but we would like to get other amendments \nprocessed.\n  So what I am saying is that throughout the day today, if Members will \nwork with us, and for those who currently have holds on that process \nmoving forward, if you would lift those, it will enable us to process a \nlot of amendments Senators are interested in having added to the bill.\n  We will continue throughout the day to negotiate with Members and \nhopefully have an additional list of amendments that we can adopt. I \nwould say again that my colleague, the ranking Democrat on the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Nelson and I have worked very carefully throughout \nthis process to make sure it is an open process and incorporates the \nbest ideas from both sides. Today we have in front of us a bill which I \nthink does that, and that is the reason I think it is very worthy of \nour Members' support.\n  We have had a lot of participation. Members of our committee on both \nsides have had ample opportunities to get amendments considered and \nvoted on, 57 of which were adopted during the committee deliberations \non this. It is the product of a lot of work.\n  I think we are at a place that when we report this out, it is a \nproduct we can be proud of, and we can send it to the House of \nRepresentatives in hopes that they will pick it up or, if they decide \nto pass their own version of this legislation, meet us in conference \nwhere we can work out the differences but get these important safety \nmeasures--these important measures that will support jobs and \ninnovation in our economy--onto the President's desk where they can be \nsigned into law and can be implemented and put into effect.\n  That is where we are at the moment. Again, I thank all of our \ncolleagues for their cooperation to date and hope that we can see more \nof that moving forward because it will enable us, in my view, to \ncontinue to strengthen this bill before it gets to its ultimate \npassage, which I hope will be sometime later this week. We have been on \nit now for a couple of weeks, and it is time to get it off the floor, \nget it to the House, and, hopefully, eventually onto the President's \ndesk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, as I traveled all over Oklahoma during \nthe State work weeks in March, I heard the concerns over and over from \nfamilies in my State about terrorism. I talked with a gentleman in \nCoalgate, OK, who absolutely could not understand how the United States \ncould release $1 billion to Iran the same month that rural hospitals \nacross our State and across America were facing new cuts from CMS in \nnew criteria there. That $1 billion that was sent by the United States \nto Iran could have bailed out every single rural hospital in America.\n  I talked to a mom in Lawton who did not understand why there was a \nconversation in DC about closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility \nand bringing those individuals into the United States.\n  I talked to a dad in Tulsa, a dad of a soldier, who wanted to know \nwhat is happening with terrorism and what is America's response.\n  I talked to an Oklahoma business owner who is very concerned about \ncyber security and the threat of foreign governments attacking his \nnetwork and other networks and businesses around the country.\n  As details come out about what happened in Brussels in that terrorist \nattack, every American has their security and their family in mind. I \ncontinue to pray for the victims of those awful attacks and work to \ndetermine the best way our great Nation can confront this threat.\n  As the only Member of this body who serves on both the Homeland \nSecurity and the Intelligence Committees, I have the privilege to \nensure that Oklahomans and Americans have a strong voice in the \ndiscussion over our Nation's national security priorities. There is no \nsimple solution, though, and there is no single method to confront \nterrorism. But we must be absolutely clear that terrorists will find no \nquarter in the land of the free, in the home of the brave.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I walk behind a \nheavy door several times a week to hear the sobering details about \nforeign threats and the amazing work that Americans do to confront \nthem. I wish we could talk about all those things here because I \nbelieve Americans would be very proud of the work that is going on.\n  We can talk about disrupted terrorist plots and insight into \nadversaries' plans that allow us to adjust and to prepare and to \nconfront those terrorists before they bring the fight here. There are \nhard questions behind those closed doors. Oversight should be expected, \nand open discussions should be expected.\n  Let me say today how incredibly grateful I am for the people in the \nintelligence community who work hard every single day. Members of our \nmilitary and members of law enforcement around the country wear \nuniforms, and we get a chance to say thank you to them personally when \nwe see them. But members of the intelligence community are patriotic \nAmericans who are working to protect their families and our families \nevery day. We don't get to say thank you to them because we don't know \nwho they are. But let me say thank you to them today from our country.\n  Right now, members of radical Islamic groups around the world are \ncalling out on social media, through encrypted messages and in public \nforums around the world, for the small minority of Muslims who believe \nas they do and who believe in their hate-filled doomsday mission. They \ntell people that if they believe as they do, they should kill as they \ndo. ISIS is enraged by our views about free speech, freedom of \nreligion, girls attending school, equal pay, equal opportunity, and \neven voting in elections. It is almost impossible for Americans to \nimagine their hatred for the modern world and for freedom and basic \nhuman rights.\n  How do you win against an enemy like that? You confront them is how \nyou do it, not ignore them. You deal with their ideology that spreads \nlike a cancer around social media platforms around the world.\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\n  Some people say poverty and lack of education creates radicalism. \nThere are billions of people in the world who live in poverty, and most \nof them do not practice this particular form of radical Islam. The \nshooters in San Bernardino, CA, weren't living in poverty or lacking in \neducation. The killers in Paris and Brussels were not isolated and \npoor. While refugees and isolated communities in poverty are \nundoubtedly breeding grounds for anger and frustration, that is not the \nprimary cancer of terrorism. There are millions of people living as \nrefugees in the world right now who are not extremists. They are not \nterrorists; they just want peace so they can go home and have a normal \nlife again.\n  We do have a moral and national security obligation to help the \nvulnerable when we can. The refugee crisis is immense, and it is \naffecting millions worldwide. Many countries are at the brink, and we \nneed to stay engaged. But America has already given billions of dollars \nin aid. No country--no country has done more for the refugees than the \nUnited States. Our logistics, our support, and our financial aid have \nsustained most of the refugee communities there either through direct \naid or what we are doing through the United Nations right now. But the \npeople living as refugees need access to education and training so \ntheir children will grow up with skills and opportunity. We can help \nthem have a second chance. But that is not the primary source.\n\n  We need to engage with religious leaders around the world. We cannot \nand we will not define faith for them, but we can challenge any faith \nthat promotes the death of people because of their race, their belief, \nor their gender. We should work to shut off terrorists' financing \naround the world, their illegal energy trade, their drug trafficking, \ntheir extortions, and persons in wealthy countries who send money with \nthe implicit promise that those terrorists will not bring terrorism to \ntheir country if only they will send them money to do terrorism in \nother places.\n  We must also fight and confront those individuals militarily. We must \nlearn the lesson of 9/11. They are not just a group of radical thugs \nover there who we can ignore. They hate us, and they will find every \nway possible to attack us here and to attack our allies. No one wants \nwar, but we cannot stand by and watch terrorists beheading Egyptian \nChristians on the beaches of Libya, killing Shia Muslims because of \ntheir faith in Iraq, blowing themselves up in an airport in Brussels, \nshooting people at a rock concert or a synagogue in Paris or just \npeople enjoying a party at work in California. We can't put our heads \nin the sand and ignore what is really happening and assume it will just \ngo away if we do nothing.\n  As long as they hold territory, they call out to people worldwide to \ncome join them in their caliphate to come fight for them or to fight \nwhere they are. We are Americans. We lose track of that at times, I am \nafraid. No one in the world has the same logistical capability as the \nUnited States of America. No one in the world has the most moral, most \npowerful military in the world like the United States of America. No \none has our intelligence capability. No one in the world has our Tax \nCode planning capability. So the whole world is waiting on America to \ndecide what we are going to do so they can decide if they are going to \njoin us in this fight against this radical Islamic terrorism. It is not \nabout massive troops on the ground; it is about a clear plan and a \nclear strategy to carry it out. It is why the Russians currently look \nmore mobile and more capable than us all of a sudden.\n  So the ``now what'' question rises large in this body.\n  No. 1, there are multiple proposals in State and foreign operations \nfor how we can engage in peaceful activities: helping refugees, helping \nthose in poverty, helping to bring education to places, helping engage \ndiplomatically with religious leaders around the world and with other \ncountries to deal with terrorist financing. Those are things we could \nand should do and should do more aggressively.\n  No. 2, the national defense authorization is coming, and it is coming \nsoon. We need to give great military clarity--not only rules of \nengagement in the battlefield, but what is the clear purpose militarily \nfor the United States in this battle against radical Islam?\n  No. 3 is tougher for this Nation, apparently: Believe and understand \nthat Iran is one of the key areas in this fight. I believe this \nadministration has been too eager to believe good news about Iran and \nis ignoring the concerns that many of us hold. I have stood here \nseveral times in the past year to speak out against the President's \nreckless nuclear deal with the Iranian Ayatollah. I didn't like it \nthen, I still don't like it, and I still don't believe Iran can be \ntrusted to be able to carry out its end of bargain.\n  I recently authored a resolution that clearly outlines to the \nadministration how the United States should respond if Iran--and I \nbelieve when Iran--breaches the nuclear agreement. We should reapply \nwaived sanctions and U.N. Security Council resolutions and limit Iran's \nability to import defensive equipment so they can stop fortifying their \nnuclear capabilities over the next 10 years. When all the enrichment \nlimitations are lifted, they will be well prepared to defend those \nfacilities they have now created.\n  As I have said many times, until Iran proves it is a peaceful, \nresponsible player in the Middle East, the international community must \nbe vigilant in pushing back against Iran's harmful and destructive \ninfluence among its neighbors.\n  Last week I spoke with Adam Szubin, Acting Under Secretary of the \nTreasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, and he \ncommunicated to me exactly what everyone already knows and fears--that \nIran has become even more of a destabilizing factor in the region after \nthe nuclear deal was signed.\n  This is clearly evident in Iran's continued, unabashed support for \nterrorism and terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, their propping \nup of the Assad regime in Syria--a government that continues to blow up \nits own people and butcher its own people--and Iran's shipments of \nweapons to rebels in Yemen to be able to fuel their civil war there, \nright on Saudi Arabia's southern border.\n  We haven't even discussed Iran's testing of ballistic missiles in \ndirect violation of international law. If Iran can't be trusted to \nuphold the law now, how can it be trusted to be able to uphold some \nagreement which it hasn't even signed? That is the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action.\n  Congressionally imposed sanctions on Iran is what brought the \nAyatollah to the negotiating table. Let's be honest about this. \nRegardless of what some people may say about the momentum of the \nmoderates and the reformists inside of Iran, Iran's foreign policy, \nespecially in dealing with the United States, runs through the \nAyatollah Khamenei. He has made it crystal clear that his regime is \nbuilt on radical Islamist views, and this particular view of Shia \nIslam--though it is opposed to ISIS--is supportive of spreading their \nviews around the world. It is absolutely anti-American.\n  It is essential that the Treasury continue to completely shut down \nIran's access to the U.S. dollar, and it is essential that Treasury \nrigorously enforce the still-standing human rights and terrorism-\nrelated sanctions on Iran.\n  I spoke with DNI Clapper in this administration just a few weeks ago. \nWhen I asked the Director of National Intelligence if there has been \nany change in Iran's focus on being the largest state sponsor of \nterrorism in the world, this administration's Director of National \nIntelligence said there has been no change in Iran's behavior since the \nnuclear deal was signed in relation to terrorism.\n  We should not release known terrorists or bring them to U.S. soil. I \ncan't believe I have to even raise this as an issue in this Nation. We \nshould keep Guantanamo Bay, known as Gitmo--that detention facility--\nopen and operational rather than releasing known terrorists back into \nthe battlefield or bringing them to the United States.\n  In this era of growing threats, why would we irresponsibly release \nthese individuals? Senator Kirk and I, along with four other members of \nthis body, introduced a bill last week to prohibit the President from \ntransferring terrorists detained in Guantanamo Bay to any other state \nwhere they may go and actually sponsor terrorism. It is not a hard \ndecision; it is common sense.\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\n  Our bill is very clear: If those individuals are transferred out of \nGuantanamo to some other state and then they later commit some act of \nterrorism, that state's foreign aid is cut off. The expectation is if \nthese individuals go to that location, that location is actually going \nto monitor them. Americans assume that at this point, but it is not \nhappening.\n\n  Senator Inhofe and I will introduce a bill later today which \nprohibits the transfer to the United States or release of terrorists \nheld in Guantanamo Bay. It also goes further than what we do with \nSenator Kirk's bill, and it actually prohibits the President from \nclosing the facility entirely. The President should not risk our \nNation's national security just to fulfill some campaign promise that \nmakes absolutely no sense and puts our country at risk.\n  The executive branch occasionally laments congressional engagement in \nforeign policy, but this is the way the American people speak out \nbecause the people in Oklahoma are absolutely concerned about what is \nhappening in national security and they want this administration to \nhear it loud and clear. There seems to be no clear plan, and the plans \nthat are clear seem to weaken our resolve on national security.\n  Today I simply ask my colleagues to join me and do what the people \nwho we represent sent us here to do--to assume the mantle of \nresponsibility as leaders and to show them that we are not afraid to \nwork with this administration or any administration. We need to take \nresponsibility for setting the Nation's national security agenda. It \nmust be done.\n  It can't be done just militarily. It must be done in a broad method \nby reaching out, not only strategically and diplomatically through our \nState Department but also militarily with a clear focus to make sure we \nprotect the Nation and that we don't release terrorists and actually do \nwhat we are supposed to do--guard this Nation's security.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if we ask most Americans: What is the \ndifference between a for-profit college and university and a not-for-\nprofit college and university, a private university, most of them would \nsay: I am not sure I can tell you.\n  Well, certainly for-profit, by definition, is a business. It is \nprimarily a business that generates a profit for the company if it is \nsuccessful. It pays for the salaries and compensation of those who work \nfor the company, and if there are shareholders, it tries to increase \nthe value of shares and maybe even pay a dividend.\n  The others--the not-for-profits--by definition don't do that, and \nmost private universities are not for profit. Examples: University of \nIllinois, a public university, the University of Maryland. Private \nuniversities: Georgetown University, George Washington University. For-\nprofit universities: The University of Phoenix--people have probably \nheard of it--DeVry University out of Chicago, IL; ITT Tech; Kaplan, \nthese are for-profit colleges and universities. Are they different? \nThey are dramatically different.\n  Let me give my colleagues three numbers that define the difference \nbetween for-profit colleges and universities and all the others. Here \nare the numbers: Ten percent of all of college students in America go \nto for-profit colleges and universities, like the University of \nPhoenix. These, many times online, universities including Kaplan and \nDeVry, 10 percent of the students go to them.\n  Twenty percent of all of the Federal aid to education goes to for-\nprofit colleges and universities. Why is it twice as much as the \npercentage of students? They are darned expensive. They have tuition \nthat is usually much more costly than other colleges and universities.\n  So that is 10 percent of the students, 20 percent of the Federal aid \nto education, and the next number is 40. Forty percent of all the \nstudent loan defaults in the United States of America are students \nattending for-profit colleges and universities--10 percent of the \nstudents, 40 percent of the student loan defaults. Why? The answer is \nobvious. They are very expensive and the education they provide often \nisn't worth much.\n  Students who enroll and start courses at for-profit colleges and \nuniversities get in over their heads and drop out--the worst possible \noutcome. Now they are deep in debt with no degree, and they default on \ntheir loan. Some finish, and for many of them, it is even worse. After \nthey have stacked up all of this debt, they graduate from a for-profit \ncollege and university and find out the diploma is worthless. That is \nthe reality of higher education in America today.\n  For quite a long time I have come to the Senate floor and talked \nabout these for-profit colleges and universities. I got into this by \nmeeting a young woman from a southern suburb of Cook County. She went \nto a place called Westwood College, a for-profit college and university \nbased out of Colorado. She had been watching all of these CSI shows and \nthe rest of them. She was just caught up in law enforcement. She wanted \nto get into law enforcement. So she enrolled at this for-profit \ncollege--Westwood--and started attending classes. Well, it turned out \nto be expensive, and then it turned out to be a disaster.\n  Five years later, she graduated and received her diploma from \nWestwood. She took the diploma to police departments and sheriffs' \noffices all around the region and they looked at her and said: Sorry, \nbut that is not a real university. You have gone to school there for 5 \nyears, and I know you have the diploma, but we don't recognize \nWestwood. Westwood College is not a real university.\n  So she found out her diploma was worthless, she couldn't get a job, \nbut here is the worst part: At that point, she had $95,000 in student \ndebt--$95,000 in debt--and a worthless diploma. Where do you turn?\n  Well, let me tell you what happened to her. She moved back in with \nher parents, living in the basement. Her dad came out of retirement, \ntook a job to try to help her pay off her student loans at Westwood, \nand she started to think about: How do I go to a real school now--a \ncommunity college or something--so I can get an education. She wasted 5 \nyears of her life, and her decisions from that point forward will \nreflect the fact that she had this terrible experience.\n  There are things which these for-profit colleges and universities do \nwhich other universities wouldn't do. I want to talk about one of them \ntoday. The abuses of this industry are clear. Hundreds of thousands of \nstudents have been deceived, misled, and harassed into enrolling in \nthese schools where they end up with a mountain of debt and a worthless \ndiploma. Every day seems to bring news about another for-profit college \nscam, and I have been giving these speeches for a while, and it keeps \nunfolding day after day. Here is the latest: the complaint the attorney \ngeneral of Massachusetts filed recently against ITT Tech for abusive \nrecruitment tactics. I know this ITT Tech because in my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, at White Oaks Mall, they have a big sign. They look \nlike the real thing, but when Massachusetts took a look at their \nrecruiting tactics, it turned out they were lying to the students. You \nsee, they need to lure in students to sign up at ITT Tech, they make \npromises they can't keep, and many times they lure in students who are \nnot ready for college. Why do they do that? Because the minute a low-\nincome student signs up at ITT Tech, the Pell grant, which goes to low-\nincome college students, flows through the student to ITT Tech. There \nis $5,800 just for being low income and signing up, not to mention what \nfollows--the college student loans.\n  If a student is lucky--if they are lucky--the for-profit college will \nlead them to the college loans originated by the government. Those are \nmore reasonable. If they are unlucky, they get steered by these for-\nprofit colleges to private loans with dramatically higher interest \nrates and terms which are not the least bit forgiving.\n  We say to ourselves: These students ought to know better. Well, how \nsmart were you when it came to the ways of the world when you were 19 \nyears old?\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nHow much did you know about borrowing $10,000 when you were 19 or 20 \nyears old, when they shoved across the desk a stack of papers and said: \nIf you will sign these for your loan, you will be able to start classes \nMonday. You know what happens. The students sign up. They have been \ntold their whole lives: This is what you need to do. When you finish \nhigh school, you go to college.\n  Here is another part of it that is very important. Right now, the \nDepartment of Education is working on new Federal regulations so that \nwhen the students go to these for-profit schools--or any school for \nthat matter--and the school engages in unfair, deceptive, or abusive \nconduct, there is some protection. The Department has set up a \nrulemaking, but because the negotiations with outside stakeholders \nhaven't reached a consensus, they are still working on the rule.\n  Let me talk about one issue that I think is critical that is under \nconsideration by the Department of Education when it comes to these \nfor-profit colleges: mandatory arbitration clauses. You are going to \nfind at for-profit colleges--and at virtually no other college--a \nlittle paragraph stuck in that enrollment agreement, stuck in your \nenrollment contract, which says that if you have any grievance with \nthat for-profit school, if you think they deceived you, defrauded you, \nlied to you, if you think that you got in debt for a promised degree \nthat was going to lead to a job, you can't plead your case in court \nafter you sign this agreement.\n  You have to go to mandatory arbitration. Mandatory arbitration, for \nthose not familiar with it, is a closed-door process. The company or \nschool, in this case, sets standards about who will decide your fate \nand about what of anything that happened to you ever becomes public. \nWhy do the for-profit schools do this? They don't want to be taken to \ncourt--no company does. They certainly don't want to face a class \naction lawsuit by students who have been defrauded by these for-profit \nschools, and they certainly don't want the Department of Education to \nknow that a certain number of students of for-profit schools have a \ngrievance about the way they were treated. So they have come up with a \nmandatory arbitration clause in documents a student has to sign to go \nto class. Students by and large don't even see them. They are buried in \nthe document. If they did see them, they would find it hard to even \nexplain. These clauses require students to give up their right to a day \nin court. It means, for example, that if a student is misled or \ndeceived by the school's advertising or Web site and the student goes \ninto debt and then can't find a job or can't qualify for a job that \nthey promised you could, the student doesn't get a day in court. \nInstead, the student is forced into the secret arbitration proceeding \nwhere the deck is stacked against them. It allows schools to avoid \naccountability for misconduct. It prevents prospective students from \nknowing that there were an awful lot of other students at the same \nschool that had the same bad experience.\n  It is fine for schools to give students the choice of arbitration, \nbut to say it is mandatory and that you have no other choice is wrong. \nMandatory arbitration clauses are not used by legitimate not-for-profit \ncolleges and universities. Not-for-profit colleges, public and private, \nare comfortable with being held accountable to the students. They don't \nrequire mandatory arbitration in order for the students to sign up for \nclasses. The Association of Public Land Grant Universities, the \nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the \nAssociation of Community College Trustees, and the American Association \nof Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers all confirmed what I \njust said. Unfortunately, mandatory arbitration clauses are a hallmark \nof the for-profit industry, used by nearly all major companies--DeVry, \nthe University of Phoenix, and ITT Tech, just to name a few.\n  These same clauses were used by a for-profit school called \nCorinthian, which went bankrupt. What happens when a for-profit college \ngoes bankrupt? They have received the money through the student from \nthe Federal Government. They have received all those Pell grants. They \nhave received the money for government loans, and now they are \nofficially out of business.\n  Where does that leave the student if the school closes? Well, we give \nthem a pretty tough choice. The first choice is to keep the credit \nhours they earned at the for-profit school and transfer to another \nschool--too often another for-profit. Is that worth the effort? Well, \nthe student has to decide or drop those credit hours of the for-profit \nschool and get what is called a closed school discharge. You don't have \nto pay it back. Who loses in that deal? The taxpayers. The taxpayers \nwho have sent thousands of dollars to these worthless for-profit \nschools.\n  I am hoping the Department of Education will promulgate a rule that \nprotects students and their families when it comes to these for-profit \nschools. There is one last thing I want to say about college loans, and \nit probably is the most important. If someone borrows money for a car \nor a home or a piece of property somewhere or to buy some goods and \nthen they fall on hard times--somebody in the family gets sick, there \nare big medical bills, someone loses a job, or there is a divorce--and \nthey are forced into bankruptcy court to clear their debts, they are \ngoing to find out if they have a student loan, they can't discharge a \nstudent loan in bankruptcy. It means, frankly, that it is with them for \na lifetime. When grandma decides to cosign her granddaughter's college \nloan and her granddaughter defaults on the loan, the collection agency \ncalls her grandmother. We have cases that have been reported where \ngrandmothers have their Social Security checks basically garnished to \npay off the granddaughter's student loan. It is a debt, frankly, that \nwill be with them for a lifetime. That is why this conversation is so \nimportant.\n  A few years ago, the for-profit colleges and universities ended up \nwith the same treatment as every other college and university, and \nthey, too, when it comes to student debt, have their investment \nprotected because the student cannot discharge it in bankruptcy.\n  This Senator thinks the Department of Education has the authority to \nclean this up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na legal analysis put together by Public Citizen outlining the authority \nthe Department of Education has to ban mandatory arbitration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2016.\n     Dr. John B.

This \n     aid, which includes Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans, as \n     well as Pell grants, is the largest stream of federal \n     postsecondary education funding.\n       While profiting from U.S. taxpayers, some predatory \n     schools--particularly in the for-profit education sector--\n     target underserved populations of students, including people \n     of color, low-income individuals, and veterans, with \n     fraudulent recruitment practices. These schools provide \n     students with an education far inferior to what has been \n     promised. They offer low quality programs and faculty, \n     provide few if any student-support services, and have abysmal \n     graduation and job-placement rates. Many students drop out \n     once they realize the extent of a school's \n     misrepresentations. Those who do not may find themselves with \n     a worthless degree. In either case, the school's wrongdoing \n     leaves many students with a debt to the federal government \n     that they cannot repay.\n       Unfortunately, the courthouse doors are closed to many of \n     these students because they signed mandatory, pre-dispute \n     arbitration agreements at the time of their enrollment. Under \n     these agreements, students are required to use binding \n     arbitration to resolve any dispute they may later have with \n     the school; they are barred from the courts. As demonstrated \n     in this petition, these arbitration clauses are detrimental \n     to students, hamper efforts to uncover wrongdoing by \n     institutions receiving Title IV assistance, and place the \n     federal investment in Title IV programs at risk.\n       Public Citizen, Inc., a consumer organization with members \n     and supporters nationwide, submits this citizen petition \n     under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(e) to request that the Department of \n     Education issue a rule requiring institutions to agree, as a \n     condition on receipt of Title IV assistance under the HEA, \n     not to include pre-dispute arbitration clauses in enrollment \n     or other agreements with students. This rule would be \n     consistent with the Department's legal authority under the \n     HEA\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n     and with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 \n     et seq. It would also be in line with a call by members of \n     Congress for the Department to condition Title IV funding on \n     a school's commitment not to use forced arbitration clauses \n     or other contractual barriers to court access in student \n     enrollment agreements.\n\n\n                        I. STATEment OF INTEREST\n\n       Since its founding in 1973, Public Citizen has advocated on \n     behalf of its members and supporters for public access to the \n     civil justice system. As part of that work, it seeks to end \n     the use of forced arbitration clauses in consumer contracts \n     because these clauses are fundamentally unfair to consumers, \n     encourage unlawful corporate behavior, and weaken the utility \n     of enforcement efforts to protect the public. Public Citizen \n     is engaged in efforts to encourage the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (SEC) to ban pre-dispute arbitration agreements in \n     consumer and investor agreements. Public Citizen's counsel \n     have represented parties in several major cases involving the \n     scope of the FAA and the enforceability of pre-dispute \n     arbitration agreements. Public Citizen also frequently \n     appears as amicus in cases involving these issues.\n       In addition to its arbitration work, Public Citizen \n     supports robust regulation of predatory educational \n     institutions and student lending practices that leave \n     students saddled with debt for overpriced educations. It \n     participated in the Department's Gainful Employment \n     rulemaking, and its attorneys represent twenty-eight \n     organizations as amici in support of that rule in Association \n     of Private Sector Colleges and Universities v. King, No. 15-\n     5190 (D.C. Cir.). Counsel for Public Citizen have also \n     represented parties and amici in numerous cases involving \n     misconduct by for-profit educational institutions.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, countless veterans groups, consumer \nadvocates, legal aid lawyers, and student organizations support a full \nban on mandatory arbitration clauses in higher education. I hope the \nDepartment of Education responds to this. I hope they have the resolve \nand the political will to get this done.\n  It is sad when students end up with a good diploma and a ton of debt. \nIt is unforgiveable for us to be complicit when the students end up \nwith a ton of debt and a worthless diploma from a for-profit college or \nuniversity.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Aviation Administration is now operating \nunder its second extension. Like too many important issues, we just \nkeep patching up the system. Last year, the Senate worked together to \npass a 5-year transportation bill. Finally, after 30 patches of a \nnational transportation program, both parties came together to pass the \nfirst long-term bill in over 10 years. This was an important step for \nthe Nation and for my State of Illinois.\n  Fixing and maintaining our infrastructure involves planning, and \nplanning includes certainty. If we don't know we are going to be funded \n6 months from now, it is very tough to plan a highway, a bridge, or how \nwe are going to administer an airport.\n  We have an opportunity to do the same for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. Senators Thune and Nelson--Republican and Democrat--put \ntogether the bipartisan bill that we are currently debating. I hope we \ncan give this bill careful consideration. One of the items we should \ncarefully consider is security at airports.\n  Since 9/11 we have focused more and more on the security of airports, \nand when we hear of these terrible terrorist incidents overseas, we \nunderstand that we can't drop our guard. There were 32 people who died \nin Belgium, and many were injured. The terrorists targeted people who \nwere just going about their daily routine, catching an airplane. The \nterrorists took advantage of a vulnerable system. At the airport, two \nbombs were set off before any security screening took place. That \nshould be a wake-up call for all of us.\n  Last week Senator Heinrich offered an amendment that I was proud to \ncosponsor for commonsense measures to strengthen security at U.S. \nairports in places such as transit stops. I am pleased it passed with \nstrong bipartisan support. It adds extra security in these areas where \npeople take planes and trains where we were vulnerable before the \ncheckpoints. It adds law enforcement officials, inspectors, specialists \nin explosives, dogs, and experts who can help with the screening \nprocess. It gives more flexibility to our States in cities like \nChicago, which I am honored to represent, to grant security funding for \nbetter protecting these vulnerable areas, and it gives more flexibility \nin spending the money.\n  O'Hare is one of the busiest airports in the world, with 77 billion \npassengers last year. Chicago is also host to many major national and \nglobal events with millions of travelers. We have one of the busiest \nnetworks of commuters and travelers by transit, with 1.6 million people \nriding Chicago's CTA every day, getting to work by bus or train. Nearly \n300,000 passengers take Chicago's Metra commuter rail every day. We \nmust ensure we are doing everything we can to keep them safe.\n  Communities such as Aurora, IL, that have experienced their own \nthreat not long ago will remember September of 2014. I am filing an \namendment which I hope will be considered on this bill to improve \nsecurity in our air traffic control facilities after the experience we \nhad back in 2014. There was a fire at the air traffic facility in \nAurora. That center directs about 9,000 flights a day over 6 States, \nincluding, of course, the Chicago region. The fire grounded thousands \nof flights. Its impact was felt for 2 weeks. It caused $5.3 million in \ndamages to the traffic control facility, and hundreds of millions of \ndollars in economic impact.\n  The air traffic controllers, local police, and fire department did \nall they could do, but there turned out to be bigger issues at play. \nThis was a case of arson by an employee at the air traffic control \nfacility.\n  I went in and actually saw the damage that he did. Following the \nincident, I worked with the FAA and called on the Department of \nTransportation to investigate what happened and to come up with \nrecommendations on how to improve security. After the Department of \nTransportation investigation, FAA and DOT found there was not enough \nfocus on insider threats, and, clearly, better equipment is needed to \nhelp communication from going down. Once again, we are dealing with an \narea that is not as secure as it should be.\n  The amendment I have offered to this bill builds on some of the \nrecommendations. It requires the FAA to make plans for law enforcement \nand other authorities in the event of an incident. It requires the FAA \nto develop guidelines for training and response to security threats and \nactive shooter incidents and to ensure that, as the FAA makes \ninvestments in infrastructure and basic equipment such as electrical \nsystems and telecommunications, they think about resiliency and \nsurvivability.\n  We learned those lessons the hard way in Chicago. I hope the Senate \nwill take up my amendment so other airports as well as Chicago will be \nready in the future.\n  These events are reminders of the damage that can be done. With a \nsimilar spirit of bipartisanship, we need to have a commitment to our \nsecurity at our airports and around the United States.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Ray LaHood\n\n  Mr. President, while I am on the subject of airports, I want to \nrecognize my friend and former colleague in the House, Congressman Ray \nLaHood. He was named Secretary of Transportation by President Obama. On \nTuesday, the Peoria International Airport honored him by naming their \nnew international terminal after him. Ray served the Peoria region \nproudly for 14 years as Congressman and for 4 years as President \nObama's Secretary of Transportation. Secretary Foxx went out to Peoria \nto show support for his predecessor.\n  Ray LaHood has been and continues to be a strong advocate for \nIllinois and for our Nation's infrastructure. This honor is certainly a \nfitting tribute, and I congratulate my former colleague, Congressman \nRay LaHood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, first I have an item I want to speak about \non the pending bill. There is another item I want to discuss, first of \nall, but even before that, I want to add that I caught the tail end of \nthe statement of the Senator from Illinois about student loans. When I \nfirst arrived here in the Senate and I was sworn in right where our \npages are sitting now, I had over $100,000 in student loans that I had \ntaken on during my undergraduate but primarily my postgraduate \neducation. I can state that had it not been for the blessings of the \nproceeds of a book that\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nI wrote called ``American Son,'' I am not sure I would have ever paid \nthose loans off. I was fortunate. I went to law school and got a law \ndegree and was employed. I know firsthand the struggle that millions of \nAmericans are facing and the young people who have taken on substantial \nstudent loan debt, some of whom have never graduated from institutions \nand others who have graduated, frankly, with pieces of paper of degrees \nthat, unfortunately, are not worth the paper they are printed on. As a \nresult, they are stuck with a debt that can never be discharged.\n  There are only two ways to get rid of a student loan--die or pay it \noff. For many people, paying it off is not going to happen. It is an \nissue that this Senator hopes Congress will confront. It is a looming \ncrisis in America. There is over a trillion dollars of student loan \ndebt. Quite frankly, it holds people back. When that student loan is \nsitting on your credit report, you won't get a loan to buy a home. If \nyour wages are being garnished and other issues come up as a result of \npaying it off, it is a debilitating problem that people face. We have \ndiscussed throughout the years the hopes of steps we can take to \naddress it, and I hope we will have a chance to do that before this \nCongress finishes its work.\n\n\n         Honoring the 65th Infantry Regiment ``Borinqueneers''\n\n  Mr. President, before I speak on the bill, I want to rise today to \npay tribute to a distinguished group of American heroes. It is a group \nthat for too long was denied the honors and benefits they were owed for \ntheir service to our Nation.\n  The 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers, is a \npredominantly Puerto Rican regiment that is the only Hispanic \nsegregated unit to fight in every global war of the 20th century. \nHistorically, the Borinqueneers were denied equal benefits and equal \nhonors for their service, despite the fact that their regiment \nexperienced equal risk and equal duty in combat during World War I, \nWorld War II, and the Korean war.\n  They have since been decorated for their extraordinary service on the \nbattlefield. In the Korean war alone, the regiment earned more than \n2,700 Purple Hearts, 600 Bronze Stars, 250 Silver Stars, 9 \nDistinguished Service Crosses, and 1 Medal of Honor.\n  There is another medal, however, that has yet to be presented, but \nthat will change later this afternoon when the Borinqueneers and their \nfamilies will celebrate the unveiling of the long overdue Congressional \nGold Medal. This is the highest civilian honor in the United States.\n  The medal will be unveiled today at a ceremony in the Capitol. It \nwill then be given to the Smithsonian Institute and placed on public \ndisplay. It is my hope that the more than 1,000 Borinqueneer veterans \nliving throughout the United States, as well as the family members of \nthose fallen, departed, and missing in action, will know at last that \ntheir service has received the ultimate tribute from a grateful Nation. \nOver the years, even in the shadow of unequal treatment, the \nBorinqueneers never faltered and never failed to prove just how \nvaluable they are to the cause of freedom.\n  My favorite example is the story of Operation Portrex--a military \nexercise that occurred on the eve of the Korean war. It was intended to \ntest how the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force would do as liberators \nof an enemy-controlled island. The Borinqueneers were tasked with \nplaying the role of ``the enemy aggressors'' and attempting to prevent \nthe more than 3,200 American troops from liberating the island in this \nexercise. It was a task that, quite frankly, they were not expected to \naccomplish. Yet, much to the surprise of the Army commanders, the 65th \nInfantry, badly outnumbered, was able to halt the offensive forces on \nthe beaches.\n\n  So it is no surprise that after seeing the tremendous skill of the \nBorinqueneers, our Army commanders quickly deployed them into the heart \nof the Korean war, trusting them with numerous important offensive \noperations. One of those operations occurred on January 31, 1951. It is \ncredited as having been the last battalion-size bayonet charge by a \nU.S. Army unit. Of that charge, the commanding general, Douglas \nMacArthur, later wrote:\n\n       The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th \n     Infantry regiment, on the battlefields of Korea, by valor and \n     determination and a resolute will to victory, give daily \n     testament to their invincible loyalty to the United States \n     and the fervor of their devotion to those immutable standards \n     of human relations to which the Americans and the Puerto \n     Ricans are in common dedicated. They are writing a brilliant \n     record of achievement in battle. I am proud indeed to have \n     them in this command. I wish that we might have many more \n     like them.\n\n  Throughout the storied history of the 65th, there are countless \nexamples of valor that have distinguished this regiment. Today, Puerto \nRicans serve in our military at some of the highest rates of any \ndemographic group in the Nation, which is no doubt a lasting legacy of \nthe Borinqueneers.\n  It has been one of my great honors as a Senator to be involved in the \neffort to secure the Congressional Gold Medal by cosponsoring the \nlegislation that passed the Senate in 2014. I was also honored to stand \nin the White House as President Obama signed the bill into law.\n  Today, I want to thank two congressionally designated liaisons who \nworked tirelessly to make this day a reality: San Rodriguez and Javier \nMorales. Both of them are Army veterans. They made it their mission to \nensure that through the design of the medal and its unveiling ceremony, \nthese men who have honored our Nation receive the honor they deserve in \nreturn. I thank both of them for their work.\n  I would also like to say a special thank-you to the students at St. \nLuke's Lutheran School in Oviedo, FL, and to their teacher, Ms. Carla \nCotto Ford, who is the granddaughter of two Borinqueneers. Ms. Ford and \nher students raised thousands of dollars in their community toward an \nongoing national effort to ensure that every single living Borinqueneer \nwould receive a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  The passionate efforts of Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Morales and Ms. Ford \nand her students and so many others who have labored to make this day a \nreality are part of what makes this Congressional Gold Medal so \nspecial. It reminds us that the legacy of past Borinqueneers who have \nfought and died for America is indeed a living legacy.\n  Today that legacy, alive and well, reminds us that America truly is \nan exceptional country. Ours is a nation made up of people from all \ndifferent backgrounds and all different cultures who came together as \none Nation because we share a common idea: that everyone deserves the \nfreedom to exercise their God-given rights. Each member of the 65th \nInfantry Regiment fought for that freedom not just for themselves but \nfor every man and woman and child in these United States.\n  In closing, to the Borinqueneers, I would like to say congratulations \non the unveiling of your well-deserved Congressional Gold Medal. More \nimportantly, on behalf of my staff and my family and the people of \nFlorida, I would like to say thank you. Thank you for your service. \nThank you for your courage. Thank you for fighting to make this Nation \nthe best it can be.\n  Mr. President, on another topic, I want to briefly discuss an \namendment I now have pending on the bill before us, the bill on the \nFAA. It is an amendment that is drafted to the finance portion of this \nbill and that deals with welfare reform.\n  For two decades now, it has been the policy of the United States that \nnew immigrants to the United States do not qualify for welfare and \nother public assistance programs for their first 5 years in the \ncountry. Just to lay out what that means, if you are a legal immigrant \nto the United States, for the first 5 years that you are in this \ncountry, you do not qualify for any Federal welfare or other public \nassistance programs. Of course, illegal immigrants do not qualify at \nall for Federal assistance programs. But there is an exception to this \nFederal law. The exception for this policy is for refugees and asylees \nwho come to our shores seeking shelter from persecution. So while \nimmigrants to the United States do not get Federal benefits, if you can \nprove you are a refugee fleeing persecution, then you do qualify for \nFederal assistance.\n  For those people who can prove they are fleeing persecution, our \ncompassionate country makes this financial\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\ncommitment so they can get a new start on life and a leg up. But there \nis a provision of existing law that many people are not aware of. A \nprovision of this existing law basically says that anyone who comes \nfrom Cuba--regardless of why they come to the United States, they are \nautomatically and immediately presumed to be a refugee, and therefore \nthey are automatically and immediately eligible for welfare and other \npublic assistance. In essence, our existing law treats all Cubans \ncategorically as if they are refugees, whether or not they can prove \nit.\n  As many of you know, I am the son of Cuban immigrants. I live in a \ncommunity where Cuban exiles have had an indelible imprint on our \ncountry, on the State of Florida and in South Florida in particular. \nYet I stand here today to say that this provision of law, this \ndistinction, is no longer justified. This financial incentive, this \nnotion, this reality that if you get here from Cuba, you are going to \nimmediately qualify for Federal benefits has encouraged the current \nmigratory crisis in which today thousands of Cubans are making \ndangerous trips to come to the United States of America. It is creating \npressure for foreign governments--for example, in Central America--that \nsimply cannot host them, and it is now adding pressure to our southwest \nborder.\n  Just to outline what is happening, traditionally, Cubans come to the \nUnited States on a raft, on an airplane, or on a visa, but now many are \nmaking to trip to Costa Rica or Honduras and they are working their way \nup to Central America, through Mexico, and crossing our southern \nborder.\n  It is my belief--and I think well-founded based on much of the \nevidence we have now received in testimony and in newspaper articles; \nthe South Florida Sun Sentinel, one of our newspapers based in Broward \nCounty, has extensively documented this and other abuses that are going \non--that a significant number of people are drawn to this country from \nCuba because they know that when they arrive, if they can step foot on \ndry land, they will immediately receive status and they immediately \nqualify for a package of Federal benefits that no other immigrant group \nwould qualify for unless they can prove they are refugees.\n  This current policy is not just being abused, it is hurting the \nAmerican taxpayers. There are reports that indicate that financial \nsupport for Cuban immigrants exceeded $680 million in the year 2014 \nalone. Those numbers, by the way, have quite frankly grown since then.\n  On top of the fundamental unfairness of the policy, recent reports in \nthe media indicate that there is gross abuse of this policy. In \nFlorida, we are now hearing many stories of individuals coming to this \ncountry and claiming their benefits regularly and repeatedly returning \nto Cuba--in essence, the country you are supposed to be fleeing because \nyou fear for your life and your freedom. If you are a refugee, it means \nyou are seeking refuge. It is difficult to justify someone's refugee \nstatus when after arriving in the United States they are traveling back \nto the place they are ``fleeing'' from, 10, 15, 20, 30 times a year.\n  By the way, this places the Cuban act in particular danger. That is a \nseparate topic not dealt with in my amendment and one that I have said \npublicly should perhaps be reexamined and adjusted to the new reality \nwe now face. But I am not dealing with that right now. We are dealing \nwith the benefits portion of this.\n  It is difficult to justify refugee benefits for people who are \narriving in the United States and are immediately traveling repeatedly \nback to the nation they claim to be fleeing. Others who are immediately \ntraveling back to the island are actually staying there.\n  Let me paint the picture for you. You come from Cuba on the Cuban \nAdjustment Act. You arrive in the United States because you crossed the \nsouthwest border with Mexico or you landed on a raft on a beach \nsomewhere in Florida. You claim your status as a Cuban refugee, and \nthen less than a year later or a year later, you travel back to Cuba \nand you stay there for weeks or months at a time. But because you \nqualify for Federal refugee benefits, you are receiving benefits from \nthe Federal Government, but you are living in Cuba. And how this \npractice works is that while you are living in Cuba, relatives or \nfriends in America are getting hold of your benefits, which are mailed \nto you or direct-deposited, and then they are making sure you get that \nmoney to subsidize your lifestyle.\n  I can tell you today unequivocally that there are people living \nbasically permanently on the island of Cuba, with an occasional visit \nback to the United States, who are living a lifestyle that is being \nsubsidized by the U.S. taxpayer because of this abuse.\n  This practice, quite frankly, is illegal under current law, but the \nresponsible agencies seem to have failed to enforce this law. So I have \noffered an amendment to this bill that puts an end to this abuse and \nputs an end to the unfairness of the existing law. All my amendment \nwould do is it would simply require those who come from Cuba--they \nwould still be able, under the Cuban Adjustment Act, to receive \npermanent status in the United States, but they are going to be treated \nlike every other immigrant. They are going to be ineligible for most \nFederal benefit programs for 5 years unless they can demonstrate and \nprove they qualify for refugee status.\n  Let me paint a picture of what that would look like. If you come from \nCuba and you can prove that you are fleeing oppression, that you are \ninvolved politically, that you are a dissident, that you are someone \nwho the government is persecuting, then you are a refugee and you will \nbe treated like a refugee and you will qualify for refugee benefits. \nBut if you simply arrive from Cuba because you are seeing a better life \nfor yourself from an economic standpoint, you will still be able to \nbenefit from the Cuban Adjustment Act in that status, but you will not \nqualify for Federal benefits and you will be treated like any other \nimmigrant who comes to the United States.\n  We should be clear that the Castro regime does indeed repress \nhundreds of people every week. There is no question that there are many \nwho still come here from Cuba who are refugees and are fleeing \npersecution. There is no doubt that there are people who will arrive \nthis month and this year from Cuba who have left Cuba because they are \nbeing politically persecuted. There is no doubt about that. So we are \nnot talking about excluding them. They will be able to prove they are \nrefugees and they will be able to qualify for refugee benefits. While \nit is clear that there are still many people facing persecution in Cuba \nand fleeing, it is also clear that it is not everyone who is coming \nfrom Cuba.\n  So all this amendment would do is bring parity between Cuban refugees \nand every other refugee. I say this to you as someone whose parents \ncame from Cuba. I propose this amendment as someone who lives in a \ncommunity where Cuban Americans comprise a significant plurality of the \npopulation. I see firsthand these abuses that are occurring. It is not \nfair to the American taxpayer. It is costing us money. Quite frankly, \nit is encouraging people to come here to take advantage of this \nprogram.\n  By passing this amendment--if we pass it--Congress will not only save \ntaxpayers millions of dollars, but I believe it will also help minimize \nthe increase we have seen in migration of Cubans over the last couple \nof years by weeding out bad actors who only come to the United States \nin search of government benefits they can take advantage of for the \nfirst 5 years they are here.\n  I believe this is responsible. I believe this is the right approach \nfor our Nation fiscally but also from an immigration standpoint. I hope \nI can earn bipartisan support for passing this very sensible proposal.\n  I encourage my colleagues to go on the Web site of the South Florida \nSun Sentinel, a newspaper in South Florida. You can see they have \nextensively documented not just these abuses but a series of other \nabuses that are occurring as well as part of this overall program.\n  So it is my hope that I can earn the support of my colleagues to \nconvert this idea into law.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Jessie's Story\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I am rising to share Jessie's story. \nJessie's story is the story of Jessie Grubb from Charleston, WV, who \npassed away. She was only 30 years old.\n  After years of struggling with heroin addiction, she had been doing \nwell. Her parents and family members and all her close friends were \nvery proud of the progress she was making. She had been sober since \nAugust, but last month she had surgery for an infection. The infection \nwas related to a running injury, and she died a day after leaving the \nhospital.\n  Jessie's story with addiction is known to many. Her father David \nGrubb was a colleague of mine--a State senator, and a very good State \nsenator, I might add. We worked together in the legislature. He shared \ntheir family's struggle with addiction with President Obama. I was very \npleased President Obama came to a State where he probably has the least \npopularity but which has the greatest challenge with opioid addiction--\nWest Virginia. He came there and he heard the struggles. He saw it \nfirsthand, and I think it moved him and made him more committed to \nfighting this drug abuse that is going on in America.\n  As I said, David Grubb shared his family's story with President Obama \nwhen he came to West Virginia last October and, like I said, it has \nmade a difference. In West Virginia, not unlike Iowa, we have been hit \nvery hard. As a matter of fact, West Virginia has been hit the hardest \nby opioid addiction. It is an epidemic.\n  When we think about an epidemic, pandemics--we talk about Ebola and \nthe Zika virus and all the things we hear about, but we haven't heard a \nwhole lot about opioid addiction. It has been a silent killer. It is \none where we are all ashamed if it happens to us or our family. We \ndon't talk much about it. We think we can handle it within our own \nstructure. Yet it is an epidemic. I say there is not a person in our \ncountry who doesn't know someone in their immediate or extended family \nwho hasn't been affected. That is an epidemic, and it is something we \nhave to cure.\n  Drug overdose in my little State of West Virginia has increased by \nmore than 700 percent between 1999 and 2013. Last year alone, over 600 \nlives were lost to prescription drug abuse--overdose. Now that is \nlegal. These are products produced by legal manufacturing companies, \npharmaceuticals. These are products approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, a watchdog responsible for making sure our food and all \nof our drugs are safe. So this is something that is legal and that our \ndoctors prescribe. Our most trusted people in America--our doctors--are \nprescribing something they think will help us. Yet it is something that \nis killing Americans everywhere.\n  So this is Jessie's story and her family's pain, which is all too \nfamiliar and all too common in West Virginia and throughout the Nation. \nAs I said, we lost 627 West Virginians last year, and 61,000 West \nVirginians used prescription pain medications for nonmedical purposes \nin 2014--nonmedical purposes. This includes 6,000 teenagers.\n  Our State is not unique. Every day in the country, 51 Americans are \ndying--51 Americans die every day from opioid abuse. Since 1999, we \nhave lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse. Think \nabout that: 200,000 in a little over a decade. That is unheard of. In \nany other category we would be doing something monumental.\n  Jessie's story deeply impacted the President, and I spoke with him \nabout her death and the pain her family is going through. When the \nPresident came to Charleston, Jessie was in a rehab facility in \nMichigan for the fourth time--for the fourth time. Before her life was \ntaken over by addiction in 2009, Jessie's future was very bright. She \nwas truly an unbelievable young lady. She was the beloved daughter of \nDavid and Kate Grubb, the beloved sister to her four sisters, and a \nbeloved friend to family and to many others.\n  Jessie was an excellent student and scored in the 99th percentile on \nevery one of her tests. She was a cheerleader at Roosevelt Junior High \nSchool and was an avid runner. At the time of her death, she was \nlooking forward to running in her first marathon. The only trouble she \nhad ever gotten into in school was when she protested the Iraq war. \nNeedless to say, she was a natural born leader. She truly was. She was \none of those girls who was captivating.\n  After graduating from Capital High School, she was thrilled and \nlooking forward to her bright future at the University of North \nCarolina, Asheville. She was sexually assaulted during her first \nsemester, which caused her to withdraw from school and return home to \nCharleston.\n  That traumatic event caused Jessie to turn to heroin to escape her \npain. Over the next 7 years, Jessie would battle her addiction. She \nwould overdose four times and go into rehab four times, but up until \nher death, she had been sober for 6 months and was focused on making a \nlife for herself in Michigan, and one her parents were very proud of.\n  All of Jessie's hard work was ruined because of a careless mistake--\none mistake. Jessie's death is particularly heartbreaking because it \nwas 100 percent preventable--100 percent. Her parents traveled to \nMichigan for Jessie's surgery and told her doctors and hospital \npersonnel that she was a recovering addict. Jessie was having hip \nsurgery that was caused by all her running, and they were treating her \nfor an infection. However, after her surgery, the discharging doctor \nwho said he didn't know she was a recovering addict sent her home with \na prescription for 50--50--OxyContin pills. She should never have been \ngiven one--not one--for opioid medication.\n  We must ensure this never happens again. Jessie passed away that \nnight and think about how preventable this was. Because of a lot of the \nprivacy laws, we can't tell. That doctor didn't know. Did someone mess \nup? We don't know. If you are allergic to penicillin or something, it \nis on your chart. They know all the way through if you are allergic to \nanything, but if you are an addict and you are allergic to opioids, \nbecause they will kill you, they can't reveal that.\n  So, Madam President, I will be asking for your help, as always, and I \nknow you will be compassionate about this. Next week I will be \nintroducing Jessie's Law to make sure this type of careless mistake \nnever happens to another daughter, a son, a nephew, a niece, anyone in \nAmerica.\n  The bottom line is, we need to go at this problem from every angle \nand with the help of everyone--family assistance, counseling programs, \ndrug courts, consumer and medical education, law enforcement support, \nState and Federal legislation. We need to throw everything we have at \nthis. With continued support and tireless work from everyone, we can \nbeat this epidemic once and for all.\n  Jessie's death is heartbreaking to anybody who knew her or the family \nor their contribution to society every day. This is a tremendous family \nwho gives so much back. We all know someone who has been impacted. We \ndo, every one of us. Every one of our young interns here know. Our \npages know. They see it in their schools. Everybody sees what is going \non, but we have to speak up. This is a fight we have to win.\n  This opioid epidemic is claiming a generation and taking them away \nfrom us. I am committed to this more than I have been committed to \nanything. If I have one purpose of being in the Senate, it is to bring \nto light these young people whose lives have been changed, whose \nfamilies' lives have been changed all over West Virginia, all over \nAmerica. There has been silence for far too long, and we are not going \nto keep silent any longer.\n  People are sending me letters from Iowa, letters from my State of \nWest Virginia, and they are saying: Please use my name. Put a face and \na name to a tragedy. They want us to know in Congress that something \nhas to be done. We don't need all these drugs on the market. We don't \nneed the pharmaceutical companies putting out more and more powerful \nopioids. We don't need a business plan that is destroying people's \nlives.\n  I think this is something we agree on. This is something that will \nunite us like nothing else in Congress. It is not a Democratic or a \nRepublican epidemic. It is not a disease that is killing Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is killing Americans, and we are Americans.\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nSo I am hopeful, and I have been very pleased with all of the support \nwe are getting from both sides, Democrats and Republicans, coming \ntogether on this issue. We have important legislation coming forward. I \nbelieve this is going to allow us for the first time to make a \nmonumental change. I thank VA Secretary Bob McDonald. He is trying very \nhard to change the culture of the VA, of treating pain with \nalternatives. There is so much more we need to do. I will be getting \ninto that later.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the great job she does for the \ngreat State of Iowa.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \namendments submitted to the previous substitute, Senate amendment No. \n3464, be considered to be submitted to the new substitute, Senate \namendment No. 3679, as long as the instructions to the clerk are \ndrafted properly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am trying to get a vote on an amendment \nthat Senator Klobuchar and I have submitted. To explain it, I want to \nshow you this graphic.\n  These are two airplanes that are exactly the same size, they are \nflying across the same sky, and they are flying over the same homes. \nBut there is a difference--a difference that I am trying to fix. This \none is a passenger plane. Due to an FAA regulation that Senator Snowe \nand I were able to get in place through a vote in this Chamber several \nyears ago, the pilots in the passenger plane can fly only up to 9 hours \na day. After that, they have to rest because pilot fatigue is a very \ndangerous situation facing not only our pilots but their crews and \neveryone that is in their vicinity.\n  What happened when Senator Snowe and I wrote our legislation? We \nassumed that the regulation that would be forthcoming from the FAA \nwould cover both passenger and cargo planes because, again, these \nplanes share the same skies, go over the same airspace, and go over the \nsame homes. It is a straightforward point, and fatigue is fatigue. They \nare not less fatigued because they are carrying cargo rather than \npassengers. These pilots can fly up to 16 hours a day. We know from the \npilots themselves--many pilots organizations have endorsed this--that \nthis is a very dangerous disparity, and it needs to be fixed.\n  I am asking the majority for an up-or-down vote on this amendment. It \nis real simple. It simply says the FAA should get rid of this disparity \nand make the cargo pilots have the same rules as the passenger pilots--\nreal simple.\n  According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the No. 1 \nsafety issue is fatigue. This is what they cite as the No. 1 problem \nacross the board. So we need to fix this. I have spoken to both of my \nfriends, Senator Nelson, who supports this, and Senator Thune, who has \nbeen a little more subtle about how he feels about this. I asked them \nif I could have the up-or-down vote. I hope I can have the up-or-down \nvote. I am not asking for anything special. A 60-vote threshold is \nfine.\n  If people want to vote against the amendment, fine; let them be held \naccountable. But it is a moral issue right now. The bottom line is, \npeople are in jeopardy right now.\n  I don't know exactly what is going to happen. The reason we are at a \nstandstill is partly because I said I want a vote, and that promptly \nstopped things. I do it rarely, but I know if we pass this, we are \ngoing to save lives. It is written somewhere in the Old Testament that \nif you save one life, you save humanity. Saving lives is one thing we \nshould do, and since we know about this disparity and we have proof \nthat we need to fix it, we need to fix it.\n  All I am asking for is an up-or-down vote. If people want to vote no, \nthat is fine with me. Hopefully, most will vote yes, and hopefully we \nwill get this done. We got it done before, and we should be able to get \nit done again.\n  What could be happening is that we could get that vote. Of course, \nwhat I would love to death is if Senator Thune and Nelson just took our \namendment and put it in the package. That would be wonderful. But if \nthey don't want to do that, I want a vote.\n  What I hope doesn't happen is that they will say: OK. We will give \nyou a vote, but we are going to take two really poison pill amendments \nand force everybody to vote on those.\n  This is not a game. I am not here to have a game. I am here to have a \nvote, up or down. This should not be tied to anything else.\n  I want to read to you the incredible words that were spoken. These \nare excerpts from UPS Flight 1354. This is a cockpit conversation that \ntook place minutes before a crash. These words are coming from the \ngrave. Listen to these words and make up your own mind as to whether I \nam being unreasonable here in wanting to have a vote.\n  Pilot 1: I mean I don't get it. It should be one level of safety for \neverybody.\n  Pilot 2: It makes no sense at all.\n  Pilot 1: No, it doesn't at all.\n  Pilot 2: And to be honest, it should be across the board. To be \nhonest, in my opinion, whether you are flying passengers or cargo, if \nyou are flying this time of day, you know fatigue is definitely--\n  Pilot 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n  Pilot 2: When my alarm went off, I mean, I am thinking, I am so \ntired.\n  Pilot 1: I know.\n  ``When my alarm went off, I mean, I am thinking, I am so tired.''\n  This photograph shows what happened to that cargo jet. It happened \nover Alabama in 2013. This is what happened. The NTSB said it was \ndefinitely fatigue that played a role in this crash. So am I being \nunreasonable to say this is the FAA bill--this is the bill we do every \ncouple years about air safety? Am I being unreasonable to ask my \ncolleagues to vote up or down on whether there ought to be parity \nbetween passenger pilots and cargo pilots? I don't think so.\n  Remember Captain Sullenberger, who was the hero? Captain Sullenberger \nwas the hero who landed his plane in the water--the ``Hero of the \nHudson.'' He is a superstar. He did this. He knows about safety. He \nknows it.\n  A passenger on that flight said: I could feel the water running over \nthe top of my feet, and that is what really scared me. ``I thought, I \nsurvived the impact and now I am going to drown.'' That was a passenger \nwho said that--how the pilot saved them all. We all know who saved 155 \npeople as he landed the jet in the frigid New York Hudson River.\n  Let's see what Sully Sullenberger says about the situation of \nfatigue. If we cannot listen to this, who are we listening to? By the \nway, these comments are not aimed just at my colleagues; they are aimed \nat the administration that has not done this, which is wrong. They are \nwrong.\n  Listen to what Captain ``Sully'' Sullenberger, the hero of Flight \n1549, said: ``You wouldn't want your surgeon operating on you after \nonly 5 hours of sleep, or your passenger pilot flying the airplane \nafter only 5 hours sleep, and you certainly wouldn't want a cargo pilot \nflying a large plane over your house at 3 a.m. on 5 hours of sleep \ntrying to find the airport and land.''\n  So the question is: Who do we listen to? Do we listen to the \ncompanies that are afraid it is going to cost them a few dollars? Do we \nlisten to the pilots? Do we listen to Sully Sullenberger, who is \ntelling us fatigue kills? It is a killer. That is what he said at the \npress conference yesterday.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles \nthat appeared recently in the news.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n  \n\n\n             [From the New York Daily News, April 12, 2016]\n\nMiracle on the Hudson Pilot Pushes Safe Skies Act To Grant Cargo Pilots \n                            Rest Protections\n\n                           (By Nancy Dillon)\n\n       Tom Hanks will play him in a Clint Eastwood-directed biopic \n     due out this summer, but Chesley Sullenberger isn't leaning \n     his seat back.\n       The Miracle on the Hudson pilot was in Washington, D.C. \n     Tuesday, pushing lawmakers to pass the Safe Skies Act and \n     grant cargo pilots the same rest protections as passenger \n     pilots.\n       ``This is not a partisan issue, it's a science-based, \n     commonsense issue, Sullenberger told the Daily News.\n       He said cargo pilots generally fly at night and deserve the \n     same sleep standards already guaranteed to passenger pilots--\n     flights limited to eight or nine hours and minimum 10-hour \n     rest periods.\n       ``It's really just flat wrong (to exclude cargo pilots). \n     They're the ones who need it most. They have their natural \n     circadian rhythms disrupted the most,'' Sullenberger told The \n     News.\n       ``If you're home in the evening when hundreds of cargo \n     airplanes are flying overhead, it doesn't matter if those \n     planes are carrying people or packages. It matters that their \n     pilots are alert enough to do their job safely,'' the retired \n     U.S. Airways captain turned author and aviation safety \n     consultant said.\n       Sullenberger joined Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Amy \n     Klobuchar (D-MN) in Washington to close the ``dangerous \n     loophole'' in prior legislation that carved out the exception \n     for cargo pilots at the request of cargo carriers, he said.\n       The Safe Skies Act would be an amendment to the FAA \n     reauthorization bill, according to a press release from \n     Boxer's office.\n       Currently, cargo pilots can be on duty for up to 16 hours \n     at a time, the release said.\n       At least one freight giant is against the proposal.\n       ``Cargo and passenger pilots have very different schedules, \n     and one size does not fit all when it comes to air travel \n     safety. Forcing cargo pilots to fly according to a set of \n     rules developed for distinct conditions in a different \n     industry will make them less safe,'' FedEx said in a \n     statement to the Daily News.\n       ``Safety is our top priority. That's why we oppose \n     legislation mandating passenger-pilot scheduling limits for \n     cargo pilots,'' the statement said.\n       Sullenberger said its doubtful he and his crew could have \n     landed U.S. Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River on \n     January 15, 2009--saving all 155 souls--if they were deprived \n     sleep.\n       ``I've proven in the most dramatic way what I'm talking \n     about,'' Sullenberger said. ``Had (copilot) Jeff (Skiles) and \n     I been fatigued, we could not have performed at that level.''\n       The legendary landing on the frigid Hudson--caused by a \n     bird strike the crippled the plane's engines after takeoff \n     from LaGuardia Airport--is something he still thinks about \n     constantly, he said.\n       ``I get daily reminders of that remarkable day. So many \n     people rose to the occasion--the crew, all the rescue \n     workers,'' he said. ``It was the result of the efforts of \n     many people, but I've become the public face.''\n       Asked about Warner Bros planned release of ``Sully'' this \n     September--a movie based on his autobiography ``Highest \n     Duty''--Sullenberger, 65, said he's grateful for all the \n     continued attention.\n       ``I'm doing very well. I've been saying that for a long \n     time. If I was not doing well, it would be my own fault. I \n     get to travel the world, meet world leaders and leaders in \n     the fields of health, technology,'' and of course Hollywood, \n     he said.\n       ``It's really been a fascinating education.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From The Hill, April 12, 2016]\n\n               Dems Want Pilot-Rest Provision in FAA Bill\n\n                          (By Melanie Zanona)\n\n       Senate Democrats want to grant cargo pilots the same rest \n     standards as passenger pilots as a provision of a Federal \n     Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill.\n       Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) \n     are leading the fight to attach an amendment to the FAA bill \n     that would limit cargo plane pilots to flying no more than \n     nine hours a day--the same standard for passenger pilots. \n     Cargo pilots can currently fly up to 16 hours a day.\n       Captain Chesley ``Sully'' Sullenberger, the retired airline \n     captain who safely executed an emergency landing in the \n     Hudson River in 2009, is also backing the provision. He was \n     spotted talking to members about the amendment in the Senate \n     basement after a Tuesday press conference.\n       ``Fatigue is a killer,'' Sullenberger said at the press \n     conference. ``It's time to right this wrong. It's time to fix \n     this rule.''\n       Boxer said she would filibuster the FAA bill if the pilot \n     provision does not get a vote.\n       ``I think this is an absurdity to block a vote on something \n     as important at this,'' she said.\n       The comments come amid growing concern that pet interests \n     could bog down the entire FAA bill, including a push to \n     include renewable energy tax breaks. The agency's current \n     legal authority expires July 15.\n       ``There are other problems with the bill that people are \n     weighing as well, so I think this bill has a very shaky \n     future,'' Boxer added.\n       Boxer and Klobuchar first crafted legislation to make sure \n     passenger and cargo crews had the same flight- and duty-time \n     requirements after the Department of Transportation (DOT) \n     wrote new rules to address pilot fatigue following a deadly \n     passenger airline crash in 2009.\n       The DOT standards require passenger pilots to be limited to \n     flying either eight or nine hours, with a minimum of 10 rest \n     hours and the opportunity for at least eight hours of \n     uninterrupted sleep. But cargo pilots were not included in \n     the rules.\n       ``This doesn't make sense,'' Boxer said Tuesday. ``It's \n     dangerous.''\n       A group of shipping companies wrote a letter to Senate \n     leadership explaining why they thought the amendment ``could \n     actually make our operations less safe and put our pilots at \n     risk.''\n       ``Measures used to prevent fatigue must be different for \n     passenger carriers than they are for cargo carriers because \n     our work schedules are different,'' wrote FedEx, UPS, ABX Air \n     and Atlas Air.\n       ``We fly fewer legs, have longer layovers, and have better \n     rest opportunities on our trips, including while technically \n     `on duty' waiting for our nightly sorts to occur.''\n       Boxer beat back against the letter, accusing special \n     interests of intervening.\n       ``The proof is in the pudding,'' Boxer said. ``Special \n     interests are doing what they always do: trying to get a \n     deal.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Here it is. This one in The Hill is quoting Captain Sullenberger:\n\n       ``Fatigue is a killer''. . . . ``It's time to right this \n     wrong. It's time to fix this rule.''\n\n  Here is another quote in the New York Daily News, with a picture of \nCaptain Sullenberger saying:\n\n       ``This is not a partisan issue, it is a science-based \n     commonsense issue.''\n       He said cargo pilots generally fly at night and deserve the \n     same sleep standards already guaranteed to passenger pilots--\n     flights limited to eight or nine hours and minimum of 10-hour \n     rest periods.\n       ``It is really just flat wrong (to exclude cargo pilots). \n     They're the ones who need it most. They have their natural \n     circadian rhythms disrupted the most.''\n\n  Just standing next to the guy was a thrill for me. Captain \nSullenberger told the News:\n\n       ``If you're home in the evening when hundreds of cargo \n     airplanes are flying overhead, it doesn't matter if those \n     planes are carrying people or packages. It matters that their \n     pilots are alert enough to do their job safely,'' the retired \n     U.S. Airways captain said.\n\n  Do you know what Sullenberger said? He said that ``it's doubtful he \nand his crew could have landed U.S. Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson \nRiver on January 15, 2009--saving all 155 souls--if they were deprived \nof sleep.''\n  Look, we can all put ourselves in a situation, whether we are young--\nand the young can take lack of sleep a lot better. As we age, it is \ntougher. I used to take the redeye all the time, and I can state that I \nfelt it for days. Do we want to have a pilot in a circumstance where he \nor she is sleep deprived and they find themselves in an emergency? I \ndon't think so. None other than Sullenberger said that he is doubtful \nhe and his crew could have landed that flight if they were sleep \ndeprived.\n  He said again--this is in another article from the Daily News. He \nsaid:\n\n       ``I get daily reminders of that remarkable day. So many \n     people rose to the occasion--the crew, all the rescue \n     workers,'' he said. ``It was the result of the efforts of \n     many people, but I've become the public face . . . and had I \n     been fatigued, we could not have performed at that level.''\n\n  This is the classic case of a no-brainer. The people who fly the \nairplanes are telling us that fatigue is a killer. They are telling us \nin a circumstance of emergencies that they will not be able to \nfunction.\n  We have an opportunity to fix it, but we don't have a vote right now. \nWe don't have a vote. As I understand it, we might have a vote, but \nthey may then say to vote on two other issues that are poison pill \nissues. That is the way it goes around here.\n  Someday I am going to write a book called ``How a Bill Really Becomes \na Law.'' The truth is that is how it goes around here. If one wants to \nvote on something, then they say: Swallow a porcupine, and maybe we \nwill give you a vote.\n  Now here is another one. ``Miracle on the Hudson Pilot Pushes More \nRest for Cargo Crews.'' He and I are standing there, and all I am \nsaying is:\n\n       We just need a vote on this, and you know if people want to \n     come down in the well and vote the wrong way on safety, then \n     they have shown themselves . . . [but], frankly, they are \n     putting the lives of people at risk.\n\n  And I am asking for a vote. Again, Sully Sullenberger is quoted:\n\n       ``Let me be very direct: Fatigue is a killer. . . . It's a \n     ruthless indiscriminate killer that\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n     our industry and our regulators have allowed to continue \n     killing for way too long.''\n\n  This is not partisan. I have a Democratic administration who did the \nwrong thing on this. I have a Republican Senate that is not giving me a \nvote on this. Come on. When people die in an airplane crash, we don't \nknow if they are Democrats or Republicans; we just know we cry our \nhearts out for the families.\n  I am going to show you the crashed plane again. This is what happens \nwhen there is fatigue. This is what can happen. There have been many of \nthese crashes because the pilots are flying on 5 hours of sleep.\n  All I am asking for is a vote. Give us a vote. If you want to vote it \ndown, vote it down. You will be judged. That is OK. That is your \nproblem, not mine.\n  I want to praise Senator Klobuchar, who is the coauthor of this \namendment. She was very effective in her comments both in the committee \nand at the presser yesterday.\n  Sullenberger, the ``Hero of the Hudson,'' said this in this other \narticle:\n\n       ``This rule was written the way it was, not for scientific \n     reasons, but for economic ones, by those who are more \n     concerned about an additional burden that they consider an \n     additional cost. It's time to right this wrong. It's time to \n     fix this rule.''\n\n  You know, those of us who have been around a long time remember the \nFord Pinto. That car exploded when there was a crash. I think a lot of \nus remember it. When discovery was done by the attorneys for the \nvictims, they found out the cold and calculating ways the corporation \nviewed these accidents and losses of life. Oh, they said, we can stand \nX number of accidents a year, no problem, because we have insurance. It \nwill not affect us. But, gee, it will cost us X number of dollars to \nfix the problem.\n  What could be more callous? What could be more cold? It is the same \nthing here. It is the companies.\n  Do you know what is fascinating? The airlines that now operate under \nthe 9-hour rule--I will put up the chart that shows the two planes with \nthe different times. The airlines that now fly their pilots up to 9 \nhours a day, compared to the cargo plane owners who permit their pilots \nto work up to 16 hours a day, they--the airline industry is doing \ngreat. They never said word one of a problem. They had rested pilots, \nthey had happier crews, and they are doing fine. So why is it that we \nget letters from the corporations that fly these planes--God forbid we \nshould tell them to give their pilots rest.\n  I want to tell you who is on our side. The Southwest Airlines Pilot \nAssociation--this thrills me--just sent us a letter:\n\n       On behalf of the more than 8,000 pilots--\n\n  This is actually to Senator Thune--\n\n       I urge you to include Senator Barbara Boxer's Safe Skies \n     Act in the FAA reauthorization.\n\n  They say:\n\n       It fixes a huge safety gap that exists in our air \n     transportation today.\n\n  They talk about the Colgan Air crash in 2009. We took action to fix \nthe problem on passenger planes, but it was inexplicable that it was \nleft out of the cargo planes.\n  As pilots, they say safety is their No. 1 priority.\n  They say:\n\n       ``We cannot do our job if we are not all held to the same \n     safety standard. A tired and fatigued pilot is a danger to \n     everyone in their path.''\n\n  That is the point. These passenger pilots are rested; the cargo \npilots are fatigued. They fly in the same sky, in the same airspace. \nThey try to land at the same airports. Having this disparity is a \nnightmare.\n  They say:\n\n       ``Please, do not let another tragedy be the reason for \n     action. This is your chance to fix the cargo carve-out and \n     ensure safe skies in this nation.''\n\n  I thank these pilots for weighing in on this issue. It means a lot to \nme that they did it.\n  The Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations talks about the \nKlobuchar amendment, which is this amendment, and they ask us to please \nallow this vote.\n  They say:\n\n       ``We cannot continue operating with two levels of safety \n     and we sincerely hope you are able to fix the cargo carve-out \n     once and for all.'' We urge your support for this amendment.\n\n  I thank so much Captain Michael Karn, president of the Coalition of \nAirline Pilots Associations.\n  You know, I want to say to my colleagues who might be listening from \ntheir offices: We get on planes all the time. We have 100-percent faith \nin the pilot. We all do. They have the responsibility of getting us to \nour families safely. Every single pilots association is saying to us: \nFix this carve-out. It is dangerous.\n  Any of us could be on a passenger plane just doing great with the \nrested pilot, and somehow a cargo plane crashes into us because that \npilot had 5 hours of sleep.\n  So we have all of these letters from the Independent Pilots \nAssociation, the Allied Pilots Association, the International Brothers \nof Teamsters, Teamsters Local 1224, Teamsters Local 357. They are all \nsaying the same thing: We cannot do our job if we are not all held to \nthe same safety standard. A tired and fatigued pilot is a danger to \neveryone. Don't let another tragedy be the reason for action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo letters I have referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Coalition of Airline\n\n\n                                          Pilots Associations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 2016.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson: I am writing \n     you today on behalf of 28,000 professional airline pilots in \n     support of the Klobuchar Amendment to the FAA reauthorization \n     bill. As you know, during the committee mark-up Senator \n     Klobuchar respectfully withdrew consideration of her \n     amendment with the hope and committee leadership would work \n     with her to solve what is known as the cargo carve-out.\n       As you are aware, Congress passed legislation in 2010 \n     following the deadly 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash that \n     claimed the lives of 45 passengers, 4 crew members and 1 \n     individual on the ground. As the details of the pilots' lack \n     of training and fatigue came to light, the American public \n     demanded that more be done to ensure safety in our skies.\n       Congress heard these concerns and included a requirement in \n     the 2010 FAA reauthorization that the Department of \n     Transportation promulgate rules on pilot duty and rest hours \n     to prevent fatigue and ensure flights are safely operated by \n     pilots with adequate rest.\n       As well-intended as those rules were, somehow through a \n     cost benefit analysis and other inexplicable changes to the \n     original rules as proposed, cargo pilots were carved out of \n     these new regulations, apparently because it was too costly \n     to ensure cargo pilots had adequate rest.\n       Time and time again we see tragic, and avoidable, plane \n     crashes where fatigue is one of the factors contributing to, \n     or out right to blame, for these accidents. In fact, the \n     National Transportation Safety Board listed preventing \n     fatigue related accidents as their number one most wanted \n     improvement in transportation safety for 2016, citing a 2013 \n     UPS plane crash in Birmingham, Alabama as an example.\n       When the FAA reauthorization legislation reaches the Senate \n     floor for debate, we urge you to use this opportunity to \n     protect your constituents and all Americans across this \n     country. Please do not wait until faced with another tragic \n     accident to address this issue.\n       We cannot continue operating with two levels of safety and \n     we sincerely hope you are able to fix the cargo carve-out \n     once and for all. We urge your support for the Safe Skies Act \n     and Senator Klobuchar's amendment to the FAA reauthorization \n     bill.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration on this important \n     aviation safety issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Captain D. Michael Karn,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    April 8, 2016.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science & \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson: We the \n     undersigned unions representing more than 30,000 pilots \n     across the United States urge you to include Senator Barbara \n     Boxer's Safe Skies Act in the 2016 FAA Reauthorization \n     currently before the full Senate.\n       Senator Boxer's bill, S.A. 3489, fixes a huge safety gap in \n     our air transportation system\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\n     today. After the Colgan Air crash in 2009, Congress took \n     action to prevent future tragedies mandating that the \n     Department of Transportation issue science-based regulations \n     addressing pilot fatigue in our nation's airlines. After \n     substantial research and review of undisputed scientific \n     evidence on sleep cycles and fatigue, the draft rules created \n     a new set of requirements related to duty and rest time for \n     all pilots.\n       Ignoring these irrefutable facts and the recommendations \n     from safety experts, the White House Office of Information \n     and Regulatory Affairs removed all references to cargo \n     airlines from the final rules suggesting that a cost of \n     imposing this safety regulation did not outweigh the benefits \n     to the public. Or more simply stated, preventing the death of \n     two pilots and the loss of some cargo does not exceed the \n     cost to a corporation to change their pilots' schedules.\n       As pilots, safety is our number one focus. Rather than \n     argue and dispute the details of the process that created the \n     cargo carve-out, we are more interested in fixing the \n     problem. When we are behind the controls of an airplane \n     trying to get from point A to point B, we do not think about \n     the costs or the benefits of what we do in the cockpit. Our \n     work before, during and after our flights is 100% focused \n     ensuring safety. Our lives depend on it, the lives of those \n     on our planes depend on it and certainly the lives of those \n     who see us flying overhead depend on our commitment to \n     safety.\n       We cannot do our job if we are not all held to the same \n     safety standards. A tired and fatigued pilot is a danger to \n     everyone in their path. Please do not let another tragedy be \n     the reason for action. This is your chance to fix the cargo \n     carve-out and ensure safe skies in this nation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Captain Keith Wilson,\n       President, Allied Pilots Association.\n     Captain Robert Travis,\n       President, Independent Pilots Association.\n     Captain David Bourne,\n       Director, Airline Division, International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters.\n     Captain Daniel Wells,\n       President, Teamsters Local 1224.\n     Captain James Clark,\n     President, Teamsters Local 357.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know people are saying: Barbara, why are you being so \ntough and not letting us vote on other things?\n  I have to say this: If we don't use this occasion to fix a problem \nthat is listed as the No. 1 safety issue by the NTSB, and we can do it \nin 2 minutes--I have spoken my piece. You know, one of my staffers said \nshe explained to her 6-year-old child what the issue is because he is \nalways interested in what she is working on. She said: Jacob, the fact \nis, the planes are the same size, and the man who is flying this one \nand the lady flying this one get different hours of rest.\n  I see that my friend from Florida, the great ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, might want to ask a question.\n  Mr. NELSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I just \nwant to bring to the Senator's attention that I am very hopeful that we \nare getting an agreement that there will be a vote on the Senator's \namendment and some other amendments. I thought the Senator would be \nhappy to hear the news that it looks as if we are coming to an \nagreement where there will be a vote on the Senator's amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, if I could respond through the Chair, the words of \nmy colleague are very hopeful. I just hope it is not tied to some \npoison pills that other people have a problem with. You never know \naround here what is going to happen. In my view--and I know the Senator \nshares it because I know his passion is with me on this--the fact is, \nthis should be an up-or-down vote. It should not be related to other \nthings. It is the No. 1 safety issue of the NTSB.\n  My friend from Florida is like a brother to me, and we counsel each \nother on issues on which we have some expertise. I know he is in there \nfighting to get a vote. I am so grateful to him. I have added a whole \nbunch of support for this.\n  I will close at this point because I think my friend has given me \nsome hope. I am going to close reading the recording. I don't know--I \nask Senator Nelson, did you ever hear this? I want to make sure you \ndid. This will take just a moment. This is from the excerpt from the \nflight deck before a plane went down:\n  Pilot 1: I mean, I don't get that. You know, it should be one level \nfor everybody.\n  These are words from the grave.\n  Pilot 2: It makes no sense at all.\n  Pilot 1: No, it doesn't.\n  Pilot 2: To be honest, it should be across the board. To be honest, \nin my opinion, whether you are flying passengers or cargo, if you are \nflying this time of day, you know fatigue is definitely--\n  Pilot 1: Yeah, yeah.\n  Pilot 2: When my alarm went off, I mean, I'm thinking I'm so tired.\n  Pilot 1: I know.\n  Now, when this happened, I thought for sure that our administration \nwould take care of this and change that rule. They didn't. That is why \nwe are here.\n  I wanted everyone to know this: Sometimes it is hard to look at \nsomething like this, but it is harder to look at the final result of \nwhat happened from fatigue. This is what happened within minutes of \nthat conversation. People could not function. Captain Sullenberger said \nit well: Fatigue is a killer.\n  We could fix it here today. We fixed it--Olympia Snowe and I--years \nago for passenger aircraft. We need to fix it for cargo pilots. They \ndeserve our support and the support of people who rely on them--all of \nus--because they share the sky with the passenger aircraft. We need to \nfix this.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \nwe too often forget about here after the fact. We move on to the next \ntopic of the day. But it was just 1 year ago, on April 2, that actually \nmarked the framework for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the \nPresident's nuclear deal with Iran. That was the day it was announced. \nWe were promised by this administration at all levels that this nuclear \nagreement would make the world a safer place. I have traveled the world \nquite a bit in the last year. I just got back from another trip to the \nMiddle East. I believe the world possibly is more dangerous right now \nthan at any time in my lifetime.\n  Unfortunately, the message that the world is safer did not resonate \nwith Iran. The world was given a false promise that this nuclear deal \nwould serve as a catalyst for change and a moderation within Iran. We \nhave seen change, but it has only been for the worse. Iran is both \nenriched and emboldened by this dangerous deal. The President's deal \nprovided Iran with over an estimated $100 billion, approximately, \nwindfall.\n  The Secretary said just this January that Iran ``had massive needs \nwithin their country and we, the U.S., will be able to track where this \nmoney is going, what is happening with it.'' But instead of focusing \nthese funds inward, as we were assured, on improving the lives of their \npeople, Iran has chosen to use the money to bolster its conventional \nforces and cyber capabilities, to strengthen its proxies, to crack down \non its own people, and to further destabilize the region.\n  Iran has test-launched four ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal \nwas announced. Most recently, these missiles were launched with the \nwords ``Death to Israel'' emblazoned on their side. The most recently \nlaunched missiles were more advanced, by the way, precision-guided and \nmore sophisticated.\n  Iran has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle \nEast capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. They continue \nin developing space-launch vehicles as well that are a transparent \nguise for seeking longer range missile capability.\n  Iran humiliated and detained at gunpoint U.S. Navy sailors, in \nviolation of international law.\n  According to American officials, Iran is using cyber espionage and \ncyber attacks as a tool of influence with Iranian hackers, breaking \ninto email and social media accounts of employees of our very own State \nDepartment who worked on Iran-related issues.\n  Iran used American hostages for strategic and economic leverage from \nthis administration, only turning over innocent Americans when the \nadministration freed 7 Iranian sanctions violators and dismissed \ncharges on 14 other Iranians, including 2 men who helped transfer \nsoldiers and weapons to the Assad regime and to the terror group \nHezbollah.\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\n  Iran continues to spend millions to support the Houthi insurgency \nthat is contributing to the security vacuum in Yemen. Just last week, \nthe U.S. Navy confiscated another weapons cache from the Arabian Sea \nbelieved to be en route from Iran to Yemen in support of the Houthis. \nThis shipment included about 1,500 Kalashnikov rifles, 200 rocket-\npropelled grenade launchers, and 21 .50-caliber machine guns. That \nwould be bad enough if it were the only one, but this is the fourth \nsuch seizure in the region just since September of last year. I think \nit is very clear what Iranian intentions are with regard to the rebels \nin Yemen and also to the terrorists of Hezbollah, Hamas, and others in \nthe region.\n  According to the State Department, Iran continues to be the world's \nleading state sponsor of terrorism. That is our own State Department. \nIn its quest to dominate the Middle East and expel American influence, \nIran has exploited terrorism as a tool of statecraft to oppose U.S. \ninterests and objectives in Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Palestinian \nterritories. Iran continues to spend an estimated $6 billion a year in \nsupport of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and millions of dollars and \nmateriel to Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  On a recent trip to the Middle East just a few weeks ago, I heard \nthese concerns from our friends and allies in the region firsthand. \nIran's domestic repression has also gotten worse. The crackdown on \ndissent is at its worst since the 2009 Green Movement, according to the \nNGOs. Iran continues to imprison those who disagree with the mullahs \nand imprisons those who are at odds with the regime. Executions are at \ntheir highest level since 1989. Further, the regime disqualified \nthousands of reformist candidates in its recently held parliamentary \nelections.\n  When you look at the facts, it is clear the Middle East, and I would \nargue the world, is potentially worse off since the signing of the \nPresident's nuclear deal. What are we doing about it? I think that is \nthe question the American people should keep their eyes on. According \nto Secretary Kerry, ``Iran deserves the benefits of this agreement that \nthey struck.''\n  Despite the four ballistic missile launches, the administration will \nnot call them a violation of U.N. Security Council resolution 2231. \nThis is the resolution that includes the nuclear deal, arms embargo, \nand ballistic missile prohibitions. Just last week, Ambassador Shannon, \nthe Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, told the Foreign \nRelations Committee that he believes these ballistic missile tests \n``violated the intent'' of the U.N. Security Council resolution but \nwould not call it a violation. I am troubled by that. Iran's ever-\nincreasing support for terrorism and instability is going essentially \nunchecked. This is no way to handle a rogue regime. Instead, we need to \ntake a tougher stance on Iran now that we see their intentions \npostdeal.\n  On ballistic missile violations, we must go beyond the President's \ndesignation of 11 individuals and companies for the ballistic missile \nlaunches. The Iranians pay for that technology somehow. Yet no \nfinancial institution was sanctioned for this transaction. The \ntechnology arrived in Iran by boat or by plane. Yet no shipping line or \nairline or any logistics firm was included in the sanctions.\n  We need to codify sectoral sanctions on Iran for ballistic missiles \nand impose tougher standards for mandatory sanctions, including \nacquisition or development of ballistic missiles as activity requiring \nsanctions. We need to show Iran we are serious about stopping their \ncontinued support of terrorism and human rights violations. We should \nimpose stricter sanctions on the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps for \ntheir support of terrorism. We need to freeze assets owned by the IRGC, \nits members, and its affiliates. We should codify Executive Order 13599 \nwhich prohibits Iran's direct and indirect access to the U.S. financial \nsystem. We need to improve new sanctions against Iran as a money-\nlaundering entity for terrorist groups and for its human rights abuses.\n  We need to reauthorize the Iran sanctions act. This vital \nlegislation, which is one of the most important linchpins in U.S. \nsanctions architecture on Iran, is due to expire at the end of this \nvery year. Without the authorization of ISA, the Iran sanctions act, \nthe threat of snapback for Iranian violations of the nuclear deal \ndoesn't carry much weight. We need to have these sanctions reauthorized \nso we can use them swiftly in the event of any future Iranian \nviolation. President Obama has already admitted that Iran has violated \nthe spirit of the nuclear agreement.\n  Finally, we must ensure that Israel is able to maintain its \nqualitative military edge--this is a standard that we have upheld for \nmany years--and equip our gulf allies against increased Iranian \naggression from proxies.\n  Iran's behavior over the past year has proven they are not worthy of \nthe trust bestowed upon them by this administration. While the \nadministration refuses to admit reality, Congress must hold Iran's feet \nto the fire to get a stronger U.S. policy toward Iran. We cannot afford \nto give this rogue regime the benefit of the doubt any longer.\n  Iran refuses to be an honest actor. It is clear from Iranian actions, \njust since the nuclear deal was announced, that they have not changed \ntheir behavior on missile testing, human rights violations, or support \nfor terrorism. Our policies must change to reflect the dangerous \nreality.\n  The Obama administration should work with Congress to strengthen our \nsanctions, reauthorize the Iran sanctions act, and stand up to Iran's \ntotal disregard for international restrictions and the original intent \nof this nuclear deal.\n  The world is a very dangerous place. Iran needs to see a strong \nAmerica stand up and lead again in the region. On this recent trip, the \nquestion we asked most of these leaders was: What do we need to do as \nAmerica? The No. 1 answer by these heads of State was universal: \nAmerica needs to lead again.\n  We have created these power vacuums. It is time now to close this one \nwith Iran.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Welcoming Team 26 from Newtown, Connecticut\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the Senate has remarkable, even magic \nmoments. Yesterday was one such time for my colleague from Connecticut \nand me. Senator Murphy and I had the great honor and privilege to again \nwelcome Team 26 from Newtown, CT, at the end of a truly extraordinary \njourney--their fourth bike ride from Newtown--to commemorate and \nremember the 26 beautiful children and educators who were killed at \nSandy Hook Elementary School.\n  This incredibly searing and horrific moment in the life of our State \nin December of 2012 was marked by their first journey 3 years ago. This \none was their fourth ride through rough roads and tough traffic, and \nsnow and rain across the Northeast as they pedaled--literally pedaled--\nto Washington, DC, from Newtown.\n  We said goodbye to them on Saturday morning in some pretty cold \nweather. I was there. They braved some fierce storms to be here, but \nthe memory they carried with them and the resolve and resilience they \nshowed truly epitomizes the spirit of Sandy Hook and its wonderful \npeople who not only survived that unspeakable tragedy of December 2012 \nbut also showed America a lesson with acts of kindness, unceasing \nadvocacy, resilience, resolve, and--most importantly--a message of \npeace, love, and hope.\n  I wear still on my wrist a bracelet I received then. Its lettering is \nworn out, so it is no longer readable, but it is that same message of \nhope, peace, and love they brought with them as they traveled here.\n  Today a number of them came to the Capitol. I was proud to greet them \nwith their leader, Monte Frank, who organized that first ride. He is \nresponsible for the extraordinary leadership in keeping that together \nand keeping them going over those rough roads.\n  With us at the Capitol today were Peter Olsen, Andrea Myers, Drew \nCunningham, and Ken Eisner. They are among the 26 riders who came to \nWashington yesterday, met with us outside\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\nthe House of Representatives, then went to the White House and met with \nofficials there--including Valerie Jarrett--and eventually with the \nVice President of the United States, Mr. Biden.\n  The members of Team 26 chose to ride to Washington, DC, not only for \ntheir personal reasons but to deliver a petition with a very clear \nmessage that guns have no place on campuses. They have no place on \nschool grounds. They have no safety reason to be there. In fact, they \naggravate the danger of firearms and other kinds of peril on school \nproperty. They also ride on behalf of commonsense, sensible measures \nthat can be achieved--and we have an obligation to achieve. That is \nwhat they said to us as we met with them in front of the Capitol \nyesterday.\n  Their message was that we can save lives, that we can work together. \nWe can get things done across the aisle, on a bipartisan basis, to do \nwhat 90 percent of the American people want, which are universal \nbackground checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and \ncriminals, making sure gun trafficking is a Federal crime and that \nstraw purchases are against Federal law, ensuring that fewer guns get \ninto the hands of dangerous people, particularly domestic abusers. When \ndomestic abuse is combined with a gun in the home, death is five times \nas likely.\n  This message ought to also include limiting the use of high-capacity \nmagazines that can prevent all kinds of terrible rampages with assault \nweapons that have become all too prevalent in this country. Providing \nprotection when temporary restraining orders are issued in domestic \nviolence cases can help some of the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety, victims of domestic abuse, at a time when they need it most, \nand making sure the gun-manufacturing industry is not given an \nexemption from liability that every other industry has to defend \nagainst when it breaks the law. PLCCA ought to be repealed, and I have \nintroduced legislation that would do it.\n  This problem of gun violence affects all of us--not just through the \nmass shootings and massacres that occurred, such as Sandy Hook, but \n30,000 deaths every year. Many of them are suicides, preventable, \nsenseless, and avoidable if we take action to tackle the problem of gun \nviolence in this country. That is the message of the riders who braved \nthose storms, who traveled those rough roads, and reminds us that \nCongress has been complicit in these deaths by its failure to act. \nCongress is complicit in gun violence and its deadly toll in this \ncountry.\n  Monte Frank is a Sandy Hook resident who was one of the founders and \nleaders of Team 26. He rode here again this year and has ridden every \nyear. I am proud he is a friend. He recently wrote:\n\n       Team 26 will ride again because we promised the families in \n     Sandy Hook that we would continue to honor their lost loved \n     ones. We made the same promise to the many victims' families \n     we have met since then in Baltimore; Bridgeport, Conn.; \n     Harlem, N.Y.; and the District of Columbia. While we \n     established Team 26 for Sandy Hook, Team 26 could just as \n     easily be named for the victims of gun violence in Chicago \n     on a given weekend. In fact, gun violence is so prevalent \n     that we could be called Team 26,000 and that number would \n     fall short of the number of gun deaths each year in \n     America.\n\n  I have with me the petition they brought here, but more important, I \nam here to tell my colleagues we must act. We must cease our complicity \nin this body. If tens of thousands of people in this country were \ninfected with Ebola or the Zika virus or the flu, there would be \ndrastic and urgent action to meet that public health crisis. The \nepidemic of gun violence in this country is no less a public health \ncrisis. It is equally an epidemic, and it can be stopped. It must be \nstopped.\n  I want to close with the words of Dennis Niez of Bethlehem, CT. \nDennis rode here with Team 26 and wrote the following, entitled ``Why I \nRide.''\n\n       I ride for the kids who will never know the joy of riding a \n     bike, the feeling of freedom, the visits of their best \n     friends to their house. All of it taken away in a split \n     second with a firearm left loaded in the same house where \n     they're supposed to feel safe.\n       I ride because the same people who have serious mental \n     health issues are able to purchase deadly firearms without a \n     background check because of a loophole.\n       I ride because the same people who have a temporary \n     restraining order because of domestic violence are sometimes \n     able to keep a deadly firearm.\n       I ride so our elected officials, regardless of affiliation, \n     will feel shame when they look at themselves for not doing \n     enough to keep guns away from people who should not have \n     them.\n       I ride because kids in the U.S. are nine times more likely \n     to die from a gunshot than in any other western country.\n       I ride because Dawn Hochsprung was my kid's principal in \n     Bethlehem, CT, someone they will always remember. She was a \n     friend to all the kids.\n       I ride because doing nothing won't make the problems go \n     away.\n\n  On that beautiful, sunny day yesterday, as remarkable and magic a \ntime as it was, I thought of all those Sun-filled days that those 20 \nbeautiful children and 6 great educators will never have and that \nothers also will be deprived of having because Congress is failing to \nact. We must act, and I hope we will act and carry with us in our \nhearts always the message of Team 26.\n  I am proud to yield to my colleague and partner in this effort, \nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank very much my colleague Senator \nBlumenthal. I want to associate myself with all the remarks of my \ncolleague from Connecticut.\n  Let me congratulate the riders from Team 26 for making it through \nsuch inclement weather, making it through such a challenging ride to \nbring these messages to the Halls of Congress and to the White House.\n  It strikes me that there are similarities between this ride and the \nchallenges ahead of us. Every tough ride is a long stretch of both \npeaks and valleys. The challenge is knowing there is another hill \ncoming before you and not giving up, knowing that at the end of that \nlong ride, there is reward.\n  When we talk about the scope of our fight to change the laws of this \ncountry to try to put a dent in this epidemic of gun violence, we have \nto view our journey the same way. There are going to be peaks and there \nare going to be valleys. There will be moments of triumph where we \nchange the laws for the better, where we see progress, as we have in \nConnecticut, where a new State law has resulted in a 40-percent \ndiminution in the number of gun homicides. Then there are the valleys--\nmoments like we had here in early 2013, where despite 90 percent of \nAmericans supporting the idea that you should prove you are not a \ncriminal before you buy a gun, we weren't able to pass that law because \nof a filibuster here. Every great change is defined not only by \nfailures but by peaks and valleys, as was their ride. I join Senator \nBlumenthal in thanking them for focusing on this particular issue of \nguns on campuses.\n  It is up to every individual as to whether they choose to buy a \nfirearm, but they should make that decision imbued by the facts. And \nthe facts are pretty clear that if you have a firearm in your home, it \nis much more likely to be used to kill you or to kill a family member \nthan it is to kill an intruder, to kill someone trying to do harm to \nyou.\n  Nancy Lanza had guns in the home for a variety of reasons, but one of \nthe reasons, apparently, was that as a single parent, she wanted \nfirearms for protection. Of course, her guns were used to kill her and \nthen 20 small first graders and their teachers. Similarly, on campuses, \nthe data tells us that in areas that have more guns, you are more \nlikely to have higher rates of gun homicides. This fiction that if you \njust arm all the good guys, they will kill all the bad guys is not \nactually how it plays out in real life.\n  So I thank them for bringing these petitions here to shed focus on \nthis movement to make sure we don't have students walking around \ncampuses with concealed weapons. That doesn't make for a safer campus \nenvironment.\n  Lastly because I know others want to speak, I want to talk about two \nthings that struck me from our meeting at the White House at the end of \nthe day yesterday. The first was when all the riders on Team 26 got to \ntell their stories about why they decided to join this ride. Many of \nthem, frankly, were doing it for deep love and affection for Monte \nFrank, but they all shared a common cause with him. Around that table \nwere individuals who had suffered gun violence in their immediate \nfamily. One woman's son committed suicide shortly after the murders in \nSandy\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nHook. Another husband and wife lost close friends in a mass shooting. \nBut many of the individuals who were there were simply there because \nthey had children who were in school, and they knew that there but by \nthe grace of God, it could be their child.\n  I have a first grader I drop off every morning at school, and I know \nthere is nothing different about my child's school than Sandy Hook \nElementary School. And I think about Nicole Hockley almost every \nmorning when I drop off my 7-year-old. She said she never imagined that \nit would be her, and she doesn't know why more parents don't step up \nand try to do something about this before it is their child.\n  The second thing I was struck by was their experience along the road. \nThey noted that in over 4 years, they haven't run into anybody who has \ndisagreed with their mission or who has given them a hard time about \ntheir advocacy. And that is really not surprising given the fact there \nis broad consensus among the American public as to what we should do.\n  There really is no disagreement in any of our States--regardless of \ngeography, race, or political ideology--on whether we should make sure \nthat criminals don't buy guns, make sure that people who have a serious \nmental illness can't get their hands on firearms. This appears to be \ncontroversial and politically toxic, the way we talk about it, but the \nway it is talked about on the Main Streets that Team 26 rode down, it \nis not controversial at all. It is a settled issue: Criminals shouldn't \nbuy guns. And there is no justification, in most Americans' minds, for \na Federal law that today, on average, allows for four of six guns to be \nsold without a criminal background check. They want the law changed. We \nshouldn't pretend this issue is politically controversial. It might be \namidst lobbying circles in Washington, but it is not in the communities \nTeam 26 rode through, and they can tell you that because they were \ncheered everywhere they went.\n  It is no small feat to organize this ride. It makes a difference in \nthe communities in which they do events, the communities through which \nthey ride, and it will ultimately make a difference here. Every great \nmovement for change is a long journey made worthwhile at the end when, \nafter you have ridden up lots of hills and down into valleys, you end \nup at the finish line.\n  I thank Team 26 for their work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while my friend from Connecticut is on the \nfloor, let me say that I have been here long enough now to realize it \nis hard to change things with just a speech. Indeed, it is hard to \nchange things by just voting up or down on bills. The way we actually \nsolve problems is by trying to find consensus.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut and I have different views on the \nSecond Amendment, and that may be because there are different views \naround the country based on our experiences and the culture in which we \nwere raised. I realize that in urban areas, particularly in the \nNortheast, the idea of people being raised around guns as a sort of way \nof life for recreation and self-defense and the like is just not their \nexperience, but in other parts of the country--where the Presiding \nOfficer lives and where I live--it is, and people feel very strongly \nabout their rights under the Second Amendment.\n  There is a common ground here, and the Senator from Connecticut and I \nhave talked about this, and that has to do with the mental health \nissue, where I hope we can find that consensus because as long as we \nare talking past each other, we are never going to resolve any of these \nissues, and I do think there is some common ground. In the end, a gun \nis an inanimate object. The fact is, if we continue to ignore the fact \nthat mental illness is very often a factor in acts of gun violence, I \nthink we are going to continue to talk past each other.\n  As the Senator and I have discussed, I actually have a bill that I \nhave introduced--the safer cities and mental health reform bill--which \nincludes a provision allowing people like Adam Lanza's mother to go to \ncourt and get a civil court order that would mandate that Adam Lanza \ntake his prescribed anti-psychotic drugs.\n  I don't know in this instance if it would have changed the course of \nevents, but I do know it would have given Adam Lanza's mother--whom he \nmurdered, and he stole her guns and then killed these poor, innocent \nchildren at Sandy Hook--an additional tool and may have just possibly \naverted the tragedy.\n  I know there are many families in America today who would welcome \nadditional tools by which they could then help loved ones become \ncompliant with their doctors' orders to take their medication and \nbecome productive people.\n  There is a gentleman named Pete Earley whom I know the Senator knows \nand who has testified here often. He is a journalist, but he wrote a \nbook called ``Crazy.'' It is a book about his son's experience, who had \nmental illness. It is not about his son. The title is not for his son. \nIt is about the so-called system that fails people like Pete Earley's \nson because it doesn't provide the options they need in order to deal \nwith their mental illness.\n  So I do think there are ways we can work together, but as long as we \njust keep making speeches to our respective constituents back home, we \nare never going to do that.\n  I know we are working on the mental health issue now, and I would \njust say to my colleague: I am more than happy to try to find some \ncommon ground on this issue because I do think we need to improve the \nbackground check system for people who are adjudicated mentally ill, \nsuch as the shooter at Virginia Tech. This was a failure of the current \nsystem, where the Virginia law did not require that this mental health \nadjudication be uploaded into the background check system and then this \nterrible tragedy occurred.\n  There are things we can do to improve the current background check \nsystem. There are things we can do to arm parents and families with new \ntools to help their mentally ill loved ones and maybe, just maybe, \nchange the course of some of these incidents of mass violence, which \nare a terrible tragedy. So I make that offer.\n  I know the Senator is not ready to cosponsor my legislation as \ncurrently written, but I would invite him to take a copy of it, mark \nthrough in a pencil the things he doesn't like and can't live with and \ngive me what he can live with, and then we can perhaps begin that \nconversation.\n  I thank the Senator for listening.\n\n\n                     Bankruptcy, Not Bailouts Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I came to speak on the FAA bill, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization bill, but I first want to commend our \ncolleagues in the House for passing some important legislation \nyesterday called the ``Bankruptcy, Not Bailouts'' bill--a bill that \nwill put to rest once and for all the concept that it is somehow the \ntaxpayers' responsibility to bail out financial institutions when they \nfail, putting our financial system in jeopardy. Of course, the idea of \ntoo big to fail was an unfair and, I think, an erroneous concept made \npart of the law in the Dodd-Frank legislation that prioritizes large \nfinancial institutions over the needs of American families.\n  We need to do everything we can to protect taxpayers from having been \ncalled upon to bail out banks. We need to let banks go bankrupt and use \nexisting laws to restructure their debt and then to get back on track. \nSo this is actually a very important step in the right direction.\n  I commend Chairman Hensarling in the House of Representatives for \npassing this important piece of legislation. It is similar to \nlegislation that I have introduced here in the Senate with Senator \nToomey, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, and I hope we can move \nforward soon.\n  I have one other interjection on the whole idea of bankruptcy versus \nbailouts. I read in the press and I hear from some of our colleagues in \nthe House that they think the bankruptcy laws are somehow a bailout. It \nis the antithesis of a bailout. It is the opposite of a bailout because \nwhat it does is it authorizes a court of law under established rules \nand laws to restructure the debt of the bankrupt person or business. In \ndoing so, it allows them to get it behind them and then to get on and \ncontinue to live a productive life as an individual or to deal with a \nproductive business if you are a business.\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\n  But the idea that somehow taking advantage of the bankruptcy laws is \na taxpayer bailout is flat wrong. I hope our colleagues in the House \nhave the courage, particularly as we look at the Puerto Rico situation, \nto realize that at some point, unless we act in the House and the \nSenate to deal with the impending crisis in Puerto Rico, unless we act \nin advance of that crisis, we are going to be presented with an \nemergency situation, and we are going to be asked to bail out Puerto \nRico using taxpayer dollars, and I want none of that.\n  I think all of us who were here during the financial crisis in 2008 \nwould say the same thing: We want none of that. So let's do our work, \nwhether it is ending too big to fail for large financial institutions \nor dealing with the impending bankruptcy and financial crisis in Puerto \nRico.\n  Mr. President, to the topic of the day, for the past few days we have \nbeen working on this legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. Chairman Thune of the Commerce Committee and his staff \nhave been doing some good work and making a lot of progress toward \ncompleting the bill. I hope that cooperation continues and that we are \nable to conclude this legislation tomorrow.\n  This legislation would do some very important things. It would \nstreamline critical new investments in airport infrastructure and \naviation safety to protect passengers and to help them get where they \nneed to go more efficiently. It would also include the most \ncomprehensive airline security reforms since President Obama took \noffice. For example, it strengthens the vetting process for airport \nemployees and addresses a growing number of cyber security threats \nfacing aviation and air navigation system.\n  Most important of all, it puts American consumers and safety first. \nIt does so without raising taxes or adding fees to customers that feel \nlike a tax. You may call it a fee. But if it costs money, it really \ndoesn't feel any different than a tax.\n  I would also like to point out the benefits to States like mine, \nTexas. It protects air traffic partnerships that supports dozens of \nTexas airports and directly responds to requests that I have gotten \nfrom Texas communities looking for new opportunities to improve \nregional air traffic management or expand service in order to meet \ndemand--all crucial measures that help Texas communities move people \nand goods safely through airports.\n  I have introduced an amendment to this legislation with the two \nArizona Senators and the junior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Heller, that \nwould do even more to help our ports of entry by strengthening public-\nprivate partnerships at air, land, and sea ports. The fact of the \nmatter is that financial resources--money--is always in short supply, \nand rather than always coming back to the taxpayer and saying you need \nto pay more, what we need to do is become more creative. That is why \npublic-private partnerships are important.\n  Local communities are willing to join in a partnership with the \nFederal Government to deal with these critical infrastructure needs at \nland, air, and sea ports, and that is what this amendment would do.\n  We have already seen in my State time and again how important these \npartnerships can be to help reduce wait times at ports of entry--at the \nland-based ports of entry such as Laredo, which is the largest land-\nbased port of entry in the United States. If you have ever been there, \nyou have seen the trucks stacked up coming from Mexico. There is \nimportant trade that goes on between our two countries that supports 6 \nmillion jobs in the United States alone. But these public-private \npartnerships have been very successful in helping to deal with our \ninfrastructure needs. It is not just about convenience. It has an \neconomic impact as well.\n  I mentioned that the 6 million people who benefit because of their \njobs depend on binational trade between the United States and Mexico. \nFor example, according to one study, each minute a truck sits idle at \nthe border waiting to come to the United States, even though they are \nlegally authorized to come here to bring goods manufactured or produced \nin Mexico, more than $100 million in economic output is lost or \nforfeited.\n  Let me say that again. For every minute a truck sits at the border \nbecause we don't have the infrastructure to process the truck into the \nUnited States, more than $100 million in economic output is lost or \nforfeited.\n  So this amendment would authorize more of these partnerships, which \nwould also facilitate staffing and better protect legitimate trade and \ntravel and keep our economy running smoothly and keep jobs being \ncreated. I hope my colleagues will consider this amendment and vote to \nbuild on the success of similar programs in the past, both in Texas and \nacross the country.\n  I want to mention one last amendment, one introduced yesterday, as \nwell, that would target the world's foremost sponsor of terrorism. That \nis the country of Iran. Mahan Air is Iran's largest commercial airline, \nand it has repeatedly played a role in exporting Iran's terrorism.\n  We all know Iran as being the No. 1 state sponsor of international \nterrorism, and Mahan Air is one of the ways they export that terrorism. \nWe might call Mahan Air ``Terrorist Airways.'' That would perhaps be \nmore precise. It not only supports the efforts of the Quds Force, a \nspecial unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard, but of another \nIranian-backed terrorist group, Hezbollah.\n  To put it simply, Mahan Air enables the reach of Iranian personnel \nand weapons throughout the Middle East, as well as Iran's proxies, as \nthe regime continues unabated to undercut the interests of the United \nStates and our allies in the Middle East, such as Israel. \nUnfortunately, today Mahan Air is working to expand its international \noperations now that the Obama administration has lifted sanctions as \npart of the misguided Iran nuclear deal.\n  Mahan Air is expanding its operations and adding more international \nairports to its flight patterns, including several in Europe in an \neffort to increase its bottom line. Mahan Air's unfettered support of \nterrorism in the worst aspects of the Iranian regime should give us all \npause. I am concerned about the security risks of Americans who fly in \nand out of the same airports serviced by a Mahan Air aircraft.\n  My amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ncompile and make public a list of airports where Mahan Air has recently \nlanded. I think the public has a right to know that the airports they \nare flying into are being used to service an airline of the Iranian \nGovernment used to export terrorism. It would also require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to assess what added security measures \nare needed. We must protect our country and our citizens from an \nairline that is complicit in terrorist activity.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this commonsense \namendment to the FAA reauthorization bill to help shine a light on this \nbad actor.\n  I will close with this. Under new leadership, the 114th Congress has \nactually gotten the Senate back to work again. It is not just for the \nbenefit of the majority party. It is not just for the benefit of the \nminority party. It is actually for the benefit of the constituents we \nserve, because they are the ones who benefit when we can try to work \nand find common ground and move legislation forward where we can find \nagreement, knowing that there are many areas where we will never find \nagreement because of fundamental principle differences of opinion. But \nthis is another example of an important piece of legislation that will \nbenefit the entire country. It definitely isn't a partisan piece of \nlegislation. So it is something I am glad we have been able to move \nforward on, and I look forward to concluding this legislation tomorrow.\n  It is time we upgrade our air transportation system for the entire \ncountry, and it is time to put the safety of airline customers first. \nThis bill does that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                        America's Coal Industry\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something very \ndear to me and to so many of my fellow Wyomingites, particularly those \nin Gillette, WY, where I used to be the mayor. It is the third largest \ntown in\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\nWyoming. It has 30,000 people. That would be a very small town to the \nrest of the Nation, but here is an effect it is having. This \nadministration has made no secret about its continuous efforts to \nwhittle away at America's coal industry. Well, very sadly, 2 weeks ago \nthose efforts resulted in unprecedented layoffs, as two of Wyoming's \nbiggest coal mines let go of 15 percent of their workforce. My wife and \nI were heartbroken to see these 456 miners suddenly out of work.\n  Besides the mines, there are railroad layoffs because that is how \nWyoming coal is delivered to the other 40 States in the Nation. Outside \nof Gillette, there are 130 coal engines parked, not to mention trains. \nThat means 1,200 railroad workers are out of jobs. Today, Peabody coal \nannounced that they are filing chapter 11 bankruptcy. We will see more \nof that.\n  I know the suffering of the 456 people and the 1,200 railroad people \nsuddenly out of work may not sound so bad in places such as California \nor New York, but in Wyoming, whole communities feel that kind of \nimpact. Folks I talked to in Wyoming are depressed and angry, and it is \nbecause the energy industries they support and rely upon have for too \nlong been the target of bad Federal policies.\n  People have been mining coal in Wyoming since the mid-1800s, but it \nwasn't until the 1970s that the industry really took off. The Clean Air \nAct of 1970 implemented the original restrictions on sulfur dioxide \nemissions, and, suddenly, the low sulfur content, the clean coal from \nWyoming's Powder River Basin was in high demand. Wyoming went from \nproducing just under 2 percent of our Nation's coal in the late 1960s \nto producing 9 percent by the end of the 1970s. That number rose to 31 \npercent by the end of the 1990s.\n  By the end of 2014, 39 percent of the Nation's electricity was \ngenerated by coal, according to the Energy Information Administration, \nand 40 percent of that coal was generated in Wyoming. That year, \nWyoming's 20 mines directly employed over 6,500 workers who earn an \naverage salary of nearly $84,000--almost twice the statewide average. \nThe industry indirectly employs tens of thousands more contractors in \njobs that support the coal industry. The coal industry paid over $1.14 \nbillion to Wyoming in taxes, royalties, and other revenue in 2014. That \nis money that was used for schools, roads, and community colleges \nacross the State. Those are all in jeopardy.\n  With all of this affordable energy, with all of these well-paying \njobs, how did Wyoming find itself losing jobs last week? How did \nWyoming wind up with the fastest growing unemployment rate in the \nNation? Well, I recently ran across this 2011 editorial cartoon that I \nthink helps explain how this administration is bringing down the coal \nindustry.\n  This cartoon was drawn and dedicated to the Wyoming Legislature when \nthey were talking about some similar things. It is still pertinent, but \nwe have to change the tattoo on the arm to say administration, and the \ndates need to be changed to 2012, when the Environmental Protection \nAgency issued its final Mercury Air Toxics Standard rule. This needs to \nbe changed to 2015, when the Department of Interior piled on with its \nproposed stream protection rule and the EPA leased its final Clean \nPower Plan. We need to change this to 2016, when Interior froze the \nFederal Coal Leasing Program. If we imagine those changes, this cartoon \ncan explain how we got where we are today. We are killing the golden \ngoose, the producer of low-cost energy for the United States.\n  Let me expand on those issues a bit further. It is a little hard to \nunderstand with only the titles. In 2012 the EPA finalized a standard \nthat required a strict reduction in air emissions from electric-\ngenerating units. It was known as the Mercury Air Toxics Standards--or \nMATS--rule, and like many of the rules from the EPA, the cost of this \nregulation was immense and the benefits were limited, even if the \nbenefits are calculated over a much longer period of time than the \ncosts. The EPA estimated that the rule would create $500,000 to $6 \nmillion in benefits related to this mercury reduction. It would cost--\nremember that this is $500,000 to $6 million in benefits--nearly $10 \nbillion annually to implement the rule.\n  Luckily the Supreme Court rejected the MATS rule last year, stating \nthat the EPA should have considered costs before setting out to \nregulate mercury from fossil-fuel fired power plants. But the \nadministration wasn't deterred. Last year Congress disapproved of both \nthe Stream Protection Rule and the Clean Power Plan--disastrous rules \naimed at eliminating the extraction and use of low-cost energy--by \nusing the Congressional Review Act. We did so with bipartisan support. \nYet the President did not listen and instead chose to veto those bills.\n  I believe U.S. Presidents should first and foremost seek to help the \ncitizens of the United States, and that means the President must have a \ndeep understanding of the people and the challenges they face. \nPresident Obama and others in his administration--and some seeking to \nreplace him--have demonstrated how woefully little they understand \nabout coal, the jobs that are related to coal, the people who produce \nit, and even the people who use it.\n  Many folks in Wyoming who produce and use coal have reached out to \nme, and I want this administration to hear from them. The \nadministration needs to hear from people like Nancy from my hometown in \nGillette. She wrote last week to tell me about losing her job at a mine \nwhere she worked for 9 years. She is 64 years old, single, and takes \ncare of her elderly father. She has a house payment--a house she worked \nvery hard to keep after going through a divorce. Now she is worried \nabout her house and just wants a job so she can keep her house and \nretire with a little money in her pocket.\n  To understand the impact these policies have on not just energy \nworkers but the communities in which they live, the administration \nneeds to hear about Sarah from Newcastle, which is about 70 miles from \nGillette and about 50 miles from any coal mines. Sarah and her husband \nstarted a carpet and flooring store and had been successfully managing \nit for over three decades. She is sad to see so many in her community \nout of work and fearful that the economic downturn will mean the end of \na business she has devoted her life to creating.\n  The administration needs to hear from Robert, again from Gillette, \nhis and my hometown. He recently lost his job at a smaller coal mine \nand had to uproot his family to move to another State in order to find \nwork. He knows that out West the media markets are small and the \nnational news will never cover the heartbreaking stories of his \ncolleagues and neighbors in this coal market. Robert needs to know that \nmaybe the media won't cover his family's story, but I won't forget \nabout him, and I won't stop fighting the bad policies this \nadministration has created.\n  America has the resources, America has the manpower, and America has \nthe reserves to provide the energy we need for a strong economy and a \nhealthy environment. Nobody knows that better than the folks in \nWyoming, where people for generations have made a good living \nextracting energy from the same lands on which they love to hunt, fish, \nhike, and camp. People are dedicated stewards of the land and want \ntheir children and grandchildren to enjoy it in the same way. That is \nwhy Wyoming coal mines are recognized year after year for their \noutstanding reclamation efforts. You can see that in this photo of the \nbeautiful land in Wyoming where a short time before a coal mine \nexisted.\n  On occasion, I take people out to view the coal mines, and usually, \nas we get close to the coal mine, they say: Oh, don't let them tear up \nthat land over there. It is beautiful.\n  We have to explain to them: That is where the mine used to be; this \nis where it is headed.\n  They say: Oh. If you can change that into this, do it.\n  There are some difficulties with replacing it like this. This hill \nhad to be exactly the same as it was before the coal was removed. If \nthere are stones in there, they have to be put back where they were \nbefore.\n  The ranchers who border on these coal mines think, why would anybody \nmove that much dirt and put it back the way it was?\n  Well, it is the law, and they have been following the law and getting \nphenomenal results.\n  What Wyoming and other States that produce and rely on fossil fuels \nneed is\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\ninnovative policies that will encourage new ways to continue to develop \nand use America's huge reserves of coal, oil, and gas. We are the Saudi \nArabia of coal, and that can displace some of what Saudi Arabia has \nbeen thrusting on us for decades. One of those options is carbon \nsequestration, which Senators from both sides of the aisle in this \nChamber have historically supported. Using that technology, carbon \ndioxide emitted from combusting fossil fuels can be captured and routed \nto secure geological storage, preventing it from being released into \nthe atmosphere, although plants need that. The carbon dioxide can also \nbe used for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas to help ensure \nthat America efficiently utilizes these resources.\n  When a well is drilled and pumped, you get about 25 percent of the \noil out of the ground. There is some enhanced recovery that has been \ninvented and since that time, and they can get about another 20 percent \nout of the ground. That means that 55 percent of our value is still \nunderground. People are working to invent ways to take care of that and \ntake care of the energy we are going to need to be energy independent.\n  Even the White House supports investment in research and development \nprojects to make carbon capture more accessible, deployable, and \naffordable.\n  I hope my colleagues from any State that uses or produces fossil \nfuels will join me in supporting policies to encourage carbon \nsequestration and the use of carbon. There are a number of uses, and \none of those is to get that enhanced oil recovery.\n  Last week was a tough one for Wyoming, but I am proud to be from a \nState that has always found a way to bounce back from any bust. \nActually, what we have is a leveling out, but it is a difficult \nleveling out because for the first time coal prices, oil prices, and \nnatural gas prices are all down at the same time. When you have an \neconomy that is building for growth and it levels out, it seems like a \ndramatic bust.\n  This is not the end of coal's chapter in Wyoming history. I will keep \nworking to make sure of that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that just came \nout today entitled ``The Powder River Basin: Creating a new future in \nWyoming's biggest coal town,'' which talks about some of the innovative \nthings people are doing and how it will help Gillette, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Powder River Basin: Creating a New Future in Wyoming's Biggest Coal \n                                  Town\n\n         (By E reporter, Brittany Patterson, April 13, 2016)\n\n       Gillette, WY.--Laura Chapman's best-selling cupcake is the \n     ``Coal Seam Overload,'' a decadent chocolate cake topped with \n     rich chocolate frosting and dark chocolate toppings.\n       It's a tribute to her home state's top export, a product \n     that eventually is used by 1 out of every 5 homes or \n     businesses in the United States.\n       ``It does permeate the whole lifestyle here,'' she said, \n     from inside Alla Lala Cupcakes and Sweet Things, Gillette's \n     first and only cupcake shop, which Chapman opened in the \n     town's downtown district in 2013.\n       On its face, a specialty store like Chapman's might seem \n     out of place in a town that since its founding has been \n     strongly rooted in producing coal, oil, natural gas and \n     methane.\n       Located in the heart of the Powder River Basin, Gillette is \n     surrounded by 12 coal mines, some of the largest in the \n     country, employing some 5,600 people, according to 2014 data. \n     In a county just shy of 50,000, the mines provide jobs for 1 \n     out of every 10 residents.\n       On a recent March morning, charter buses, similar to the \n     ones that ferry tech workers to the Google and Facebook \n     campuses, head out of Gillette. Yet these buses aren't filled \n     with coders and app designers, but with miners. Pickup trucks \n     sporting long poles topped with bright orange flags follow \n     suit. The flags are to make sure those operating the living \n     room-sized coal trucks don't accidentally engage in an \n     unintentional monster truck brawl.\n       On the south side of town at mining parts supplier L \n     Industrial, a 13,000-square-foot mural is devoted largely to \n     an image of inky black coal being scooped into a coal truck, \n     a train filled with coal passing by.\n       Since 1990, the town's population has doubled to a little \n     more than 30,000, a respectable size in a state where \n     pronghorn antelopes outnumber people. But the promise of \n     plentiful, good-paying jobs has not only brought people to \n     the self-styled, ``Energy Capital of the Nation,'' but also \n     brought tax revenues and prosperity.\n       Wyoming produces 39 percent of the nation's coal, or about \n     382 million tons in 2014, according to the Bureau of Land \n     Management. Because Gillette is so interconnected with coal \n     and other fossil energy resources, it faces a barrage of \n     assaults, both economic and regulatory. Production of Wyoming \n     coal has declined 14 percent since 2011. Late last month, \n     mass layoffs were announced.\n       At the largest mine in the region, Peabody Energy Corp.'s \n     North Antelope Rochelle mine, 235 workers were told not to \n     come to work. Arch Coal Inc. cut 230 jobs. The reductions \n     represent about 15 percent of each company's workforce in the \n     state.\n       A boomtown since its founding, Gillette is acutely aware of \n     the central role that natural resources, especially coal, \n     have played in its existence. And yet Gillette seems \n     determined to survive in a world that is pushing coal out. It \n     has invested in itself and planned for a future where coal is \n     not king.\n       The question now facing Gillette is whether it has done \n     enough: Can this boomtown weather this bust?\n       Shedding a boomtown stigma.\n       Founded in 1892, the city was named after railroad surveyor \n     Edward Gillette. Today, between 80 and 100 trains speed out \n     of the region daily, carrying Wyoming coal to more than 30 \n     states.\n       In the 1960s, oil development about doubled the city's \n     population from about 3,500 to more than 7,000. The rapid \n     population growth spurred violence and crime, so much that \n     psychologist Eldean Kohrs in 1974 coined the term ``Gillette \n     Syndrome'' to describe the social problems that accompany a \n     boomtown.\n       With the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1963 and \n     subsequent amendments in the years after, power plants began \n     turning to Powder River Basin coal. Gillette officially \n     became a coal town.\n       It wasn't until the mid-1970s that then-mayor and now U.S. \n     Sen. Mike Enzi (R) crafted a city expansion plan aimed at \n     changing the public perception about Gillette. A major \n     component included investing in infrastructure to support the \n     growing population.\n       Built on a 19-mile grid, present-day Gillette is an \n     amalgamation of strip malls newly filled with chain stores \n     like Petco and Buffalo Wild Wings. Rows of hotels and motels \n     advertise weekly rates, and newly constructed subdivisions \n     rise out of the hilly landscape. Shiny trucks, boats and \n     campers litter driveways. There are two frozen yogurt shops \n     and two golf courses.\n       Recent growth has been steady since the mid-2000s, which \n     Chapman said has led to more boutique shops like hers opening \n     downtown.\n       About a decade ago, the city and county began investing a \n     sizable portion of revenues from the energy sector back into \n     services for the community. For $53 a month, residents can \n     use the state-of-the-art recreation center featuring a six-\n     lane indoor track and a 42-foot climbing wall designed to \n     resemble aspects of the nearby Devils Tower National \n     Monument.\n       The Gillette that Chapman grew up in hardly resembles the \n     one that exists today, she said.\n       ``Hell, when Applebee's opened 10 years ago, it was like \n     the town wanted to throw a party, because before then, the \n     only chains we had were fast-food restaurants,'' she said, \n     laughing. ``And I know that sounds weird, but that's an \n     exciting thing to realize, `Hey, we've gotten to this point \n     they're going to build an Applebee's.' ''\n\n\n                  Reimagining a city with fewer people\n\n       But as the coal industry feels the pinch, the city's \n     investments are being tested. Gillette is losing people as \n     mines make layoffs, supporting service companies shutter \n     their doors, and oil and gas production falls, said Wyoming \n     state Sen. Michael Von Flatern (R). About 1,500 people have \n     packed up and left in the last year, and he expects another \n     couple of thousand to move on before the summer is out.\n       ``I expect we'll lose 10 percent of our population over the \n     next year,'' he said. Charlene Murdock, executive director of \n     the Campbell County Chamber of Commerce, embodies the \n     interconnectedness of the energy industry and business \n     community in Gillette. She spent nearly eight years with the \n     chamber in the 1990s and then did communications work for \n     energy companies, most recently working for four years with \n     Peabody Energy.\n       She is generous with her laughter but also gives off a no-\n     nonsense vibe, and she is quick to shoot down the word \n     ``bust'' as a descriptor for the current situation in \n     Gillette, preferring to call it a ``softer economic period.''\n       ``Bust, to me, says something like `We have no jobs, we \n     have no people, we have no income,' '' Murdock said, noting \n     that Gillette's latest ``boom'' was more like steady growth \n     for the last 12 years.\n       Murdock sees this period as one of ``leveling off'' in \n     Gillette, even a chance for the community to catch its \n     breath.\n       At the height of the energy boom in the 2007-08, \n     unemployment was less than 2 percent. Houses were on the \n     market mere hours before being snapped up.\n       And yes, she said, this downturn might mean the end of some \n     businesses and services. For example, Gillette might lose one \n     of its frozen yogurt shops. Perhaps, this year, housing \n     development will not occur, she allowed. But whether it's \n     growth or decline, she said, those who have made roots in \n     Gillette are aware that energy commodities drive the economy \n     and uncertainty isn't new.\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\n       ``I really don't see us not having an energy industry in \n     two years' time,'' Murdock said. ``While I think certainly \n     people are apprehensive about what the future looks like, I \n     think they also are resilient, and we'll see that resiliency \n     really pay off for us.''\n       Not everyone is convinced.\n       Greg Cottrell, owner of the Big O Tires in Gillette, falls \n     into the worried camp. He worked for 14 years in the Cordero \n     Rojo mine when it was owned by Kennecott Energy, and he said \n     this downturn feels different.\n       ``We've never had a war on coal before coming from the \n     administration,'' he said. 'We've had coal companies since \n     the '70s. So for 40 years, they've been a very big part of \n     this community and the growth and the reason we have very \n     good schools and hospitals and recreation centers for kids.''\n\n\n                          Looking for a Plan B\n\n       That phrase ``the war on coal'' isn't uncommon in Wyoming.\n       Many in Gillette feel President Obama's environmental \n     policies targeting carbon emissions have doomed the industry.\n       Concerns abound about a decision earlier this year by the \n     Department of the Interior to pause federal coal leasing for \n     three years while the agency conducts a review of the \n     program. All of the mines near here are part of the federal \n     coal program.\n       Another fear is U.S. EPA's Clean Power Plan, which which is \n     expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants \n     32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 nationwide.\n       Gillette is surrounded by, and in some cases part owner of, \n     three coal-fired power plants. Some could be on the chopping \n     block in order for the state to meet its emissions cuts under \n     the rule.\n       Some of the worry is tied to Gillette's deep financial \n     dependence on coal. Revenues from the resource are the \n     second-largest cash stream for state and local governments in \n     Wyoming. In 2014, the total amounted to $1.14 billion.\n       In addition, since 1992, Wyoming has received more than $2 \n     billion in coal bonus bids, which are paid to BLM and the \n     state over a five-year period once a lease is issued. The \n     money has been used to fund schools, highways and community \n     colleges across the state.\n       Right now, Cottrell said, companies that supported the \n     energy industry, especially the oil industry, have closed \n     shop or aren't spending money, at least not on new tires.\n       He concedes that the city is different, bigger.\n       ``We don't have so much of an up-and-down economy now \n     because Gillette is a little more diversified,'' he said, but \n     added, ``I wouldn't call it self-sustaining yet, though.''\n       Last month, the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services \n     reported that Campbell County had experienced one of the \n     largest jumps in unemployment across the state. From January \n     2015 to January 2016, unemployment rose from 3.6 percent to 6 \n     percent. That was before the huge mine layoffs were \n     announced.\n       A population exodus means a loss of sales tax revenue for \n     the city, but a downturn in the energy sector also affects \n     the tax base significantly. Each living room-sized \n     coal truck, road grader or shovel is purchased by the \n     mines from businesses on the south side of town.\n       The city, for its part, has recently re-evaluated how it \n     will invest in major capital projects over the next five \n     years, according to Gillette City Administrator Carter \n     Napier, but with no way to know if revenues from the energy \n     sector might rebound, the city is facing tough decisions.\n       ``The further questions we need to have are with regard to \n     what services we may need to cut and what programs we may \n     need to curtail until we can feel comfortable that revenue is \n     back to at least an understandable level,'' he said.\n       But if it doesn't come back, there might be a plan B.\n\n\n               Meet the man trying to diversify Gillette\n\n       Soft-spoken, with wire-rimmed glasses, Phil \n     Christopherson's current job is engineering, but of a \n     different kind than the former Boeing employee was trained to \n     do.\n       As CEO of Energy Capital Economic Development, his job is \n     to help diversify the city's energy-intensive economy. The \n     two-person entity is both publicly and privately funded and \n     tasked with promoting, retaining and expanding business in \n     Gillette.\n       The state-of-the-art sports complex, events center and \n     other niceties in Gillette were part of that calculation, the \n     idea being that they would foster community and help provide \n     reasons to stay even when times get tough.\n       Expanding the community college is another form of economic \n     diversification, one that required the city, the county and \n     private industry to step up financially. Inside the Technical \n     Education Center, part of Gillette College, students can earn \n     associate's degrees in welding, industrial electricity, \n     mining machine tools and diesel technology. There's a popular \n     nursing program, as well. Inside the Peabody Energy Hall, \n     students rehearse for an upcoming musical performance. The \n     college is expanding and adding an arena, and more dorms are \n     under construction.\n       In 2010, the group partnered with the city to revitalize \n     the downtown shopping district now home to the cupcake shop, \n     a brewery, boutique clothing stores and a meadery, among \n     others. Public art adorns the corners of South Gillette \n     Avenue. Art is also sprinkled throughout town--a lustrous \n     palm tree, a polar bear sculpture and a larger-than-life \n     spider.\n       ``There's never not something to do,'' added Mary \n     Melaragno, director of business retention and expansion with \n     Energy Capital Economic Development.\n       The group's newest endeavor, with help from a grant from \n     the Wyoming Business Council, is to purchase office space it \n     could then rent to new businesses looking to relocate, like \n     an incubator.\n       In the wake of the historic layoffs, Christopherson sees \n     the role of diversifying Gillette as even more important.\n       ``It's interesting,'' he said. ``You have some people that \n     are quite worried and quite fearful, but there's a segment of \n     the population that has stepped up.''\n       Some residents have even started a ``Stay Strong Gillette'' \n     movement, he said.\n       And why not Gillette, supporters say. The city has the rail \n     and road infrastructure, access to cheap and plentiful \n     electricity and a workforce that is used to working hard.\n       Already, one company, Atlas Carbon LLC, has moved to town \n     with a business plan that includes using coal--in this case \n     manufacturing activated carbon (the stuff found in water \n     filters)--but not burning it for energy.\n       Christopherson said he hopes it's enough. He concedes that \n     if the community had prioritized this effort five or 10 years \n     ago, ``we could have helped insulate against some of this.''\n       Still, he doesn't see Gillette existing without coal \n     mining.\n       And he's not alone. Most people in Gillette don't believe \n     coal will disappear from their lives anytime soon, if ever. \n     Instead, the consensus seems to be that the peak of coal \n     production in Campbell County has come and gone.\n       ``There is a way to continue Gillette's economic success \n     and move us into a future that is not dependent upon coal and \n     oil and methane,'' said Chapman, back at the cupcake shop. \n     ``I just feel like there's a way to do it right, a way that \n     lessens the impact on the people who live and work here and a \n     way that lessens the impact on our future.''\n       For now, Chapman said business is good and she is content \n     to continue whipping up cupcakes and baking birthday cakes. \n     Her husband is in the process of opening a whiskey barber \n     shop across the street.\n       ``Of course I'm optimistic,'' she said laughing. ``I opened \n     a cupcake shop, didn't I?''\n\n  Mr. ENZI. If we eliminate coal, it will force people across the \nNation to pay more for their energy.\n  Coal has a good base load. It runs all the time. It is not like wind. \nIf the wind doesn't blow, you don't have it. It is not like solar. If \nthe sun doesn't shine, you don't have it. Coal can work 24 hours a day, \nand it is low cost. There has also been more done to clean up coal-\nburning power plants than anywhere else.\n  We invite people to come to Gillette, WY, and look at the power \nplants and clean air that we have. The only time we get regional haze \nis when the forests burn in Oregon or Washington and blow into Wyoming \nand make our mountains disappear. You won't find coal dust around \nthere, either, because people don't let anything blow away that they \ncan sell.\n  We hope everyone will come and take a look at the environment and the \npower plants so you, too, can say: You know, coal is not bad, and \nAmerica needs it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is now my 39th edition of ``Waste of \nthe Week.'' For 39 weeks I have been back on the floor when the Senate \nhas been in session to talk about unnecessary, fraudulent, wasted, \nabusive spending of taxpayer dollars.\n  We have run up quite a toll--more than I thought we would--but the \nmore I dig into this and the more information we get from the agencies \nthat are looking at how we spend taxpayers' dollars, the more alarmed I \nhave been and the public should be and our colleagues should be over \nhow these hard-earned tax dollars are spent in a wasted and abusive way \nor a fraudulent way. So I am going to keep doing this to alert my \ncolleagues and alert the American people--in particular, people in my \nState--that there are ways we can better and more efficiently use their \ntax dollars or not require them in the first place.\n  This week I am focusing on documented abuse of the Department of \nAgriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most Hoosiers \nand\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\nother Americans know this as the Food Stamp Program. The Food Stamp \nProgram has had some ups and downs in terms of our support, and there \nhas been a lot of bad publicity about the abuse of this program. I get \nmany letters and contacts in my office describing standing in the \ngrocery line and seeing someone use food stamps not for milk for their \nchildren or cereal or nutritious food but for junk food or tobacco or \nalcohol. The program is not supposed to be used for that kind of thing, \nbut somehow we keep reading about potential misuse of what this program \nis intended to do.\n  Now, the SNAP program, as it is now called--Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, S-N-A-P, the SNAP program--exists to provide low-\nincome individuals with their nutrition needs and food items. It is \nfunded by the Federal Government, and it is administered by the States.\n  Let me begin by saying I am not here to do a critique of the program. \nThat is a topic for a different discussion. I am here to talk about \nwhether this program is being effectively run by the States and \neffectively funded by the Federal Government. What we have learned is \nthat--no surprise--as with so many other Federal programs, there has \nbeen gaming and fraudulent use of the program. There clearly are people \nwho don't qualify and are not eligible for receiving these food stamp \nvouchers but are nevertheless receiving them through this program.\n  The government has become modern with the digital age, and instead of \nfood stamps they issue an electronic benefits transfer card. It is like \na debit card that people carry in their wallet. Money is added to that \ncard electronically and it can be used at grocery stores. People swipe \nit. Hopefully, it works better than Secretary Clinton's card worked at \nthe subways of New York. Anyway, you can swipe this card, and it will \ndeduct the amount you have, in terms of the cost of the food provided, \nand it is refreshed on a monthly basis.\n  In looking at the program, the General Accountability Office got some \ntips about the fact that a lot of replacement cards were being sent \nout. We all leave our license on the counter in the kitchen or our \ncredit card and we wonder, ``Where is that credit card,'' and then we \nneed a replacement. This happens. We understand that. So there is a \nreplacement card program available through SNAP. You say you lost your \ncard and they send you a new one. The problem is that GAO--the \nGovernment Accountability Office--learned from the program that a \ntremendous amount of replacement cards were going out to people--\nsometimes over four. Then, they say: Wait a minute. Maybe we ought to \nlook at this because this person has been asking for replacement cards \non a regular basis. Are they really losing those cards or are they \nusing them for other purposes?\n  So they set up a trial program. They looked at three States--\nMassachusetts, Michigan, and Nebraska--and found that more than 7,500 \nhouseholds receiving these SNAP benefits had suspicious transactions \nand were using four or more EBT cards in a year during key times, such \nas when cards were credited with benefits, and all of a sudden the \nrequest came in, saying: I lost my card--and by the way this is the \nfifth time or sixth time or whatever.\n  In totaling all of this, the General Accountability Office said this \naccounted for more than $26 million of suspicious transactions. Now, \nthat was just from the three States. These are sizable States--\nMassachusetts, Michigan, and Nebraska--but they pale in comparison to \nsay Florida, Texas, California, and New York. So if it was $26 million \nof suspicious transactions for just these three States that were looked \ninto, imagine what it would be if they checked all 50 States.\n  So we did some calculations using the same proportion of SNAP \nhouseholds as those identified by GAO as affecting the whole country, \nand we came up with roughly $3.2 billion of waste over a 10-year period \nof time. That is not small change. A lot of people work awfully hard to \naccumulate the kind of money needed to total $3.2 billion and then only \nto see it wasted.\n  People said: Maybe these suspicious transactions were legitimate. So \nwe did a quick search on Craig's List. Craig's List is this list you go \ninto--I know all of the young pages understand this. We old people \naren't necessarily up to speed on all of these new electronic \ntransactions and processes and so forth. I got into it with the help of \nmy young staff. We got into Craig's List and we found that what was \nbeing advertised--see, on Craig's List you put up something that others \nwill want to buy, and it can be anything from a washing machine to a \nlawn mower, to a picture frame or whatever. We found some people \nadvertising these SNAP cards, these EBT cards. For instance, a mechanic \nnamed Marco could--this was not Marco Rubio, by the way--a mechanic \nnamed Marco will accept EBT cards as payment for auto care, he said. In \nother words, if you have a problem with your car, come over to my shop. \nI will fix it for you, and instead of cash, you can give me EBT cards. \nSo probably that is pretty tempting. How much to fix my automobile? \nThirty-five bucks. I have an EBT card. It has $33.47 left on it. How \nabout I pay you with that? He says: OK. I can take that in payment. \nThen they apply for a replacement card. That is probably one of the \nways it adds up.\n  Another person advertised two Beyonce tickets. I haven't been to a \nBeyonce concert, but I actually know who she is. I actually realize, \neven at my age, that she is a star and everybody wants these tickets. \nSo they advertised two tickets for $1,200 and said: We can accept EBT \ncards for payment. Somebody has to accumulate a lot of these cards to \ncome up with a payment for two tickets to a Beyonce concert.\n  Another post on Craig's List reads: ``I have around $1,300 in food \nstamps and have no need for it at all.'' I will sell this card with \n$1,300 in credits if you will send me $300. I guess that raises \nquestions about how these cards are being used, and these are just a \nfew examples.\n  This kind of fraud obviously needs to be addressed. As all of the \nother 38 weeks of ``Waste of the Week'' I have put up here continues to \naccumulate, these cards obviously are not being used--all of them--for \nthose who need it and for its intended purpose. It is clear that we \nought to be adopting GAO's methodology of tracking both the number of \nrecipients that receive more and more EBT cards at specific times of \nthe year and those with suspicious transactions, and I think a lot of \nthis abuse could be eliminated.\n  So what we are doing today is we are adding another $3.2 billion of \nwaste, and we continue to raise the amounts. It is now $162 billion of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. This is going to continue as we alert the \nAmerican people, inform my colleagues in the Senate and the Congress, \nand inform the administration that there are ways to better use, and \nhopefully not even have to request in the first place, the kind of tax \ndollars we are paying for a clearly dysfunctional Federal Government \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the FAA \nreauthorization legislation before us, as well as the managers' \namendment filed yesterday on this key piece of legislation.\n  This is an important bill that will ensure the airport and airway \ntrust fund will remain solvent and that our Nation's airway system--and \nthe countless jobs that are impacted by the system--do not have to deal \nwith a funding shortfall or a lapse in authorization.\n  The airport and airway trust fund finances many of our national \naviation programs. Currently, expenditures from the trust fund are \nauthorized through July 15 of this year. The provisions that ensure \nadequate funding for the trust fund expire at the same time. That means \nthat, absent congressional action, national airway programs and \nprojects will come to a screeching halt about 3 months from now.\n  Make no mistake, this bill is about protecting jobs and consumer \ninterests across the country. No one would benefit from a lapse in \nfunding or authorization as either one would threaten\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nthe livelihoods of people throughout the country. While from time to \ntime the passage of what should be considered routine legislation can \nget weighed down by unrelated issues, no one seriously disputes the \nneed to get the bill over the finish line.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Senate Finance Committee, which I \nchair, is responsible for the tax title of the FAA bill. The trust fund \nis paid for through a number of tax provisions that are set to expire \nin July along with the authorization of expenditures from the trust \nfund. These provisions include longstanding taxes on domestic and \ninternational airfares, taxes on jet fuel, and others.\n  In years past, the Finance Committee has introduced and debated \nlegislation to renew and, if necessary, update those provisions. We \ntypically have a markup and report the legislation out of committee. I \nhad intended to follow a similar course with this year's FAA bill. \nUnfortunately, that isn't how things worked out.\n  As we were working through the process in committee to set up an FAA \nmarkup, it became clear that my friends on the other side of this aisle \nsaw the bill as an opportunity to add a number of extraneous items--\nprovisions that had nothing whatsoever to do with the FAA--to the bill \nand set the stage for a politically charged debate in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Now, I am not one to shy away from controversy, but with an item of \nthis importance--one that is a priority for Members on both sides--I \ndidn't see the benefit for either side in turning the FAA tax title \ninto another wide-ranging tax extenders bill and reducing the robust \ndebate process in the Finance Committee to a series of controversial \nvotes. Moreover, given the small lead time before the authorizing bill \nwas to be up for floor debate, a markup that addressed anything more \nthan the Finance Committee's basic responsibility to fund the FAA would \nhave prejudiced Members on both sides in terms of preparation. For all \nof these reasons, we decided not to mark up the bill in committee, and, \ninstead, to resolve the matter here on the floor.\n  It appears that it has been resolved. There will be voting before the \nend of the week on a simple extension of the taxes dedicated to the \nairport and airway trust fund through the end of Fiscal Year 2017. \nUltimately, a clean extension of the FAA taxes like the one before us \nis probably the best approach. My main priority in developing this \nlegislation was to ensure adequate funding for the FAA and airway \nprojects and programs throughout the country and to do so in a fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n  Over the past few weeks, we heard a lot of talk about adding \nadditional provisions to the tax title and there were some efforts to \nonce again stack this legislation with extraneous items. Indeed, \nleading up to yesterday, lobbyists and special interest groups all over \ntown were waiting with baited breath to see what was in the tax title.\n  Don't get me wrong. I am not a purist or foolhardy idealist. While I \nhave made it clear that I would prefer that the Senate pass a clean FAA \nbill, I know that none of us can reasonably expect to get everything we \nwant out of every piece of legislation, particularly when the goal is \nbipartisan compromise. I am very much in favor of practicing the art of \nthe doable, which sometimes means accepting things I don't want to see \nhappen. I have been willing to work with my colleagues to include other \nprovisions in the tax title in order to get a deal on the overall FAA \nbill.\n  I will leave it to others to characterize what happened in those \nnegotiations, as none of the items under discussion were high \npriorities for me. I will just note that after weeks of discussion, \nfinger-pointing, and a little bit of grandstanding, the decision was \nmade to move forward on a clean 18-month extension of the FAA funding \nprovisions, which once again, was my preference from the outset.\n  Needless to say, I am pleased with the outcome. I wish we could have \ntaken a less contentious path to arrive at this conclusion.\n  Still, this is a good outcome for the American people and for all the \nindustries that rely on a fully functional airway system. The \nlegislation before us will extend the programs for a year and a half \nand provide greater certainty for people and businesses around the \ncountry. On top of that, it will improve security on planes and in our \nNation's airports while also providing much needed improvements to help \nconsumers and airline passengers.\n  I know that the people of Utah in my home State are particularly \ninterested in seeing Congress finish its work on the FAA \nreauthorization. Over the last few months, I have heard from many \ngroups and businesses from Utah and elsewhere on a number of issues \naddressed by this bill, including airport funding, drone safety, rural \nairport needs, and general aviation.\n  Many people, when they think about Utah's airways, probably think \nthat we just have the one airport in Salt Lake City. Make no mistake, \nthat is an important airport, not only to Utah but to air travel and \nshipping all across the country and other parts of the world. But my \nState's interest in the FAA bill extends well beyond the Salt Lake City \nInternational Airport. All told, we have 47 total airports in the State \nof Utah, varying greatly in purpose, size, and overall capacity, all of \nwhich would benefit from this legislation. Many of these airports have \nnew development or expansion projects either underway or in the \nplanning stages. The legislation before us will give assurances to \nthese airports and allow them to plan for future needs.\n  The bill also includes important provisions from the Treating Small \nAirports with Fairness Act, which constitutes section 5028 of the FAA \nbill. This legislation will help a number of smaller rural airports, \nsuch as some of those in Utah, to bring back TSA staff and security \nscreening equipment if certain conditions are met.\n  Under subtitle F of the bill, we have language taken from Pilot's \nBill of Rights 2, a bill that the Senate passed with unanimous consent \nlast year but was not yet passed in the House. The general aviation \ncommunity in Utah will benefit tremendously from these provisions, \nwhich could potentially help thousands of general aviation pilots in \nUtah, saving them time and money in managing their health and fitness \nto fly. There are other provisions in the bill that will benefit Utah \nand most States throughout the country.\n  In short, this is a good bill. From the FAA reauthorization \nprovisions to the tax and funding title, it is the right approach to \naddressing these particular needs, and we need to get it done. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Thune's managers' \namendment as well as the overall FAA bill.\n\n\n       Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk for a few minutes on S. 483, the \nEnsuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. The Senate \nunanimously passed this crucial legislation last month, and just \nyesterday the House passed the bill as well. The bill now goes to \nPresident Obama for signature.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Senator Whitehouse for his \nimportant work on this legislation. He and his staff have been crucial \npartners in helping to move it forward. I am also grateful for the \nsupport of our other cosponsors--Senators Rubio, Vitter, and Cassidy.\n  S. 483 is not a long bill, but it is an important one. It clarifies \nseveral key provisions of the Controlled Substances Act in ways that \nwill strengthen efforts to fight prescription drug abuse while ensuring \npatients retain access to needed medications.\n  As we all know, prescription drugs play a crucial role in treating \nand curing illness, alleviating pain and improving quality of life for \nmillions of Americans. Unfortunately, these drugs can also be abused. A \nbalance is necessary to ensure that individuals who need prescription \ndrugs for treatment receive them but that such drugs are not diverted \nfor improper purposes. To this end, S. 483 makes three important \nchanges to the Controlled Substances Act.\n  First, it clarifies the factors that the Attorney General is required \nto consider when deciding whether to register an applicant to \nmanufacture or distribute controlled substances. The current text of \nthe Controlled Substances Act instructs the Attorney General to \nconsider factors that ``may be relevant to and consistent with the \npublic\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nhealth and safety,'' but it does not provide any guidance as to what \nthose factors might be. This vague language creates uncertainty among \nadvocates regarding the standards they must meet to obtain a \nregistration.\n  S. 483 reduces this uncertainty by tying those standards to \nCongress's findings in section 101 of the Controlled Substances Act \nregarding the benefits, harms, and commercial impact of controlled \nsubstances. This change will bring clarity to the registration process \nand provide better guidance to regulators as they consider applications \nto manufacture or distribute controlled substances.\n  The second change S. 483 makes is to delineate the standards under \nwhich the Attorney General may suspend a Controlled Substances Act \nregistration without a court proceeding. Under the terms of the \nControlled Substances Act, the Attorney General may suspend a \nregistration to manufacture or distribute controlled substances without \ncourt process if she determines there is an imminent danger to the \npublic health and safety. But the Act does not define what constitutes \nan imminent danger, leaving the Attorney General's authority under this \nprovision essentially open-ended. This in turn leads companies to \noperate in the shadow of uncertainty regarding when and whether a \nregistration might be summarily suspended.\n  S. 483 clarifies the Attorney General's authority to immediately \nsuspend a registration by specifying that such a suspension may be \nappropriate where there is a ``substantial likelihood of an immediate \nthreat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled \nsubstance will occur in the absence of an immediate suspension of the \nregistration.'' This will permit the Attorney General to issue \nimmediate suspension orders when necessary to protect against an \nimminent threat of harm, while at the same time ensuring that this \npower does not become a sword constantly hanging over the head of law-\nabiding companies.\n  In addition to these important clarifications, S. 483 will also \nfacilitate greater collaboration between distributors, manufacturers, \nand relevant Federal actors in combatting prescription drug abuse. In \nparticular, the bill provides a mechanism for companies that violate \nthe Controlled Substances Act to correct their practices before the \nAttorney General suspends or revokes their registration. Even \ninadvertent violations may lead to suspension or revocation, disrupting \nthe supply chain for the company's prescription drugs. This in turn can \ncause hardship for patients who rely on the company's drugs for \ntreatment and cure.\n  S. 483 alleviates this problem by allowing companies to submit a \ncollective action plan to remediate the violation before suspension or \nrevocation, thus ensuring that supply chains remain intact. This \nprovision will also encourage greater self-reporting of violations and \npromote joint efforts between government and private actors to stem the \ntide of prescription drug abuse.\n  S. 483 takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription \ndrugs. It clarifies and further defines the Attorney General's \nenforcement powers while seeking to avoid situations that may lead to \nan interruption in the supply of medicine to suffering patients. It \nreflects a measured, carefully negotiated compromise between \nstakeholders and law enforcement that will enable both to work together \nmore effectively. Most importantly, it will make a meaningful \ndifference in our homes and communities.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation, \nand I urge the President to sign it into law.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                        Remembering Ray Thornton\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, Arkansas lost a political legend today \nwhen former Congressman Ray Thornton passed away at the age of 87.\n  Ray Thornton grew up in Sheridan, the child of two teachers. Ray's \nintellect and quick wit was evident from an early age. He graduated \nfrom high school at just 16 years old. He then headed off to the \nUniversity of Arkansas, eventually winning the Navy Holloway Program \nscholarship to attend Yale University. After college, Ray heeded what \nwould be the first of several calls to serve his country and joined the \nU.S. Navy, where he served 3 years with the Pacific Fleet during the \nKorean war.\n  After leaving the Navy, Ray returned home to Arkansas, earned a law \ndegree from the University of Arkansas, and married Betty Jo, with whom \nhe raised three daughters.\n  Ray began a successful legal career before being elected attorney \ngeneral in 1970. After one term, Ray was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives from Arkansas's Fourth District. Ray served with \ndistinction, including on the Judiciary Committee, where he helped \ndraft the articles of impeachment against President Nixon.\n  In 1978, he narrowly lost an epic Senate primary fight, featuring \nhim, fellow Congressman and later Governor Jim Guy Tucker, and \nGovernor, later Senator, David Pryor. He then returned to the family \nbusiness of education, becoming the only man to serve as president of \nboth Arkansas State University and the University of Arkansas.\n  Ray returned to politics in 1990, winning election to the House of \nRepresentatives again, this time from Arkansas's Second District, \nserving another three terms. Representing the Little Rock area, Ray was \nPresident Clinton's Congressman, yet he voted against the President's \nsignature budget in 1993. Also, around this time, Arkansans passed an \namendment to our State's Constitution limiting the terms of Federal \nofficeholders.\n  In the ensuing landmark case, U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, the \nSupreme Court held that States cannot add additional qualifications to \nFederal offices, including a limitation on terms. Ray was the named \ndefendant and believed in this constitutional principle. But shortly \nafter the decision, he announced his retirement from Congress, proving \nthat the case was never really about him but rather his devotion to the \nConstitution.\n  On a personal note, I got to know Ray as he prepared to retire from \nCongress. Thanks to the recommendation of a family friend who worked \nfor Ray, I interned at Ray's Little Rock office for a few weeks in the \nsummer of 1996. Rather than the usual intern routine of ``clips''--for \nyou pages down front, that is when interns literally clip stories out \nof the newspaper--I spent days and days at a storage unit in southwest \nPulaski County, sorting through more than a quarter century of Ray's \npublic papers and preparing them for the archives under the supervision \nof his longtime, matchless advisor, Julie Baldridge.\n  It was a fascinating history lesson in Arkansas politics, and it \nhighlighted a common theme of Ray's career: his commitment to do the \nright thing, as he saw the right, even when it was the tough thing. \nWhether it was impeachment, that 1993 budget vote, or the term limit \ncase, Ray stood his ground. But Ray did not leave public life after \nCongress, for he answered another call to service, this time on the \nArkansas Supreme Court, where he served until 2005.\n  Now Ray has gone home to his Maker. While we join his family and \nfriends in mourning the loss, we also celebrate his long, well-lived \nlife in service to our country and Arkansas. Rest in peace, Ray \nThornton.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Rounds pertaining to the introduction of S. 2796 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we are trying to determine whether \nwe\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nhave a path forward for an energy bill we have been working on for \nmonths, as well as the FAA reauthorization, I thought I would take the \ntime to come to the floor to speak about the importance of this much \nneeded Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization, recognizing the \nimportance of what the FAA does. It is just a reminder to us that when \nwe delay needed reforms and those initiatives that provide some \ncertainty of funding for airport improvements, it doesn't help us out \nhere, and that making sure we are attending to these matters in a \ntimely manner is important.\n  I think it is fair to say that all of us in this body travel a fair \nbit. Most everyone, seemingly, will fly home to their respective \nStates, visit with their constituents, and be with their families on \nweekends. Some of us who are from farther away make efforts to be back \nhome as often as we can, but the distances might complicate it a little \nbit more. But I think it is fair to say that we see firsthand the \ninside of many of our Nation's airports and see firsthand those areas \nwhere improvements can certainly be made.\n  In my State of Alaska, for some of us the airport is almost as common \nand matter-of-fact as going to the grocery store. It seems as though we \nare in and out of our small airports so much because it is how we get \naround. In a State where 80 percent of our communities are not \nconnected by a road, how do you get around? How do you get to \nDillingham? How do you get to Fort Yukon? Well, you can take a boat. \nYou could take a snow machine in the winter. But the fact is, we fly. \nWe are a flying State. And it is not a matter of flying because it is a \nvacation or a business trip. It is to go see the doctor. It is to go to \nhigh school. It is to go to the grocery store--literally to the grocery \nstore. So many of the people in the outlying rural parts of the State \nwill fly to Anchorage so they can shop at Costco, and instead of taking \nluggage back home with them, they take toilet paper, diapers, canned \ngoods, and their grocery items. In one community, we have kids who \nliterally instead of a schoolbus to get to school, they take a small \nplane to fly across the river that separates their community from the \nschool.\n\n  We are working to get them a bridge. Some might suggest these are \nbridges to nowhere. We think this is about connecting people. Right now \nit is pretty limited in our ability to move in and out. When we talk \nabout flying, for us in Alaska, it is a very matter-of-fact way to \ntravel. It is no frills.\n  You come from a cold State, Mr. President. You know that if you and \nyour family are going on a long trip out on the road and you are going \nto be in the high mountains and the roads might be treacherous and it \nis cold, you will be smart and you will pack some snow gear in the \ntrunk. You might have some emergency supplies there. We do that when we \nare flying on the airplanes too. Make sure you have snow pants and \nboots on because sometimes these airplanes are cold, and unfortunately \nsometimes things happen. This is a fact of life, and I think the Alaska \ndelegation probably logs as many miles as any Members out there--\nperhaps our friends from Hawaii just a little bit more. It is a part of \nwho we are. We have come to rely on that access with a pragmatism that \nperhaps some others don't necessarily appreciate.\n  I can be at Reagan National, and if a plane is canceled or there is a \nmechanical problem, the tension is almost so thick you can cut it with \na knife. People are so frustrated. If your flight gets grounded in \nAlaska, it is like, well, the weather has set in. My sister lived on \nthe Aleutian Islands for many years in a community called Unalaska. \nWhen she needed to take her family into Anchorage some 800 miles or so \naway for medical care or any other issues that presented themselves \nthat she would have to go to town, she basically planned for 3 days on \neither end of her trip because weather shuts you in.\n  I was in Fairbanks, AK, on a field hearing for the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee 2 weeks ago, and it was a quick day trip up and \nback, but there was no plane that came my way. In fact, all the planes \nwere grounded in Fairbanks because a volcano blew about 800 miles to \nthe south and the winds were strong. It picked up the volcanic ash and \ndeposited it all the way from Pavlof Volcano, down in the Aleutians, up \nto Barrow and down into the interior of Fairbanks. So what do we do? We \ndon't panic. I was able to spend the night with my sister, catch up on \nfamily stuff, rent a car, and drove the 7 hours to Anchorage the next \nday. It messed up my schedule, but it is a matter-of-fact part of \nflying in Alaska. At the end of that week, I took a quick supposedly \nday trip to Kodiak to attend our commercial fishing symposium. Halfway \nthrough the day, weather kicked up again. It wasn't a volcano, but it \nwas pretty tough winds, rain, and fog. While the airport wasn't shut \ndown, the airplanes weren't flying. You find a friend's house to go \ncamp out for the evening, and you hope the skies are favorable the next \nday. You don't want to press the weather because when you are in the \nair and you are flying, you want to be safe.\n  I don't tell you these stories to be dramatic about what happens with \nvolcanos and weather in Alaska but to speak to how integral air \ntransportation is to people in my State. A good airport, a reliable \nflight schedule, this is the equivalent of having a good road and a \ngood car on the road.\n  I look very critically and very carefully at things such as the FAA \nReauthorization Act because some of what we deal with in this measure \nis effectively a matter of life safety for many of my constituents. \nSome of those for whom flight is the only option in my State live in \nthe small community of Little Diomede. Little Diomede is about 16 miles \noff the coast of Alaska. It is in the middle of the Bering Strait. You \nmay have heard of Little Diomede because it is 2\\1/2\\ miles from Big \nDiomede. Little Diomede is owned by the United States. Big Diomede is \nowned by Russia. So when you hear that statement about you can see \nRussia from Alaska, when you are on Big Diomede, that is a true \nstatement.\n  When you are sitting in this small island community of some 110 \npeople, your hub community for food, for health care, for pretty much \nanything is Nome, AK. That is where you go. During the summertime, \nduring the time when the ice is not frozen over in the Bering Strait, \nliterally the only way to get in and out is by helicopter because the \nisland is so small and it is such a peaked island--basically a big rock \ncoming out of the water--there is no flat space for a runway. So you \nhave a helicopter that provides for medical in and out and travel in \nand out. In the winter, the residents will actually carve a runway into \nthe ice so planes can land on the ice to deliver essential products, \nwhether it is food or medicine or the such. Sometimes you can't put the \nrunway on the ice because the ice has been so compressed and jumbled \nand you have ice ridges that don't allow for a place to land. Again, \nyou are back to helicopter.\n  The good news for the residents of Little Diomede--and this is thanks \nto the good work of my colleague Senator Sullivan--Little Diomede will \nbe joining the other 43 communities in the State that are part of the \nEssential Air Service, and this will help provide funding to keep the \nairport open so people can continue to live in a place they have lived \nfor generations.\n  Nowhere in this country is Essential Air Service so vital. The reason \nthey call it Essential Air Service is because it is essential. In a \nplace like Little Diomede, it is essential. Forty-three communities in \nthe State of Alaska, compared to 113 across the rest of the country, \nare in Alaska. Many of these locations are only accessible by air. As \nwith Little Diomede, you don't have a road in, you don't have a road \nout. It truly does make the phrase ``Essential Air Service'' have \nmeaning.\n  Another community you have heard me speak about at great length--and \nin fact we are going be having a hearing focused on King Cove, AK. King \nCove is a community that is at the beginning of the Aleutian chain. \nThis is a community that has no road access in or out. It is accessible \nonly by plane. It is an area that suffers from some very difficult \nweather conditions because of where it sits on the peninsula--the \nmountains, the ocean. The dynamics are such that it doesn't allow their \nsmall airport to be open for about one-third of the year. Think about \nthat--getting goods in and out, getting people in and out, getting to \nsafety if there is a medical emergency. There is a small airstrip there \nin King Cove. It\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\nis about 3,500 feet long. It is made of gravel. We have been working to \ntry to get access for the people of King Cove for about 25 years, \naccess to the State's second longest runway, which is in Cold Bay.\n  We have an opportunity tomorrow morning in the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources to shine a spotlight on this issue, to remind \npeople that since 1980 we have had 19 people die due to plane crashes \nor injured residents who have waited for a safe way out. I have brought \nup this issue with Secretary Jewell so many times I can't count it, but \nshe continues to be a blockade and refuses to allow a road to be built \nso these people can gain safe passage.\n\n  Since 2013, there have been 42 medevacs out of King Cove; 16 of them \ncarried out by the Coast Guard. This is one of those examples where if \nyou have people who live in a place where the elements and their \ngeography dictate a level of concern for safety, where we can provide \nfor safe transportation systems, where we can provide them the access \nto the best air transportation possible, which is over in Cold Bay, \nthen we should be trying to do that.\n  The last issue I want to raise with the FAA bill that is very \nimportant is all that is going on with unmanned aerial systems. Alaska \nis home to one of the six official FAA sites for unmanned aerial \nsystems. It is managed by the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The Pan-\nPacific UAS Test Range Complex is huge. It covers an area from the \nArctic all the way down to the tropics. In Alaska, we have six test \nranges. I think it is fair to say that provides some pretty unique \nrange for an opportunity to conduct experiments.\n  In addition to incredible range, the Arctic itself offers a unique \nopportunity for testing our UAS. It is vast. It is remote. You are away \nfrom the congestion of the lower 48. You are in different climate \nconditions. So this is something where Alaska truly has been leading \nand pioneering, and we are very proud of that.\n  I am encouraged that this bill requires the Department of \nTransportation to develop a plan allowing UAS to operate in designated \nareas of the Arctic 24 hours a day and beyond line of sight. I think \nthis is important not only from the research perspective but hopefully \nfor the commercial purposes as well.\n  I think it is fair to say there is good work, strong work that has \ngone into this FAA reauthorization. I commend the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Thune, for his leadership, and I look \nforward to its passage in the very short term. I will certainly stand \nin support of that measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  MS. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nFederal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016. I wish to \nthank Senators Thune and Nelson for their work on this bipartisan bill. \nThe Presiding Officer also serves on the Commerce Committee. Thank you.\n  I also thank Senator Murkowski because in 2013 we worked together to \npass the Small Airplane Revitalization Act, and the law requires the \nFAA to move forward with modernizing the Part 23 safety certification \nprocess for small airplanes. Updating the Part 23 process--why we \nbrought the bill together and passed it--will improve safety, decrease \ncosts, and encourage innovation for American small airplane \nmanufacturers.\n  The bill before us actually builds on those efforts by requiring the \nFAA to finish the Part 23 rulemaking by the end of the year and make \nfurther reforms to the certification process. It will also help to \nensure greater coordination with FAA regional officers when they \ninterpret and implement FAA rules and regulations so that the aviation \nindustry has certainty. There are also are provisions to help the FAA \nand industry maintain global leadership on safety at a time when the \naviation market is becoming increasingly competitive and global.\n  Senator Murkowski and I have similar but different interests here. In \nAlaska, of course, people fly on a lot of small planes to get places, \nand in Minnesota we do the same thing, but we also make planes. We have \none of the biggest domestic manufacturers, Cirrus, in Duluth, MN, and \nso we share an interest in the safety of small planes and also in \nexpediting these safety regulations and getting them approved. It has \nbeen taking the FAA a while to do that, so we are really glad this bill \nbefore us, the FAA reauthorization, actually includes a deadline so \nthat this can get done.\n  Last week I spoke about the security elements of this bill. I am a \ncosponsor of the amendments that we passed to strengthen airport \nsecurity, improving security in nonsecure areas of the airport, such as \nthe check-in and baggage claim, and also tightening airline employees' \naccess to secure areas of our airport. Those are important security \nadvancements and show how we can make bipartisan progress on an \nimportant issue.\n  My airport has been experiencing significant delays in processing \npassengers. There has been a bit of an improvement since the Homeland \nSecurity TSA Administrator actually came out and saw for himself what \nwas going on, and as a result, they gave us additional dog teams--\nsimilar to what we are talking about in this bill--to help us with \nsecurity. In this case they also walk the longer lines of passengers. \nOnce they are able to use the dogs, which are highly efficient and \ngood, it will help to expedite the lines because the passengers become \nthe equivalent of a precheck passenger, and they can move them along \nfaster.\n  When I first heard we were getting a few dog teams, I wasn't sure if \nthat would actually solve our problem when the average line was up to \n45 minutes, and as a result many people would miss their planes. We \nhave seen some improvement, including adjusting to the reconfiguration \nat our airport.\n  Another issue the bill addresses that I think is really important is \nhuman trafficking. During the Commerce Committee markup, we adopted my \nStop Trafficking on Planes Act as an amendment. This bill, which \nSenator Warner and I introduced, will require training for flight \nattendants so they can recognize and report suspected human \ntrafficking. Flight attendants are on the frontlines in the battle \nagainst trafficking, and this amendment will ensure they have the \ntraining they need to help prevent the horror and violence women and \nchildren suffer as victims of human trafficking. Obviously, Senator \nCornyn and I led a significant bill last year on this issue to give our \nlaw enforcement some better tools to be able to go after these \nperpetrators, and this is really a continuation of that work.\n  There is another important safety priority which I am concerned this \nbill does not address. I filed an amendment with Senators Moran and \nInhofe to clarify that the Oklahoma City aircraft registry office \nprovides essential services and should remain open during a government \nshutdown. One might wonder why the Senator from Minnesota is concerned \nabout the Oklahoma City aircraft registry office. The reason for the \nconcern is that every aircraft sold domestically, exported, or imported \nto the United States must be registered and obtain FAA approval. These \nregistrations are vital to the safety of our national airspace system, \nand they are all processed by the Oklahoma City aircraft registry \noffice.\n  In addition to the safety risk from closing the registry office--and \nthat is what occurred during the shutdown--we saw that it had a \ndevastating economic impact. The company I am talking about, Cirrus, \nwhich makes these jets, had jets lined up in a warehouse for weeks and \nweeks and weeks--multimillion dollar products that were supposed to be \nsold around the world. They were unable to ship them out because this \nparticular office in Oklahoma had been shut down. The General Aviation \nManufacturers Association estimates that $1.9 billion worth of aircraft \ndeliveries were delayed during the last shutdown, putting a severe \nstrain on many general aviation manufacturers and their employees.\n  The Oklahoma City aircraft registry office is vital to the safety of \nour national airspace system and the economic well-being of our \naviation sector. An entire sector was shut down because they couldn't \nget approval to keep selling their planes for a number of weeks. I urge \nmy colleagues to support my amendment to ensure that this important \noffice remains open in case we have another shutdown, which we all hope \ndoes not occur.\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\n  The last issue I came to the floor to speak about in terms of a \ngrouping of provisions in this bill is the Safe Skies amendment. I am \non this amendment with Senator Boxer. She is leading this amendment, \nwhich is based on her bill, the Safe Skies Act. This bill will close \nthe so-called cargo carve-out. There is absolutely no reason to exempt \ncargo pilots from the stronger pilot fatigue rules that we all passed \nand Congress mandated after the tragic 2009 crash of Colgan Flight 3407 \noutside of Buffalo.\n  I met those family members, I have seen the tragedy, and I have \ntalked to others who have been in other crashes that were the results \nof pilot fatigue. We had our own tragic air crash in Minnesota when \nSenator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila died in a small airplane, \nnot a commercial airplane, due to pilot error. That pilot supposedly \nhad not slept for a long time, and so we have seen this in my own \nState.\n  Cargo airline operations share the same airspace as passenger \nairplanes, the same runways, and the same airports as the rest of the \nairline industry and the flying public. A tired pilot is a danger not \nonly to himself or herself but to others in the air and to those on the \nground.\n  This issue is a top priority at NTSB. They want to have this loophole \nclosed, and I don't know how it could be more telling than this \ndialogue. This happened in 2013 when two cargo airline pilots were \ntragically killed in a crash near the airport in Birmingham, AL. I will \nread an excerpt, which is right here on the chart, from the cockpit \nvoice recorder on that flight. These were the two pilots speaking to \neach other just 20 minutes before this flight went down.\n\n       Pilot 1: I mean, I don't get that. You know, it should be \n     one level of safety for everybody.\n\n  They are actually discussing the fact that these rules don't apply to \nthem. They are not protected. They don't have the 8-hour flying rule, \nand then they can rest.\n\n       Pilot 2: It makes no sense at all.\n       Pilot 1: No it doesn't at all.\n       Pilot 2: And to be honest, it should be across the board. \n     To be honest in my opinion whether you are flying passengers \n     or cargo . . . if you're flying this time of day--\n\n  They often fly in the evenings--\n\n     you know fatigue is definitely . . .\n       Pilot 1: Yeah . . . yeah . . . yeah . . .\n       Pilot 2: When my alarm went off I mean I'm thinkin' I'm so \n     tired.\n       Pilot 1: I know.\n\n  Twenty minutes later, this plane crashed, and both of the pilots were \nkilled. We shouldn't have to wait for more tragedies before we close \nthis gap in aviation safety.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support Senator Boxer's amendment and \ncreate a uniform rest standard for all pilots. I don't know how much \nclearer it can be when the actual pilots who crashed were discussing \nthe fact that they were too tired because of the way the cargo rules \nwork.\n  This bill--the general bill that is before us--makes great strides in \naviation security and safety. I think there are some things we can add \nto this bill. By the way, Captain Sully Sullenberger did an event \nyesterday with Senator Boxer and me. He feels strongly about this \nissue. He was the one who made that miraculous landing in New York. He \nstood with us and a bunch of pilots and said there is absolutely no \ndifference between flying cargo and flying people; it is just a \ndifferent kind of cargo.\n  I look forward to continuing to work on these amendments, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this long-term FAA reauthorization and avoid \nthe uncertainty of further short-term extensions. I hope we will be \nable to have a vote on this very important safety amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to talk about the \nurgency of our passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in \nthe House of Representatives. This is legislation that passed the \nSenate with a 94-to-1 vote about a month ago. In fact, the Senator from \nMinnesota, who just spoke, Ms. Klobuchar, is one of the four original \ncosponsors of this legislation. She is one of those who feels so \npassionately about it, along with Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nAyotte.\n  When this came bill came up for a vote, all but one Senator said that \nthis is important, it is urgent, and we need to address it. Passing it \nin the Senate with that kind of a vote meant that the House of \nRepresentatives would likely take it up quickly, partly because over \nthe last 3 years we worked with the House. We didn't just make this \nbipartisan, we made it nonpartisan. We didn't just make it a Senate \nproject, we made it a House-Senate project. It was bicameral. We \nintroduced the same legislation in the Senate that they introduced in \nthe House. I believe there are 119 cosponsors of that bill in the \nHouse.\n  It has been subject to a lot of hearings over here. It has been \nsubject to five different summits here in Washington, DC. We brought \nexperts from all over the country to tell us what to do. We don't have \nall the best ideas here in Washington, so we got the ideas from around \nthe country. One reason the legislation got this strong vote of 94 to 1 \nin the Senate is that it does address the problems people see in their \ncommunities.\n  I want the House to act on this because it is so urgent. This \nlegislation will help right away in terms of helping to prevent drug \nabuse, helping young people to make the right decisions, and helping \npeople get into treatment and recovery which is evidence-based and \nworks, rather than people overdosing and dying from this heroin and \nprescription drug epidemic.\n  It has been more than a month since we voted on this bill in the \nSenate. Every day it is estimated that 120 Americans die from drug \noverdoses. That means we have lost more than 3,800 Americans to drug \noverdoses since the legislation passed the Senate. We can't wait. We \nhave to move, and we have to move quickly on this because it is an \nepidemic.\n  The experts say that from 2000 to 2014, the rate of overdose deaths \ndoubled, leaving nearly half a million Americans dead from drug \noverdoses. That is why we call it an epidemic.\n  In Ohio alone, we have lost 160 Ohioans since the Senate passed CARA. \nSince 2007, drug overdoses have killed more Ohioans than car accidents. \nCar accidents used to be the No. 1 cause of accidental deaths in Ohio, \nand now it is drug overdoses. It is probably true in your State too.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, Ohio now has the \nfifth highest overdose death rate in the country--top five, not \nsomething to be proud of. Statewide, overdose deaths more than tripled \nfrom 1999 to 2010. We have been told that over 200,000 Ohioans are \naddicted to opioids right now. It is not slowing down. Unfortunately, \nthis crisis continues, and therefore our response cannot slow down. In \nfact, it needs to speed up.\n  Washington is not going to solve this problem. It will be solved in \nour communities back home, but we can help. We can be better partners, \nand that is what the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, \ndoes. It makes Washington a better partner to be able to save lives.\n  Last week I talked about how it is affecting one of our cities in \nOhio--Cleveland, OH. I would like to update everybody here and my \ncolleagues in the House about what is happening in Cleveland, OH. From \nMarch 10, which was the day we passed CARA, to March 27, the latest \ndate for which we have statistics, 29 people died from overdoses, and \nthat is in one 17-day period in one city. Over the course of one long \nweekend during that period, eight men and four women died of overdoses. \nDuring one long weekend in one city, 12 Ohioans overdosed, which \nincluded a 21-year-old and a 64-year-old. Some of the victims were \nWhite, some of the victims were African American, some of the victims \nwere from the suburbs, and some of the victims from were from the inner \ncity. This is affecting all ages, all races, all backgrounds, and all \nZIP Codes.\n  Some of you may have heard the story of Jeremy Wilder. He is from \nPortsmouth, OH, one of the areas that is hardest hit in Ohio.\n  In Portsmouth, OH, we had a townhall meeting 6 years ago. I brought \nin the drug czar and law enforcement officials to deal with the \nprescription drug epidemic that was exploding at that point. As we made \nmore progress on\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nprescription drugs, heroin started to come in, which is a cheaper \nalternative, and unfortunately more and more people got into the grip \nof that heroin addiction.\n  Jeremy Wilder of Portsmouth, OH, said he became addicted to heroin \nand sold drugs to pay for his own use. He told National Public Radio \nthis:\n\n       I sold dope to cops, I sold dope to lawyers, I sold dope to \n     doctors. I had a cop that used to drive me to my drug \n     connection--rich kids. I had two good friends that were very \n     wealthy, and because of their addiction, their parents have \n     nothing today because their children just drained them.\n\n  That was on National Public Radio.\n  There is no demographic, no State, no city, no county that is safe \nfrom this epidemic.\n  One of the big issues we have now in Ohio is heroin laced with what \nis called fentanyl, which is an even more powerful drug. In 2013, five \npeople in Cleveland died of overdoses of fentanyl, which we are told is \nup to 100 times more potent than heroin, depending on the fentanyl. In \n2014, that number increased by more than 700 percent. So from 2013 to \n2014, a 700-percent increase to 37 people dying. Last year, by the way, \nthat number more than doubled to 89 people dying of fentanyl overdoses.\n  Over the weekend--4 weeks after the Senate passed CARA--in the middle \nof the day, a man overdosed and died at a McDonald's in a suburban \ncommunity outside of Cleveland in front of a lot of people, and there \nwas a lot of media coverage as a result.\n  In Franklin County, annual overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled in \nthe last decade.\n  In Toledo, we lost 214 people to overdoses last year--a 50-percent \nincrease in just 1 year. We think now that some 10,000 people in the \narea are addicted to heroin or opioids.\n  People in Akron have been heartbroken over the story of Andrew Frye. \nAndrew's mom was a heroin addict. Andrew, his mom, and his grandmother \nall did heroin. Last week, Andrew's mom found him dead at the age of 16 \nin a Summit County hotel room. That was his last week, 16 years old.\n  Summit County, by the way, where Akron is located, has seen its \noverdose death rate double in just 5 years.\n  I think we get the picture. This is clearly a growing epidemic. It is \na problem that must be addressed. As I have said, no ZIP Code, no \ncongressional district is safe from this threat. In Ohio, we understand \nthat. Just in the last few weeks, there have been summits on this issue \nin Cincinnati, in Middletown, in Cedarville, OH. Again, suburban, \nrural, and inner city communities are all affected.\n  On March 23, nearly 2 weeks after CARA passed, the Franklin County \ncoroner, Dr. Anahi Ortiz, convened the Franklin County Opiate Crisis \nSummit. She says she has seen children as young as 14 die of drug \noverdoses. She has seen toddlers and seniors alike die of overdoses as \nthe coroner in that community.\n  There is a sense of urgency across Ohio about this, a sense that it \nhas gotten out of control. It is in the headlines. People understand \nit. Washington could use that sense of urgency too. Communities are \ntaking action. Ohio is taking action. Other States are taking action. \nThe Senate has taken action by a 94-to-1 vote. That means it is now \ntime for the House of Representatives to take action. Right now, the \nHouse version of CARA has 113 cosponsors.\n  This bill was written together with us, on a bipartisan, bicameral \nbasis, to ensure that we could get this legislation through to the \nPresident for signature and get it out to our communities to begin \nhelping to avoid not just these overdose deaths but all the \ndislocations occurring because of this epidemic, all the families and \nall the communities that are being torn apart and devastated. \nProsecutors in Ohio told me 80 percent of crime is related to this \nopiate addiction issue.\n  I know the House majority leader has said he wants the House to take \non this drug epidemic and pass legislation sometime this month. I \nappreciate that, and I know he is sincere. I watched the Republican \nweekly address by Congressman Bob Dold of Illinois. He did a very good \njob. It is clear to me that he is passionate about this issue, and I \nappreciate his advocacy on behalf of those who need our help. But I \nwould say that I didn't notice any hearings or markups this week.\n  We passed this legislation in the Senate. It has been subject to all \nkinds of scrutiny and hearings, and it passed with a 94-to-1 vote. Are \nthere other ideas? Of course there are, and that is fine. But we know \nthese ideas work: better prevention; better education; more people in \ntreatment and in recovery that is actually evidenced-based, and it \nworks; helping police officers to have the Narcan they need to save \nlives--this miracle drug that can stop an overdose from turning into a \ndeath; helping to ensure that prescription drugs are taken off the \nbathroom shelves; stopping this overprescribing by having a drug-\nmonitoring program because most people who are hooked on heroin started \nwith prescription drugs. We know these things. This legislation does \nthis.\n  It provides around $80 million in additional funding going forward. \nThat funding is needed, again, to be a partner with State and local \ngovernments and nonprofits, not to take their place. We know this.\n  Let's get this legislation passed. Let's move this legislation \nseparately. It can be sent to the President's desk next week. We can \nbegin to make progress now. If there are other ideas, that is great; \nsend them over here and we will work on them. We will work on our own \nideas. There is always more to do on this issue. Unfortunately, there \nis always more to do.\n  We know the bill we passed here works. We know it is bicameral, and \nwe know it has cosponsorship in the House to be able to get it done. We \nhope the House will simply put CARA on the floor, pass it by a large \nbipartisan margin, just as the Senate did, and get it to the \nPresident's desk for his signature. This is close to being a historic \nachievement for this Congress and, much more importantly, for the \nAmerican people. It is really one vote away--one vote away--on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives.\n  I will tell my colleagues why it is going to pass. It is going to \npass because Senators from every State in the Union representing every \nsingle congressional district supported this bill. It has the support, \nmore importantly, from groups all over the country, including 130 \ndifferent organizations, stakeholders, the people who represent those \nwho are in the trenches dealing with treatment, in the trenches dealing \nwith prevention. Our law enforcement community--the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs' Association--they all endorse this \nlegislation. These groups understand what is needed, and they want this \nhelp now.\n  This is a unique opportunity for us to move forward. In this \npolitical year, in this partisan atmosphere, this is one issue that \nshould not have any partisanship to it at all. It should just get done.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I crafted this legislation together, again \nworking with others in the Chamber, as we talked about earlier. We \ndrafted it with a lot of different stakeholders from around the \ncountry, holding five forums on various aspects of this debate. These \nforums were here in Washington, but we brought in experts from all over \nthe country, knowing that is where the best ideas are going to be.\n  The best practices around the country are represented in the \nlegislation. We have done this. We have done the factfinding. We have \nconsulted with the experts--with the doctors, law enforcement, the \npatients in recovery, with the drug experts in the Obama \nadministration, including the White House Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, including the Department of Health and Human Services \nand the Department of Justice. We brought in people from all over, and \nthey agree that this is where we can make progress and make progress \nnow.\n  That work is important. It should not be ignored. But much more \nimportant is the fact that people out there are waiting for us. They \nare waiting for us to act. Thousands of veterans, pregnant women, and \nfirst responders are waiting because this legislation affects all of \nthem. Every single one of these groups would benefit from CARA, and \nthey want it now.\n  Think about the peace of mind we could give parents by expanding \nprevention and educational efforts to prevent prescription and opioid \nabuse and the use of heroin so that their kids\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\ndon't make that tragic mistake of experimenting one time--one time--\nwhich is sometimes all it takes. CARA could give them some peace of \nmind.\n  CARA would increase drug disposal sites to keep these medications--\nthese prescription drugs and pain killers--from getting into the wrong \nhands. We are already told by the Centers for Disease Control that the \namount of prescription opioids sold in the United States nearly \nquadrupled since 1999; yet there has not been an overall change in the \namount of pain Americans report. So how do we explain this dramatic \nincrease in prescriptions? Some of these drugs are being abused, or \nsold on the street to addicts. A survey in 2013 found that 4.5 million \nAmericans use opioids for nonmedical purposes. CARA would help make \nsure that prescription drugs don't get into the wrong hands. And set up \nthe drug-monitoring program to better know who is getting these drugs \nand why and be able to stop the inappropriate use.\n  CARA would create law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and \nmethamphetamine and expand the availability of naloxone and Narcan to \nour law enforcement and first responders. They know how important that \nis. They know that if they had more training and more availability, \nthey could save more lives. Again, that is why law enforcement, \nincluding the Fraternal Order of Police, supports this legislation. \nThank God we have them out there. If you talk to your police officers \nand firefighters, you will find that they are doing this work every \nsingle day. They are intervening and saving lives every single day in \nyour community.\n  They know that this addiction epidemic is driving lots of other crime \ntoo. It causes thefts, violence, and human trafficking. Last month in \nColumbus, I met with a group of trafficking victims. These were women. \nThey all told me the same thing, which is that their pimps, their \ntraffickers, got them hooked on heroin and then trafficked them, and in \neach case they were trafficked on this Web site: backpage.com. This \ndrug issue and human trafficking are definitely related.\n  We are told by law enforcement that so much of the crime--the \nmajority of the crime in our State has been driven by this drug \naddiction.\n  There are so many heartbreaking stories, but there are also stories \nof hope. I have heard them firsthand. I have met people who have been \nin recovery, who have made it through to the other side. So part of \nwhat this legislation is saying is that this addiction issue is an \nillness. Addiction is an illness and, like other illnesses, needs to be \ntreated that way. It is a disease. But also, part of our legislation is \nsaying that there is hope. We have seen where treatment and recovery \nthat is evidenced-based can work to get people's lives back on track, \nto bring families back together.\n  I have heard so many stories. I was in a treatment center in Athens, \nOH, a couple of weeks ago meeting with women who are now reunited with \ntheir children for the first time in years because they have taken the \nbrave and courageous step to get into treatment. This grip of addiction \nis very difficult. It is very difficult to escape from, but they have \ndone it. They are now in long-term recovery. They are back at work. \nThey have the dignity and self-respect that come with taking care of \ntheir family and being at work.\n  On March 29, 19 days after we passed CARA, the President spoke at the \nNational Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit in Atlanta, GA. At \nthat summit we heard from Crystal Oertle of Shelby, OH. She told her \nstory of trying Vicodin because someone offered it to her. She became \naddicted because she tried it once. Eventually she needed something \nstronger and stronger, and pills weren't always available and they were \nmore expensive. Heroin was more readily available and cheaper, so she \nstarted using heroin. She would drive an hour to Columbus, OH, with her \n2-year-old daughter every day to get her heroin. Her addiction drove \nher to theft. Her family supported her and begged her to get help. She \nis now being treated. She is more than 1 year sober. She is part of an \noutreach program, the Urban Minorities Alcohol and Abuse Outreach \nProgram. She is taking opiate blockers, drugs that actually block the \neffects of opiates. This is exciting new medication. She is getting \ncounseling. She is part of a support group with other people in \ntreatment. It is working. It is working for her, and it is working for \nmany other Americans. She is dedicating herself to eliminating the \nstigma around addiction to get more people to step forward and to get \ninto treatment because she knows that if you treat addiction like other \ndiseases, it will have an impact on that stigma, more people will come \nforward, and more people will be able to get their lives back on track.\n  There is hope. Addiction is treatable. We are told that 9 out of 10 \npeople who need treatment aren't getting it. Again, this is one reason \nCARA is so important: It will get more people into treatment.\n  As I said before, I take the House leadership at their word when they \nsay they would like to move this legislation and move it through \nregular order. I understand that, but I will say this: They need to \nmove and they need to move quickly because of the urgency of this \nissue, because of the fact that in their communities and in the \ncommunities represented here on the Senate floor, which is every \ncommunity in America--every single State here has a U.S. Senator who \nsupports this legislation.\n  People are waiting. They need the help. We can provide the help. We \ncan make the Federal Government a better partner. We can deal with this \ncrisis.\n  I am going to do everything in my power to protect the people of \nOhio, even if that means continuing to come out here on the floor every \nweek and continuing to do everything I can, including making calls, as \nI did yesterday, over to the House of Representatives; including \ntalking to my colleagues personally; and including telling some of \nthese stories I have told today. People's lives are at stake. We have \nto move this legislation. We need to get it to the President's desk. He \nwill sign it. And it can then begin to make a real difference for the \nfamilies we represent who are so affected by this epidemic.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2200\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, yesterday many Members of the Senate \ncame down to the floor to discuss the importance of equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  Republicans remain committed to enforcing our equal pay laws and \npreventing discrimination. We all believe wage transparency is an \nimportant tool, and we agree that employees have a right to freely \ndiscuss their compensation without the fear of retaliation. This \ntransparency will allow employers and employees to identify what trends \nor factors exist and how they are actually contributing to wage \ndisparities.\n  No meaningful change to overcoming the opportunity gap can occur \nwithout this knowledge. We have bipartisan agreement that preventing \nretaliation will empower American workers and will enable them to \nnegotiate more effectively for the wages that they have earned. \nProtecting employees from retaliation is an issue that all of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans, can agree on. Today we have a unique \nopportunity to pass a bill that will strengthen our Nation's equal pay \nlaws for the first time in over 50 years. Today we have a chance to \nmake a difference for American workers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 278, S. 2200. I ask consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed and that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 862\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the bill my colleague from Nebraska is\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nasking to bring to the floor falls far short of closing the wage gap. I \nwant to speak for a few minutes about why. At the end of my remarks, I \nhave a unanimous consent request.\n  If we really want to offer working women solutions for wage \ndiscrimination, we should instead pass Senator Mikulski's Paycheck \nFairness Act because today women across the country make just 79 cents \nfor every $1 a man makes. This is an issue that Democrats have been \nfocused on for years. I am glad at least some Republicans finally \nrecognize there is a wage gap problem, and I welcome their support for \nfixing this systemic problem. Unfortunately, the Republican proposal \nthat is offered today will not provide the solutions working women \nneed.\n  Many companies prohibit workers from discussing their pay. So if a \nwoman talks with her male colleague about their salary and discovers \nthere is a wage gap, her employer could fire her or retaliate in some \nother way. The Republican bill would make it illegal for an employer to \nretaliate against workers for discussing salary but only when those \nconversations are for the express purpose of finding out if the \nemployer is providing equal pay for equal work.\n  Nonretaliation is only one small part of the wage gap problem. It \ndoesn't provide nearly enough protections to actually make a difference \nin closing the pay gap. In today's workplace, many workers find out \nabout pay discrimination by accident. Maybe they see a spreadsheet that \nwas left on a copy machine or maybe a male colleague's salary comes up \nin casual conversation, but in these circumstances, any worker who \nattempts to address the problem would have no protections from \nretaliation under this bill. The only way to qualify for these limited \nprotections is if a woman uses the magic words that pass a legal test \nwhen discussing equal pay with her colleagues.\n  It is even worse than that. This bill can give workers a false sense \nof security that their conversations about equal pay are protected, \nwhen instead women can still be reprimanded or, worse, lose their jobs \naltogether for finding out their male colleagues earn more than them. \nSo this Republican bill wouldn't even solve the one narrow problem it \nis trying to address.\n  Thankfully, we do have a bill that would address the wage gap. It is \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act that Senator Mikulski has championed. The \nPaycheck Fairness Act would make it unlawful for employers to retaliate \nagainst workers for discussing pay, period. It wouldn't involve a \ncomplicated legal test like the Republican proposal, and the Paycheck \nFairness Act would help close the wage gap in so many important ways.\n  If a woman finds out her male colleagues are paid more for the same \nwork, the Paycheck Fairness Act backs her up. It would empower women to \nnegotiate for equal pay, it would close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act, \nand it would create strong incentives for employers to provide equal \npay.\n  I want to make one thing very clear. The Republican bill being \noffered today has zero Democratic cosponsors. It is not bipartisan. By \ncontrast, before Republicans politicized equal pay for equal work, the \nPaycheck Fairness Act actually passed the House of Representatives in \nboth 2008 and 2009 with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, since then, \nsome Republicans have decided to make the wage gap about politics and \nblocked it in the Senate. So today I am glad Republicans do agree with \nus that this is an urgent problem. We need real solutions to address \nit.\n  That is why I object to the Fischer bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Paycheck Fairness Act that would tackle pay discrimination \nhead-on.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 862, the Paycheck Fairness \nAct; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the \nbill be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  I have heard many times from my friends on the other side of the \naisle that my proposal doesn't go far enough. Respectfully, I believe \nsome of the provisions of the Paycheck Fairness Act go too far. I take \nissue with the accusation from those who wrongly assert that my bill \nwill make it harder for women to discuss wage discrimination. I \nunderstand that my nonretaliation language is different from the \nPaycheck Fairness Act, but the intent and the effect are the same. My \nbill will protect women and men from retaliation when they learn about \nor seek out information about how their compensation compares with \nother employees.\n  It is clear there is common ground to make progress on equal pay when \nit comes to wage transparency. Every Senate Republican is on board with \nthis proposal. It is a needed update to our equal pay laws. In 2014, \nevery Senate Democrat welcomed a more limited but similar Executive \norder that was issued by President Obama that pertained only to Federal \nworkers.\n  My Workplace Advancement Act goes further. It protects all Americans. \nMoreover, it is bipartisan. Five Senate Democrats are already on the \nrecord in support of this plan. So why do my friends from the other \nside of the aisle not now support my bill?\n  Colleagues, this is an issue we can agree on. It is clear my \nlegislation enjoys bipartisan support, and it can make meaningful \nprogress for American women. While I am disappointed in today's \nobjection to my bill, I hope we can move beyond sound bites because \nthis issue is too important to politicize year after year.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act that my colleague speaks of will inhibit \nemployers' ability to establish merit-based pay systems, and it will \ninhibit employees' ability to negotiate flexible work arrangements.\n  The Independent Women's Forum recently conducted a study on what \nmatters to women when they choose a job. They found that flexibility \nwas a common theme. Whether providing flexible scheduling or offering \nalternatives like telecommuting, women value flexibility, and they \nvalue it at about the same level as receiving 10 paid vacation and sick \ndays or receiving $5,000 to $10,000 in extra income. This is important \nto women. We should be doing it.\n  The survey showed what many of us already know. Every situation is \ndifferent, and by providing more options, workers can negotiate work \narrangements that can suit their own particular needs.\n  With these concerns in mind, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the Senators from Minnesota and Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, in the months since world powers reached an \nagreement to block Iran's pathway to building a nuclear weapon, Iran's \nbehavior has given the international community reasons for both some \noptimism and continuing, serious concern. The positive news has been \nthat Iran has taken some real steps to restrain its nuclear programs. \nIt has disabled two of its short-term pathways to producing weapons-\ngrade material by shipping nearly its entire stockpile of enriched \nuranium out of the country and by filling its plutonium reactor with \nconcrete.\n  Iran has reduced its number of functioning uranium-enrichment \ncentrifuges by two-thirds, and the country has provided international \ninspectors 24/7 access to continuously monitor all of Iran's declared \nfacilities. These are positive developments. Yet, at the same time, \nIran continues to engage in deeply concerning activities, such as \nsupport for terrorism and efforts to foment instability in the Middle \nEast, to\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nconduct illegal ballistic missile tests, and to continue to violate its \ncitizens' most basic human rights.\n  Today, my colleagues and I come to the floor to draw attention to \nsome of the more grave, more concerning developments of recent weeks. I \nam honored to have the company of my friend, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, who joins me in addressing why Russia's \nrefusal to condemn Iran's bad behavior--and, in fact, in some ways \nencouraging it--poses huge security risks for our allies in the Middle \nEast.\n  I would now like to yield, if I could, to my colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to my \nfriend from Delaware, who is truly an expert on this issue, as a member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee. He has been a leader in this area, \nand I am delighted and honored to join him on the floor today to \ndiscuss the ever-evolving and concerning cooperation between Russia and \nIran, particularly in recent months. He has very eloquently and \npersuasively described a number of the concerns that we share. I want \nto associate myself with what he has said here this afternoon.\n  As we all know, Iran has conducted multiple ballistic tests in the \nlast several months. That is beyond question. I have continuously \ncondemned both Iran's ongoing ballistic program and Iran's failure to \nuphold its international obligations under the U.N. Security Council \nresolutions by calling for sanctions enforcement at the Armed Services \nCommittee hearings and in letters to the administration and in public \nstatements.\n  We have been steadfast in this effort. While the administration has \nheeded my calls by enforcing sanctions against 11 entities and \nindividuals supporting Iran's missile program, clearly more must be \ndone. The United States and the international community must vigilantly \nenforce sanctions on Iran's ballistic development, as well as its state \nsponsorship of terrorism and human rights violations which continue day \nin and day out.\n  These steps must be taken to hold this regime accountable and prevent \nTehran from believing it can violate international law with impunity. \nNothing less is at stake here than that principle. Yet Russia has \nrefused to punish Iran. As a world power and permanent member of the \nU.N. Security Council, Russia can and must be doing more to counter \nIran's destructive deeds, including ensuring that Iran abides by U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 2231.\n  This resolution calls on Iran ``not to undertake any activity related \nto ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear \nweapons, including launches, using ballistic missile technology.'' That \nis a quote. That mandate applies for up to 8 years from the JCPOA's \nadoption day, October 18, 2005.\n  In March, one of Iran's defiant tests notoriously involved a missile \nthat had a disturbing and alarming message scrawled on the side: \n``Israel must be wiped off the face of the Earth.'' This explicit \nmessage, by the way, written not only in Persian but in Hebrew, was \ndesigned to directly threaten Israel. That is hardly speculation.\n  It should not be tolerated by any Nation. Even worse than Russia's \nrefusal to condemn Iran's ballistic missile tests, is that Russia has \nessentially rewarded Iran for its bad behavior by continuing--even \nincreasing--its cooperation with Iran through military deals.\n  In February, Iran's Defense Minister visited Moscow to discuss \npurchasing an array of weapons. Any sale of major combat systems to \nIran in the next 5 years would require approval by the U.N. Security \nCouncil under Resolution 2231. But the United States has made it clear \nthat such a sale will not be supported. Therefore, it will not be \napproved by the U.N. Security Council.\n  Media reports in recent weeks have highlighted Russia's shipment of \nparts of an S-300 air defense system to Iran. In addition, Russia and \nIran are supposedly in talks over Sukhoi fighter jets. If such sales \nare finalized and the systems are delivered, Russia would be directly \ndefying U.N. Resolution 2231.\n  Supplying weapons to Iran is particularly dangerous and potentially \ndamaging because it is not done in a vacuum. Russia's growing \npartnership has far-reaching ramifications because Hezbollah, Iran's \nterrorist proxy in Lebanon, also benefits, at least indirectly, from \nRussian arms and military operational experience in Syria.\n  The flow of support from Russia to Iran to Hezbollah feeds into yet \nanother threat that deeply concerns me and our greatest ally in the \nMiddle East and one of our greatest in the world, Israel. Coupled with \ncontinued chaos in the region, the Russian-Iranian cooperation, which \nstrengthens Hezbollah, only adds to the urgency and importance of \nensuring that Israel remains secure, stable, and independent.\n  Last November, Senator Bennet and I co-led a letter to the President \nconcerning the need to renew the memorandum of understanding on U.S. \nmilitary assistance--the MOU, as it is known--with Israel to help that \nnation prepare for, respond to, and defend against threats in an \nuncertain regional environment and to ensure its qualitative military \nedge. There is nothing original or novel about that policy or \nprinciple.\n  The current MOU provides $30 billion in assistance to Israel through \nfiscal year 2018. As threats in the region continue to evolve, \nincluding Iran's malign influence, reinforced and enabled by Russia, \nthe administration must engage at the highest levels to continue to \ndevelop a shared understanding of threats confronting Israel by \nstrengthening the MOU that serves as the foundation of our bilateral \nsecurity efforts. Those efforts support not only Israel, they are in \nthe national interests of the United States of America. Indeed, they \nare essential to our national interests in the region and in the world.\n  While negotiations remain ongoing between the United States and \nIsrael regarding the historic renewal of the MOU, I want to express \nthat I continue to support making the MOU a truly transformational \ninvestment to deepen the U.S.-Israel strategic partnership. It is based \non a shared understanding of the environment that confronts Israel and \nthe United States together. Russia is only exacerbating the threats in \nthe region to our partnership--the United States and Israel--as well as \nto each of our nations.\n  The Russian-Iranian cooperation legitimizes and strengthens Tehran's \nadventurism, as well as the Assad regime in Syria, and threatens \ninternational security. Moscow's affair with Tehran and beyond has \nbrought Russian military might to a network of terrorism that we must \ncontinue to monitor closely and work to combat for the safety and \nsecurity of the United States. It is our security and it is Israel's \nsecurity that is at stake, and the entire international community's \nsecurity.\n  I again thank my colleague from Delaware for giving me this time and \nhis patience in hearing me out. I look forward to working with him and \nother colleagues who are concerned about the Russian-Iranian \ncooperation. They are certainly deeply concerning. I thank him again \nfor his leadership and vision on this topic.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut--who \nhas been determined, engaged, and thoughtful--for his wise words today \nand for his persistence and his efforts in making sure that our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are aware of alarming \ndevelopments in the region and continuing to do everything we can in a \nresponsible and bipartisan way to support Israel's security through the \nMOU, which he has referenced and on which he led a letter about the \nimportance of a prompt and supportive renegotiation of that MOU, and \ncalling attention to Russia's destabilizing actions.\n  As Senator Blumenthal just referenced, recent reports convey that \nIran is reporting that Russia has already delivered parts of this S-300 \nweapons system--a defense system, they claim, but a weapons system that \nwould significantly change the regional balance of power.\n  I again thank my colleague from Connecticut for being shoulder-to-\nshoulder with me on the floor today and in the months and years behind \nus and the months and years ahead of us because it will be a \nlongstanding challenge to keep the Members of this body and folks in \nWashington focused on the very real threat to America's security and \nIsrael's security that is presented by Iran and its actions.\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\n  As Senator Blumenthal mentioned, when it comes to countering Iranian \naggression in the Middle East, a number of Russia's recent actions do \nthreaten to do more harm than good.\n  Last summer, when the United States came together with the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, and Russia to reach an agreement with Iran to \nblock their pathway to build a nuclear weapon, the international \ncommunity was clear that the success of this deal relied on every \nsignatory keeping its word and doing its part to prevent Iran from \nviolating the deal.\n  The responsibility to enforce the terms of the JCPOA goes hand-in-\nhand with an understanding that world powers must also push back on \nIran's bad behavior outside the four corners of this agreement--\nspecifically, its support for terrorism, its continued illegal \nballistic missile tests, and its human rights violations.\n  Despite its participation in the negotiations that led to the \nagreement, Russia reportedly plans to sell missile systems to the \nstill-dangerous Iranian regime, as well as--as referenced by Senator \nBlumenthal--advanced fighter jets. Russia also continues to block the \nU.N. Security Council from taking action--necessary and responsible \naction--after Iran's recent illegal missile tests, which contravene its \ncommitments under U.N. Security Council resolution 2231.\n  Despite the divisions that have brought Congress to a standstill in \nrecent years, I am confident that we all agree on one thing: that Iran \nmust not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. I continue to believe \nthe JCPOA represents the least bad option for blocking Iran's pathway \nto a nuclear bomb.\n  In recent months, as I have said, Russia has repeatedly undermined \nthe spirit of that agreement, using the JCPOA as an excuse to proceed \nwith dangerous and provocative sales of allegedly defensive equipment \nto Iran. According to news reports, as I said, Russia has begun \ndelivering parts of the S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Iran. \nAlthough it is unclear how much of that system has already been \ndelivered, the five S-300 systems Russia has promised to Iran would \ncontain 40 launchers, which could shoot down missiles or aircraft as \nfar as 90 miles away. One version of the S-300 currently in use by the \nRussian military can travel nearly 250 miles at five times the speed of \nsound. In a worst-case scenario, if Iran backs out of the nuclear deal, \nthis S-300 system would substantially limit the international \ncommunity's options to act to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon.\n  That is not all, though. Recent news reports indicate Russia and Iran \nare actively negotiating an agreement to allow Iran to purchase an \nunknown number of Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets--similar to the one \npictured here--some of the most advanced fighter jets available in the \nworld. Although it is unclear what specific version of this aircraft \nIran is seeking to obtain, these advanced weapons would significantly \nenhance the capabilities of Iran's Air Force.\n  Currently, Iran fields an outdated mix of antiquated Russian, Iraqi, \nAmerican, and Chinese-built aircraft. Many of these planes date from \nthe Cold War. One particularly advanced variety of this Russian jet, \nfor example, is armed with air-to-air, anti-ship, and land attack \nmissiles and bombs--precision munitions that would significantly \nincrease the performance capabilities of the Iranian Air Force. They \ncould target other fighter aircraft, stationary military facilities, \nand naval vessels. In the hands of Iran, these fighter jets would \nfundamentally change the balance of power in the Middle East and pose a \nthreat to U.S. facilities and our local allies.\n  More concerning, according to some reports, Iran is seeking not just \nto buy these aircraft but also to license their production in Iran, \nwhich would greatly strengthen Iran's industrial base and its technical \nknowledge. It would also leave the international community with even \nfewer options to prevent Iranian access to this technology in the \nfuture.\n  At a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Tom Shannon, \nthe Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, said the United \nStates would ``block the approval of fighter'' aircraft sales from \nRussia to Iran. I urge the Obama administration to use all diplomatic \nmeasures available to it to ensure that we fulfill Under Secretary \nShannon's commitment.\n  As my colleagues know, Iran could use these weapons to threaten U.S. \nassets in the Persian Gulf region, challenge the safety of our vital \nally Israel and other close partners, or to protect illicit nuclear \nsites within Iran's borders. These threats are not just hypothetical. \nIran remains a rogue and unpredictable regime that supports terrorism \nin the region and is publically committed to the destruction of valley.\n  The international community cannot stand by while Iran continues to \nthreaten our allies and destabilize the Middle East. Its illegal \nballistic missile tests in March served as yet another example that the \nIranian regime is not a responsible member of the international \ncommunity. These tests help Iran to further develop missiles capable of \nreaching most of the Middle East and even parts of Europe, and they \ndestabilize the region and belie Iran's supposedly peaceful intentions, \nstated often by both its President and Foreign Minister. They claim \nIran's intentions are to serve as a responsible member of the \ninternational community, but these provocative missile tests clearly \ncontradict their commitments under U.N. Security Council resolution \n2231 and demand a response.\n  Last week I met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. While Ambassador Churkin reiterated Russia's commitment \nto the JCPOA and our shared goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon, I left our conversation convinced that Russia will \ncontinue to stand in the way of the international community's efforts \nto penalize Iran for its ballistic missile tests.\n  Russia's military sales to Iran and intransigence at the U.N. \nSecurity Council are disappointing, to say the least, in light of \nRussia's agreement to the terms of this nuclear deal and the importance \nof all of us working together in the international community to \nconstrain Iran's bad behavior.\n  The challenge for American diplomacy is to convince Russia that its \nmilitary sales to Iran, its refusal to engage in multilateral action to \npunish Iranian ballistic missile tests, and its hesitancy to sanction \nIran for supporting terrorist groups harm not only American interests \nbut Russian interests as well.\n  Enabling Iran to strengthen its military capabilities makes it easier \nfor Iran in the future to one day return to an effort to develop a \nnuclear weapon. Ballistic missile tests foment instability in the whole \nPersian Gulf and southern Europe, both of which lie close to Russia. As \nwe have tragically seen in recent weeks, the scourge of modern \nterrorism does not abide by international borders and poses a real \nthreat to Russia as well.\n  In the coming months and years, the United States must continue to \npursue action at the Security Council and work with our European allies \nto punish Iran for its bad behavior.\n  With that, I yield to my friend the senior Senator from Minnesota, \nwho has just joined me for the colloquy. Senator Klobuchar has joined \nme to talk about the importance of continuing to work to hold Iran \naccountable under the JCPOA, to urge a need to confirm senior national \nsecurity nominees, and the imperative to support our regional partners, \nespecially of our ally Israel.\n  Senator Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coons for his work. As \nhe stated, Russia's actions are very harmful in the effort to bring \npeace in the Middle East. Russia reportedly plans to sell advanced \naircraft and missile systems to Iran, as Senator Coons noted, and may \nbegin making these shipments in the next few days. These weapons could \nbe used to destabilize the region and threaten the security of our \nallies, especially Israel.\n  Russia also continues to block the U.N. Security Council from taking \naction in response to Iran's recent illegal missile tests. These \nactions can only embolden Iran and encourage Iran to disregard its \ncommitment.\n  Russia, as a JCPOA country, a world power, and a member of the U.N. \nSecurity Council, needs to be convinced that it is in its best \ninterests and in\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nthe interests of the international community that Iran stick to its \ncommitments under the JCPOA. I thank Senator Coons for making those \npoints.\n  As he noted, I also stress the need to enforce Iran's commitments \nunder the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and also to confirm \nnominees for positions vital to national security and to support our \nallies in the Mid East. Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon \nis one of the most important objectives of our national security \npolicy.\n  I strongly advocated for and supported the economic sanctions that \nbrought Iran to the negotiating table over the last few years. Those \nsanctions resulted in a nuclear nonproliferation agreement between Iran \nand the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and \nChina that was implemented in January. But our work is clearly not \ndone. As we have seen over the past few months, Iran continues to \nconduct ballistic missile tests and continues to support terrorism and \nthreatening regional stability. Now we are reading news reports, as I \nnoted, that Russia is selling a long-range surface-to-air missile \ndefense system to Iran.\n  All of this means we have to remain vigilant in our monitoring and in \nour verification. That is why I sponsored the Iran Policy Oversight Act \nand encourage my colleagues to pass it. The bill does three important \nthings to hold Iran accountable. First, it allows Congress to more \nquickly impose economic sanctions against Iran's terrorist activity. \nSecond, the bill expands military aid to Israel. Third, the bill \nensures that agencies charged with monitoring Iran have the resources \nthey need.\n  We also have to reauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act in order to ensure \nthat we can hold Iran accountable if it violates the deal. The Iran \nSanctions Act is up for reauthorization this December and has been a \npivotal component of U.S. sanctions against Iran's energy sector, and \nits application has been steadily expanded to other Iranian \nindustries. Given Iran's history, we can anticipate that it will \ncontinue to test the boundaries of international agreements, and we \nhave to be ready to respond when it does so.\n\n  In summary, we must hold Iran accountable every step of the way. \nImposing harsh sanctions, as the administration must do, against those \nresponsible for Iran's ballistic missile program, which threatened \nregional and global security, is, of course, a good start, but we must \ncontinue to sanction Iran's ballistic missile program as well as its \nsponsorship of terrorism and abuse of human rights.\n  Any person or business involved in helping Iran obtain illicit \nweapons should be banned from doing business with the United States, \nhave their assets and financial operations immediately frozen, and have \ntheir travel restricted. Minimizing the threat Iran poses also means \nworking to ensure that the money flowing into Iran now that nuclear \nsanctions are lifted is not used to further destabilize the region and \nspread terrorism. We must monitor the flow of terrorist financing and \nuse every tool available to punish bad actors who seek to do harm. But \nit is also important for Iran to understand that we will not hesitate \nto snap back sanctions if Iran fails to comply its commitments under \nthe JCPOA. Sanctions were effective at getting Iran to the table and \nthey will continue to be a tool that allows the United States and our \nallies to minimize the threat posed by Iran.\n  We must also continue to work with our partners, including the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, and Russia to ensure that \nthe agreement is strictly enforced. Iran must know that if it violates \nthe rules, the response will be certain, swift, and severe. As Senator \nCoons mentioned, when the agreement was reached, its success is \nultimately dependent upon every country keeping its word to keep Iran \nfrom violating its commitments under the agreement. We need the support \nof the international community to ensure that Iran sticks to its \ncommitments. As we just heard from Senator Coons, Russia's actions are \nharmful to this effort.\n  Russia reportedly plans to sell advanced aircraft and missile systems \nto Iran and may begin making these shipments in the next few days. \nThese weapons could be used to destabilize the region and threaten the \nsecurity of our allies, especially Israel. Russia also continues to \nblock the U.N. Security Council from taking action in response to \nIran's recent illegal missile tests. These actions can only embolden \nIran and encourage Iran to disregard its commitments. Russia, as a \nJCPOA country, a world power, and a member of the U.N. Security \nCouncil, needs to be convinced that it is in the best interest of the \ninternational community that Iran sticks to its commitments under the \nJCPOA.\n  We also need to make sure that we fill vacant frontline positions \nthat hamper our ability to protect our country and work with our \nallies. While I was pleased that the Senate Banking Committee voted 14-\n8 last month to approve the nomination of Adam Szubin as undersecretary \nfor terrorism and financial intelligence at the Department of Treasury, \nthe fact remains that it should not have taken 325 days for the \ncommittee to vote. This position is essential to national security as \nit tracks the source of terrorist funding around the world and should \nbe filled as soon as possible.\n  We cannot delay confirmations if the reasoning has nothing to do with \npolicy and everything to do with politics. Senator Shaheen came to the \nfloor several times to call for swift action on his confirmation, and I \njoin her to urge my Senate colleagues to vote on his confirmation as \nsoon as possible. Our allies and our enemies need to see a united and \nfunctional American frontline. And in order to hold Iran accountable, \nwe have to have these positions filled. It is that simple.\n  The United States needs to limit Iran's destabilizing activity in the \nregion. We need to give our allies in the region the support they need. \nAs the Administration negotiates a new Memorandum of Understanding for \nsecurity assistance to Israel, I, along with many of my colleagues, \nsupport a substantially enhanced agreement to help provide Israel the \nresources it requires to defend itself and preserve its qualitative \nmilitary edge. Israel remains America's strongest ally in this troubled \nregion. A strong and secure Israel remains a central pillar of our \nnational strategy to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East.\n  Those of us who supported the Iran nuclear agreement have a special \nresponsibility to ensure that it works. In fact, this whole Senate has \na responsibility, regardless of whether Members supported it or not. It \nis in the best interest of our country. We cannot shirk from our duties \nand we must be vigilant. We owe it to the American people, to Israel, \nand to our allies.\n  Our mission here is clear: We must protect our own citizens by \nexercising our authority to enact strong legislation to ensure that \nIran does not cheat on its international commitments. Because we know \nfrom experience that Iran will test the international community, we \nmust be ready to respond when it does. We must also minimize the threat \nIran poses to our citizens and the world by doing everything in our \npower to stop Iran from funding the world's terrorists.\n  It is critical that we take additional steps to stop countries like \nIran from funding terrorism and destabilizing the world. Stopping \nIran's support of terrorism protects us here at home, but it also helps \nmillions of refugees fleeing Syria, the children that are starving in \ncities like Madaya, and the families fleeing mortar fire in Yemen. Our \nvalues of justice, democracy, and freedom for all demand nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Klobuchar and \nBlumenthal for joining me in this colloquy, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The majority leader.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 2012\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 2012 \nand that it be in order to call up the following amendments en bloc, \nand that the amendments be called up and reported by number: amendments \nNos. 3276, Cantwell, striking certain provisions; 3302, as modified, \nKlobuchar, modifying a provision; 3055, Flake; 3050, Flake; 3237, \nHatch; 3308, Murkowski; 3286, as\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nmodified, Heller; 3075, Vitter; 3168, Portman-Shaheen; 3292, as \nmodified, Shaheen; 3155, Heinrich; 3270, Manchin; 3313, as modified, \nCantwell; 3214, Cantwell; 3266, Vitter; 3310, Sullivan; 3317, Heinrich; \n3265, as modified, Vitter; 3012, Kaine; 3290, Alexander-Merkley; 3004, \nGillibrand-Cassidy; 3233, as modified, Warner; 3239, Thune; 3221, \nUdall-Portman; 3203, Coons; 3309, as modified, Portman; 3229, Flake; \n3251, Inhofe.\n  I ask consent that immediately following the reporting of the \namendments, it be in order for the Senate to vote on these amendments \nen bloc, as well as the Murkowski amendment No. 2963, with no \nintervening action or debate; further, that it be in order to call up \nthe following amendments en bloc and that the amendments be called up \nand reported by number: amendments Nos. 3234, as modified, Murkowski-\nCantwell; 3202, Isakson-Bennet; 3175, Burr; 3210, Lankford; 3311, \nBoozman; 3312, Udall; 3787, Paul; that there be 2 hours of debate, \nequally divided in the usual form, on the amendments concurrently; that \nno further amendments to these amendments be in order; and that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the \namendments in the order listed, with a 60-affirmative-vote threshold \nfor adoption of each of the amendments with no intervening action or \ndebate; further, that following the disposition of the Paul amendment \nNo. 3787, the Senate vote on the Cassidy amendment No. 2954, with a 60-\nvote-affirmative threshold for adoption; that following the disposition \nof the Cassidy amendment, the substitute amendment No. 2953, as \namended, be agreed to, and that notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture, upon reconsideration, on S. 2012, \nas amended; that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be yielded \nback, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of \nS. 2012, as amended; finally, that budget points of order not be barred \nby virtue of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To clarify, amendments Nos. 3055 by Flake and \n3229 by Flake.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment here to \ncongratulate Chairman Murkowski for what could best be described as a \nlong march. Her persistence and determination to pull this very \nimportant bill together with a lot of Senators with different views at \npoints along the way has been a really extraordinary accomplishment \nand, frankly, has been fun to watch because she certainly knows how to \nmanage a bill, how to get to a conclusion, and she did that in an \nextraordinary fashion.\n  I also want to thank Senator Cantwell, her ranking member. The two of \nthem worked well together, and I think we are on the cusp here of \nsomething very important and very much worth doing for the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very happy we are at this point. This \nlegislation has taken 3 years. It has been hard to get to where we are \ntoday. We can go back to a lot of hurdles that we have had to jump to \nget to where we are now, and we can affix blame to a lot of different \npeople, but there is no need to do that today. We are where we are, and \nwe should accept that with glee.\n  I am gratified we are able to reach this agreement, and that is an \nunderstatement. It is an important piece of legislation. Is it perfect? \nOf course not. But nothing we do legislatively is. We are trying to \nwork things out through compromise. This is a good opportunity for us \nto show we can do that.\n  We have tried to move this legislation for 3 years, and I really \nappreciate the patience of Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire. She has \nworked on this and has been so disappointed so many times. I hope she \nfeels as good as the rest of us.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member of the Energy Committee. She \nhas had other responsibilities before, but those of us who have worked \nwith Senator Cantwell know how persistent she can be. She is tireless \nin advocating for what she thinks is appropriate. So I appreciate what \nshe has done in the last few days to get us to this point.\n  I am grateful that we are done with this and that we are going to \nfinish this bill. We will have to work it out timewise. It will not be \nthe easiest thing, but we should be able to do that. We have other \nthings we need to do. We have an appropriations bill coming up. We are \ngoing to finish with the FAA, I hope, pretty soon. I hope nobody is \ngoing to be demanding a lot of postcloture time on that.\n  So I would hope, Mr. President, we can use this as a pattern for what \nwe can do in the future to get things done for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge and thank \nthe majority leader and the minority leader for their cooperation and \ntheir help in getting us here and specifically recognize the good work \nof Senator Cantwell. You do not get to a point in this body with \nsignificant legislation if you don't have a willing partner on the \nother side.\n  We have not taken up energy reform or any real energy legislation in \nover 8 years now, and in those intervening 8 years, much has happened \nin the energy space. Our policies as they relate to energy, whether it \nis LNG exports or renewables, haven't advanced. And the commitment that \nSenator Cantwell and I made to one another over a year ago to try to \nmove legislation--not just to move messages but to move legislation--\nwas a commitment that held us through a lot of hearings, a lot of \ndiscussion, a lot of debate going back and forth, but to the point \nwhere we are today with an agreement to move forward to final passage \non a very significant energy bill for the country.\n  So I thank Senator Cantwell, and I would also like to recognize her \nstaff, led by Angela Becker-Dippmann, and my energy team, led by Colin \nHayes, who have put in yeoman's work to get us to this point.\n  I would like to think we could kick this whole thing out tonight, but \nwe are not going to be doing that. We do, however, have the glidepath \nforward, and I thank not only those on our respective teams but also \nthose here on the floor who have helped us with this as well.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Congratulating the University of North Dakota Men's Hockey Team\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the University of \nNorth Dakota men's hockey team, which won a national championship last \nSaturday. Undoubtedly, like everybody else, the Presiding Officer was \nglued to his TV set watching the exciting game between the University \nof North Dakota men's hockey team and Quinnipiac. The UND hockey team \nprevailed 5 to 1 in an exciting game in front of about 20,000 fans. It \nwas just fantastic.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S2017, April 13, 2016, in the middle of the third \ncolumn, the following language appears:CONGRATULATING THE \nUNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM Mr. HELLER. Mr. \nPresident, . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: CONGRATULATING THE \nUNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. \nPresident, . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  So I am here to read a resolution into the record from the United \nStates Senate congratulating the University of North Dakota men's \nhockey team for winning the 2016 National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation's Division I Men's Hockey Championship.\n\n       Whereas the University of North Dakota (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``UND'') Men's Hockey Team won the 2016 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``NCAA'') Division I Men's Hockey Championship Game in \n     Tampa, Florida, on April 9, 2016, in a hard fought victory \n     over the Quinnipiac University Bobcats of Connecticut by a \n     score of 5 to 1;\n       Whereas the UND men's hockey team and Coach Brad Berry had \n     an incredible 2015-16 season and became the first head coach \n     to win the National Championship in his first season as head \n     coach;\n       Whereas UND has won its eighth NCAA Frozen Four \n     Championship--\n\n  Second only to Michigan. Michigan has won nine. We hope to remedy \nthat next year and get our ninth, and then pass by the University of \nMichigan--\n\n     ending the season with a 34-6-4 record;\n       Whereas Coach Berry and his staff have instilled character \n     and perseverance in the UND players and have done an \n     outstanding job with the UND hockey program;\n       Whereas the leadership of Interim President Ed Schafer and \n     Athletic Director Brian Faison has helped further both \n     academic and athletic excellence at UND;\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\n       Whereas thousands of UND fans attended the championship \n     game, reflecting the tremendous fan base of the University of \n     North Dakota that showcases the spirit and dedication of UND \n     hockey fans, which has helped propel the team's success; and\n       Whereas the 2016 NCAA Frozen Four Division I Hockey \n     Championship was a victory not only for the UND men's hockey \n     team, but also for the entire State of North Dakota--\n\n  We take great pride in our hockey and our tremendous UND hockey \nteam--\n\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the University of North Dakota men's \n     hockey team, the 2016 National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association Division I Men's Hockey champions;\n       (2) commends the University of North Dakota players, \n     coaches, and staff for their hard work and dedication; and\n       (3) recognizes the students, alumni, and loyal fans for \n     supporting the UND men's hockey team on their successful \n     quest to capture another NCAA National Championship trophy \n     for the University of North Dakota.\n\n  We are very proud of our university, of the leadership there at the \nuniversity, of the coaches, the staff, and these tremendous student \nathletes. They conducted themselves so well both on and off the ice. \nThey had an absolutely impressive run through the postseason.\n  I think Quinnipiac only lost about three games all year, so they had \nan incredible record. They were rated No. 1 in the country. Our hockey \nteam came in and played a fantastic game. It was an exciting game to \nwatch, but on both sides tremendous athletes. Congratulations to \nQuinnipiac on a great year and on an outstanding program.\n  We played Denver in the semifinals. They also had a great year. \nBoston College was in the other bracket. They were outstanding hockey \nprograms. It was a great hockey tournament. There was a fantastic fan \nbase from all the schools. Again, back to the quality of the athletes, \nthe student athletes who were competing--great character. They handled \nthemselves well and had great sportsmanship. It is exactly the kind of \nthing we like to see not only for our State but the other States that \nwere there and the teams that were representing.\n  It was a great tournament all around. Also, thanks and \ncongratulations to everyone in Tampa for hosting the tournament and \ndoing an absolutely fantastic job. We had thousands of fans outside the \narena after the game savoring the victory and having a great time. The \ncity of Tampa and the arena could not have been more hospitable, so we \nwant to say thank you and express our appreciation. Again, \ncongratulations to a great team on a great year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this is the 133rd climate speech that \nI have delivered, and it has been an amazing week. On Saturday, the New \nYork Times posted its cover story about dying coral reefs in our \noceans. On Sunday, the cover story in the Providence Journal was about \ndrowning salt marshes in Rhode Island. Both are the handiwork of \nclimate change.\n  Even more amazing, listen to what a Koch brothers operative said last \nweek: ``Charles has said the climate is changing. So, the climate is \nchanging.'' That was Sheryl Corrigan speaking, of Koch Industries, the \nmassive fuel conglomerate led by Charles and David Koch, and the \nCharles was Charles Koch.\n  She went on: ``I think he's also said, and we believe that humans \nhave a part in that.''\n  Climate change is real, it seems, and manmade if even they say so.\n  What this really means is that the denial shtick has collapsed \nentirely. We saw this coming with the oil and gas CEOs. In the runup to \nthe Paris climate summit, the chief executive officers of 10 of the \nworld's largest oil and gas companies declared their collective support \nfor a strong international climate change agreement.\n  ``We are committed to playing our part,'' they professed. ``Over the \ncoming years we will collectively strengthen our actions and \ninvestments to contribute to reducing the GHG intensity of the global \nenergy mix.''\n  So if the oil and gas CEOs will not do it and now even the Koch \nbrothers will not do it, it looks like denying climate change is no \nlonger acceptable--even to those who most cause it.\n  As we know, Big Coal took another path, denying to the end, and for \nmany players in the coal industry it really is the end. The industry is \nbeing devastated by market forces and is in precipitous decline. As I \nnoted in my last climate speech, the Wall Street Journal reported that \nthe ``war on coal'' was a war on coal by the natural gas industry, and \nthe natural gas industry has won.\n  Appalachian Power president and CEO Charles Patton told a meeting of \nenergy executives last fall that coal was losing a long-term contest \nwith natural gas and wind power. Today we learned America's largest \ncoal company, Peabody Energy, filed for bankruptcy, as Arch Coal did in \nJanuary.\n  In recent years, one report found 26 U.S. coal companies have gone \ninto bankruptcy. Some of the most notable bankruptcies include James \nRiver Coal and Patriot Coal Corporation, which had combined assets that \ntotaled $4.6 billion.\n  Denial was not a winning strategy for the coal industry. If outright \ndenial of manmade climate change is no longer a viable strategy, what \nis left? It is an old classic: Dissembling--saying one thing and doing \nanother. The polluters say climate change is real and they say that a \ncarbon fee makes sense, but they put their entire massive lobbying and \npolitical operations to work to prevent Congress from actually \nacknowledging that climate change is real or from working on \nlegislation to establish a carbon fee--even a carbon fee that would \ndramatically reduce the corporate income tax rate.\n  For example, USA TODAY reported this week that oil titan Chevron has \npumped at least $1 million into the super PAC set up to keep the Senate \nin the hands of the climate denial party. I don't know of a penny that \nChevron has put into supporting climate action in Congress. Say one \nthing; do another.\n  A new report from the nonprofit research organization Influence Map \nshows that two other major oil companies, along with three of their \nindustry trade groups, spend as much as $115 million a year to lobby \nagainst the very climate policies they publicly claim to support. Say \none thing, do another.\n  This chart shows the streams of money from ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch \nShell--whose CEO, by the way, signed the oil-and-gas Paris \ndeclaration--as well as the American Petroleum Institute, the Western \nStates Petroleum Association, and the Australian Petroleum Production & \nExploration Association. That is Shell and that is Exxon.\n  This money deluge--total spent, $114 million--includes advertising \nand public relations, direct lobbying here in Congress and at State \nhouses, and political contributions and electioneering. Don't think any \nof this goes to support a solution to climate change.\n  What this chart doesn't show is the dark money these corporate \nbehemoths funnel through phony-baloney front groups, often untraceable, \nto undermine public understanding of the climate crisis and to \nundermine action in Congress. Front groups have been testifying this \nvery week in the Environment and Public Works Committee against climate \naction. Was there any pushback from Charles Koch or from the oil CEOs? \nNo. Nor does this chart show the undisclosed fossil fuel millions \ndumped into our elections thanks to the regrettable Citizens United \nSupreme Court decision.\n  Academic researchers like Robert Brulle at Drexel University, Riley \nDunlap at Oklahoma State University, Justin Farrell at Yale University, \nand Michael Mann at Penn State University, among many others, have \nstudied and are exposing the precise dimensions and functions of the \ncorporate climate denial machine. It is quite a piece of machinery. \nInvestigative writers like Naomi Oreskes, Erik Conway, Naomi Klein, and \nSteve Coll are also on the hunt.\n  Jane Mayer of The New Yorker has put out an important piece of \nlegislation--her new, aptly titled book ``Dark Money,'' about the \nsecret but massive\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\ninfluence-buying of rightwing billionaires led by the infamous Koch \nbrothers. Mayer's book catalogs the rise and the expansion into a vast \narray of front groups of this operation and the role in it of two of \nAmerica's more shameless villains Charles and David Koch.\n  If you want a little more history on this unholy alliance, you can \nread ``Poison Tea,'' a new book out by Jeff Nesbit. Mr. Nesbit was a \nRepublican who worked in the Bush 41 White House. He was there at the \ncreation. He has reviewed an enormous array of documents and he has \nwritten an amazing expose.\n  The Koch brothers' say one thing, do another strategy is every bit as \nbad as the say one thing, do another strategy of their oil and gas \nallies. Remember, here is what they now say:\n\n       Charles has said the climate is changing. So, the climate \n     is changing. . . . I think he's also said, and we believe \n     that humans have a part in that.\n\n  Again, that is the Koch Industries' rep.\n  Here is what they still do: They threaten that Republicans who \nsupport a carbon tax or climate regulations would ``be at a severe \ndisadvantage in the Republican nomination process. . . . We would \nabsolutely make that a crucial issue.''\n  That is the President of Americans for Prosperity, the juggernaut of \nthe Koch brothers-backed political network, which has promised to \nspend, believe it or not, $750 million just in this 2016 election. What \non Earth could they possibly want to spend $750 million on?\n  Americans for Prosperity's president also takes credit for the \n``political peril'' they are proud to have created for Republicans who \ncross them on climate change. This threat is not subtle. Step out of \nline and here come the attack ads and the primary challengers all \nfunded by the deep pockets of the fossil fuel industry, powered up by \nCitizens United.\n  The result? The issue of climate change is completely absent from the \nRepublican campaigns. They really don't want to talk about it. Every \nRepublican candidate has gone into silence or outright denial. Their \nsilence or outright denial is exactly paralleled on the floor of this \nbody.\n  Just this week, a bipartisan effort to extend tax incentives for \nrenewable energy fell apart after it was reported that the Kochs and an \narray of their front groups told the Senate majority to cease and \ndesist from allowing an extension of renewable tax credits the majority \nhad already agreed to.\n  So down came the FAA bill compromise. Of course, the Big Oil tax \ncredits have been baked into the Tax Code, and there is no contesting \nthem that is allowed. We now have a field in which renewable tax \ncredits that were agreed to are not in place, but Big Oil protects its \nown tax breaks as the fossil fuel industry attacks the renewable tax \nbreaks.\n  Look at what fossil fuel influence has done to the business lobby \ngroups. The Chamber of Commerce, which is probably more accurately \ndefined now as the chamber of carbon, the American Petroleum Institute, \neven the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation \nof Independent Business, and the Farm Bureau--Big Oil and the Koch \nbrothers have locked them all down. It is a wall of opposition among \nthose groups to any sensible conversation about carbon pollution.\n  I have spoken before about the well-defended castle of denial \nconstructed by the big polluters to attack and harass their opponents \nand to keep out the unwelcome truths of climate science. Built as it is \non a foundation of lies, the denial castle is bound to crumble. We have \nseen cracks begin to appear in the edifice. This revelation on the part \nof the Koch brothers that they finally see that climate change is real \nand manmade is another collapse. It is a big collapse. But don't \nbelieve they are surrendering their position entirely. What we see here \nin Congress is that they are still fighting as hard as ever. They are \njust conceding some of their more extreme positions because they know \nsome of their nonsense is now simply beyond the pale and is not \nacceptable. This is just a strategic retreat from a preposterous \nstance.\n  Every major scientific society in America agrees on the cause and \nurgency of climate change, and, I think, so do every one of our major \nState universities--certainly every one I have looked at--all of our \nNational Labs, NASA, NOAA, America's national security and intelligence \ncommunity, and all the corporations that signed the American Business \nAct on Climate Pledge, which includes major corporations from a lot of \nour Republican colleagues' home States. That is a lot of information to \ndeny and ignore, and that is an awful lot of legitimate people to claim \nour part of the hoax.\n  Here it comes--the whole structure of deceit and denial erected by \nthe fossil fuel interest is creaking and crumbling. More than a dozen \nattorneys general are starting to poke and probe. My Republican \ncolleagues may want to consider getting out of the way of this because \nthe day is coming--and soon--when the whole denier castle collapses, \nand that day cannot come too soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2019-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2019-S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK AND THE JUSTICE FOR ALL REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every year in April, we pause to observe \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week, and this year marks its 35th \nanniversary. Since 1981, in communities across the Nation, people have \nobserved this week with candlelight vigils and public rallies to renew \nour commitment to crime victims and their families. Vermonters have \nalways banded together to help crime victims and their families. That \nis just who we are, and I am proud of that long tradition. It is \nvitally important that we continue to recognize the needs of these \nsurvivors and work together to promote victims' rights and services.\n  One of our most important tools to do so is the Victims of Crime Act \nof 1984 and the crime victims fund that it created. I strongly \nsupported passage of this critical legislation, which has been the \nprincipal means through which the Federal Government has supported \nessential services for crime victims and their families for more than \nthree decades. It is time to review and renew that law, and I have been \nworking closely with Senator Grassley in that effort. Next week, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to assess the crime \nvictims fund and discuss how to ensure that it continues to meet the \nchanging needs of victims.\n  The Justice for All Act is another important law that promotes \nvictims' rights. I am working with Senator Cornyn to reauthorize this \nvital legislation. Our bill will further strengthen the rights of crime \nvictims; improve the use of forensic evidence, including rape kits, to \nprovide justice as swiftly as possible; and protect the innocent by \nimproving access to post-conviction DNA testing.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act builds on the work I began in \n2000, when I introduced the Innocence Protection Act, which sought to \nensure that defendants in the most serious cases receive competent \nrepresentation and, where appropriate, access to post-conviction DNA \ntesting. I served proudly as a prosecutor in Vermont for 8 years, and I \nbelieve that we must find those responsible for crimes and prosecute \nthem. But we must also ensure that our system does not wrongly convict \nthose who are innocent. DNA testing is often necessary to prove the \ninnocence of individuals in cases where the system got it grievously \nwrong. ``Innocent until proven guilty'' is a hallmark of our criminal \njustice system, but when a person who has been found guilty is truly \ninnocent, we cannot stand idly by. We must act to exonerate that \nperson.\n  The Innocence Protection Act passed as part of the original Justice \nfor All Act in 2004, and since that time, at\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\nleast 26 people have been exonerated through DNA testing funded by the \nlegislation. In North Carolina, for example, a man was released after \nspending 37 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. In \nVirginia, a man was released after spending 27 years in prison for \nviolent rapes he did not commit. And in New Orleans, a man was released \nafter spending 20 years in a State mental health hospital for an \nabduction and rape he did not commit. We must continue funding this \ncritical post-conviction DNA testing since we know our system does not \nalways get it right. It is an outrage when an innocent person is \nwrongly punished, and this injustice is compounded when the true \nperpetrator remains on the streets, able to commit more crimes. We are \nall less safe when the system gets it wrong.\n  As we begin this year's Crime Victims' Rights Week, I look forward to \nworking with Senators on both sides of the aisle to update and \nreauthorize both the Victims of Crime Act and the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act. Survivors and their families deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2020-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OBSERVING WORLD HEMOPHILIA DAY\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate April 17 as \nWorld Hemophilia Day where we recognize the serious challenges of the \n20,000 Americans who suffer each day from hemophilia and where we raise \nawareness to fight for a cure.\n  Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that prevents an individual's \nability to form a proper blood clot. Patients with hemophilia need \nimmediate access to care and lifesaving therapies. There is currently \nan enormous discrepancy in the level of care available to patients with \nhemophilia. While some are diagnosed very young and have medical care \nthroughout their life, most do not or do not have the access to \ndiagnosis and treatment they need. As a physician, I have treated \npatients with hemophilia, and I know how debilitating the health \nproblems endured by those living with hemophilia can be. If left \nuntreated, a bleeding episode can lead to terrible pain, chronic joint \nand muscle damage, serious injury, or even death.\n  I am hopeful that through attention, diligence, and raised awareness \nwe might prevent more complications, unnecessary procedures, and \ndisabilities so often caused by these diseases. As we increase our \nunderstanding and awareness of hemophilia, we also increase our ability \nto find treatments and eventually, a cure for this disease. I'm proud \nto stand today in support of all Americans with hemophilia on World \nHemophilia Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2020-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS VOLUNTARY \n                                SERVICE\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in \nrecognizing, celebrating, and highlighting the significance of the 70th \nanniversary of the Department of Veterans Affairs Voluntary Service, \nVAVS, this year. This program is one of the largest centralized \nvolunteer groups in the Federal Government with approximately 75,000 \nvolunteers providing more than 9.7 million hours of service for our \nNation's veterans during their hospital stay.\n  It has been 70 years since this program started in 1946. Since then, \nthe volunteers have donated more than 782.2 million hours of service to \nsupport our veterans. More than 7,400 national and community \norganizations support the volunteers, including support by a national \nadvisory committee, comprising 55 major veteran, civic, and service \norganizations who work together to improve volunteerism in VA.\n  Keeping up with the VA's fast-paced efforts to expand access to care \nfor veteran patients into the community, this program, too, has strived \nto continue their efforts to assist our veterans. The volunteers serve \nin many different ways, including supplementing staff in hospital \nwards, community living centers, outpatient clinics, community-based \nvolunteer programs, respite care programs, end-of-life care programs, \ncreative arts, adaptive sports, vet centers, veterans homes, national \ncemeteries, and veterans benefits offices.\n  Just in 2015, the volunteers contributed a total of 10.8 million \nhours of service. The current monetary value of those hours from all of \nthe volunteers is more than $250 million. Additionally, the volunteers \nand their organizations contributed more than $105 million in gifts and \ndonations in 2015, for a combined total value of $355.5 million in \nvolunteer service and giving.\n  While the tangible value of these volunteer activities is impressive, \nit is impossible to calculate all of the compassionate care and efforts \nthat the volunteers provide for our veterans.

Since its founding near the time of World War I, NAS NSE \nhas worked to promote the welfare of its members and increase the \nefficiency of work at Navy yards and naval stations.\n  The members of NAS NSE encompass diverse trades, including shop \nsuperintendents and senior managers from engineering, project \nmanagement, financial, business office, facilities, base operations, \nand resource management. Despite their varied backgrounds, these \nprofessionals possess a common ability to lead, educate, and manage, as \nwell as a true dedication to the protection of our country. In \nparticular, the NAS NSE chapter at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is \ncommitted to ensuring the Navy's submarines are maintained, repaired, \nand modernized to the highest degree in order to fulfill the Navy's \nmission of winning wars, deterring aggression, and maintaining freedom \nof the seas.\n  As threats facing our Nation increase and become more complex, the \nNavy's ability to project power and uniquely provide worldwide presence \nplays an increasingly critical role in protecting our national \nsecurity. As such, it is critical that our naval fleet is properly \nmaintained so it can be positioned around the world where and when we \nneed it. NAS NSE members play a vital role in ensuring that our ships \nare ready to deploy on schedule and in good condition.\n  Over the past 100 conventions, NAS NSE has worked on many important \nissues, including many shipyard safety and leadership issues. This \nyear, their efforts continue to focus on empowering shipyard workers to \nbe leaders, helping new employees to efficiently achieve proficiency in \nnecessary skills, and developing innovation in the shipyard. Through \nthese and many other initiatives aimed at increasing the safety and \nabilities of its members, NAS NSE has improved both the lives of \nshipyard workers and the efficiency of our shipyards.\n  I commend the organization for its commitment to passing on a strong \nand healthy program of naval maintenance, so that future generations \ncan benefit from a Navy ready to defend our freedoms. It is an honor \nfor me to pay tribute to the National Association of Superintendents of \nU.S. Naval Shore Establishments as they celebrate 100 years of meeting \nto work on behalf of our shipyard workers and our naval shipyards.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I join my esteemed colleague, Senator \nSusan Collins, in recognizing the 100th Convention of the National \nAssociation of Superintendents of the U.S. Naval Shore Establishments, \nNAS NSE. This association works diligently to implement a strong and \nhealthy program of naval maintenance and modernization at our naval \nshipyards, so future generations can benefit from a Navy that is always \nready to defend our freedom.\n  I specifically wish to recognize the work of the NAS NSE chapter at \nthe Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery,\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nME. Maintaining the structural and functional integrity of our Navy's \nsubmarines enables the United States to consistently serve and protect \nour Nation's interests around the globe, and the NAS NSE of Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard serves as a paragon of efficient, quality service on \nbehalf of our Navy's ships and servicemen. Portsmouth has earned a \nreputation as the Navy's Center of Excellence for attack submarine \nmaintenance, which is a reflection of the hard work and determination \nof the association to manage and protect these American treasures for \nnational security. Through their consistent dedication and skillful \nwork, the men and women of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard play a vital role \nin furthering the esteemed tradition of excellence within the NAS NSE.\n  Building on over a century of work to promote our Navy's strength, \nthis year's historic convention focuses on the national initiative of \nimproving productive capacity throughout the association. This year's \nconvention will help to further streamline systems, optimize \nproduction, and enhance safety across all the NAS NSE's operations. \nDiscussing and implementing improved strategies will help to ensure the \ncontinued effectiveness of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and shipyards all \nacross the country.\n  I congratulate the NAS NSE on their 100th convention, and I thank \nthem for their dedication and hard work on behalf of our shipyards. I \nwish them continued success in the future as the association continues \nto ensure the safety of our Nation for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2021-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        OBSERVING THE HOLIDAY OF VAISAKHI FOR THE SIKH COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to honor and celebrate the holiday \nof Vaisakhi, a very important day for those who practice Sikhism.\n  The world's fifth largest religion, Sikhism was founded over five \ncenturies ago and was introduced to the United States in the 19th \ncentury. There are over 500,000 Sikh adherents in the United States.\n  Pennsylvania is the home of many proud Sikh Americans, who contribute \nand make a positive impact in their workplaces, communities, and to our \ncountry. They are part of the rich cultural fabric of the Commonwealth.\n  As a member of the American Sikh Congressional Caucus, I rise to \nhonor this community on the holiday of Vaisakhi. This is an important \ncelebration for the Sikh community and is celebrated this year on April \n13. On this day in 1699, Guru Gobind Singh created the Khalsa, a \nfellowship of devout Sikhs. Vaisakhi is a festival which marks this \noccasion and the spring harvest.\n  The Sikh community around the world recognizes this important holiday \nwith parades, dancing, singing, and other festivities. Celebrations \nalso include performing seva, or selfless service, such as providing \nfree meals to others and volunteering for service projects in their \ncommunities.\n  I am proud to represent the Sikh community of Pennsylvania, and I \nwish the Sikh American community a joyous Vaisakhi.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2021-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING OFFICER NATHAN TAYLOR\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe life of California Highway Patrol Officer Nathan Daniel Taylor, a \nbeloved husband, father, brother, son, and grandson who tragically lost \nhis life in the line of duty on March 13, 2016.\n  Officer Taylor was born on January 17, 1981, in Baltimore, MD. His \nfamily later moved to Loomis, CA, where Officer Taylor was an active \nmember of the Boy Scouts, earning the highest rank of Eagle Scout. \nAfter graduating from Del Oro High School, Officer Taylor attended \nBrigham Young University on a full academic scholarship and received a \nbachelor's degree in history. He spent 2 years in Venezuela serving as \na church missionary before joining the California Highway Patrol, \ncontinuing his commitment to helping those in need. Officer Taylor \ncompleted cadet training in 2010 and was assigned to the San Jose area \noffice before transferring to the Gold Run area in 2013.\n  Colleagues fondly recalled Officer Taylor's tremendous service to the \npublic, offering examples of his selflessness and compassion. ``Officer \nTaylor was the most genuine, honest officer I knew,'' said CHP Officer \nJosh Webb. ``He would literally give the shirt off his back for \nsomebody.'' His ability to go above and beyond the call of duty also \nearned the appreciation and affection of the community he served. In \nfact, he received so many thank-you letters from the public that his \ncolleagues joked that he must have written them himself.\n  Officer Taylor truly embodied the very best of law enforcement, and \nhis courageous service will be forever remembered. On behalf of the \npeople of California, whom Officer Taylor served so bravely, I extend \nmy gratitude and deepest sympathies to his wife, Becky; sons Preston, \nWyatt, and Joshua; parents, Jeff and Linda; brothers Karl, Collin, and \nSteven; sister, Sarah; and grandparents, Karl and Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2021-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2021-S2022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JANET AIRIS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join with the vice chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski, and the chairman and \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Enzi and Senator \nSanders, in honoring Janet Airis on her retirement after 32 years of \ndistinguished service to the Congress with the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Janet is highly regarded by both Republicans and Democrats on \nboth sides of the Capitol for her encyclopedic knowledge of the \nappropriations and budget process and its lexicon, her responsiveness \nto committee and Member staff, and her dedication to the nonpartisan \nrole that CBO plays in the successful enactment of appropriations bills \nyear after year. Janet has been a valuable asset to eight of the nine \nCBO directors.\n  Janet came to CBO in the waning days of 1983, fairly soon after \ngraduating from Wellesley College. She joined the scorekeeping unit in \nthe budget analysis division, which has the responsibility of tracking \nand scoring the appropriations bills at each legislative stage as well \nas tracking mandatory spending in authorizing legislation. Janet was \nhired to assist in maintaining the database used by the division. Janet \nhas worked to keep the database in sync with the many changes in the \nbudget process, integrating new categories and methods so that CBO \ncould accurately tabulate and report on Federal spending. Janet started \nas the scorekeeper for the defense and military construction \nappropriation bills. Over the course of her career, she also handled \nthe Transportation, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and \nAgriculture, and legislative branch appropriations bills, in the \nprocess gaining a vast array of knowledge of a substantial part of the \nFederal budget.\n  In 2000, Janet made the transition to unit chief. For the past 16 \nyears, she has successfully overseen the analysis of the President's \nbudget request for each of the appropriation bills, the scoring of the \nappropriation bills at each stage, the production and review of \nbaselines, and the writing and coordination of CBO's annual report on \nunauthorized appropriations and expiring authorizations. Through all of \nthese tasks, she has been the steady hand of the scorekeeping unit, \ngenerous with her time and knowledge, and vital to the smooth \nfunctioning of the budget analysis division. Senate staff and \ncolleagues have come to depend on her for her ready expertise, \ndiligence, and attention to detail.\n  Janet is also famous for sharing her prodigious baking talent. Every \nyear she has coordinated the provision of cookies during the conclusion \nof the December baseline, which often coincided with the final days of \na congressional session. The appearance of a red-clothed table outside \nof the scorekeeping unit bearing plates of homemade cookies always \nbrings a smile to stressed budget analysts checking final numbers or \nscoring final bills.\n  Janet's expertise, corporate knowledge, and generosity of time and \nspirit will be sorely missed, but she well deserves an opportunity to \nrest after her years of outstanding service to the Congress. We are \ngrateful for that service, and we wish her the best in the years to \ncome.\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2022-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING JAMES BARRETT McNULTY\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to James \nBarrett McNulty, former mayor of my hometown Scranton, PA. Former Mayor \nMcNulty was a dedicated public servant who made a lasting impact on \nScranton and all of Pennsylvania.\n  Born on February 27, 1945, in the High Works section of Scranton, Jim \nattended South Scranton and South Catholic High School. In 1966, he \ngraduated from the University of Scranton as student body president \nwith a bachelor of arts in political science. A member of the Young \nDemocrats for John F. Kennedy, Jim McNulty answered President Kennedy's \ncall to young people to serve their community and their country.\n  The extraordinary love that Mayor McNulty had for public service and \nfor the people of Scranton was felt by all who had the good fortune of \nbeing in his presence. As a committed public servant, Jim McNulty \njoined the staff of Congressman Dan Flood and then transitioned to work \non the mayoral race in Scranton in 1969. By 1974, Jim was deputy mayor. \nHe quickly rose through the ranks as director of the Department of \nPublic Works, chairman of the Scranton Redevelopment Authority, \nchairman of the Scranton Recreation Authority, City of Scranton Urban \nAffairs coordinator and member of the City of Scranton Government Study \nCommission. In 1981, he was elected to serve as the 26th mayor of \nScranton.\n  John F. Kennedy once said: ``For I can assure you that we love our \ncountry, not for what it was, though it has always been great--not for \nwhat it is, though of this we are deeply proud--but for what it someday \ncan, and, through the efforts of us all, someday will be.'' Jim McNulty \nwas a visionary mayor who saw the greatness in the city of Scranton and \nits people. He fought tirelessly to make life better for residents with \nhis instrumental actions in making the Steamtown Historic Site and the \nHilton at Lackawanna Station a reality.\n  His joyful presence around Scranton left an indelible mark long after \nhis mayoralty ended. Mayor McNulty's voice would paint a picture of the \ncity of Scranton through his public affairs program ``Sunday Live'' \nwith Jim McNulty and WARM radio talk show ``the Mayor of WARMland.''\n  May his memory live on through the love of his wife, Evie; the \nMcNulty family; his many friends; and the ongoing efforts to enhance \nthe Scranton community. We honor him for his love for all the people of \nnortheastern Pennsylvania and his commitment to service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2022-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO OFFICER MICHAEL STONEKING\n\n Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Eastern \nIowa Airport Transportation Security Officer Michael Stoneking for \nrecent actions he took to aid a choking passenger.\n  Officer Michael Stoneking, while on duty at Eastern Iowa Airport in \nCedar Rapids, IA, was on his way to take his break when he was alerted \nby another airport employee that a passenger was in distress. Officer \nStoneking was directed to a female passenger who had her hands at her \nthroat indicating that she was choking. Officer Stoneking performed the \nHeimlich maneuver and was able to successfully remove the obstruction \nfrom the passenger's throat, allowing her to breathe clearly. The \npassenger's family and the passenger, once able to speak, thanked \nOfficer Stoneking and credited him with saving her life. Official \nTransportation Security Administration reports from the scene praise \nOfficer Stoneking for his command presence and calm professionalism, \nstating that his ability to think clearly and react saved a life.\n  At a time when transportation security is on everyone's mind, it is \ncomforting to know that we have such capable security officers in our \nairports. Those who go above and beyond the call of duty, as Officer \nStoneking did, are to be commended and serve as an example of what \ndedicated law enforcement officers can accomplish.\n  I am very proud today to share Officer Stoneking's story with our \ncolleagues and would ask that they join me in commending Officer \nStoneking for his actions that saved a passenger's life.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2022-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATING AIRBUS EMPLOYEES IN MOBILE, ALABAMA\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, today I am proud to join Oregonians \nall across our State in marking the 75th anniversary of the Oregon Air \nNational Guard. For three-quarters of a century, thousands of Oregon's \nsons and daughters have joined the Air National Guard, dedicating \nthemselves to defense of the Constitution of the United States and \nservice to their fellow Americans and Oregonians. Today I want to take \na moment, here on the Senate floor to thank them for their service and \nfor their sacrifices on our behalf.\n  The Oregon Air National Guard traces its beginnings back to April \n1941, when a small group of 110 airmen boldly stepped forward and \nvolunteered for duty in the months before the U.S. entered the Second \nWorld War. Initially activated as the Oregon National Guard Air Corps \n123rd Observation Squadron, their first mission was to conduct maritime \nsurveillance of the continental United States following the attack on \nPearl Harbor. In 1947, following the allied victory in World War II, \nCongress officially established the U.S. Air Force as a separate \nmilitary service, apart from the U.S. Army, and designated the Air \nNational Guard as a reserve component.\n  In the decades since, the Oregon Air National Guard has played a \nvital national defense role in the Korean war,\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\nthe Vietnam war, the Cold War, and in many global operations in the \nwake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Today's Oregon Air \nNational Guard units include the 142nd Fighter Wing in Portland, the \n173rd Fighter Wing in Klamath Falls, and the Joint Forces Headquarters \nin Salem. Oregon's F-15s serve on guard 24 hours a day, 365 days a year \nto defend the skies above America's western coast. In addition to \nprotecting that airspace, Oregon airmen are the sole providers of F-15 \nflight training for the U.S. Air Force.\n  But Oregon's airmen and women aren't simply ready to respond in times \nof conflict; they also answer the Governor's call during natural \ndisasters to protect Oregonians from floods, forest fires, volcanic \neruptions, and medical emergencies. Through the State partnership \nprogram, Oregon Guardsmen also have played a powerful role to improve \nrelations with our State's partners in Vietnam and Bangladesh. In doing \nso, they demonstrate the best of American generosity in communities \nthroughout the world.\n  The strength of any organization is its people and here the men and \nwomen of the Oregon Air National Guard, like its counterpart the Oregon \nArmy Guard, are at the top of their class. Oregon guardsmen come from \ndiverse backgrounds and bring top notch private sector skills to bear \non behalf of the State and the country. The nearly 2,300 men and women \nnow serving in the Oregon Air National Guard contribute to the long \nlegacy of volunteerism and community service for which the organization \nis already so well known.\n  As a Senator, it has always been one of my highest honors to \nrepresent the men and women of the Oregon Air and Army National Guards \nin Congress, and as an Oregonian, I am so proud of today's Oregon Air \nNational Guard and its rich heritage. It is a privilege to serve these \nheroes--active, retired, and those who have given their lives in \ndefense of our nation and helping others. I know I speak for people in \nOregon, across the country, and around the world when I thank the \nOregon Air National Guard for 75 years of fabulous service, \ncongratulate them on this historic milestone, and wish them continued \nsuccess in the years and decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2023-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 483.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ROUNDS:\n  S. 2796. A bill to repeal certain obsolete laws relating to Indians; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to begin \nto address the list of historic wrongs against Native American citizens \nbrought by the early U.S. Government.\n  The idea that these laws were ever considered is disturbing, but the \nfact that these laws remain on our books is, at best, an oversight. \nCurrently, Native Americans who are U.S. citizens just like you and me \nare still legally subject to a series of obsolete, historically wrong \nstatutes. These statutes are a sad reminder of the hostile aggression \nand overt racism that the Federal Government exhibited toward Native \nAmericans as the government attempted to assimilate them into what was \nconsidered modern society.\n  In 2016, laws still exist that would allow for the forced removal of \ntheir children, who can be sent to boarding schools, and they can be \ndenied rations if they refuse. They can still be subject to forced \nlabor on their reservations as a condition of their receipt of \nsupplies. Moreover, they can be denied funding if found drunk on a \nreservation.\n  These statutes actually remain on the books of the land and, in many \ncases, are more than a century old and continue the stigma of \nsubjugation and paternalism from that time period. It is without \nquestion that they should be stricken.\n  We cannot adequately repair history, but we can move forward. Because \nof this, today I am introducing the RESPECT Act or the Repealing \nExisting Substandard Provisions Encouraging Conciliation with Tribes \nAct.\n  I wish to list some of the 12 existing laws that the RESPECT Act will \nrepeal. In Chapter 25 of the United States Code, section 302, entitled \n``Education of Indians, Indian Reform School; rules and regulations; \nconsent of parents to placing youth in reform school,'' the \nCommissioner of Indian affairs was directed to place Indian youth in \nIndian reform schools without the consent of their parents.\n  The issue of off-reservation Indian boarding schools, in particular, \nis a rightfully sensitive one for our Native Americans. Between 1879 \nand into the 20th century, at least 830,000 Indian children were taken \nto boarding schools to allegedly ``civilize them.'' Many parents were \nthreatened with surrendering their children or their food rations. This \nlaw, in fact, is also still on the books.\n  A requirement exists in section 283, entitled ``Regulations for \nwithholding rations for nonattendance at schools,'' that the Secretary \nof the Interior could ``prevent the issuing of rations or the \nfurnishing of subsistence to the head of any Indian family for or on \naccount of any Indian child or children between the ages of eight and \ntwenty-one years who shall not have attended school in the preceding \nyear in accordance with such regulations.''\n  Yet there still exist other outdated laws relating to wartime status \nbetween Indians and the United States, such as those found in section \n72 of the Code, entitled ``Abrogation of treaties.'' Here the President \nwas authorized to declare all treaties with such tribes ``abrogated if \nin his opinion any Indian tribe is in actual hostility to the United \nStates.''\n  In section 127, entitled ``Moneys or annuities of hostile Indians,'' \nmoneys or annuities stipulated by any treaty with an Indian tribe could \nbe stopped if the tribe ``has engaged in hostilities against the United \nStates, or against its citizens peacefully or lawfully sojourning or \ntraveling within its jurisdiction at the time of such hostilities.''\n  Likewise, in section 128, entitled ``Appropriations not paid to \nIndians at war with United States,'' none of the appropriations made \nfor the Indian Service could ``be paid to any band of Indians or any \nportion of any band\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\nwhile at war with the United States or with the white citizens of any \nof the States or Territories.''\n  Moreover, in section 138, entitled ``Goods withheld from chiefs \nviolating treaty stipulations,'' delivery of goods or merchandise could \nbe denied to the chiefs of any tribe by authority of any treaty ``if \nsuch chiefs'' had ``violated the stipulations contained in such \ntreaty.''\n  Finally, in section 129, entitled ``Moneys due Indians holding \ncaptives other than Indians withheld,'' the Secretary of the Interior \nwas ``authorized to withhold, from any tribe of Indians who may hold \nany captives other than Indians, any moneys due them from the United \nStates until said captives shall be surrendered to the lawful \nauthorities of the United States.''\n  In section 130, entitled ``Withholding of moneys or goods on account \nof intoxicating liquors,'' racist identifications tying drunkenness by \nIndians to receipt of funds still exist, stipulating that no \n``annuities, or moneys, or goods'' could ``be paid or distributed to \nIndians while they'' were--and, once again, I will quote--``under the \ninfluence of any description of intoxicating liquor, nor while there \nare good and sufficient reasons leading the officers or agents, whose \nduty it may be to make such payments or distribution, to believe that \nthere is any species of intoxicating liquor within convenient reach.''\n  Mandatory work on reservations still exists in section 137, entitled \n``Supplies distributed to able-bodied males on condition.'' Once again, \nI will quote from the text: ``For the purpose of inducing Indians to \nlabor and become self-supporting, it is provided that, in distributing \nthe supplies and annuities to the Indians for whom the same are \nappropriated, the agent distributing the same could require all able-\nbodied male Indians between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to \nperform service upon the reservation, for the benefit of themselves or \nof the tribe'' in return for supplies.\n  Let me summarize what I said in the beginning. In the year 2016 in \nthe United States, Native Americans--citizens like you and me--are \nstill legally subject to outrageous, racist, and outdated laws that \nwere wrong at their inception. There is no place in our legal code for \nsuch laws.\n\n  In my home State of South Dakota, which is home to 9 tribes and \nroughly 75,000 enrolled members, we strive to work together to \nconstantly improve relationships and to mend our history through \nreconciliation and mutual respect. It is not always easy, but with our \nfutures tied together, with our children in mind, reconciliation is \nsomething we are committed to.\n  History also proves that since the onset of the government's \nrelationship with the tribes, it has been complicated and challenging \nover the years, sometimes downright dark and disrespectful, and to this \nday often has led to mistreatment by the Federal Government.\n  As Governor of South Dakota, I proclaimed 2010 the Year of Unity in \nSouth Dakota. This was done in recognition of the need to continue \nbuilding upon the legacy and work of those who came before us. The year \n2010 also marked the 20th anniversary of the Year of Reconciliation in \nSouth Dakota, which was an effort by the late Governor George Mickelson \nas a way to bring all races together. The Year of Unity and the Year of \nReconciliation were efforts to build upon a common purpose, acknowledge \nour differences, and yet find ways to work together. I suspect we could \nuse a lot more of that in Washington, DC.\n  While legislative bodies before us have taken steps to rectify our \nprevious failures relative to Native Americans, sadly, these laws \nremain, and out of a sense of justice, I believe we should repeal them. \nImagine a scenario where descendants of those from Norway, Britain, \nItaly, or any other country for that matter, were treated with the same \npatronizing air of superiority. Only Native Americans face this \ndiscrimination, and it is long overdue to repeal these noxious laws.\n  I would take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill and to put an end to this blatant discrimination \nagainst Native Americans. We can't change our history, but we can start \nto change the paternalistic mentality of the Federal Government toward \nthe Native people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/senate-section/article/S2027-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 419--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA \n  MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2016 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n            ASSOCIATION DIVISION I MEN'S HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Ms. Heitkamp) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 422\n\n       Whereas individuals in the United States are the victims of \n     more than 20,000,000 crimes each year;\n       Whereas crime can touch the lives of anyone, irrespective \n     of age, race, national origin, religion, or gender;\n       Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on \n     individuals, families, schools, and communities by--\n       (1) protecting the rights of crime victims and survivors; \n     and\n       (2) ensuring that resources and services are available to \n     help rebuild the lives of the victims and survivors;\n       Whereas, as of 2008, the most conservative estimate for the \n     economic cost of violent and property crimes in the United \n     States was $17,000,000,000 per year;\n       Whereas that economic cost does not account for the \n     struggle of a crime victim to be made whole or losses that \n     result from being the victim of a crime, including losses of \n     psychological, emotional, and physical well-being;\n       Whereas despite impressive accomplishments between 1974 and \n     2016 in increasing the rights of, and services available to, \n     crime victims and survivors and the families of the victims \n     and survivors, many challenges remain to ensure that all \n     crime victims and survivors and the families of the victims \n     and survivors are--\n       (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;\n       (2) offered support and services, regardless of whether the \n     victims and survivors report crimes committed against them;

Building Trust; Restoring \n     Hope'' and highlights the collaborative and multifaceted \n     effort to provide comprehensive and quality support to \n     survivors;\n       Whereas engaging communities in victim assistance is \n     essential to promoting individual and public safety;\n       Whereas the United States must empower crime victims and \n     survivors by--\n       (1) protecting the legal rights of the victims and \n     survivors; and\n       (2) providing the victims and survivors with services to \n     help them in the aftermath of crime; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States recognize and \n     appreciate the continued importance of--\n       (1) promoting the rights of and services for crime victims \n     and survivors;

SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There is scientific consensus based on sound scientific \n     evidence that climate change is occurring due to increases in \n     carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \n     and that human activity has caused a significant increase in \n     the amount of these greenhouse gases.\n       (2) Scientific measurement shows that the concentration of \n     carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ranged from 170 to 300 parts \n     per 1,000,000 for at least 800,000 years, which is 4 times as \n     long as the species Homo sapiens has existed, but, in \n     measurements taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory in each of \n     the 2 years preceding the date of enactment of this Act, \n     exceeded 400 parts per 1,000,000.\n       (3) Transportation emissions accounted for approximately 28 \n     percent of total carbon dioxide emissions in the United \n     States in 2012, with emissions from the aviation sector \n     representing about 12 percent of transportation emissions in \n     the United States.\n       (4) Commercial-only aviation emissions in the United States \n     are projected to grow by almost 25 percent by 2030.\n       (5) Climate change diminishes the efficiency of fixed-wing \n     and rotary-wing aircraft by increasing the likelihood of \n     takeoff weight restrictions due to warmer ground level air \n     reducing the lift force on the wings.\n       (6) Climate change increases the likelihood of clear-air \n     turbulence, which already injures hundreds of passengers and \n     causes structural damage to aircraft.\n       (7) The 2015 primer of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     entitled ``Aviation Emissions, Impacts & Mitigation'' \n     acknowledges that ``emissions associated with commercial \n     aviation . . . degrade not only air quality but also the \n     broader climate,'' and will hurt the health and welfare of \n     society.\n       (8) The scientific consensus about climate change and the \n     findings from the Federal Aviation Administration support the \n     conclusions that--\n       (A) climate change poses a challenge to the growing \n     national aviation industry of the United States; and\n       (B) aviation activities have a measurable effect on \n     climate.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) climate change is real and human activity is \n     significantly contributing to climate change;\n       (2) the scientific consensus on climate change and the \n     findings of the national aviation community that climate \n     change poses real challenges to the growing aviation industry \n     of the United States are not products of a hoax or deception \n     perpetrated on the people of the United States; and\n       (3) reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the \n     effects of climate change is in the national interest of the \n     United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3757.

IMPROVING AIRLINE COMPETITIVENESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States and the United States \n     economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air \n     transportation industry to move people and goods in the \n     fastest, most efficient manner.\n       (2) In a global economy, air carriers connect the people of \n     the United States with the rest of the world. A strong air \n     transportation industry is essential to the ability of the \n     United States to compete in the international marketplace.\n       (3) A strong air transportation industry depends on \n     competition between a number of air carriers servicing a \n     variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, \n     at both the national and local levels.\n       (4) Important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent \n     on, a robust air transportation industry, including--\n       (A) business and leisure travelers;\n       (B) the tourism sector;\n       (C) shippers;\n       (D) State and local governments and port authorities;\n       (E) aircraft manufacturers; and\n       (F) domestic and foreign air carriers.\n       (5) As a result of the consolidation of United States air \n     carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number \n     of major passenger air carriers in the United States.\n       (6) In the past few years, the air transportation industry \n     has become increasingly concentrated. In 2015, the top 4 \n     major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air \n     traffic in the United States.\n       (7) The continued success of a deregulated air carrier \n     system requires actual competition to encourage all \n     participants in the industry to provide high quality service \n     at competitive fares.\n       (8) Further consolidation among air carriers threatens to \n     leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure \n     that the people of the United States share in the benefits of \n     a well-functioning air transportation industry.\n       (b) Establishment of National Commission to Ensure All \n     Americans Have Access to and Benefit From a Strong and \n     Competitive Air Transportation Industry.--There is \n     established a Commission, which shall be known as the \n     ``National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to \n     and Benefit from a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation \n     Industry'' (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Commission'').\n       (c) Functions.--\n       (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of the \n     passenger air transportation industry, with priority given to \n     issues specified in subsection (d).\n       (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the \n     study conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall \n     recommend to the President and to Congress the adoption of \n     policies that will--\n       (A) achieve the national goal of a strong and competitive \n     air carrier system and facilitate the ability of the United \n     States to compete in the global economy;\n       (B) provide robust levels of competition and air \n     transportation at reasonable fares in cities of all sizes;\n       (C) provide a stable work environment for employees of air \n     carriers;\n       (D) account for the interests of different stakeholders \n     that contribute to, and are dependent on, the air \n     transportation industry; and\n       (E) provide appropriate levels of protection for consumers, \n     including access to information to enable consumer choice.\n       (d) Specific Issues To Be Addressed.--In conducting the \n     study under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall \n     investigate--\n       (1) the current state of competition in the air \n     transportation industry, how the structure of that \n     competition is likely to change during the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, whether \n     that expected level of competition will be sufficient to \n     secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and \n     the effects of--\n       (A) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, \n     including the competitiveness of fares and services and the \n     ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air \n     carrier fees;\n       (B) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced \n     competition artificially inflates ticket prices;\n       (C) the level of competition as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act on the travel distribution sector, \n     including online and traditional travel agencies and \n     intermediaries;\n       (D) economic and other effects on domestic air \n     transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control \n     the majority of available seat miles;\n       (E) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete \n     against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or \n     potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; \n     and\n       (F) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new \n     service to underserved markets;\n       (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the \n     Federal Government should take to enhance air carrier \n     competition, including changes that are needed in the legal \n     and administrative policies that govern--\n       (A) the initial award and the transfer of international \n     routes;\n       (B) the allocation of gates and landing rights, \n     particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a \n     limited number of air carriers;\n       (C) frequent flier programs;\n       (D) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the \n     domestic air transportation marketplace;\n       (E) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air \n     transportation marketplace;\n       (F) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers;\n       (G) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers;\n       (H) the bankruptcy laws of the United States and related \n     rules administered by the Department of Transportation as \n     such laws and rules apply to air carriers;\n       (I) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension \n     obligations;\n       (J) antitrust immunity for international air carrier \n     alliances and the process for approving such alliances and \n     awarding that immunity;\n       (K) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and \n     joint ventures; and\n       (L) constraints on new entry into the domestic air \n     transportation marketplace;\n       (3) whether the policies and strategies of the United \n     States in international air transportation are promoting the \n     ability of United States air carriers to achieve long-term \n     competitive success in international air transportation \n     markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, \n     including--\n       (A) the general negotiating policy of the United States \n     with respect to international air transportation;\n       (B) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral \n     negotiations with respect to international air \n     transportation;\n       (C) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary \n     infrastructure of airports and airways to enable United \n     States air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the \n     demand for air transportation between the United States and \n     those countries;\n       (D) the desirability of liberalization of United States \n     domestic air transportation markets;

Res. 388) supporting the goals of \n     International Women's Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with an amendment and an amendment to the preamble, as \nfollows:\n  (Strike out all after the resolving clause and insert the part \nprinted in italic.)\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n       Whereas, in March 2016, there are more than 3,640,000,000 \n     women in the world;\n       Whereas women around the world--\n       (1) have fundamental rights;\n       (2) participate in the political, social, and economic \n     lives of their communities;\n       (3) play a critical role in providing and caring for their \n     families;\n       (4) contribute substantially to economic growth and the \n     prevention and resolution of conflict; and\n       (5) as farmers and caregivers, play an important role in \n     the advancement of food security for their communities;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas, on July 28, 2015, in Mandela Hall at the African \n     Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the President told \n     individuals in Africa--\n       (1) ``if you want your country to grow and succeed, you \n     have to empower your women. And if you want to empower more \n     women, America will be your partner''; and\n       (2) ``girls cannot go to school and grow up not knowing how \n     to read or write--that denies the world future women \n     engineers, future women doctors, future women business \n     owners, future women presidents--that sets us all back'';\n       Whereas 2015 marked the 20th anniversary of the Fourth \n     World Conference on Women, where 189 countries committed to \n     integrating gender equality into each dimension of society;\n       Whereas 2016 will mark the 5-year anniversary of the \n     establishment of the first United States National Action Plan \n     on Women, Peace, and Security, which includes a comprehensive \n     set of commitments by the United States to advance the \n     meaningful participation of women in decisionmaking relating \n     to matters of war or peace;\n       Whereas the first United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security states that, ``Deadly conflicts \n     can be more effectively avoided, and peace can be best forged \n     and sustained, when women become equal partners in all \n     aspects of peace-building and conflict prevention, when their \n     lives are protected, their experiences considered, and their \n     voices heard.'';\n       Whereas there are 58 national action plans around the \n     world, and there are 15 national action plans known to be in \n     development;\n       Whereas at the White House Summit on Countering Violent \n     Extremism in February 2015, leaders from more than 60 \n     countries, multilateral bodies, civil society, and private \n     sector organizations agreed to a comprehensive action agenda \n     against violent extremism that--\n       (1) highlights the importance of the inclusion of women in \n     countering the threat of violent extremism; and\n       (2) notes that ``women are partners in prevention and \n     response, as well as agents of change'';\n       Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict \n     prevention and conflict resolution efforts, despite the \n     proven success of women in conflict-affected regions in--\n       (1) moderating violent extremism;\n       (2) countering terrorism;\n       (3) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation and \n     negotiation; and\n       (4) stabilizing societies by improving access to peace and \n     security--\n       (A) services;\n       (B) institutions; and\n       (C) venues for decisionmaking;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, peace negotiations \n     are more likely to end in a peace agreement when women's \n     groups play an influential role in the negotiation process;\n       Whereas according to a study by the International Peace \n     Institute, a peace agreement is 35 percent more likely to \n     last at least 15 years if women participate in the \n     development of the peace agreement;\n       Whereas according to the Bureau of International Narcotics \n     and Law Enforcement Affairs of the Department of State, the \n     full and meaningful participation of women in security forces \n     vastly enhances the effectiveness of the security forces;\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2015, the Secretary of State and the \n     Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of \n     the United Kingdom highlighted, ``our goal must be to build \n     societies in which sexual violence is treated--legally and by \n     every institution of authority--as the serious and wholly \n     intolerable crime that it is. We have seen global campaigns \n     and calls to action draw attention to this issue and mobilize \n     governments and organizations to act. But transformation \n     requires the active participation of men and women \n     everywhere. We must settle for nothing less than a united \n     world saying no to sexual violence and yes to justice, \n     fairness and peace.'';\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Children's \n     Emergency Fund (referred to in this preamble as ``UNICEF''), \n     in 2014--\n       (1) 700,000,000 women or girls had been married before the \n     age of 18; and\n       (2) 250,000,000 women or girls had been married before the \n     age of 15;\n       Whereas, on October 11, 2013, the President strongly \n     condemned the practice of child marriage;\n       Whereas according to UNICEF--\n       (1) approximately \\1/4\\ of girls between the ages of 15 and \n     19 are victims of physical violence; and\n       (2) it is estimated that 1 in 3 women around the world has \n     experienced some form of physical or sexual violence;\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\n       Whereas according to the 2012 report of the United Nations \n     Office on Drugs and Crime entitled the ``Global Report on \n     Trafficking in Persons''--\n       (1) adult women account for between 55 and 60 percent of \n     all known trafficking victims worldwide; and\n       (2) adult women and girls account for approximately 75 \n     percent of all known trafficking victims worldwide;\n       Whereas women in conflict zones are subjected to physical \n     or sexual violence, including rape, other forms of sexual \n     violence, and human trafficking;\n       Whereas 603,000,000 women live in countries in which \n     domestic violence is not criminalized;\n       Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the President announced the \n     United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based \n     Violence Globally, the first interagency strategy to address \n     gender-based violence around the world;\n       Whereas, in December 2015, the Department of State released \n     a report on the implementation of the United States Strategy \n     to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally that \n     states, ``Addressing GBV is intimately tied to a range of \n     global efforts that address gender equality and women's and \n     girls' empowerment, whether in peacetime or in the midst of \n     conflict. This includes addressing GBV as part of efforts to \n     raise the status of adolescent girls and through women's \n     economic empowerment activities.'';\n       Whereas the ability of women and girls to realize their \n     full potential is critical to the ability of a country to \n     achieve--\n       (1) strong and lasting economic growth; and\n       (2) political and social stability;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific, and Cultural Organization, \\2/3\\ of the \n     775,000,000 illiterate individuals in the world are female;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank Group, 150,000,000 \n     children currently enrolled in school will drop out before \n     completing primary school, not less than 100,000,000 of whom \n     are girls;\n       Whereas according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, in comparison with uneducated \n     women, educated women are--\n       (1) less likely to marry as children; and\n       (2) more likely to have healthier families;\n       Whereas the goal of the United Nations Millennium Project \n     to eliminate gender disparity in primary education was \n     reached in most countries by 2015, but more work remains to \n     achieve gender equality in primary education worldwide;\n       Whereas in September 2015 world leaders rededicated \n     themselves to ending discrimination against women and girls \n     and advancing equality for women worldwide;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, women have access \n     to fewer income earning opportunities and are more likely to \n     manage the household or engage in agricultural work than men, \n     making women more vulnerable to economic insecurity caused \n     by--\n       (1) natural disasters; or\n       (2) long term changes in weather patterns;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank Group, women own or \n     partially own more than \\1/3\\ of small- and medium-sized \n     enterprises in developing countries, and 40 percent of the \n     global workforce is female, but female entrepreneurs and \n     employers have disproportionately less access to capital and \n     other financial services than men;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, women earn less \n     than men globally;\n       Whereas despite the achievements of individual female \n     leaders--\n       (1) women around the world remain vastly underrepresented \n     in--\n       (A) high-level positions; and\n       (B) national and local legislatures and governments; and\n       (2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women \n     account for only 22 percent of national parliamentarians and \n     17.7 percent of government ministers;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, during \n     the period beginning in 1990 and ending in 2015, global \n     maternal mortality decreased by approximately 44 percent, but \n     approximately 830 women die from preventable causes relating \n     to pregnancy or childbirth each day, and 99 percent of all \n     maternal deaths occur in developing countries;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization--\n       (1) suicide is the leading cause of death for girls between \n     the ages of 15 and 19; and\n       (2) complications from pregnancy or childbirth is the \n     second-leading cause of death for those girls;\n       Whereas the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees reports that approximately \\1/2\\ of--\n       (1) refugees and internally displaced or stateless \n     individuals are women; and\n       (2) the 59,500,000 displaced individuals in the world are \n     women;\n       Whereas it is imperative--\n       (1) to alleviate violence and discrimination against women; \n     and\n       (2) to afford women every opportunity to be full and \n     productive members of their communities;\n       Whereas, on October 10, 2014, Malala Yousafzai became the \n     youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate for her work \n     promoting the access of girls to education; and\n       Whereas March 8, 2016, is recognized as International \n     Women's Day, a global day--\n       (1) to celebrate the economic, political, and social \n     achievements of women in the past, present, and future; and\n       (2) to recognize the obstacles that women face in the \n     struggle for equal rights and opportunities: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of International Women's Day;\n       (2) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of a country to \n     generate--\n       (A) economic growth;\n       (B) sustainable democracy; and\n       (C) inclusive security;\n       (3) recognizes and honors individuals in the United States \n     and around the world, including women human rights defenders \n     and civil society leaders, that have worked throughout \n     history to ensure that women are guaranteed equality and \n     basic human rights;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment--\n       (A) to end discrimination and violence against women and \n     girls;\n       (B) to ensure the safety and welfare of women and girls;\n       (C) to pursue policies that guarantee the basic human \n     rights of women and girls worldwide; and\n       (D) to promote meaningful and significant participation of \n     women in every aspect of society and community;\n       (5) supports sustainable, measurable, and global \n     development that seeks to achieve gender equality and the \n     empowerment of women; and\n       (6) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.
