Mr. President, we have all heard the legal maxim ``Justice \ndelayed is justice denied,'' and it is really applicable to what is \ngoing on in the Senate today. Here in this body, justice is being \ndelayed by the Republican majority. The refusal of the Senate \nRepublicans to heed their constitutional duty to provide advice and \nconsent on judicial nominations is an injustice to the American people.\n  So far this year, the Senate has confirmed two judicial nominations--\njust two--in more than 4 months. By contrast, in 2007, my first year as \nmajority leader during the Bush administration, we had already \nconfirmed 16 nominations. If the Republican majority keeps up their \ncurrent trend of ignoring judicial nominees, by the end of this year we \nwill have confirmed five for an entire year. The last time the Senate \nconfirmed so few Presidential nominations was, unsurprisingly, when we \nhad a Republican majority here in the Senate under the Clinton \nadministration. It is funny how history repeats itself.\n  The Federal courts depend on the Senate to do its job so justice can \nbe dispensed in courtrooms all across the country. As of today, there \nare 55 Federal court vacancies, 24 of which are classified as \nemergencies. At the beginning of the year, there were only 12 judicial \nemergencies, but now it is double that--24. These vacancies create a \nbacklog of cases, effectively delaying justice for plaintiffs and \ndefendants, for prosecutors and the accused, and for the sitting judges \nwho are trying their best to administer justice, but they can't do \ntheir work because they are so overwhelmed with work.\n  This is about more than judges and lawyers. This is about the people \nwho come before the courts, people who have cases that have been \nwaiting and waiting. This is about a prosecutor who is going after \nsomebody who, in their opinion, has done something really bad. We have \nall heard the expression ``They are trying to make a Federal case out \nof it.'' The reason they say that is because Federal prosecutors do \nsuch a great job. But if they have to wait and wait until there is \navailability in the courtroom, witnesses disappear and it makes it much \nmore difficult.\n  What has happened to our judicial system is, because of the \nRepublicans, we are having justice delayed. This is unconscionable.\n  It is no wonder Republicans are scrambling for cover on judicial \nnominations. They are scrambling because they have been ignoring their \nconstitutional duty.\n  This afternoon, the courts are going to be looked at by the Judiciary \nCommittee. In fact, the committee is going to hold a hearing on several \ndelayed judicial nominations. But everyone should look at Felipe \nRestrepo, the President's nominee to the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals. That is in Pennsylvania and other places--a very important \ncircuit. Despite being nominated by the President 6 months ago, this \nman is not even going to be on the calendar. And this is what was done \npreviously. The man, my friend, who is chair of the Committee on \nFinance, was chair of the Judiciary Committee\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\nback in those days, and he did the same thing--just ignored them, \ndidn't even schedule them for a hearing. Senator Leahy has been to the \nfloor many times--our past chair of the Judiciary Committee, now \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee--talking about how bad that \nused to be, and now he is talking about how bad it is even today.\n  So Restrepo and others will not be on the agenda. Despite the fact \nthat this Philadelphia-based seat is a judicial emergency, they just \nignore people like Restrepo. They say: We only have a few people on the \ncalendar. Why aren't there more on the calendar?\n  Because they won't schedule hearings. It is so unfair.\n  Now Restrepo won't be on the agenda in spite of the fact that the \njunior Senator from Pennsylvania said Restrepo would be a ``superb \naddition to the third circuit.'' Why doesn't the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania talk about this man being held up by his own party? There \nis no reason he has been held up for 6 months other than the \nRepublicans simply want to do everything they can to create problems \nfor President Obama. But it is not a problem for President Obama. \nPresident Obama is doing just fine. It is a problem for the people I \nhave talked about--the prosecutors, those who are accused of crimes, \nplaintiffs and defendants in civil cases, and, of course, the judges.\n  After having heard the statement from the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania, I wonder what Pennsylvanians are thinking. Are they left \nwondering why this qualified judicial candidate is not moving forward \nand not a word from the junior Senator from Pennsylvania? Not a word.\n  It appears Republicans are heeding calls from the far right to \nretaliate against President Obama by blocking judges. Republicans \ncouldn't defend their trying to shut down the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They tried. They tried to block Loretta Lynch's nomination, \nand they couldn't get that done. So now they want to block President \nObama's judges.\n  Our courts should be above political gamesmanship. Qualified judicial \nnominees such as Mr. Restrepo deserve a vote in the Senate.\n  President Bush's judges were considered fairly when I was the \nmajority leader, and there is no one who can say that nominees are now \nbeing handled fairly. It is certainly not unreasonable for Democrats to \nexpect the same measure of cooperation and fairness from Republicans \nthat I gave them. The American judicial system should not be taking a \nbackseat to Republican politics here in the Senate, in our Nation's \nCapitol. If it were only the judges they are holding up, that would be \none thing, but Republican Senators are holding up basically all his \nnominations, with rare exception. For example, the chief law \nenforcement officer of this country, Loretta Lynch, who is well \nqualified in every way--experience, education, and character--was held \nup for 6 months. If what they did in her case wasn't bad enough, they \nnow are not allowing her to have the people she needs around her. They \nare not allowing a vote on her No. 1 assistant. It is unfair and just \ntoo bad that justice delayed is justice denied. I am sorry to say that \nis where we find ourselves today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2660-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate is now nearing completion of \nthe bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This is a bipartisan \nbill which is based on an important principle: that the American \npeople, through the Congress they elect, deserve a say on one of the \nmost important issues of our time.\n  This act would require that any agreement reached with Iran be \nsubmitted to Congress for a review. It would require that Congress be \ngiven time to hold hearings and to take a vote to approve or disapprove \nof the agreement before congressional sanctions could be lifted. It \nwould give Congress more power to rapidly impose sanctions if Iran does \ncheat.\n  Many wish the bill were stronger. I don't disagree with them. But \nthis is a piece of legislation worthy of our support. It offers the \nbest chance we have to provide the American people and the Congress \nthey elect with the power to weigh in on a vital issue. We will pursue \nother opportunities to address Iran's full-spectrum campaign to \nincrease its sphere of influence in the broader Middle East as well.\n  I look forward to Senators of both parties coming together to pass \nthis bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act soon. Once we do, the \nSenate will take up another measure designed to hold the administration \naccountable: the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act. This bipartisan bill is about a lot more than just \nexpanding Congress's oversight authority. It is about delivering \nprosperity for the middle class and supporting jobs. It is about \nhelping American workers sell more of what they make and farmers sell \nmore of what they grow. It is about eliminating unfair rules in other \ncountries that discriminate against American workers and American jobs. \nRemember, the United States already has one of the most open markets in \nthe world, but other countries maintain unfair barriers against \nAmerican goods and services--barriers that trade agreements can reduce \nor even eliminate to make things fairer for America.\n  That is why the United States is currently involved in negotiations \nwith Europe and several nations in the Pacific such as Japan--in order \nto break down barriers to goods stamped ``Made in America.'' That is \nthe main point here. We want to knock down barriers to our goods \nstamped with ``Made in America'' to be sold in other countries.\n  One estimate shows that trade agreements with Europe and the Pacific \ncould support as many as 1.4 million additional jobs in our country, \nincluding over 18,000 in Kentucky alone. But in order to get there, we \nwill first need to lay down some clear and fair rules of the road for \nour trade negotiators. That is what the Bipartisan Congressional Trade \nPriorities and Accountability Act would do.\n  First, it would make Congress's priorities clear, issuing specific \nobjectives for the administration's trade negotiators.\n  Second, it would mandate transparency, forcing the administration to \nconsult regularly with Congress and stakeholders.\n  And it would reaffirm the supremacy of this body and require our \nexclusive approval before trade agreements are enacted.\n  The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act \nis good bipartisan legislation that was endorsed overwhelmingly in the \nFinance Committee 20 to 6. It is good for the middle class, it is good \nfor manufacturers, and, yes, it is very good for farmers.\n  Here is what one Kentucky constituent--a corn, wheat, and soybean \nfarmer from Spencer County--recently wrote to say on the issue:\n\n       We need free trade to compete with grain farms in South \n     America. Dozens of people have jobs as a direct result of our \n     small business: Input suppliers, truckers, mechanics and \n     traders, just to name a few.\n\n  He went on.\n\n       Help me and all these people by expanding trade and \n     consumption globally. Our future depends on it.\n\n  Well, I couldn't agree more with that farmer from Spencer County. Our \nfuture does depend on cultivating better opportunities for American \ngoods, American crops, and American workers in the 21st century.\n  I look forward to the Senate turning to the Bipartisan Congressional \nTrade Priorities and Accountability Act very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2660-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we continue to fight against ISIS and \nthose radicalized by them, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join \nefforts to provide direct assistance to a critical partner in that \nfight--the Kurdistan Regional Government.\n  Yesterday, I joined Senator Barbara Boxer of California to do just \nthat. We introduced bipartisan legislation to provide temporary \nauthority for the President to provide weapons directly to Iraqi \nKurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS. This legislation \nbuilds upon a similar bipartisan House effort led by House Foreign \nAffairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel. The \nbill's 3-year authorization seeks to reduce delays in arming Peshmerga \nforces to fight ISIS, while still maintaining consultation with the \nIraqi Government.\n  Beginning in the first gulf war, the Iraqi Kurds and their Peshmerga \nforces have played a vital role in supporting U.S. interests and a free \nIraq, despite limited means of doing so.\n  Since August 2014, the Kurds have provided sanctuary to nearly 2 \nmillion ethnic and religious minorities in Iraqi Kurdistan, and they \nhave been the only force to hold its ground against ISIS in northern \nIraq.\n  Currently, by law, the United States must provide support to the \nIraqi Kurds through the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, which has \noften not been timely or adequate in the past. This has had a negative \nimpact on the Kurds' ability to defend Iraqi territory and provide \nsecurity for those Iraqis and Syrians who have sought refuge in Iraqi \nKurdistan.\n  Last November, Secretary of State John Kerry said that if Chairman \nRoyce wanted to change current law--to ``fix it''--that he invited him \nto do so. Well, that is exactly what this legislation does.\n  It makes it the policy of the United States to provide direct \nassistance to the Kurdistan Regional Government to combat ISIS. We do \nthat because we believe that defeating ISIS is critical to maintaining \nan inclusive and unified Iraq and that the Iraqi Kurds are key in that \ngoal, as well as to help to end the humanitarian crisis in Iraq through \ntheir support of over 1.6 million displaced persons from Iraq and \nSyria.\n  The legislation preserves the President's ability to notify the Iraqi \nGovernment before weapons, equipment, defense services or related \ntraining is provided to Iraqi Kurdish forces.\n  It ensures this emergency authorization does not construct a \nprecedent of providing direct support to organizations other than a \ncountry or an international organization. Finally, it works toward \naccountability by requiring a report to Congress on U.S. weapons \nprovided to the Iraqi Government which have ended up in the hands of \nIranian controlled and supported Shia militias or foreign terrorist \ngroups.\n  ISIS is deadly and determined, and Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces--\nour critical partner in the fight against ISIS--need U.S. weapons as \nquickly as possible.\n  This 3-year authorization would bolster efforts against ISIS, which \nare critical to maintaining a unified and stable Iraq and imperative to \nour national security interests. We simply cannot afford to have future \ndelays at this critical moment in the battle.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this much-needed \nlegislation to arm the Iraqi Kurds in the fight against ISIS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Thursday a week ago I had the privilege, \nas a member of the Finance Committee, to serve on the markup of the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, trade promotion authority, and \ntrade adjustment and assistance.\n  This past Saturday, I was given the opportunity to give the \nRepublican response on the radio, and I talked about trade promotion \nauthority. I have been privileged to be ranking member and chairman at \none time of the African Affairs Subcommittee. I have traveled back and \nforth to the continent of Africa, seen the opportunities for trade, \nbusiness, and exchange with the African people.\n  I came to the Congress in 1999. In that year, I voted for trade \npromotion authority for President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Later, I \nvoted for trade promotion authority for President Bush, a Republican. \nAnd I proudly will vote for trade promotion authority for President \nObama, a Democrat, because trade is not a partisan issue. It should not \nbe nor should it ever be a partisan issue. It should be an issue of the \nAmerican people's employment opportunities and jobs in the future. \nTrade is the cement that holds together the diplomacy and the \nagreements between countries to work together, play together, and not \nfight together and not have armed conflict. Trade is important to the \nsecurity of the United States of America and, in fact, the rest of the \nworld.\n  But I don't want to talk about trade promotion authority today. I \nwant to talk about the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  Africa is the continent of the 21st century for the United States of \nAmerica, with 1.5 billion mouths to feed, a number of votes at the \nUnited Nations, in terms of the African countries, but most \nimportantly, it has the rarest earth minerals and the natural resources \nso important to us and the rest of the world. Africa is a gold mine \nwaiting to be mined. But it is not one that we abuse, like the Chinese \nare abusing it. It is one where we share in prosperity.\n  When China goes into Africa, they bring their own workers, pay their \nown workers with Chinese currency, extract the rarest minerals--oil and \npetroleum and natural resources--and then leave.\n  When America goes, we invest in the human capital with PEPFAR to \nreduce the rate of AIDS, and we invest in the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation to bring jobs, opportunities, and a lack of corruption to \nthe African people.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act is a godsend for the continent \nof Africa, but it is a godsend to the country of the United States of \nAmerica. In the future, Africa will become our greatest trading partner \nif we handle it right.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act that will be before us, along \nwith TPA, is a 10-year extension of our goal. That is important, \nbecause it gives predictability to the African countries and the United \nStates. But, more importantly, it gives us the opportunity to file \ncases with the Trade Representative against those countries that are \nnot playing by the rules.\n  South Africa is a perfect example. They have blocked access to their \nmarket to poultry from the United States of America, with arbitrary and \ncapricious blockades to keep our poultry from going in.\n  Senator Coons from Delaware and I from Georgia, two big poultry \nStates, have confronted the South Africans. We know that under the new \nAGOA, when it is passed and ratified by this Congress and by the \nAfrican countries as well, it will give us the opportunity to file a \npetition to ask the Trade Representative to file a case to open up the \nSouth African practices. And if they are found to be not right--or \nwrong or corrupt--then we can block South Africa's participation in \nparts of the AGOA or all of the AGOA. In other words, the AGOA is going \nto have consequences, much as the Millennium Challenge account does.\n  Today, when America makes an investment in a foreign country in \nAfrica for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, there are consequences \nif they don't end corruption, if they don't have private sector \nparticipation, if they don't have the rule of law governing their \nproject. We pull the Millennium Challenge Corporation out, and they \ndon't get another grant.\n  Look at the nation of Ghana, which is now working on its third grant, \nor the nation of Benin, which is working on its second. Both are \nimproving their infrastructure and their ability to trade and produce \nwith America because of a joint venture between our country and those \ncountries.\n  I urge all my colleagues in the House and the Senate to adopt the \nAfrican\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nGrowth and Opportunity Act for three reasons.\n  No. 1, it is a 10-year predictable extension of a relationship we \nneed to grow and prosper.\n  No. 2, it gives us the tools not to be abused, and it makes sure that \nif one of the African countries is abusing American access to their \nmarket, we can stop it and file a case with the Trade Representative.\n  But No. 3, it offers hope and prosperity for America in the 21st \ncentury--with 1.5 billion mouths to feed, rare earth minerals, natural \nresources, the power of the people and the power of the purse of the \npeople. Africa is the continent of the 21st century for our country. \nHaving a trade agreement with Africa is essential to seeing to it that \nwe have a prosperous and free future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, yesterday, along with Senator Mikulski and \nCongressmen Cummings and Ruppersberger and Sarbanes, I was in Baltimore \nwith Attorney General Lynch meeting with our faith-based leaders. \nAttorney General Lynch also met with the mayor of Baltimore as well as \nthe family of Freddie Gray. She also met with our Baltimore City Police \nDepartment. I wish to thank the Attorney General for her personal \npresence in Baltimore.\n  For those of us who live in Baltimore, the events over these last \ncouple of weeks have been heartbreaking. The city we love has gone \nthrough a very difficult time. I wish to thank my colleagues who have \ncontacted Senator Mikulski and me for offering their help, for offering \ntheir understanding, and for their willingness to work together so we \ncan deal with the issues that have been raised in Baltimore--and other \ncities, quite frankly--in other places around the country. It is our \nresponsibility to move forward, and the people of Baltimore understand \nthat. We understand the national spotlight will be leaving and we are \ngoing to need to deal with the issues that are left behind.\n  To me, there are two pillars for the rebuilding of Baltimore and \nrestoring confidence; one deals with public safety and justice and the \nother deals with rebuilding as a result of the damages that were caused \nand dealing with the core problems that led up to the violence in \nBaltimore. I believe that we in Baltimore can serve as a model for the \ncountry as to how we can make our community and our Nation stronger.\n  On the public safety and justice pillar, let me make some suggestions \nto my colleagues. I have spoken to several of my colleagues about areas \nwhere I hope we can work together in order to restore public safety and \njustice in our community. One of those issues is a bill I filed that \nwould end racial profiling in America. We should have passed this bill \na long time ago.\n  Racial profiling--profiling because of the race of a community or the \nethnic background or a religion--is just wrong. It is against the \nvalues we believe in in this country. It turns communities against law \nenforcement. We saw that in Baltimore and we have seen it in other \ncommunities around the country where the local community just does not \nhave confidence that the police department is working on their behalf. \nWe heard examples of that yesterday in the roundtable discussion we had \nwith the faith-based leaders. We have to restore that confidence. One \nway to do it is to make it clear that our national policy is against \nprofiling by police.\n  Now, let me make it clear that if a person has some specific \ninformation about a particular crime and identifies who is responsible, \nthat is not profiling. That is not what we are talking about. We are \ntalking about communities in Baltimore and around the country where a \nperson is African American and they have a much better chance of being \nstopped by police just because of the color of their skin. That is \nwrong, and it has to end in America. We need to take action in this \nbody, the U.S. Senate, to make it clear that we will not permit racial \nprofiling. It is not only wrong and counterproductive to neighborhoods \nworking with police; it is costly. We have limited resources to spend \nin law enforcement. It is not productive in keeping communities safe, \nand as we have seen around the country, it can be deadly. We need to do \nmore in this area.\n  I have spoken to some of my colleagues about some of the sentencing \nguidelines we have in this country. They are certainly discriminatory \nagainst certain communities in America. We need to take a look at our \ncriminal justice system and at the sentencing guidelines to recognize \nthat if a person is of a certain race or a certain religion or ethnic \nbackground, that person is much more likely to end up in prison today, \neven though the incidents of the violations of the law are no different \nin their community than in other communities in this country. We have \nto deal with it. This country has to deal with that.\n  Lastly, I have introduced legislation that would restore voting \nprivileges for those who have completed their prison sentences, and we \nneed to pass it. I know I have support on both sides of the aisle. We \nhad a vote on that not too long ago, where we had almost a majority \nwilling to move forward. I hope we can come to an agreement. I remember \nthe opposition said it is the wrong bill. Well, let's get a bill that \nis the right bill to restore voting privileges to those who complete \ntheir sentences.\n  They can then again become a part of the community. They know we \nbelieve they have a future. They should be able to serve on our juries. \nThere is not a person who is serving in the U.S. Senate who didn't have \na second chance sometime in their life. All of us need a second chance. \nWe can't give up on people. I think the experiences we have seen in \nBaltimore and around the rest of the country indicate that we all have \na stake in rebuilding and giving opportunities to every person in our \ncommunity.\n  I talked about rebuilding and dealing with the core issues that led \nup to the violence in Baltimore. There was a letter written to the \nBaltimore Sun this week that said we need a Marshall Plan for America's \ncities. That sort of struck me because I thought back to World War II, \nwhen Europe was burning and the United States came to the rescue of \nEurope and put out the fire. But we didn't stop there. We then planted \nthe seeds for the rebuilding of Europe. We were not alone. Other \ncountries helped us, the private community helped us, businesses helped \nus, and Europe was rebuilt.\n  So it is not enough just to restore public order on the streets of \nBaltimore. We have to rebuild in a way that we give opportunities for \njobs for all the people in the community. We talked about what is going \nto happen this summer. Will there be summer jobs for our young people? \nWill we have permanent jobs for them? We have to work on that.\n  We have to work on rebuilding. We can do this. We have come together \nin the past. We are the strongest country in the world. The United \nStates has been there to help people around the world. We said we would \npursue efforts about ending HIV/AIDS under President Reagan, and the \nPEPFAR Program has changed the dynamics around the world on the spread \nof HIV/AIDS. It is time we used that energy here in America to help the \npeople of this country.\n  So I hope we will all come together and look at the core problems and \nhelp rebuild America. It is appropriate that we talk about it the day \nafter we passed our budget. I hope, as we get to the individual \nappropriations bills, that we understand the Federal Government, in \npartnership with the private sector, in partnership with State and \nlocal governments, can do a better job.\n  Today, Secretary Perez, the Secretary of Labor, is going to be in \nBaltimore meeting with local officials to figure out how the Federal \nGovernment can partner with us to provide resources to energize the \nprivate sector, to energize the rebirth of Baltimore. I heard a request \nfrom groups I met with about the new markets tax credit. We\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\nneed to extend those types of credits that can make a difference in our \nurban centers. I visited with Pastor Hickman whose church was torched--\nthe senior housing project next door to his church was on fire last \nMonday night. He is rebuilding that senior housing project, but he \nclearly knows he needs partners from the Federal Government.\n  We can do a better job. I urge my colleagues to understand we can do \nthis. We must do this. We must rebuild our cities and our communities \nfor a better Baltimore and for the betterment of America's future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Criminal Justice Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as were most Americans, I was very \ndisturbed by the scenes from Baltimore that unfolded on our TV sets \nacross America--a place not too far away from here--during the last \ncouple of weeks. The whole idea of a young man dying in police custody, \nfollowed by the confrontations with police and the looting and burning \nof innocent minority-owned businesses in their own neighborhoods--these \nare all scenes we would expect perhaps in other countries, somewhere \nelse around the world, but certainly not here at home. But that is what \nwe saw and not just last week but also last summer in Ferguson, MO.\n  So the question arises: What can we do? What can we do about it? What \ncan we do as individual citizens? What can we do as parents? What can \nwe do as neighbors? And then: What can we do as Members of the U.S. \nCongress? Perhaps more fundamentally, how can we as a nation unite to \naddress injustice when it occurs? What steps can we take today to help \nthe diverse fabric of this great Nation mend for future generations?\n  As I indicated, I am somewhat skeptical that Washington, DC, and \nparticularly the U.S. Congress, can wave a magic wand and solve these \nproblems. A lot of this is going to have to be worked out at the local \nlevel by communities, by families, by houses of faith, and by civic \norganizations as well. Obviously, they are closest to the situation. \nBut the Federal Government does, I believe, have a role to play that I \nwill speak about in just a moment. I will just conclude in speaking \nabout Baltimore by saying that our prayers, I know, are with those \ninvolved, and I know they are carefully considering how best to move \nforward and heal as well. But we are doing a great disservice to \nourselves and to everyone else so clearly frustrated by the status quo \nif we isolate Baltimore or Ferguson as just individual instances of \ncivil unrest and if we don't step back and see how they fit into the \nbroader issue of our entire criminal justice system.\n  I sometimes call myself a recovering judge. I was a district judge \nfor 6 years, which is our main trial court in Texas, and I was on the \nTexas Supreme Court for 7 years after that. I also served as attorney \ngeneral. I mention all of that just to say that I have had some \nexposure in my professional life and in my adult life with our criminal \njustice system. I have seen how it should work, and I have seen areas \nwhere we need to get to work to reform what is broken.\n  I believe Congress can and must play a role--even a small role; I say \nsmall but in a significant way--by correcting injustice where we can \nand making it less likely that situations such as those we have seen in \nFerguson or Baltimore are repeated. While we cannot singlehandedly fix \nbroken families or broken communities or deal with situations at the \nlocal level around the country, we can contribute to efforts to remedy \nthe basic instability of those communities and particularly we can \nstart to make real progress in our criminal justice system to lessen \nthe burden on those communities that are struggling with these issues.\n  I know the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Senator \nGrassley, is committed to doing what he can, through the Committee on \nthe Judiciary, to pursue criminal justice reform. I am happy to say \nthat under the leadership of Senator Grassley, many efforts are already \nunderway to consider how we can do a better job of rehabilitating \noffenders, increase public safety, save taxpayers some money, and help \nrebuild that all-important relationship between law enforcement and \nlocal communities.\n  One example of how we are doing that is a piece of legislation I \nintroduced in February with the junior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse, called the CORRECTIONS Act, which stands for the \nCorrections Oversight, Recidivism Reduction, and Eliminating Costs for \nTaxpayers In Our National System Act. That is why we call it \nCORRECTIONS, because that is such a long title, but I think it says a \nlot about what we are trying to achieve.\n  With about 30 percent of the Department of Justice budget spent on \ndetaining Federal inmates and the costs of Federal prisons \nskyrocketing, this bill would actually take a number of constructive \nsteps to reform our Federal prison system and would also make better \nuse of taxpayers' money.\n  For example, the CORRECTIONS Act would allow eligible offenders--\nmainly low-risk or medium-risk offenders; certainly not high-risk \noffenders--to earn additional days of good time credit by participating \nin programs that will help equip them for life outside of prison. Texas \nis sometimes considered a tough-on-crime State, and that is true. After \nawhile, though, we realized we\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nalso need to be smart on crime because virtually all of the people \nincarcerated in our prisons will eventually someday be released. We \nneed to begin to focus on what we can do to help them--those who want \nhelp and who will accept that help--and how we can do a better job of \nequipping them so they don't end up recommitting, reoffending, and \nending up back in prison again. That is what this piece of legislation \ntries to do.\n  So the CORRECTIONS Act allows offenders to earn additional days of \nearned time credit by participating in programs that will prepare them \nfor life outside of prison. Low-risk offenders, for example, could earn \nup to 10 days of earned time credit for every month in which they are \nsuccessfully completing programs such as drug rehab, education, work \nprograms, faith-based training, and life skills courses. It is \nastonishing. I was in East Texas at one part of the Texas prison system \nwhere I got to observe some of the prisoners, some of the inmates there \nattending some of these types of courses. It is shocking how poorly \nequipped so many of these inmates are for life outside of prison and \nwhy it is so important that we try to help those who will accept the \nhelp and who want the help to prepare for life outside so they don't \nend up back inside.\n  This legislation would allow these eligible prisoners to use this \ngood time credit to spend the final portion of their sentences in home \nconfinement or a halfway house. Half-way houses have worked over time \nas a transition from prison to life in communities, and they work very \nwell. Also, technology can even allow home confinement for nonviolent, \nlow-risk prisoners who have earned the right to a less confining \ncircumstance on the backhand of their sentence. This may sound like a \nlittle thing, but it is important for several reasons.\n\n  First of all, inmates need to learn valuable skills that can transfer \nto a lifetime of community engagement, instead of returning to a \nlifetime of crime. Second, it allows them to reconnect sooner with \ntheir families and the communities that need them most. Finally, this \nmakes financial sense. It costs about $5,000 a year to keep a low-risk \nprisoner in home confinement, and it cost $30,000 a year to keep them \nin prison.\n  I am not one of those who say, well, we just need to save money, so \nlet's throw public safety to the wind. That is not what this does. We \nfocus first on public safety as we must, but we also try to be smart \nabout it--not just tough on crime. We try to be smart on crime. The \ngreat thing is that we actually have States such as my State that have \nexperimented with this sort of approach with great success. Texas has \nactually, over recent years, closed three prison systems. Crime has not \nspiked, and, in fact, many inmates who have taken advantage of this \nprogram have become resocialized and integrated back into society. So \nwe actually know. Rather than the Federal Government trying to mandate \nfor the entire Nation and adhering to some new experiment, we actually \nhave the laboratories of democracy--otherwise known as the States--\nunder our Federal system, trying things out to see if they will work, \nand we learn from that if we can. This is an area where we can learn, \nand we should.\n  So I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley and our members \nof the Judiciary Committee to get the CORRECTIONS Act passed. The last \ntime it was considered, last year, it passed overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis through the Judiciary Committee.\n  As I said, fortunately, Chairman Grassley has made this a priority, \nand he has put together a bipartisan effort to look at some other \nconsensus ideas that we might add to this prison reform bill, such as \nsentencing reform. Honestly, that is a little bit more controversial, \nbecause I am not one for just cutting sentences on the front-end \nindiscriminately or arbitrarily. We need to make sure we are smart \nabout sentencing reform. I think this consensus-building effort that \nChairman Grassley has undertaken will help us get in the right place. \nThere are a number of targeted sentencing reforms I think we could all \nsupport to help address failures in our criminal justice system.\n  So we should not let the divisive, controversial proposals stand in \nthe way of making real bipartisan progress on the issue of criminal \njustice reform. But this is sort of a chronic problem we have had \naround here when we try to do comprehensive everything. When we try to \ndo comprehensive everything, we make mistakes. We also make it almost \nimpossible to do, because there are so many different moving parts. It \nis complicated, and many people remain skeptical about its chances of \nsucceeding. But when you have something such as the CORRECTIONS Act, \nwhich brings to the Federal level the successful pilot programs that \nhave been undertaken in the States, it just makes sense that this \nshould be the place we should start. Indeed, that is why it has such \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  In order to make sure that the conversation about criminal justice \nreform extends to issues beyond prison reform and sentencing, there is \nanother step the junior Senator from Michigan, the senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina, and I introduced just last week. This is another idea, \nbecause we realize the time that Congress has in our capacity, both on \nthe floor and in committee, to deal with this complex topic in a \nthoughtful and deliberate way. So we need some help, and what we have \nintroduced is something we call the National Criminal Justice \nCommission Act, which would create a commission to provide a top-down \nreview of our entire criminal justice system.\n  After completing a review of the system, this bipartisan commission \nwould work for a unanimous recommendation on how to strengthen it. \nCongress could--much as it did with the 9/11 Commission--take bits and \npieces of it. We wouldn't need to embrace all of it--or any of it, for \nthat matter. But at least we would have the good and thoughtful work \nproduct of some experts who would be able to make recommendations to us \nin a number of areas.\n  I was just at a meeting where somebody asked about the \novercriminalization of a regulatory state, and that is a real problem. \nThe fact that you can commit a crime without even intending to commit a \ncrime if you happen to violate some regulation is a real problem. There \nare a number of areas I think we need to look at. As our attention was \nriveted by what happened in Baltimore and Ferguson, I think those \nincidents are symptoms of a much bigger challenge, and I think this \ncommission would help us focus on building consensus and producing \nactionable results.\n  Importantly, the continuing dialogue and commission process will help \nus strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and communities \nand help us to build on consensus items such as the CORRECTIONS Act. I \nthink the CORRECTIONS Act is a good place to start, and the National \nCriminal Justice Act, the consensus-based sentencing reform--all of \nthese measures will help us improve our criminal justice system. It \nwill help bring down some of the tension we witnessed across the \nNation, and help us, again, be smart when it comes to dealing with our \ncriminal justice system.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this important effort. I think \nthis is the kind of big idea of a big challenge which will resonate \nwith the people we represent in our States and across the country. When \nthey see us coming together on a bipartisan basis and actually trying \nto solve problems, I think they feel that we are finally listening to \nthem and doing what we should be doing here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, for the past couple of weeks, we have \nbeen talking about very important things on the floor of the Senate. \nOne of the most\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\nimportant has been the possible deal with Iran over the country's \nnuclear program. I believe an agreement that could stop Iran's efforts \nto get nuclear weapons would be enormously significant. Making sure the \nAmerican people are involved in this process is also extremely \nimportant. There is bipartisan agreement on both of those things. We \nare still debating the Iran sanctions review act simply because it is \nso important. The debate has been going on.\n  This bill goes a long way toward protecting the right of the American \npeople to have a say on any deal and the right of Congress to review \nthe specifics of that deal. I know there are Senators who have ideas \nfor how to make this bill even better. I had an amendment last week, \nand I appreciated the chance to debate the amendment and to have a vote \non it. That is the important part of this process. It is a big reason \nwhy the Senate has been so much more productive, I believe, this year \nthan it was under the previous majority leader.\n  Under Republican leadership, Senators of both parties have gotten \nback the right to really represent our constituents--something we were \nelected to do. We have gotten back the right to work through \ncommittees, the right to offer amendments and to make our case on the \nfloor.\n  Republicans and Democrats agree that the bill before us right now is \nimportant. Congressional review of any Iranian deal is absolutely \nessential. We also agree that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a global \nthreat to everyone everywhere. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate \nknow it would be better to have no deal at all than to have a bad deal. \nEven President Obama has said that.\n  The concern many Americans have right now is that the deal the \nPresident seems prepared to sign is nowhere near strong enough. When I \ngo home to Wyoming every weekend, as I did this past weekend, the \npeople I talk with don't believe Iran has earned the right to be \ntrusted. They are very concerned that the President is ready to sign a \nvery bad deal. I think those concerns are absolutely justified. Iran \nhas avoided scrutiny of its nuclear program for years. What has \nhappened to make the President think all of a sudden that Iran will \ncome clean? I have not seen anything happen out there.\n  President Obama and his team have been too willing to negotiate \nwithout conditions and too hesitant to take the strong stand that I \nbelieve must be taken. The President never wanted these economic \nsanctions in the first place. He said the sanctions would ruin his \nchances of negotiating a deal at all. Remember that? Well, Congress \ninsisted anyway. Those sanctions did not drive Iran away; it is the \nsanctions themselves that brought Iran to the negotiating table. Now \nthe President admits that the sanctions, which he opposed, were a good \nidea. He still wanted to get rid of them as quickly as possible.\n  The President wanted members of his administration to do all of the \nnegotiating in private, and he wanted to decide by himself what is \nbest. Republicans and Democrats both said that Congress needs to review \nany deal before getting rid of the sanctions--the sanctions imposed by \nCongress. We said that he does not have the right to make such \nimportant decisions about sanctions imposed by Congress. He does not \nhave the right to eliminate them by himself.\n  It is very important that we keep asking questions about any \npotential deal, questions such as, what exactly is the Obama \nadministration agreeing to on sanctions relief? I mean, it is \ninteresting. Iran has said that the final deal must remove all of the \neconomic sanctions on day No. 1. The administration has said that the \nsanctions will be lifted in phases and only if Iran complies with \ndifferent steps along the way. Well, which is it? There is a big \ndifference between what the President is saying and what Iran is \nsaying.\n  The administration already gave Iran sanction relief from sanctions \nunder the interim agreement in 2013. We saw how that turned out. It has \ngiven Iran access to $12 billion in much needed hard currency since \nthen. The Obama administration has been unclear on exactly how much \nactual additional currency it plans to release under the final \nagreement. Tens of billions? I heard a number as high as over $100 \nbillion with sanctions relief. Well, once the rest of the sanctions are \nlifted, how can we make sure Iran does not use the money to support \nterrorists who want to attack us, who want to attack America? Iran has \na long history of supporting terrorists such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Is \nthat where the money is going to go? I do not believe Iran is going to \nuse the money to build roads or hospitals or schools.\n  What about Iran's plans for their nuclear program? Now Iran says they \nwant to do nuclear research for peaceful purposes. Have our negotiators \nmade any progress on holding Iran to its word on that specific point?\n  Back in November of 2013, Iran signed a framework agreement with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency that was supposed to address the \npossible military aspects of Iran's nuclear program. It named 12 \nspecific areas where Iran was going to address those concerns. The \nDirector General of that organization, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, now says that Iran has addressed only 1 of the 12 it promised \nto address--only 1 of 12 things it was supposed to do under the last \ndeal from 2013. What has changed since then to make President Obama and \nthe Obama administration think Iran is going to comply with this deal? \nWhy should we suddenly trust Iran now? What is there in the agreement \nthat will force Iran to do what it says it will do?\n  Congress needs to keep a very close eye on any final agreement. \nWhatever happens, a deal with Iran must be enforceable, it must be \nverifiable, and it must be accountable.\n  We know President Obama is looking to finish out his time by \npolishing his legacy. Congress needs to make sure this deal is about \nprotecting America and protecting Americans, not protecting the \nPresident's diplomatic legacy. The stakes are too high. So far, there \nare too many unanswered questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on my amendment to the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, to bolster Congress's role in \nmonitoring Iran's ballistic missile and defensive weapons activity. I \nhope this amendment is agreed to. It has been written, rewritten, and \nrewritten again to try to fit the concerns of the majority, the \nminority, everybody concerned.\n  My amendment simply requires the President to make an addition in his \nsemiannual report to Congress, including to the Finance Committee, of \nwhich I am a senior member, on any weapons sold, leased or lent by any \ncountry to Iran, which are currently prohibited under the United \nNations Security Council Resolution 1929--and sophisticated air defense \nsystems.\n  In 2010, the United Nations Security Council, including Russia, a \npermanent member of the security council, passed a new round of \nsanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Resolution 1929 prohibits Iran \nfrom investing abroad in uranium mining, related nuclear technologies \nor nuclear-capable ballistic missile technology, and prohibits Iran \nfrom launching ballistic missiles, including on its own territory.\n  That same year, Russia finalized a weapons sale with Iran on the S-\n300, much publicized today--the S-300 air defense system, which is not \ncurrently sanctioned by the United Nations. However, to provide a \nworking partnership and cooperation, then-Russian President Dmitry \nMedvedev placed a halt on the sale. Unfortunately, the situation and \nagreement has now changed dramatically. Today, we are contending with \nPresident Vladimir Putin.\n  Sophisticated air defense systems, such as the Russian-produced S-\n300, have the capability of shielding Iranian missile facilities from \noversight and airstrikes. This poses a real threat to global security, \nnot to mention peace in the Middle East and, as a consequence, all \nthroughout the world.\n  To prevent this threat, we must ensure our intelligence community is \ndoing everything in its power and capability to ensure the greatest \nthreat in\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nan unstable region, Iran, is not getting help from nations looking to \nboost their economy through weapons sales, regardless of the impact.\n  News reports now confirm Russia is preparing to sell Iran billions in \nsophisticated weaponry. News reports are one thing. However, it is \nimperative our intelligence community keeps the administration and the \nCongress briefed fully and on a timely basis on this national security \nthreat.\n  One month ago, reports revealed Russia's intention to sell the S-300 \nto Iran. I was alarmed when I asked my colleagues what they knew about \nthe immediacy of this sale before it was made public in news reports--\nmore specifically, members of the Select Committee on Intelligence--and \nit was apparent no one in the Senate had been fully briefed.\n\n  I cannot imagine any of my colleagues not wanting to know who is and \nwho may be planning to arm Iran or why the administration would not be \nwilling to share this information with the Congress--and know it \nthemselves. Our intelligence community can and surely must do better.\n  By requiring President Obama, and future Presidents as well, to \nprovide Congress with timely, actionable intelligence on Iran's weapons \nsystems, my amendment ensures that Congress can make informed decisions \nwith regard to our national security.\n  For Congress to support an agreement, Congress must be kept informed. \nIf a nuclear agreement with Iran has even the slightest chance of \npreventing a nuclear Iran, then we must be vigilant, at least to ensure \nthat other nations are not arming Iran and putting our allies in the \nregion--Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and, more \nespecially, Israel--at increased risk.\n  My amendment strengthens this bill by ensuring Congress obtains \noversight and intelligence on every country, especially Russia, \nregarding weapons sales to Iran.\n  So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider this \namendment and to join me in supporting increased oversight on all of \nIran's weapons activities.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for the 98th time to urge \nthis body to stop sleepwalking through history. Climate change is real, \nit is already harming the United States, and it is time for the Senate \nto wake up and address this threat.\n  The science that links carbon pollution to global warming is nothing \nnew. It dates back to President Lincoln. In the century and a half \nsince, we have measured changes in the climate that scientists \nvirtually unanimously say are caused by our burning of fossil fuels. \nAtmospheric carbon is now measured at 400 parts per million--higher \nthan ever in our species' history. Our oceans are warming and \nacidifying. Those are measurements again. We are experiencing the \nwarmest years ever recorded. More measurements. And rising seas are \nlapping at our shores. In Rhode Island, we measure nearly 10 inches of \nsea level rise since the 1930s. These are all measurements, not \nprojections. These are facts, not theories.\n  If we do not act soon to cut carbon pollution, we can reasonably \nexpect the consequences to be dire. Yet, the fossil fuel industry \ncontinues its crafty, cynical campaign of denial and delay. Big Coal, \nOil and Natural Gas, and related industries, such as the Koch brothers' \ncompanies, profit by offloading the costs of their carbon pollution \nonto the rest of us. They traffic in products that put health and \nsafety at risk, and they don't tell the truth about their products. \nSound familiar? Well, it should because the fossil fuel industry is \nusing a familiar playbook, one perfected by the tobacco industry. \nFollowing this same playbook, Big Tobacco fought for more than four \ndecades to bury the truth about the health effects of its product.\n  Well, the government has a playbook, too. It is called RICO, the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The elements of a \ncivil racketeering case are simple. The government must allege four \nthings: The defendants No. 1 conducted No. 2 an enterprise No. 3 \nthrough a pattern No. 4 of racketeering activity. Conducting means \neverything from directing to aiding and abetting the activity. An \nenterprise can be any form of association or a common scheme. Pattern \nmeans continuity of the scheme and--for civil RICO particularly--the \nprospect of ongoing conduct. Racketeering activity simply means a \nviolation of designated Federal laws, including the Federal mail fraud \nand wire fraud statutes.\n  In 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil RICO lawsuit \nagainst the major tobacco companies and their associated industry \ngroups. The government's complaint was clear: The tobacco companies \n``have engaged in and executed--and continue to engage in and execute--\na massive 50-year scheme to defraud the public, including consumers of \ncigarettes, in violation of RICO.''\n  Big Tobacco spent millions of dollars and years of litigation \nfighting the government, but finally, through discovery, government \nlawyers were able to peel back the layers of deceit and see what the \nbig tobacco companies really knew all along about cigarettes.\n  In 2006, Judge Gladys Kessler of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia decided the case. In a nearly 1,700-page opinion, \nshe found the tobacco companies' fraudulent campaign amounted to a \nracketeering enterprise. According to the court:\n\n       Defendants coordinated significant aspects of their public \n     relations, scientific, legal, and marketing activity in \n     furtherance of the shared objective--to . . . maximize \n     industry profits by preserving and expanding the market for \n     cigarettes through a scheme to deceive the public.\n\n  The parallels between what the tobacco industry did and what the \nfossil fuel industry is doing now are striking. In fact, we can go back \nand reread those judicial findings about tobacco, substitute the words \n``fossil fuel,'' and exactly describe what the fossil fuel industry is \nup to. That is without the benefit of discovery, where litigants get to \ndemand the production of documents and take the depositions of \npotential witnesses and require answers under oath. What a treasure \ntrove that would produce.\n  We know that the prospect of action on climate change is a business \nrisk for fossil fuel companies. Serious action on climate--a transition \nto clean, low-carbon energy--threatens to cut into polluters' market \nand profits. The match between the fossil fuel industry and Big Tobacco \nis pretty good in terms of the business risk presented if the public \nwere to be really aware of the harm. They have a motive to deceive.\n  We know that in the case of both tobacco and fossil fuels, the \nindustry joined together in a common enterprise and coordinated \nstrategy. Remember the finding in the tobacco case that defendants \ncoordinated significant aspects of their public relations, scientific, \nlegal and marketing activity in furtherance of the shared objective. \nHow about the fossil fuel industry?\n  In 1998, as the Clinton administration was building support for \ninternational climate action under the Kyoto Protocol, another group \nwas up to something else. That group was the fossil fuel industry, its \ntrade associations, and the conservative policy institutes that often \ndo the industry's dirty work with clean faces. They met at the \nWashington office of the American Petroleum Institute. Their plan? To \norganize a scheme to create doubt about climate change and to undermine \npublic support for American participation in the Kyoto agreement.\n  A memo from that meeting was leaked to the New York Times. The memo \ndocumented the polluters' plans for a multimillion-dollar public \nrelations campaign to undermine climate science. What was the project's \ngoal? To ensure that--and I will quote the memo here--``a majority of \nthe American Public, including industry leadership, recognizes that \nsignificant uncertainties exist in climate science, and\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\ntherefore raises questions among those (e.g. Congress) who chart the \nfuture U.S. course on global climate change.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the memo printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  If anything, the fossil fuel industry's climate denial scheme has \ngrown even bigger and more complex than Big Tobacco's. The shape of the \nfossil fuel industry's denial operation has been documented by, among \nothers, Drexel University Professor Robert Brulle. Brulle's follow-the-\nmoney analysis shows how the fossil fuel industry perpetuates climate \ndenial through a complex network of organizations and funding that is \ndesigned to obscure the fossil fuel industry's fingerprints. It is \nquite a beast.\n  This is the climate denial beast. Polluter money and dark money are \nits lifeblood. PR front groups are its organs, and lies and obfuscation \nare its work. Look at the complex interconnection of the beast's major \nplayers. The green diamonds are the big funders--the Koch-affiliated \nfoundations, the Scaife-affiliated Foundations, the American Petroleum \nInstitute. The blue circles are the who's who of tea party, \nlibertarian, and front groups who have wittingly or not become the \nflacks for the fossil fuel industry--the Heartland Institute, the \nHoover Institution, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and \nthe Mercatus Center, to name just a few. Think how much trouble someone \nmust have gone to to set all this in play. Think how important the \npurpose would have to be to them to take all that trouble.\n  What was the purpose of this network? To quote directly from Dr. \nBrulle's report, it was ``a deliberate and organized effort to \nmisdirect the public discussion and distort the public's understanding \nof climate.'' That sounds a lot like the judge's findings in the \ntobacco racketeering case: ``Defendants have intentionally maintained \nand coordinated their fraudulent position on addiction and nicotine as \nan important part of their overall efforts to influence public opinion \nand persuade people that smoking is not dangerous.''\n  The coordinated tactics of this network, Dr. Brulle's report states, \n``span a wide range of activities, including political lobbying, \ncontributions to political candidates, and a large number of \ncommunication and media efforts that aim at undermining climate \nscience.'' Compare that to the findings in the tobacco case: \n``Defendants coordinated significant aspects of their public relations, \nscientific, legal, and marketing activity in furtherance of the shared \nobjective.''\n  So that is the beast, and big money flows through it.\n  Brulle's report chronicles that from 2003 to 2010, 140 foundations \nmade 5,299 grants totaling $558 million to 91 organizations that \nactively oppose climate action. For decades, the tobacco industry did \nthe same thing. In the tobacco case, Judge Kessler found that the \n``defendants took steps to fund research designed and controlled to \ngenerate industry favorable results, and to suppress adverse research \nresults.''\n  Look at the recent affair with Dr. Willie Soon, a scientist who \nconsistently publishes papers downplaying the role of carbon dioxide \nemissions in causing climate change. Through the Freedom of Information \nAct, we know that Dr. Soon has received more than half of his funding \nfrom oil and electric utility coal interests. His fossil fuel backers \ninclude the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil, the Charles G. \nKoch Foundation, and the Southern Company. Most recently, he has been \ngetting his funding through Donors Trust, the dark money identity-\nlaundering operation that anonymizes corporate and polluter money. By \nthe way, the biggest mark in the whole beast is right there, and that \nis Donors Trust.\n  The manipulation of science is pretty egregious. Some of Dr. Soon's \nresearch contracts gave his industry backers a chance to see what he \nwas doing before he published it. Some of these contracts even had \nclauses that promised Dr. Soon's fossil fuel backers would receive ``an \nadvance written copy of proposed publications...for comment and \ninput.'' The New York Times reported that in correspondence with his \nfossil fuel funders, Dr. Soon referred to the scientific papers he \nproduced as ``deliverables.'' Deliverable, indeed.\n  The fossil fuel industry has had to work against mounting evidence to \ncover up the risks for as long as possible; The same with Big Tobacco. \nAgain, to quote Judge Kessler's decision in the tobacco case, ``Despite \noverwhelming evidence from a wide range of disciplines including \nstatistics and epidemiology, pathology and chemistry, clinical \nobservation and animal experimentation, as well as their own internal \nresearch, Defendants continued to claim `no proof' and continued to \nattempt to create doubt about the scientific findings.''\n  The Federal racketeering complaint opened up discovery into the files \nof the tobacco companies and showed finally and unequivocally that for \ndecades the tobacco industry knew about smoking's harm while it \ncontinued public relations campaigns to deny that smoking was harmful. \nDiscovery is a powerful tool. Sanctions for hiding evidence from a \ncourt are steep. So time and again, it is discovery that finds the real \nsmoking guns in corporate records. Remember when New York's attorney \ngeneral discovered internal emails from analysts at Merrill Lynch that \nshowed the company promoting stocks to its customers that they \ninternally described as ``junk''?\n  The fossil fuel industry is engaged in a massive effort to deny \nclimate science and deceive the American public. They have been at it \nfor years, and the clearer the science becomes, the harder the \npolluters fight. Gary Wills used to work for William F. Buckley at the \nNational Review and recently described this effort as ``their kept \nscientists, their rigged conferences, their sycophantic beneficiaries \n[and] and their bought publicists.'' Imagine what a little discovery \ninto the beast would reveal about the schemes and mischief of the \nclimate denial apparatus, about what they are telling each other in \nprivate while they scheme to deceive the public.\n  The truth will eventually come to light. It always does. But here in \nthe Senate, we should not wait for a court case before taking action. \nThe evidence is clear. We have a legislative responsibility to address \nclimate change and to do that now. The facts are clear as day right \nbefore our eyes, despite the fossil fuel industry's efforts to deceive \nand deny, despite their persistent big political spending and bullying. \nWe just have to wake up to the facts and to our duty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The material below contains a memo by the API from April \n     1998.\n\n                                  Memo\n\n     From: Joe Walker\n     To: Global Climate Science Team\n     Cc: Michelle Ross; Susan Moya\n     Subject: Draft Global Climate Science Communications plan\n       As promised, attached is the draft Global Climate Science \n     Communications Plan that we developed during our workshop \n     Last Friday.

After that, we hope to have a ``Plan champion'' \n     help us move it forward to potential funding sources, perhaps \n     starting with the global climate ``Coordinating Council.'' \n     That will be an item for discussion on April 17.\n       Again, thanks for your hard work on this project. Please e-\n     mail me, call or fax me with your comments. Thanks.\n           Regards,\n                                                       Joe Walker.\n\n                 GLOBAL CLIMATE SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS\n\n                              Action Plan\n\n\n                           Situation Analysis\n\n       In December 1997, the Clinton Administration agreed in \n     Kyoto, Japan, to a treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \n     to prevent what it purports to be changes in the global \n     climate caused by the continuing release of such emissions. \n     The so-called green house gases have many sources. For \n     example, water vapor is a greenhouse gas. But the Clinton \n     Administration's action, if eventually approved by the U.S. \n     Senate, will mainly affect emissions from fossil fuel \n     (gasoline, coal, natural gas, etc.) combustion.\n       As the climate change debate has evolved, those who oppose \n     action have argued mainly\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\n     that signing such a treaty will place the U.S. at a \n     competitive disadvantage with most other nations, and will be \n     extremely expensive to implement. Much of the cost will be \n     borne by American consumers who will pay higher prices for \n     most energy and transportation.\n       The climate change theory being advanced by the treaty \n     supporters is based primarily on forecasting models with a \n     very high degree of uncertainty. In fact, its not known for \n     sure whether (a) climate change actually is occurring, or (b) \n     if it is, whether humans really have any influence on it.\n       Despite these weaknesses in scientific understanding, those \n     who oppose the treaty have done little to build a case \n     against precipitous action on climate change based on the \n     scientific uncertainty. As a result, The Clinton \n     Administration and environmental groups essentially have had \n     the field to themselves. They have conducted an effective \n     public relations program to convince the American public that \n     the climate is changing, we humans are at fault, and we must \n     do something about it before calamity strikes.\n       The environmental groups know they have been successful. \n     Commenting after the Kyoto negotiations about recent media \n     coverage of climate change, Tom Wathen, executive vice \n     president of the National Environmental Trust, wrote:\n       ``. . . As important as the extent of the coverage was the \n     tone and tenor of it. In a change from just six months ago, \n     most media stories no longer presented global warming as just \n     a theory over which reasonable scientists could differ. Most \n     stories described predictions of global warming as the \n     position of the overwhelming number of mainstream scientists. \n     That the environmental community had, to a great extent, \n     settled the scientific issue with the U.S. media is the other \n     great success that began perhaps several months earlier but \n     became apparent during Kyoto.''\n       Because the science underpinning the global climate change \n     theory has not been challenged effectively in the media or \n     through other vehicles reaching the American public, there is \n     widespread ignorance, which works in favor of the Kyoto \n     treaty and against the best interests of the United States. \n     Indeed, the public has been highly receptive to the Clinton \n     Administrations plans. There has been little, if any, public \n     resistance or pressure applied to Congress to reject the \n     treaty, except by those ``inside the Beltway'' with vested \n     interests.\n       Moreover, from the political viewpoint, it is difficult for \n     the United States to oppose the treaty solely on economic \n     grounds, valid as the economic issues are. It makes it too \n     easy for others to portray the United States as putting \n     preservation of its own lifestyle above the greater concerns \n     of mankind. This argument, in turn, forces our negotiators to \n     make concessions that have not been well thought through, and \n     in the end may do far more harm than good. This is the \n     process that unfolded at Kyoto, and is very likely to be \n     repeated in Buenos Aires in November 1998.\n       The advocates of global warming have been successful on the \n     basis of skillfully misrepresenting the science and the \n     extent of agreement on the science, while industry and its \n     partners ceded the science and fought on the economic issues. \n     Yet if we can show that science does not support the Kyoto \n     treaty--which most true climate scientists believe to be the \n     case--this puts the United States in a stronger moral \n     position and frees its negotiators from the need to make \n     concessions as a defense against perceived selfish economic \n     concerns.\n       Upon this tableau, the Global Climate Science \n     Communications Team (GCSCT) developed an action plan to \n     inform the American public that science does not support the \n     precipitous actions Kyoto would dictate, thereby providing a \n     climate for the right policy decisions to be made. The team \n     considered results from a new public opinion survey in \n     developing the plan.\n       Charlton Research's survey of 1,100 ``informed Americans'' \n     suggests that while Americans currently perceive climate \n     change to be a great threat, public opinion is open enough to \n     change on climate science. When informed that ``some \n     scientists believe there is not enough evidence to suggest \n     that [what is called global climate change] is a long-term \n     change due to human behavior and activities,'' 58 percent of \n     those surveyed said they were more likely to oppose the Kyoto \n     treaty. Moreover, half the respondents harbored doubts about \n     climate science.\n       GCSCT members who contributed to the development of the \n     plan are A. John Adams, John Adams Associates; Candace \n     Crandall, Science and Environmental Policy Project; David \n     Rothbard, Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow; Jeffrey \n     Salmon, The Marshall Institute; Lee Garrigan, environmental \n     issues Council; Lynn Bouchey and Myron Ebell, Frontiers of \n     Freedom; Peter Cleary, Americans for Tax Reform; Randy \n     Randol, Exxon Corp.; Robert Gehri, The Southern Company; \n     Sharon Kneiss, Chevron Corp; Steve Milloy, The Advancement of \n     Sound Science Coalition; and Joseph Walker, American \n     Petroleum Institute.\n       The action plan is detailed on the following pages.\n\n\n                              Project Goal\n\n       A majority of the American public, including industry \n     leadership, recognizes that significant uncertainties exist \n     in climate science, and therefore raises questions among \n     those (e.g. Congress) who chart the future U.S. course on \n     global climate change.\n       Progress will be measured toward the goal. A measurement of \n     the public's perspective on climate science will be taken \n     before the plan is launched, and the same measurement will be \n     taken at one or more as-yet-to-be-determined intervals as the \n     plan is implemented.\n\n\n                     Victory Will Be Achieved When\n\n       Average citizens ``understand'' (recognize) uncertainties \n     in climate science; recognition of uncertainties becomes part \n     of the ``conventional wisdom''\n       Media ``understands'' (recognizes) uncertainties in climate \n     science\n       Media coverage reflects balance on climate science and \n     recognition of the validity of viewpoints that challenge the \n     current ``conventional wisdom''\n       Industry senior leadership understands uncertainties in \n     climate science, making them stronger ambassadors to those \n     who shape climate policy\n       Those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extent \n     science appears to be out of touch with reality.\n\n\n                            Current Reality\n\n       Unless ``climate change'' becomes a non-issue, meaning that \n     the Kyoto proposal is defeated and there are no further \n     initiatives to thwart the threat of climate change, there may \n     be no moment when we can declare victory for our efforts. It \n     will be necessary to establish measurements for the science \n     effort to track progress toward achieving the goal and \n     strategic success.\n\n\n                         Strategies and Tactics\n\n       I. National Media Relations Program: Develop and implement \n     a national media relations program to inform the media about \n     uncertainties in climate science; to generate national, \n     regional and local media coverage on the scientific \n     uncertainties, and thereby educate and inform the public, \n     stimulating them to raise questions with policy makers.\n       Tactics: These tactics will be undertaken between now and \n     the next climate meeting in Buenos Aires/Argentina, in \n     November 1998, and will be continued thereafter, as \n     appropriate. Activities will be launched as soon as the plan \n     is approved, funding obtained, and the necessary resources \n     (e.g., public relations counsel) arranged and deployed. In \n     all cases, tactical implementation will be fully integrated \n     with other elements of this action plan, most especially \n     Strategy II (National Climate Science Data Center).\n       Identify, recruit and train a team of five independent \n     scientists to participate in media outreach. These will be \n     individuals who do not have a long history of visibility and/\n     or participation in the climate change debate. Rather, this \n     team will consist of new faces who will add their voices to \n     those recognized scientists who already are vocal.\n       Develop a global climate science information kit for media \n     including peer-reviewed papers that undercut the \n     ``conventional wisdom'' on climate science. This kit also \n     will include understandable communications, including simple \n     fact sheets that present scientific uncertainties in language \n     that the media and public can understand.\n       Conduct briefings by media-trained scientists for science \n     writers in the top 20 media markets, using the information \n     kits. Distribute the information kits to daily newspapers \n     nationwide with offer of scientists to brief reporters at \n     each paper. Develop, disseminate radio news releases \n     featuring scientists nationwide, and offer scientists to \n     appear on radio talk shows across the country.\n       Produce, distribute a steady stream of climate science \n     information via facsimile and e-mail to science writers \n     around the country.\n       Produce, distribute via syndicate and directly to \n     newspapers nationwide a steady stream of op-ed columns and \n     letters to the editor authored by scientists.\n       Convince one of the major news national TV journalists \n     (e.g., John Stossel) to produce a report examining the \n     scientific underpinnings of the Kyoto treaty.\n       Organize, promote and conduct through grassroots \n     organizations a series of campus/community workshops/debates \n     on climate science in 10 most important states during the \n     period mid-August through October, 1998.\n       Consider advertising the scientific uncertainties in select \n     markets to support national, regional and local (e.g., \n     workshops/debates), as appropriate.\n\n\n     National Media Program Budget--$600,000 plus paid advertising\n\n       II. Global Climate Science Information Source: Develop and \n     implement a program to inject credible science and scientific \n     accountability into the global climate debate, thereby \n     raising questions about and undercutting the ``prevailing \n     scientific wisdom.'' The strategy will have the added benefit \n     of providing a platform for credible, constructive criticism \n     of the opposition's position on the science.\n       Tactics: As with the National Media Relations Program, \n     these activities will be undertaken between now and the next \n     climate meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, \n     and will continue thereafter. Initiatives will be launched as \n     soon as the plan is approved, funding obtained, and the \n     necessary resources arranged and deployed.\n       Establish a Global Climate Science Data Center. The GCSDC \n     will be established in Washington as a non-profit educational \n     foundation with an advisory board of respected climate \n     scientists. It will be staffed initially with professionals \n     on loan from various companies and associations with a major \n     interest in the climate issue. These executives\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\n     will bring with them knowledge and experience in the \n     following areas.\n       Overall history of climate research and the IPCC process;\n       Congressional relations and knowledge of where individual \n     Senators stand on the climate issue;\n       Knowledge of key climate scientists and where they stand;\n       Ability to identify and recruit as many as 20 respected \n     climate scientists to serve on the science advisory board;\n       Knowledge and expertise in media relations and with \n     established relationships with science and energy writers, \n     columnists and editorial writers;\n       Expertise in grassroots organization; and\n       Campaign organization and administration.\n       The GCSDC will be led by dynamic senior executive with a \n     major personal commitment to the goals of the campaign and \n     easy access to business leaders at the CEO level. The Center \n     will be run on a day-to-day basis by an executive director \n     with responsibility for ensuring targets are met. The Center \n     will be funded at a level that will permit it to succeed, \n     including funding for research contracts that may be \n     deemed appropriate to fill gaps in climate science (e.g., \n     a complete scientific critique of the IPCC research and \n     its conclusions).\n       The GCSDC will become a one-stop resource on climate \n     science for members of Congress, the media, industry and all \n     others concerned. It will be in constant contact with the \n     best climate scientists and ensure that their findings and \n     views receive appropriate attention. It will provide them \n     with the logistical and moral support they have been lacking. \n     In short, it will be a sound scientific alternative to the \n     IPCC. Its functions will include:\n       Providing as an easily accessible database (including a \n     website) of all mainstream climate science information.\n       Identifying and establishing cooperative relationships with \n     all major scientists whose research in this field supports \n     our position.\n       Establishing cooperative relationships with other \n     mainstream scientific organizations (e.g., meteorologists, \n     geophysicists) to bring their perspectives to bear on the \n     debate, as appropriate.\n       Developing opportunities to maximize the impact of \n     scientific views consistent with ours with Congress, the \n     media and other key audiences.\n       Monitoring and serving as and early warning system for \n     scientific developments with the potential to impact on the \n     climate science debate, pro and con.\n       Responding to claims from the scientific alarmists and \n     media.\n       Providing grants for advocacy on climate science, as deemed \n     appropriate.\n\n\nGlobal Climate Science Data Center Budget--$5,000,000 (Spread over two \n                             years minimum)\n\n       III. National Direct Outreach and Education: Develop and \n     implement a direct outreach program to inform and educate \n     members of Congress, state officials, industry leadership, \n     and school teachers/students about uncertainties in climate \n     science. This strategy will enable Congress, state officials \n     and industry leaders will be able to raise such serious \n     questions about the Kyoto treaty's scientific underpinnings \n     that American policy-makers not only will refuse to endorse \n     it, they will seek to prevent progress toward implementation \n     at the Buenos Aires meeting in November or through other \n     ways. Informing teachers/students about uncertainties in \n     climate science will begin to erect a barrier against further \n     efforts to impose Kyoto-like measures in the future.\n       Tactics: Informing and educating members of Congress, state \n     officials and industry leaders will be undertaken as soon as \n     the plan is approved, funding is obtained, and the necessary \n     resources are arrayed and will continue through Buenos Aires \n     and for the foreseeable future. The teachers/students \n     outreach program will be developed and launched in early \n     1999. In all cases, tactical implementation will be fully \n     integrated with other elements of this action plan.\n       Develop and conduct through the Global Climate Science Data \n     Center science briefings for Congress, governors, state \n     legislators, and industry leaders by August 1998.\n       Develop information kits on climate science targeted \n     specifically at the needs of government officials and \n     industry leaders, to be used in conjunction with and \n     separately from the in-person briefings to further \n     disseminate information on climate science uncertainties and \n     thereby arm these influentials to raise serious questions on \n     the science issue.\n       Organize under the GCSDC a ``Science Education Task Group'' \n     that will serve as the point of outreach to the National \n     Science Teachers Association (NSTA) and other influential \n     science education organizations. Work with NSTA to develop \n     school materials that present a credible, balanced picture of \n     climate science for use in classrooms nationwide.\n       Distribute educational materials directly to schools and \n     through grassroots organizations of climate science partners \n     (companies, organizations that participate in this effort).\n\n\n           National Direct Outreach Program Budget--$300,000\n\n       IV. Funding/Fund Allocation: Develop and implement program \n     to obtain funding, and to allocate funds to ensure that the \n     program is carried out effectively.\n       Tactics: This strategy will be implemented as soon as we \n     have the go-ahead to proceed.\n       Potential funding sources were identified as American \n     Petroleum Institute (API) and its members; Business Round \n     Table (BRT) and its members, Edison Electric Institute (EEI) \n     and its members; Independent Petroleum Association of America \n     (IPAA) and its members; and the National Mining Association \n     (NMA) and its members.\n       Potential fund allocators were identified as the American \n     Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), Committee For A \n     Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), Competitive Enterprise \n     Institute, Frontiers of Freedom and The Marshall Institute.\n\n   Total Funds Required to Implement Program Through November 1998--\n  $2,000,000 (A significant portion of funding for the GCSDC will be \n                    deferred until 1999 and beyond)\n\n\n                              Measurements\n\n       Various metrics will be used to track progress. These \n     measurements will have to be determined in fleshing out the \n     action plan and may include:\n       Baseline public/government official opinion surveys and \n     periodic follow-up surveys on the percentage of Americans and \n     government officials who recognize significant uncertainties \n     in climate science.\n       Tracking the percent of media articles that raise questions \n     about climate science.\n       Number of Members of Congress exposed to our materials on \n     climate science.\n       Number of communications on climate science received by \n     Members of Congress from their constituents.\n       Number of radio talk show appearances by scientists \n     questioning the ``prevailing wisdom'' on climate science.\n       Number of school teachers/students reached with our \n     information on climate science.\n       Number of science writers briefed and who report upon \n     climate science uncertainties.\n       Total audience exposed to newspaper, radio, television \n     coverage of science uncertainties.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 1186\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the Iran sanctions \nbill which is pending. This is amendment No. 1186. I come to the floor \nto attempt to modify my own amendment simply by taking out section 2 of \nthe amendment. I have given this proposed modification of my own \namendment to all of the managers of the bill, majority and minority. \nThey have had it for several hours, and I have discussed it with the \nmanagers. All I am seeking is to be able to modify the language of my \nown amendment, which is already pending. With that in mind, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. \n1191, the Iran sanctions bill, that I be allowed to modify my amendment \nNo. 1186 with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Senator Vitter has pointed out, right \nnow we are on the motion to proceed to the trade bill. We are not on \nthe Iran sanctions bill. There are continuing discussions taking place \non the Iran sanctions bill between Senator Corker and me in an effort \nto try to get as many of the amendments that we have been working on \ncleared as possible. Senator Vitter's request could very well at this \npoint interfere with the maximum number of amendments being considered, \nand for that reason I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, my request is not going to interfere with \nanything. That is a bunch of bull. My request is that I be allowed to \nmodify the language of my own amendment which is pending, and it is not \ngoing to interfere with any other amendment.\n  Let's be upfront about what is going on here. It is not an open \namendment process. We have been talking about this bill for 2 weeks. We \nhave had two votes on amendments. They are not even talking about \namendment votes. What Senator Cardin is describing is negotiating the \nlanguage and changing the language of certain amendments so it is \nagreeable to everyone, including him. That is not an open amendment \nprocess. Those are not votes. That is not voting up or down. That is \nnot giving everyone their say and their ability to have votes. That is \nblocking the gate, blocking the door, and returning to the practices of \nthe Harry Reid\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nSenate and then holding everybody hostage and demanding the language \nyou want, Senator Cardin wants, everybody wants, in order for that \namendment to even possibly be considered. That is as far from an open \namendment process as you can get.\n\n  If that is what they are discussing, they might as well stop now \nbecause I will object. I want a vote on my amendment. I want votes on \nother significant amendments. If this is just a game to come to some \nunanimous consent agreement, some managers' package which they bless, \nthey can stop those discussions right now because I will object.\n  Again, Mr. President, I think it is reasonable that a Senator get to \nmodify his own amendment. I think that is a pretty minimal request. I \nwill repeat it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nH.R. 1191, that I be allowed to modify amendment No. 1186 with the \nchanges that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \npoint out that but for the fact that Senator Cotton filed an \namendment--he had every right to do so, and I am not saying he did \nnot--without Senator Corker or the leadership or my knowing that he was \ngoing to go through that process, Senator Vitter could have modified \nhis amendment. He is being blocked and needs consent because of actions \ntaken by a Republican Senator.\n  Prior to that action being taken, Senator Corker and I, working \nwith--I think there were somewhere around 60 amendments filed by \nRepublicans and none by Democrats. This is a bill which passed the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee 19 to 0, one which incorporated many \namendments of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, who is working with us on this. We \nworked those out. We are in the process of presenting an additional \nfour amendments for floor action.\n  When that action was taken by a Senator--who had every right to do it \nbecause he was trying to get his amendment considered on the floor--in \neffect, it blocked other amendments from being considered on the floor. \nWhen you have one party filing all of the amendments, it is necessary \nto have an orderly process for these considerations. We were in the \nprocess of doing that, and that was blocked.\n  Senator Corker and I regret that we did not have a chance to bring \nmore amendments in an orderly way for consideration on the floor. But \nthe request made by Senator Vitter is to try to get his amendment in a \ndifferent position than other amendments, and for that reason, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is not being blocked by Senator \nCotton. Everybody knows that. Senator Cotton made it clear that he \nwould happily agree to get amendments up for a vote. This has been a \ndetermined, choreographed effort to close the door during an open \namendment process and to demand leverage so that every amendment has to \nbe worked out. Do you know what ``worked out'' means? That means they \nget a veto and we don't get a vote. That is unreasonable, and that is \nthe exact opposite of an open amendment process.\n  I am not being blocked by Senator Cotton. I know that. Everybody \nknows that. We are being blocked by the managers of this bill. I think \nit is highly regrettable.\n  As I said, if the end game here is to work out amendments to Senator \nCardin's or anyone else's satisfaction, and they get a veto, they can \nstop their work on that right now because I am objecting, and I will \nobject. I want a vote.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will point out in response to Senator \nVitter that we had two record votes on the floor on this bill, and both \nwere amendments that were overwhelmingly rejected. They were not \namendments I wanted on the bill. I opposed both of those amendments and \nSenator Corker opposed both of those amendments.\n  When the amendment was offered by Senator Cotton, we were in the \nprocess of scheduling another vote on the floor of an amendment that I \nequally opposed. I have indicated that I will oppose several of the \nother amendments Members have tried to make pending, but I did not \nobject to votes on those amendments.\n  I just want to respond to Senator Vitter. Senator Corker and I did \nnot attempt to block votes on amendments that we don't agree with. We \nwere seeking an orderly way to proceed because, quite frankly, this \nbill is critically important to our country.\n  Let's not lose sight of what we are trying to achieve, and that is to \nblock Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The best way for us to do \nthat is for this body and the House and the President to speak with a \nunited voice, to give us the strongest possible position in \nnegotiations, and for Congress to carry out its responsibility to \nreview this agreement because it was Congress that imposed the \nsanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table. We have a \nresponsibility--in an orderly way--to review that agreement.\n  The legislation we brought forward--and the Presiding Officer was \nvery helpful in bringing it forward--allows us, in an orderly way, to \nconsider that agreement, if one is reached, so that we can have open \nhearings in a deliberative way to determine how Congress should act, \nand that is what this bill does.\n  I regret that my friend from Louisiana--and he is my friend--feels \nthat any amendment he wants to offer--and there are 60-some other \namendments to be offered--that he should be able to bring them up at \nany time he wants. Quite frankly, this bill is too important for us to \nuse anything but an orderly way to consider amendments. That is what \nthis bill does for the consideration of a potential agreement.\n  I thank Senator Corker for his leadership, and the two of us will \nwork together to make sure we complete this bill in an orderly way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2670-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2670-S2672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am surely going to make a unanimous \nconsent request, and I have notified the Republican leader of this, but \nbefore I do, I wish to make a statement on this issue. I am talking \nabout the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization \nAct of 2015. That is a lot of words, but it is basically talking about \nthe bulletproof vest bill Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell \nand I first put together 17 years ago. It is a lifesaving grant \nprogram.\n  Senator Nighthorse Campbell and I both had the privilege of serving \nin various forms of law enforcement. We knew how things had changed. We \nknew a number of police officers, men and women, who died, were shot to \ndeath, who would have lived had they had bulletproof vests. We also \nknew a lot of them--especially small departments such as those in my \nState and many in Senator Nighthorse Campbell's State--could not afford \nthem. That could be said of virtually every single State.\n  The partnership we put together has provided 13,000 State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies with nearly 1.2 million bulletproof vests for \ntheir officers. When we pass it today, the Senate will move a step \ncloser to ensuring that for the next 5 years thousands of agencies can \npurchase bulletproof vests for officers serving in their communities.\n  These are not just empty words or an empty gesture. It is probably \nthe most tangible support Congress can provide to law enforcement \nofficers. It will help put vests on the backs of more than 200,000 \npolice officers and it will save lives.\n  Just ask the chief of the Woodway, TX, police department, Yost \nZakhary. Chief Zakhary testified at a Senate judiciary hearing last \nyear. He brought\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\nthis vest with him to the hearing. The officer wearing it was shot at \nalmost pointblank range during a roadside stop. The officer lost a lot \nof blood--we can see it on his vest--but he did not lose his life \nbecause this vest, purchased through this partnership grant program, \ncaught the bullet aimed at his heart.\n  Officer Ann Carrizales of the Stafford, TX, police department also \ntestified at the hearing last year. She told us that her vest--because \nwe are now beginning to buy vests that recognize the obvious \ndifferences between male and female officers--was uniquely fitted for \nher body. It saved her life when she was shot twice during a routine \ntraffic stop. Her testimony was some of the most moving testimony I \nhave heard in 40 years in the Senate. She brought with her nearly 200 \nletters from her daughter's elementary school. They saw how a \ndaughter's mother's life was saved, and they all called for the Senate \nto act.\n  This bill is important to law enforcement around the Nation. It is \ncertainly important to my little State of Vermont. Vermont law \nenforcement agencies have received nearly 4,400 protective vests from \nthis program, and those officers throughout Vermont, as well as around \nthe Nation, are better protected and better able to do their jobs. I am \nproud to share that recent recipients in Vermont include agencies in \nAddison County, Barre City, Barre Town, Bennington County, Berlin, \nBrattleboro, Burlington, Caledonia County, Chester, Dover, Essex \nCounty, Essex Junction, Franklin County, Grand Isle County, Hardwick, \nHartford, Ludlow, Middlebury, Milton, Montpelier, Morristown, Newport, \nNorthfield, Norwich, Orange County, Orleans County, Richmond, Rutland, \nShelburne, South Burlington, Springfield, St. Albans, St. Johnsbury, \nStowe, Waterbury Village, Weathersfield, Williston, Windsor County, \nWindsor, and Winooski.\n  It has helped to make protective vests standard equipment for law \nenforcement agencies across the country. Yet, for far too many \njurisdictions--especially smaller and rural agencies such as those in \nVermont--they know the vests still cost too much and wear out too \nsoon. They actually work.\n\n  I remember to this day a young police officer who was in and \ntestified before our Senate Judiciary Committee. He had his mother and \nhis father, his wife and his children lined up behind him. He said to \nus: I love police work. The only thing I love more than that is my \nfamily. He said: There was a day when I thought I would never see my \nfamily again. Again, it was a routine traffic stop, but the man stepped \nout and shot him twice, pointblank. He reached under and pulled up the \nbulletproof vest, and we could see the two slugs embedded in the vest.\n  He said: My mother and father and my wife and my children came to the \nhospital to see me. I had cracked ribs that day, but they knew they \ncould bring me home to be with them the next day.\n  They are not going to save every officer, of course, but they have \nsaved more than 3,000 law enforcement officers since 1987. I have met \nwith police officers such as the one I just described, who are alive \ntoday because of vests purchased through this program. They will tell \nus the program saves lives. But it is also for the members of their \nfamilies, seeing them going off to work knowing they have put it on. \nThat makes a difference.\n  This bill also contains a number of improvements to the grant \nprogram. I want to thank Senator Feinstein for helping to improve the \nbill so that it provides incentives for agencies to provide uniquely \nfitted vests for female officers. The bill also ensures that agencies \nhave mandatory-wear policies to ensure that the vests are used \nregularly.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I remember walking down the street in \nDenver, CO, where Ben Nighthorse Campbell and I first started this. A \npolice officer walked up to me and said: Are you Patrick Leahy of \nVermont? And I said: Yes. He tapped his chest and said thank you and \nmoved on.\n  Senator Graham is a lead cosponsor of this legislation. I wish to \nthank Senator Graham for his important efforts to help pass this \nlegislation.\n  I am also thankful to the law enforcement community. They have long \nspoken with a single voice on this issue. They don't care whether we \nare Republicans or Democrats; they just care about this issue.\n  So if we pass this bill today and move it to the House of \nRepresentatives, I would urge the Speaker to quickly take up the bill \nso the President can sign it next week as we approach National Police \nWeek. Now is the time to honor the brave men and women of law \nenforcement who have lost their lives serving their communities. Let's \nput real meaning behind our words and tributes. It is time to pass this \nbill.\n  I see my friend from Oklahoma on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 32, S. 125; that a Lee amendment which is \nat the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 125) to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to extend the \n     authorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \n     Program through fiscal year 2020, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this is a great bill in many ways. There \nis a tremendous need. I have family members who are police officers, \nactually, in small, rural police forces. I have staff members who are \nformer police officers. I understand the situation very well, how much \nof a difference it makes to so many people. But we have two different \nprograms dealing with bulletproof vests, two different systems of \nactually distributing bulletproof vests from the Federal Government \nthat in many ways are complementary and in some ways competing. We have \ntwo sets of applications with two different sets of personnel to \nactually approve those applications and two different processes to \napply.\n  My goal is that where we find duplication of effort, even if it is a \ngood effort, that we as the Federal Government find ways to be able to \nstreamline that process. Every dollar we spend on bureaucracy here, on \na duplicative program, is a dollar less that we actually spend to buy \nthe bulletproof vests and be able to get them out the door.\n  I have had multiple conversations that have been very productive with \nSenator Leahy and with Senator Graham to talk about this particular \nissue of how we can combine the application process, how we can combine \nthe administrative process to make sure a good program doesn't lose \ndollars. We have numerous reports all over the Federal Government on \nduplication in government.\n  I look forward to the ongoing conversations. I have some assurances \nthat we will deal with some of these issues as we go through the \nappropriations process in the days ahead, so I am willing to withdraw \nmy objection. I know that we will resolve some of these issues in the \ndays ahead to allow us to be able to move forward.\n  So with that, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The amendment(No. 1214) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To modify the authorization of appropriations)\n\n       On page 2, line 11, strike ``$30,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$25,000,000''.\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the bill having \nbeen read the third time, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  The bill (S. 125), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to sound a note of warning about the \nnation of Iran. Consider the following facts: The Supreme Leader, \nAyatollah Khamenei, has accused America of lying. We learned that the \nIranian regime has been actively arming and supporting the anti-\nAmerican Houthi rebels in Yemen since 2009. The Iranian regime held a \nparade of military equipment that featured chants of ``Death to \nAmerica'' and ``Death to Israel.'' The Iranian regime unjustly detained \nAmerican citizen, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and charged \nhim with espionage and other crimes, including ``propaganda against the \nestablishment.'' The Defense Minister of Iran declared that IAEA \ninspectors would be barred from all military sites, even those known to \nhave nuclear facilities. The Iranian Navy threatened a cargo ship \nsailing under the flag of the United States in the Strait of Hormuz. \nThe Iranian Navy seized another cargo ship in the Strait of Hormuz \nsailing under the flag of our ally, the Marshall Islands. The Foreign \nMinister of Iran accused the United States and our allies of being the \nbiggest danger to the international community. Great Britain informed a \nU.N. sanctions panel that Iran has an active nuclear procurement \nnetwork linked to two blacklisted firms. The Iranian Navy harassed a \nU.S. warship and military plane off the coast of Yemen.\n\n  These are not events from 1979 or 1983 or 1996. These are, in \nchronological order, the aggressive anti-American actions of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran in the last month. Every one of those occurred \nin the last month, at least these are the ones we know of that have \nbeen covered in the media.\n  This relentless drumbeat of hostility has gone on unabated for 36 \nyears, and it makes the legislation before this body, the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act, all the more critical. The bill's supporters \ninsist it is the only way to ensure that Congress has its due say over \nPresident Obama's proposed Iran deal.\n  I agree that it is of paramount importance to give Congress its \nproper role in an international agreement of this magnitude and to make \nclear that President Obama must persuade Congress and the American \npeople to support his deal if he wants it to be binding, which is why I \nhave been supportive of this process so far. But I am here to tell you \nthat as the legislation stands, this legislation is unlikely to stop a \nbad Iran deal.\n  The problem is an all-too-familiar one here in Washington, DC, which \nis that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act contains a provision \ninserted at the insistence of Senate Democrats which will allow \nCongress to appear to vote against the deal while tacitly allowing it \nto go into effect. The bill allows Congress to adopt a ``resolution of \ndisapproval'' of President Obama's Iran deal. On the surface that \nsounds reasonable.\n  From what we know publicly of the deal, I certainly disapprove of it \nstrongly. But a resolution of disapproval under this legislation, even \nif it passed a 60-vote threshold, with grand claims of bipartisanship, \nwould not be the end of the matter.\n  The President would certainly veto it. Once he did, it would require \n67 votes in the Senate and 290 votes in the House to override that \nveto. No wonder the White House has lifted its objection to this \nlegislation. All the President would have to do to force a bad Iran \ndeal on America is hold 34 Senators in the Democratic Party or 145 \nMembers of Congress.\n  If he could do that, a bad deal that undermines the national security \nof this country, that endangers our friend and ally, the nation of \nIsrael, would go into effect. He could claim he was simply following \nthe process Congress required. That is not an oversight. That\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\nis not an accident. This bill, as drafted, will provide some political \ncover to Senate Democrats to say they have voted to provide strict \nscrutiny and congressional approval of an Iran deal.\n  Yet, as currently drafted, it is a virtual certainty that no matter \nhow terrible this deal is, it will go into effect and this legislation \nis unlikely to stop it. Our first priority should be stopping a bad \nIran deal that jeopardizes the lives of millions of Americans and \nmillions of our allies. There is nothing more important this body can \nconsider, not trade, not the budget. There is nothing more important.\n  The first responsibility of this body is to protect the national \nsecurity of this country, to protect the lives and safety of men, \nwomen, and children across this country. The President's Iran deal \ndeeply jeopardizes the safety of Americans. From what we know \npublicly--and the details are still shrouded in considerable secrecy--\nbut from what we know publicly, under this deal, Iran will be allowed \nto keep its enriched uranium. It will be allowed to keep its \ncentrifuges and reactors. It will continue its ICBM Program, the only \npurpose of which is to deliver a nuclear weapon to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Tehran will receive even more economic relief, reportedly including a \n$50 billion signing bonus. Who in their right mind would give a $50 \nbillion signing bonus to Iran? It is worth noting that even under one \nof the strictest regimes of international sanctions, Iran was still \nable to marshall the resources to become one of the world's leading \nstate sponsors of terrorism. We can only imagine what Iran will do with \nthis new source of funding, which will certainly flow to Hamas, to \nHezbollah, and to the Houthis, as well as to their proxies in Latin \nAmerica.\n  I would note, if this deal goes into effect, and tens or hundreds of \nbillions of dollars flow into Iran, including a $50 billion signing \nbonus, and that money is given directly to radical Islamic terrorists, \nthe blood of the men and women and children who will be murdered by \nthose terrorists will be directly on the hands of this administration. \nIf we allow tens and hundreds of billions of dollars to flow into the \nhands of terrorists, it places complicity for that terrorism on this \nadministration.\n  There is no topic more serious this body could consider than \npreventing the murder of Americans. The Iranians' behavior speaks for \nitself. They are, right now today, unlawfully imprisoning multiple \nAmerican citizens--Pastor Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, as well as Jason \nRezaian--under brutal conditions. They are withholding information on \nthe whereabouts of Robert Levinson.\n  They have killed Americans across the globe and they have plotted to \nkill us here at home. They are explicitly threatening to wipe our ally, \nthe nation of Israel, off the map. Indeed, in the midst of this \nnegotiation, the senior Iranian general said: The annihilation of \nIsrael is ``non-negotiable''. Given that, there is no way on Earth we \nshould be allowing billions of dollars to flow into a radical terrorist \norganization that has declared its object destroying Israel, which they \ncall the ``Little Satan,'' and ultimately destroying America, which \nthey call us the ``Great Satan.'' They are telling us they want to kill \nus, not 10 years ago or 20 years ago--they are telling us this right \nnow. If history teaches any principle with abundant clarity, it is that \nif somebody tells you they want to kill you, believe them. They are not \nbeing subtle. Those are the people the Obama administration are putting \non a path to having nuclear weaponry, the most fearsome weaponry known \nto man. Make no mistake. That is what this deal would do unless \nCongress steps in to stop it--not to have a show vote, not to pretend \nto disapprove but to actually stop a bad deal that jeopardizes our \nsafety.\n  To see how this scenario is likely to play out, we do not have to \nspeculate. We need to look no further than to the recent history of \nNorth Korea. In October 1994, the Clinton administration reached \nanother agreed framework with North Korea over that nation's nuclear \nprogram. Then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright insisted she had \ngotten a deal that would freeze the military components of the program \nand, through economic incentives and diplomatic outreach, entice the \nhermit kingdom to join the international community and reject their \npursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  At first, all seemed to go well as North Korea eagerly accepted the \ninflux of hard currency, as well as the promised civilian nuclear \nreactors. Secretary Albright, accompanied by then-Policy Coordinator \nfor North Korea Wendy Sherman, even visited North Korea in 2000 to \ncelebrate the progress. Despite all of the diplomatic initiatives, \ndespite all of the champagne toasts, the North Koreans were cheating, \nwe now know, they were cheating on the framework from the get-go.\n  When the George W. Bush administration figured it out, economic \nsanctions were reimposed. But they had no effect, neither did yet more \nadditional rounds of negotiations while they continued and continued \nand continued to enrich.\n  Kim Jong-il had gotten the resources he needed because the Clinton \nadministration relaxed sanctions and allowed billions of dollars to \nflow into his hands. In 2006, North Korea tested its first nuclear \nweapon--two more tests to follow.\n  In 2012, when Kim Jong Un came to power, then-Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton suggested that Kim Jong Un might be a transformative \nleader. The State Department reportedly assured the President that he \nwould be more concerned with economic improvements than with his \ninherited nuclear program. In less than 2 years, this, too, was proven \nwrong. Kim Jong Un has demonstrated no interest in reform. He has, \ninstead, resolutely pursued his father's policy. Just last week, we \nlearned from the Chinese that North Korea is well on its way to having \nsome 40 nuclear weapons by 2016, as their ability to enrich uranium is \nsignificantly more sophisticated than had been believed.\n  In addition, they are hard at work at their ICBM Program and may soon \nbe able not only to threaten our regional allies but also to strike the \nwest coast of the United States. With so many weapons in their arsenal, \nit seems only logical that this rogue regime may, in turn, offer some \nof those weapons for sale to the highest bidder.\n  All of this proves the fallacy of the Clinton administration's \nrepeated basic assumption; that the North Koreans would act in their \nbest interests economically, for which, for Albright and Sherman, meant \nreaching a diplomatic agreement to achieve economic relief. \nUnfortunately, they were dead wrong. The result is the United States \nfaces an escalating strategic threat in the Pacific.\n  We are now in grave danger of history repeating itself with Iran. \nWendy Sherman, the very same person who negotiated the failed North \nKorea deal, the Obama administration brought her back from the Clinton \nadministration to be our lead negotiator with Iran. Think about that. \nThe person who led the failed North Korea talks, the talks that led to \nNorth Korea getting nuclear weapons, is President Obama's lead \nnegotiator with Iran, and her negotiations will certainly lead to the \nsame outcome.\n  Indeed, when Secretary Clinton brought Wendy Sherman back, Wendy \nSherman promptly followed the exact same playbook for the negotiations \nthat she had followed under the Clinton administration with respect to \nNorth Korea. You know, Albert Einstein famously said: ``The definition \nof insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting \ndifferent results.'' If we negotiate the same failed deal, we will get \nthe same failed outcome.\n  Iran has already enjoyed significant economic relief and \nlegitimization on the international stage, while America's demands have \ndwindled from dismantling Iran's nuclear program to now merely curbing \nit around the edges temporarily and unverifiably. It may only be a \nmatter of time before Secretary John Kerry, no doubt accompanied by \nUnder Secretary Wendy Sherman, pays a courtesy call on Tehran to echo \nhistory and to show the world how ``civilized'' the whole arrangement \nis and only a matter of time until the Iranians cheat--just like the \nNorth Koreans--their way to a bomb.\n  Yet the grim reality is that, as bad as the situation is with North \nKorea, with Iran it is qualitatively worse. The\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\nKim dynasty are brutal, megalomaniacal dictators, but they do seem to \nbe motivated, at least to some extent, by self-preservation, and so to \nsome form, there is at least a possibility of rational deterrence. And \ntherein lies the fundamental difference with Iran.\n  The mullahs in Tehran are radical, Islamist zealots, for whom the \neradication of the little Satan, Israel, and the great Satan, America, \nis a solemn religious duty. And with radical religious zealots, \nordinary cost-benefit analysis doesn't apply the same way. With zealots \nwho glorify death and suicide, deterrence doesn't work the way it works \nelsewhere.\n  ``Death to America'' is not just a slogan; it is a religious promise.\n  The risk that the Ayatolla will use the economic windfall of billions \nof dollars, courtesy of the United States, to pursue nuclear weapons \nthat he would either use himself or give to terrorist surrogates to use \nis intolerably high.\n  The consequences of this deal could very well be an Iranian nuclear \nweapon used in the skies of Tel Aviv, New York or Los Angeles. The \nconsequence of this deal could very well be millions of Americans \nmurdered. There is no more serious topic we could be addressing.\n  Now, President Obama and his two Secretaries of State have had their \nchance to negotiate with Iran, and they have squandered it on the same \napproach that was so spectacularly unsuccessful with North Korea. They \nchanged very little. They just replayed the same failed plan.\n  Once again, assuming they can reason with a rogue regime, they are on \nthe verge of sealing a deal that could result in the most significant \nthreat to our Nation in the 21st century.\n  The administration's claim that Tehran will not use their economic \nwindfall to pursue a nuclear program or to support terrorism and that \nif they do, ``snapback'' sanctions will fix the problem are hardly \nreassuring, especially, as we know from the example of North Korea that \nthe opposite result is far more likely. Having gotten what they wanted, \nthe mullahs will string out the economic benefits for as long as they \nwant and then, when they are ready, test a nuclear bomb.\n  The Iranians know perfectly well what a very good deal this is for \nthem. And they are doing what they can to prevent Congress from \ndisrupting it.\n  In March, I was proud to join with 46 of my colleagues in signing a \nletter written by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas that explained the \nconstitutional role of the Senate in approving a treaty--or of both \nHouses of Congress--passing legislation into law, for any deal to be \nbinding on the United States of America.\n  Judging from their reaction, Tehran does not appreciate our free \nsystem of government. Foreign Minister Mohammed Zarif responded that:\n\n       The authors [of the letter] may not fully understand that \n     in international law, governments represent the entirety of \n     their respective states, are responsible for the conduct of \n     foreign affairs, are required to fulfill the obligations they \n     undertake with other states and may not invoke their internal \n     law as justification for failure to perform their \n     international obligations.\n\n  Speaking last week to an audience at NYU, Mr. Zarif reiterated his \nopinion that as a matter of international law, President Obama would \nhave to abide by the dictates of whatever deal is struck and that \nCongress is powerless to stop it.\n  He also said that he ``does not deal with Congress.'' As a matter of \nU.S. law, Mr. Zarif is wrong. It is true that in the nation of Iran, \nwhen you have a supreme leader, an ayatolla, with the ability to string \nyou up or shoot you if you disagree, the word of the Supreme Leader is \nbinding. But we have no supreme leader in the United States of America.\n  We are bound by a Constitution and rule of law that keeps sovereignty \nin we the people. If Mr. Zarif wants a sanctions agreement, the only \nway to make that binding is to deal with Congress pursuant to the \nConstitution of the United States. But if we pass the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act as it stands right now, he won't have to.\n  It is time to tell the American people the truth--enough games. This \nlegislation is not a victory of Congress. This legislation, at best, \nwill slow down, slightly, a terrible deal from being put into place. \nThat is the very best outcome--a slight delay in the President's \nputting into effect a terrible deal that jeopardizes American security.\n  It is not a guarantee that President Obama will have to submit this \ndeal and honor the will of Congress. In fact, it provides a back-door \npath for a minority in Congress, one-third of Congress, to ensure that \nthe deal goes into effect over the bipartisan will of the majority. And \neven worse, the President will be able to claim that he satisfied the \nterms that Congress itself set.\n  That is hardly the message we want to send on Iran's nuclear program. \nAnd this issue is far too important to pass a bad bill simply to send a \nmessage. By prioritizing bipartisan compromise over our national \nsecurity, we are endangering the safety and lives of Americans across \nthis country.\n  Now, I will note there is a silver lining. In 20 months, Mr. Obama \nwill no longer occupy the Oval Office.\n  In January of 2017, when a new President enters the White House, he \nor she will have full authority to rescind any international agreement \nwith Iran that has not been ratified by the Senate or passed into law \nby both Houses of Congress.\n  Any man or woman who is fit to be Commander in Chief of the United \nStates of America should be prepared to rescind a bad deal with Iran on \nday one. No President of the United States should jeopardize the lives \nof millions of Americans or millions of our allies.\n  Congress could act right now to stop a bad deal. We could come \ntogether and assert our constitutional role, and we can do so through a \nvery simple mechanism. Right now, the current bill provides that if \nCongress doesn't override President Obama's veto, a terrible Iran deal \ngoes into effect.\n  I have joined with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania in filing an \namendment that simply reverses that default, which simply says: The \nPresident cannot lift sanctions on Iran unless the deal is \naffirmatively approved by Congress. That is the constitutional \nstructure.\n  That ought to be a provision supported--not by 51 Senators or even 60 \nSenators or even 67 Senators--by all 100 Senators.\n  What a strange development in our modern polity that the Congress of \nthe United States is content to effectively neuter itself.\n  The Presiding Officer and I are both Members of the Republican Party. \nI feel quite confident that if a Republican President were in office, \nwe would not be content to give up the constitutional authority and \nresponsibility that is given to this body to ratify treaties or to pass \nlaw. And yet I am sorry to say, on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nour friends are perfectly content to forfeit their constitutional \nauthority to the President.\n  If this deal is a good deal on the substance--it most assuredly is \nnot, but if it is--the President should be able to get congressional \napproval.\n  Yet the reason that Senate Democrats are terrified of requiring \ncongressional approval is they know full well you cannot defend a deal \nthat allows Iran to keep tens of thousands of centrifuges, to keep \nenriched uranium, to keep developing their ICBM program, to keep \nremaining the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and to keep \nworking to annihilate the nation of Israel. That is not defensible on \nthe merits.\n  One simple change would turn this legislation into something \nmeaningful. One simple change that would say: The President is free to \nnegotiate any deal he likes, but before it goes into effect, bring it \nto Congress and get the affirmative agreement of Congress. Don't have a \nfig-leaf vote and let the President's bad deal go into effect. That \nundermines our national security. Have a meaningful vote that requires \nthe affirmative approval of Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the Cruz-Toomey amendment, which is a \ncommonsense fix that will give this bill real teeth by removing the \nresolution of disapproval and, instead, would allow an Iran deal to go \ninto effect only if Congress approves it. In the spirit of this \nlegislation, it is purely procedural, and so it is germane to this \nbill.\n  Yet Senate Democrats have blocked a vote on it. They have refused \neven to vote on this amendment. All this amendment does is ensure that \nthe burden is on President Obama to persuade Congress and the American \npeople that the deal is a good one or, at a\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nvery minimum, is not a terrible threat to the national security of the \nUnited States of America.\n  This should be something on which we come together--not as \nRepublicans, not as Democrats, but as Senators who have a \nresponsibility to protect our constituents, to protect the American \npeople, and to defend the Constitution. We should come together with \none voice and say: We will not allow a bad Iran deal that ensures that \nIran will acquire nuclear weapons that could be used to murder millions \nof Americans or millions of our allies.\n  This should be unanimous.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 1152\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of H.R. 1191, that I be allowed to offer my amendment No. \n1152.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first I thank my friend from Texas. He and \nI share the same goal, and that is to prevent Iran from becoming a \nnuclear weapon State.\n  There are three basic problems with my friend's amendment, if it were \nto be adopted.\n  One, it would either defeat the bill--which is very possible, because \nit changes the fundamentals of this bill. We are looking at reviewing \nan agreement that does not require consent, because Congress may, in \nfact, decide it does not want to take up this issue. That is one of the \noptions.\n  Second, if it were adopted, it could very well affect our ability to \nnegotiate with Iran. They may say: Gee, we have to negotiate with the \nPresident, and then we have to negotiate with the Congress.\n  And our negotiating partners, who don't have those circumstances, \nmight very well say: That is the end of negotiations.\n  Then the United States is blamed, and we are isolated as the country \nthat prevented a diplomatic solution to this very difficult problem.\n  Or, third, it puts our negotiators in a tough position because they \ndon't have a united position. Therefore, we won't negotiate, and we \nwon't have the strength to negotiate the strongest possible deal.\n  And for my friend who says it is just simple for Congress to pass a \nbill in order to implement this, we have been on this bill for 2 weeks. \nIt came out of the committee 19 to 0, and I don't yet see an end in \nsight. So at the same time, this bill prevents the President from \nexercising his waiver authority under the sanctions regime while \nCongress is reviewing it.\n  So, in effect, delay tactics could be used by a minority to prevent \nthe agreement from being considered on the floor of the Senate.\n  So for all those reasons the well-intended amendment would have, I \nthink it could have the reverse effect. But, from a procedural point of \nview, as I have explained earlier, we have been working to try to get \namendments up.\n  For all those reasons, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am a little confused about our \nscheduling. I know I was supposed to be speaking at 5:05 p.m. We do \nwant to get back to where we are going back and forth.\n  I know my good friend from Ohio wishes to be recognized next for a \nshort period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized now and \nthat he be followed by my good friend from Delaware to be recognized \nfor his time, and then I be recognized at the end of his remarks for \nsuch time as I would consume as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas still has the floor.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am sorry about that.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I will wrap up momentarily and then will be \nhappy to yield to my friend from Oklahoma for his very reasonable time \nallocation suggestion.\n  I would note that the Senator from Maryland suggested the problem of \nCongress affirmatively approving this is that it could be subject to \ndelay; that Congress might not take it up. I would note for my friend \nfrom Maryland that I would certainly be amenable to a friendly \namendment to my amendment that required expedited consideration of an \nIran deal without the ability to filibuster but with the requirement \nthat it receive the affirmative approval of both Houses of Congress.\n  So the specific problems my friend from Maryland suggested could be \navoided. We could put in a short but expedited time period, if \nnecessary, but what is critical, I would suggest, is that Congress has \nto ultimately approve this; that we take responsibility. If the deal is \na good one, then the majority of Congress should support it. If it is \nnot a good one, then it will not receive the approval of the majority \nof Congress.\n  So I would ask my friend from Maryland if that would be a friendly \namendment that he would be open to in reaching a compromise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I appreciate the friendliness of my friend from Texas, \nbut I must tell him we have this bill balanced. There is an expedited \nprocess in regard to Congress taking action if there is a violation of \nthe agreement by Iran. We do have an expedited process in the bill \ncurrently before us so that we can snap back sanctions quickly, and \nCongress receives not only certification but notices from the \nadministration as to whether there are material breaches. So we already \nhave that process in the bill to deal with any violation of any \nagreement.\n  The balance here is that Congress does not know what process it uses: \nWe impose the sanctions. We might want to take up modifications to the \nsanctions. We may want to take up an approval resolution. We may want \nto take up a disapproval resolution. We might want to take up something \ntotally different with Iran. Those are our options. So it would be \ndifficult now to predict an expedited process when we don't know what \nthe action of the Congress is going to be in regard to the agreement \nbeing submitted by the President of the United States.\n  So even though it is a very friendly suggestion, I can't take the \nSenator up on it.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would note, Mr. President, the result of this amendment \nnot being taken up is that Congress is abrogating our authority and \nresponsibility to approve this deal. Because of the result of this bill \nas drafted, we can look in a crystal ball and know exactly what is \ngoing to happen. In a couple of months, the administration will come \nforward with the details of its terrible deal with Iran. This summer we \nare going to have debates in this body. A resolution of disapproval \nwill be introduced, and it will not get 67 votes in this body. There \nwill be enough Members of the President's own party who will stand with \nhim no matter how terrible the deal is for our national security.\n  Right now, with this legislation, the bad deal will go into effect--a \ndeal that has the potential to result in the murder of millions of \nAmericans. There are very few topics we address that come anywhere \nclose to the gravity of this topic, and it is disappointing to see \nDemocratic Senators putting partisan politics above our national \nsecurity. We should stand together to protect America.\n  The next 20 months are going to be very dangerous in this Nation. Yet \nI am encouraged that in 20 months America is going to embark on a \ndifferent path. America is going to return to defending our Nation and \ndefending our Constitution and defending the men and women across this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before I propound my unanimous consent \nrequest, let me just applaud my friend from Texas.\n  I had a hard time believing it when they said they were going to be \nnegotiating with a terrorist, they were going to negotiate with Iran. \nHave these people forgotten our unclassified intelligence way back in \n2007 said that by 2015 Iran was expected to have a weapon and a \ndelivery system that could actually reach the United States of America? \nHere it is--what year is it, 2015--and they are talking about \nnegotiating.\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\n  I happened to be out on the USS Carl Vinson during this negotiation \njust a couple of weeks ago, and at the same time we were out there, \nIran was sending to Yemen the different weapons, and our sister ship, \nthe USS Roosevelt, had to go down and turn them around. At the same \ntime that they are negotiating with Iran, we had Putin sending down to \nIran the S-300 rocket. That S-300 rocket--and it is not even \nclassified--it can go up and kill something 98,000 feet above the \nground. Yet here we have Israel and the United States, and if the time \nwould come that we would want to take out some of the nuclear activity \nin Iran, our proven enemy, we would perhaps be unable to do that.\n  So I do applaud my friend for bringing this up. Not many people are \ntalking about this. I remember so well, though it has been several \nyears ago now, when President Bush was first elected and he talked \nabout the triad, those dangers, and he put at the top of that Iran. How \nmuch do they have to do before we realize that is the greatest threat \nfacing America today.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent--to straighten out the confusion \nin the order of things--that my friend from Ohio be recognized for a \nshort presentation; after that, my friend from Delaware would be \nrecognized; and that I be recognized at the conclusion of the remarks \nof my friend from Delaware for such time as I shall use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                   Iran and Federal Permitting Reform\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \na couple of issues, one with regard to Iran. I would just make one \npoint that I think is pretty obvious to most Members on this floor, \nwhich is that these sanctions really matter. In other words, regardless \nof what we end up doing with regard to the Iranian nuclear agreement--\nand I am very concerned about what I see in the framework agreement--we \nhave to be very careful about relieving sanctions because Iran is the \nNo. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world. That is based on our own \nState Department.\n  With us providing them sanctions relief, it frees up resources that \nthey can then use for some of their terrorist activity in the Mideast \nand really around the globe.\n  I returned from Israel a couple days ago and got some great briefings \nthat were very troubling about what is happening with regard to Iran's \nsupport of Hezbollah--additional and more sophisticated missiles with \nguidance systems--and what is happening even with the other groups in \nthe region, including a Sunni group, Hamas, in providing rockets there, \nand certainly what they are doing in Syria and what they are doing \ntoday in Yemen and even in Libya.\n  So this is not just about the nuclear arms agreement, if that, in \nfact, does come to some conclusion. It is about a broader issue, about \nensuring that we do not provide this funding for Iran to continue its \naggression in the Middle East and around the globe.\n  I want to speak about something closer to home, and I appreciate my \ncolleague from Oklahoma giving me a chance to talk briefly. This is \nabout a piece of legislation that actually passed a committee today \nthat helps create jobs and helps to encourage more construction \nprojects and would make a huge difference in getting people back to \nwork.\n  I will say I am glad Senator Carper is on the floor because I want to \ntalk about him too. He was part of this project. We have worked on this \nthe last few years. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri is my \ncosponsor, but today in the committee, with the help of chairman Ron \nJohnson and Ranking Member Carper on the floor today, we were able to \nget people working together to move this permitting reform bill \nforward.\n  This is about regulatory reform. It is about ensuring we streamline \nto make our system work better. But ultimately it is about jobs. That \nis why both the business community and the labor unions representing \nthe building trades--the AFL-CIO Building Trades Council supported this \nlegislation today. They want to see people get back to work, and so do \nI.\n  If we look at what has happened over the past year, our economic \ngrowth has been anemic. Even in the first quarter of this year, we find \njust 0.2 percent growth is now the number out there. Employment numbers \nfrom last month were disappointing. We need to give this economy a shot \nin the arm, and this will help do it.\n  Unfortunately, what we have now is a permitting process that is full \nof uncertainty, unpredictability, it is out of date, it hinders \ninvestment, it stifles growth, and keeps jobs from being created at a \ntime when too many Americans, particularly in the construction trades, \nare looking for work.\n  This is a real problem in getting investment in America too. There is \na World Bank study done every year about how countries line up in terms \nof their ability to get things done, the ease of doing business. With \nregard to green-lighting a project, permitting, the United States of \nAmerica now stands No. 41 in the world--41. That is unacceptable. That \nmeans that capital is going elsewhere, and one reason is because of the \ndelays; one reason is because of the liability risk; one reason is \nbecause people are worried if they put capital here, it is not going to \nbe able to come to fruition quickly enough because of our permitting \nsystem. So this is about not just global rankings but helping Americans \ngo back to work.\n  I learned about this first when constituents came to me; that with \nregard to Federal permitting, particularly on energy projects, \nsometimes there are as many as 35 different Federal permits, we are \ntold. American Municipal Power came to me. They were trying to put \ntogether a hydro plant on the Ohio River--something we should all be \nfor--and it was taking too much time. They were losing investors.\n  Folks came to me from Wellsville, OH. They wanted to put together a \n$6 billion synthetic fuels plant there. It was a coal-to-liquid plant \nthat would convert coal into clean diesel and jet fuel that would \ncreate jobs, employing up to 2,500 workers just to build it. \nUnfortunately, permitting delays and lawsuits interfered with the \nproject and the plant was never constructed. We need that in Ohio. It \nwould have been a win-win for us.\n  So this is an urgent issue we should address, and this is just a \ncouple of examples of it. The bottom line is it is not unheard of for \nsome projects to have dozens of different Federal permits. So this will \nhelp.\n  This bill does a few things. One, it does strengthen coordination and \ndeadline setting. It creates an interagency council that identifies \nbest practices, deadlines for reviews and approvals of important \ninfrastructure projects, strengthens cooperation between State and \nlocal permitting authorities to avoid the duplication we see too often \nnow in trying to get a permit to build something.\n  The bill also facilitates greater transparency, more public \nparticipation, with the creation of an online dashboard so you know \nwhere a project is to see who is holding this thing up and how to get \nit moving. The bill requires agencies to accept comments from \nstakeholders early in the approval process, with the goal of \nidentifying public policy concerns early on so it doesn't end up \nstopping the project.\n  Finally, the bill institutes some very sensible litigation reforms. \nAgain, I thank my colleague from Delaware because he helped us to work \nthrough this. This reduces the statute of limitations on lawsuits, \nchallenging permitting decisions from 6 years, where it is now, down to \n2 years.\n  This is legislation that can unite both our parties. It is something \nthat will help to get the economy going. It is something the \nPresident's own jobs council has called for. It is something that also \nthe business groups have called for, including the Chamber of Commerce \nand the Business Roundtable. Again, it is commonsense reform where we \nwere able to bring together groups that normally don't see eye to eye, \nincluding the labor unions.\n  Here is a quote today from Sean McGarvey, president of North \nAmerica's Building Trades Unions. He said:\n\n       If there was ever an issue that could be considered a no-\n     brainer for Congress, the Federal Permitting Improvement Act \n     is it. . . . Any way you slice it, this is a jobs bill, and \n     it is critically important to the economic interests of the \n     skilled craft construction professionals I represent.\n\n  I agree with Sean. This is a bill that makes sense. It is one all \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\ncan agree on. We need to be committed to these serious reforms and get \nthem done. This is going to help turn our economy around, help bring \nback some of these good-paying jobs, and it is an area where we can \nfind common ground.\n  Again, I thank Senator McCaskill for her partnership over the last 3 \nyears on this. I thank the members of our committee for voting for it \ntoday. Again, to the chairman and ranking member, including Senator \nCarper, who is on the floor today, thank you for moving this through \nthe committee. Now let's get it to the floor.\n  We had a strong vote today. I think the final vote was 12 to 1. Let's \nget this to the floor and actually get it done, have a vote on this \nlegislation, get it through the House, get it to the President for his \nsignature, and start to bring back these jobs and start to build these \nprojects right here in the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his kind \nwords, and to him and our colleague, Senator McCaskill from Missouri, \nfor their persistence and leadership on an important issue.\n  I oftentimes describe myself on this floor as a recovering Governor \nand one who focuses on how to create a more nurturing environment for \njob creation and job preservation. There are a lot of attributes--\naccess to capital, infrastructure--which Senator Inhofe leads us on \nevery day. Another one is a reasonable tax burden. Another is \ncommonsense regulation.\n  My dad always used to say: Use some common sense. And I think, with \nthe legislation we moved out of committee, and hopefully through this \nSenate Chamber, that will show a lot of common sense and provide a more \nnurturing environment.\n  So I thank Senator Inhofe.\n\n\n                    Public Service Recognition Week\n\n          Tribute To Elizabeth ``Beth'' Leski and Carol Richel\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the efforts of the men and \nwomen who serve their neighbors every day as Federal, State, county, \nand municipal workers.\n  In 1985, the Public Service Roundtable, with support from Congress, \nstarted the very first Public Service Recognition Week to honor the \nhard work of public employees on our behalf and the sacrifices they \noften make in doing so. Since then, the first week of May has been \nofficially designated by Congress as Public Service Recognition Week. \nThis week is the 30th anniversary, and I think a perfect opportunity \nfor each of us to show our appreciation to the millions of public \nservants in our communities and across the country.\n  Over the past several months, I have been coming to the Senate floor, \nas my colleagues know, to highlight the important work being done by \npublic employees at the Department of Homeland Security, in particular.\n  Over 200,000 men and women work at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. While their jobs are diverse, they share one common mission; \nthat is, to keep our country a safe, secure, and resilient place where \nthe American way of life can thrive. Whether they are patrolling our \nborders, responding to natural disasters or bolstering our defenses in \ncyber space, these public servants touch the lives of Americans every \nday.\n  Today, I rise to recognize two more outstanding public servants at \nDHS, this time from the Transportation Security Administration, which \nwe call TSA.\n  As we may recall, TSA was established after the devastating September \n11, 2001, terrorist attacks with the mission to better protect our \nNation's transportation systems. Today, TSA employs some 47,000 \ntransportation security officers at over 440 airports nationwide. Each \nyear, those officers screen about 660 million travelers and nearly 1.5 \nbillion bags.\n  TSA is also the lead agency in securing our surface transportation \nnetworks, including our roads, bridges, tunnels, railroads, and \nmaritime ports. For anyone who has ever taken a flight, chances are \nthey have seen the men and women of TSA in action. If they haven't seen \nthem, they certainly enjoyed the benefit of the important work they \noften do behind the scenes to keep us safe.\n  I would like to take a moment today to recognize one of those TSA \nemployees who is keeping our skies safer. Her name is Elizabeth \n``Beth'' Leski.\n  Beth is one of those TSA employees who are usually out of sight but \nwhose work, nonetheless, is vital. She is a Secure Flight Program \nanalyst in the TSA Office of Intelligence and Analysis. Originally from \nMichigan, she has lived in Severn, MD, for the last two decades with \nher husband David. After graduating with a B.S. in aviation management, \nBeth worked in the airline industry for 21 years before joining the \nSecure Flight Program.\n  Over the past 4 years, Beth has worked at TSA as a customer service \nagent, customer service supervisor, and now as a program analyst at the \nSecure Flight Operations Center.\n  Here she is in a picture, between Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security Jeh Johnson and Deputy Secretary Mayorkas.\n  As I said, over the past 4 years, Beth has worked in different roles \nat the Secure Flight Operations Center. Secure Flight is a program that \nenhances aviation security by running the names of passengers against \nthe government's watch list of known or suspected terrorists. In other \nwords, Beth helps to keep bad people off of planes by ensuring that \nthose who receive boarding passes are not on our government's list of \nindividuals prohibited from flying.\n  According to her colleagues, Beth works tirelessly to synchronize all \nthe moving parts at her operations center. They say that Beth always \ngoes above and beyond the call of duty. She strives to make life easier \nfor fellow analysts, developing checklists, spreadsheets, and calendar \ninvitations to keep individuals accountable and organized. Her \ncolleague James Billups says that Beth ``inspires everyone around her, \nand truly brings the best out of people.'' I can see why.\n  In addition to her positive energy in the workplace, she has been \nwidely recognized at TSA and the Department for always lending a \nhelping hand at employee morale events. She is also known for welcoming \nnew recruits to the national capital region with a unique ``Welcome \nAboard'' package. It is actions such as these that show that Beth has \ntruly embodied TSA's core value of team spirit.\n  In 2014, Beth received the Secretary's Award for her steadfast and \noutstanding assistance to the entire team in the Secure Flight \nOperations Center.\n  When she is not securing our skies, Beth likes to run and travel the \nworld--pursuits she and I actually share in common. We have another \nvery important thing in common--the U.S. Navy. Beth is a retired yeoman \nchief petty officer with 21 years of service with the U.S. Navy \nReserve. I retired as a captain and spent a couple of years in an \nairplane with the Navy around the world, and my dad was a chief in the \nNavy, as well. But on behalf of the Senate--and, really, on behalf of \nall Americans--Beth, I just want to thank you. We thank you for your \nexemplary service to our country.\n  I wish to take a couple more minutes to recognize the service and \nsacrifice of another TSA employee. Her name is Carol Richel.\n  As we can see, even though TSA is often the target of criticism and \nfrustration, their mission at the end of the day is to save lives--our \nlives. Carol reminded us of this mission just a couple of months ago \nwhen a man wielding a machete attacked her and her colleagues at the \nLouis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans.\n  A native of St. Ignace, MI, Carol has worked as a TSA officer at the \nNew Orleans airport since October 2003 and has been a TSA supervisory \nofficer since October 2005. She is known by her colleagues to step up \non a moment's notice. This latest incident was no exception. As many of \nus may remember from the news stories, in March, a deranged man began \nto attack a number of TSA agents at a security checkpoint at the New \nOrleans airport. The man sprayed insect repellent in the face of an \nofficer, pulled a machete from the waistband of his pants, and began \nswinging the weapon in the direction of other TSA officers. Watching \nfrom her post, Carol yelled at the passengers in the area to run.\n  But her warning also attracted the attention of the attacker, and at \nthe\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nmoment, he started to run toward Carol. As the man got closer to her, \nLieutenant Heather Sylve of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office began \nfiring at him. Lieutenant Sylve shot the assailant three times, \nwounding and incapacitating him on site. He later died as a result of \nthose wounds.\n  Unfortunately, one of those shots also hit Carol in the arm. Injured \nbut undeterred, she reported to her post the very next day, ready to \nwork--not the next week, not the next month, the next day.\n  When asked about her work, by the St. Ignace News, she said:\n\n       I enjoy my job, and I feel that what we do is a necessary \n     thing. . . . This is an example of why it's necessary.\n\n  According to her colleagues, Carol is known for her hard work, her \ndedication to TSA's mission, and her sincere interest in the well-being \nof the entire team.\n  Our colleague from Oklahoma will enjoy this. When she is not at work, \nCarol enjoys caring for her animals and dedicating herself to Bible \nstudies.\n  Carol's bravery and commitment to her colleagues and the public she \nserves truly exemplify TSA's core values of integrity, innovation, and \nteam spirit.\n  To Beth and Carol, let me say this. Every day you go to work, we want \nyou to know that you help to ensure the safety of your fellow Americans \nand the security of our transportation system, which serves us all. We \nare grateful for that. Thank you both for your tireless dedication and \nyour invaluable service to our Nation and its people.\n  And to all of the public servants across this country and beyond our \nborders who give us 110 percent every day, let me close by saying that \nI want you to know that what you do every day is important to me and to \nall of my colleagues with whom I am privileged to serve here in this \nbody. We hope your work and your service fills your life with meaning \nand with happiness. On behalf of the people that we serve together, \nthank you for what you do. May God continue to bless each of you and \nthis country we love.\n  I yield the floor, and thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his \nkindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Delaware, I \nappreciate his remarks. It is seldom people will thank people for the \ntime and effort they spend and the successes they have.\n  Even though he is located so close to Washington that he is not \nexposed as much as I am--twice a week--I actually learn personally to \nknow these people. I feel the commitment they make. Certainly in Tulsa, \nDallas, and here are the ones whom I know well. So I appreciate the \nfact that the Senator is paying attention to them. That means a lot.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, since 2002, I have come to the floor to talk, after we \ndiscovered the truth about the whole global warming thing and who is \nbehind it and all this stuff. I don't want to say anything that would \nbe interpreted as not respectful, but I can remember back in 2002, it \nwas a difficult thing to tell the truth about this to the American \npeople because at that time most of the American people felt that--yes, \nthey bought into this idea that the world is coming to an end, and it \nis all manmade gases that are causing this. So it was difficult.\n  The Gallup poll of 2002 said at that time that, of all the \nenvironmental concerns, No. 1 was global warming. Now, that is not true \ntoday. Today, it is almost dead last. Last March, there was a poll that \ncame out from Gallup, and it was next to the last. It was down from \nsome 20 different environmental concerns.\n  So the people have realized that this largest tax increase in the \nhistory of America, if it were to take place, is not going to solve a \nproblem--a problem that really doesn't exist to the extent it has been \nrepresented. Today, they are still debating this.\n  I want to bring people up to date on where we are now--the fact that \nclimate change is not based on hard evidence and observation, but \nrather on a set of wishful beliefs, a well-scripted dialogue with which \nPresident Obama and the environmental alarmists are intending to scare \nthe American people into accepting this thing that would be so \ndevastating economically to America.\n  The other day a good friend of mine, Lamar Smith from the House--I \nlike Lamar. He and I were elected actually the same day many years ago. \nLamar is the chairman of the committee that has a lot of this \njurisdiction, and he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \nwas entitled, ``The Climate-Change Religion.'' Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  I thank Lamar Smith for his continued leadership and support on this \nissue. As Lamar highlights in the op-ed, the debate about global \nwarming is predicated more on ``scare tactics than on fact based \ndeterminations.''\n  Global warming alarmism has evolved into a religion where one is \neither an alarmist or a skeptic. Some people are not aware of those two \nterms. Someone who has bought into this ``the world is coming to an \nend''--they are the alarmists. People who do not believe that, as \nmyself, are skeptics. And being a skeptic is akin to heresy of the \nhighest order. Good policy has to be based on good science, not on \nreligion, and that requires science free from bias, whatever its \nconclusions may be.\n  The modern-day religion of climate change has been very artful in \nestablishing and controlling carefully scripted talking points intended \nto scare the American people under the guise of environmental \nprotectionism.\n  There are three main tenets of climate change alarmism that can be \nfound in any related speech, which we heard the President recite during \nhis recent Earth Day speech. Those three tenets are: No. 1, climate \nchange is human caused. No. 2, climate change is already wreaking havoc \nacross the globe. And No. 3, we must act today--now--before terrible \nthings happen--the world coming to an end.\n  These three main tenets of climate change can be found on just about \nevery administrative agency page, and they are creeping into every \nFederal policy determination.\n  As wise as the Presiding Officer is, something that he is not aware \nof that is happening in America today is that the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA, adjusted its policy for receipt of disaster \npreparedness resources to require States that are to be accepting these \nFEMA funds to first accept the undeniable ``challenges posed by climate \nchange'' and then spend State resources figuring how to plan for them \nbefore becoming eligible for disaster preparedness funds.\n  Look, I come from Oklahoma, a State that has tornadoes, called \nTornado Alley. When this happens, as it did very recently in the south-\ncentral part of Oklahoma, for us to get the funds that we are entitled \nto from FEMA, the State of Oklahoma has to accept the policy that we as \na State accept the undeniable challenges posed by climate change and \nthen spend our State resources figuring out how to plan for them before \nbecoming eligible for disaster relief. That is impossible.\n  People can't believe that is true when I tell them this is being done \nthrough the administration and this is adopted by these agencies. FEMA \nis supposed to be there to assist States in areas of the country for \ndisaster relief. But they cannot get it. They are held hostage until \nthey say something that they know is a lie and are held to that and \nspend State money. Again, that is not really believable, what I just \nstated, because it is so inconceivable that that could happen.\n\n  Now, the reality of this debate, however, is that the climate has \nbeen changing since the Earth was formed. I said the other day--a good \nfriend of mine had an amendment on the floor. The amendment made \ncomment to the fact that the climate is changing. Yes, it is changing. \nI think what the proponents of this idea are trying to do is to try to \nchange it over to say that those people who are not blaming human \nemissions as the cause of all these problems are denying that climate \nchanges.\n  I said on floor at that time, all evidence, archeological evidence, \nscriptural evidence, historical evidence is that climate has always, \nalways changed. We all accept that. The big issue is, is it because of \nhuman emissions. That is where the science now\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nshows clearly that it is not. You are going keep hearing it, though, \nbut it is not.\n  Further, the scientific debate around the role of climate change, its \ncauses and projected impacts, is ongoing. There is no consensus, and \nthe Wall Street Journal recently produced a great opinion piece that \nhighlights a multitude of discrepancies in the assertion that 90 \npercent of the scientists believe this to be true. This is kind of \ninteresting because any time you do not have science behind you, what \nyou say is science is settled, science is settled. And sooner or later, \npeople believe it, and they have not offered any evidence that would \nsupport that. That is what has happened.\n  This item really suggests that the Wall Street Journal opinion piece \nthat highlights the discrepancies in the 97 percent, when they say 97 \npercent of the scientists believe manmade gas is causing global \nwarming--the article points out that the myth of a scientific consensus \nis predicated on--and I am quoting now--``a handful of surveys and \nabstract-counting exercises that have been contradicted by more \nreliable research.''\n  Over the years, I have quoted a number of scientists. In fact, my Web \nsite way back in the--probably 10 years ago, I started accumulating the \nnumber of scientists and their credibility and their qualifications and \nstatements they have made. One I remember, from my head now, is Richard \nLindzen. Richard Lindzen is a professor from MIT. He is recognized as \none of the top climatologists in the country. When asked the question, \nhe says, of course it is not true. But the reason people, the \nbureaucracy, are so concerned about it is that regulating carbon is a \nbureaucracy's dream. If you regulate carbon, you regulate life. That is \nwhat the motivation is around this.\n  I think that is a good article to read so people will realize that \nthere is no consensus, scientific consensus. Some of them believe it, \nsome of them do not.\n  As climate research continues to develop, limitations in the overall \nunderstanding of our climate and the limitations of scientific research \nhave become increasingly evident. This could not be more evident than \nby the growing discrepancy between climate model predictions and actual \nobservations. For example, alarmists failed to foresee the ongoing \nwarming hiatus.\n  What is a warming hiatus? There has not been a change in that \ntemperature in the last 15 years. This is something that is \nincontrovertible. Everybody understands that. They admit they didn't \nforesee this happening, but that hiatus is actually going on today. It \nis still continuing. It further explained that the source of such a \ndiscrepancy could be caused by the ``combinations of internal climate \nvariability, missing or incorrect radiative forcing, and model response \nerror.''\n  In other words, climate modeling cannot accurately project, much less \npredict, the climate of the future as climatologists and the broader \nscientific community have yet to fully understand how our climate \nsystem actually works today.\n  There is also a growing body of scientific studies suggesting that \nvariations in solar radiation and natural climate variability have a \nleading role in climate change. Surprise, everybody, the Sun warms us. \nThat is a shocker to a lot of people. It is not manmade gas. It is not \nCO2 emissions. It is the Sun.\n  A number of independent studies assessing the impact of clouds have \neven suggested that water vapor feedback is entirely canceled out by \ncloud processes. Yet when the facts of reality do not appropriately \nalign with the religion of climate change, the alarmists will simply \ntry to explain these things away or conveniently exclude any science \nthat shows they are wrong.\n  A favorite talking point of the climate change religion that is often \nused by senior officials within the Obama administration is that \nhurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods--you name it--are proof of harm \nbeing caused by global warming. They all say that. I have yet to hear a \nspeech by any of the alarmists where they do not talk about the fact \nthat all the hurricanes and tornadoes--the nature of them, the severity \nof them, the occurrences--are proof of harm being caused by global \nwarming. But the global data shows no increase in the number or \nintensity of such events, and even the IPCC itself acknowledges the \nlack of any evident relationship between extreme weather and climate.\n  This is interesting because the IPCC--I know most people are aware of \nthis who are into this issue. But the IPCC is the Intergovernmental \nPanel On Climate Change. This is the United Nations. I even wrote a \nbook about it. The longest chapter is talking about the United Nations, \nhow they put this together. But they are the ones who have supposedly \nthe science behind this whole thing, and they are the ones who are now \nadmitting that there is no increase in intensity or occurrences of \nhurricanes, tornadoes, droughts or floods.\n  In fact, Roger Pielke was before our committee in July of 2013. He \nsaid the oft-asserted linkage between global warming and recent \nhurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and drought is ``unsupportable based on \nevidence and research.''\n  I am still quoting now.\n\n       It is misleading, and just plain incorrect, to claim that \n     disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or \n     droughts have increased on climate timescales either in the \n     United States or globally.\n\n  Hurricane landfalls have not increased in the United States ``in \nfrequency, intensity or normalized damage since at least the year \n1900.''\n  That is now an accepted fact. But in spite of that, every speech you \nhear, they talk about all the hurricanes and all the disasters taking \nplace and the intensity that has come to us because of global warming.\n  The IPCC--again, this is the U.N. 2013 ``Fifth Assessment Report.'' \nNow, the assessment report that they come out with is--they will come \nout with a long, complicated report every so often, but then they will \nhave kind of abbreviated ones for people like us to use to spread their \npropaganda. Their ``Fifth Assessment Report'' concluded that ``current \ndata sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical \ncyclone frequency over the past century. . . . No robust trends in \nannual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricane \ncounts have been identified over the last 100 years in the North \nAtlantic Basin.''\n  But let's just keep in mind everyone is now in agreement on that. Yet \nyou still hear in the speeches that the world is coming to an end, and \nall the tornadoes--all this intensity is going to be disastrous to \nAmerica.\n  Counter to the doomsday predictions of climate alarmists, increasing \nobservations suggest a much reduced and practically harmless climate \nresponse to increased amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Also \nmissing from the climate alarmists' doomsday scenarios and well-\nscripted talking points are the benefits from increased carbon that has \nled to a greening of the planet and contributed to increased \nagricultural productivity.\n  People do not realize that you cannot grow things without \nCO2. CO2 is a fertilizer. It is something you \ncannot do without. No one ever talks about the benefits. The people are \ninducing that as a fertilizer on a daily basis.\n  Despite admitted gaps to the scientific understanding of climate \nchange and a track record of climate modeling failures, President Obama \nand his environmental allies are holding fast to their bedrock beliefs. \nThey are intent on selling the President's so-called Climate Action \nPlan to the American people that is less about protecting the \nenvironment and more about expanding the role of the government while \nenriching, I should say, some campaigns of some of our friendly \nDemocrats. There is a guy named Tom Styer. Tom Styer lives in \nCalifornia. He is very, very wealthy. He is all wrapped up in this \nissue. He claims that he spent in the last election to elect people who \ngo along with global warming $75 million of his money. Originally, he \nwas going to spend $100 million, $50 million of his money and $50 \nmillion that he was going to raise. He found out he couldn't raise it, \nso that did not work.\n  I would say that his effort was not all that successful, judging from \nthe results of the last election. But he is still out there. He still \nhas a lot of money. He will not even miss the $75 million.\n  For the President's core domestic plan policy, the Clean Power Plan, \nlet's look at what this is. Starting back in 2002, when it was \nperceived to be a very\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\npopular issue, Members of this Senate started introducing bills that \nwould be cap-and-trade bills that would address this issue. It is very \nsimilar to the plan the President is putting out now. At that time, I \nwas the chairman of the committee--I think it was the Subcommittee on \nClean Air in the Senate. I was a believer because everybody said that \nwas true, until they came out--and there is a study made by the Charles \nRiver Associates and MIT that said if we comply with the cap and trade, \nthe cost to the American people would be in the range of $300 billion \nto $400 billion every year. That, again, would be the largest tax \nincrease in history. I thought, if the world is coming to an end, maybe \nwe need to do that.\n  I started questioning the science behind it. I started getting \nresponses from scientists all over America. First of all, 10 of them \ncame in. Then it went up to 400 and then 1,000. I started publishing \nthese on my Web site so people would know that there is another side to \nwhat they were calling this determined science by IPCC. They tried from \nthat time--this is 2002--until last year to pass legislation that would \nlegislatively give us a cap-and-trade system, but it got defeated more \nand more each year because the people have actually caught on. They \nhave caught on that it is not a real thing, the science is not settled. \nThat has led the President to say, all right, if you guys are not going \nto pass legislation, I am going to do it through regulation.\n  Where have we heard that before? That is everything the President has \nbeen doing that he can't get through in his policy that is through the \nlegislature. Right now, you probably cannot get 20 votes in the whole \nSenate on this issue. He is trying to do it through regulation. We have \na Clean Power Plan.\n  We had a hearing on this just last week. The President is no longer \nsatisfied with the fact that he can now tell you what doctor you can \nuse under ObamaCare, what type of investments you can use under that \nregulation or how fast your Internet will be. I understand that is \ncoming up next. He would like to dictate what type and how much energy \nyou can use.\n  With such high costs on the line, one would think there must be an \nequal amount if not greater number of benefits. What are the benefits? \nIn reality, according to various impact assessments, the environmental \nbenefits of the Clean Power Plan--again, admittedly, it is going to be \n$479 billion initially, the cost of this, and the core domestic policy \nof the President's Climate Action Plan that is supposed to protect this \ncountry from the impending impacts we are facing, the climate change--\nall of these costs will reduce CO2 concentrations by less \nthan 0.5 percent. The global average temperature rise will be reduced \nby only 0.01 degree Fahrenheit, and sea level rise will be reduced by \n0.3 millimeters. That is the thickness of three sheets of paper.\n  Further, these minuscule benefits would be rendered pointless by the \ncontinued emissions growth in India and China. The chart is up now. It \nis very significant.\n  Because we look at this and look at what China and India are \ncontributing to the atmosphere by their emissions. Now, there is the \nUnited States. In fact, the figure is that China alone produces more \nCO2 in 1 month--that is 800 million tons--than the Clean \nPower Plan will reduce in 1 year, and that is 500 million tons.\n  Perhaps what is most telling is that President Obama's EPA didn't \neven bother to measure what impacts the proposed Clean Power Plan would \nhave on the environment. This is something which has been very well \ndocumented.\n  I guess what we are saying here is that it doesn't really matter what \nwe are doing here in the United States. This is not where the problem \nis. But that is to be expected under the religion of climate change. \nWhen the science doesn't add up and the projections don't pan out and \nthe weather won't cooperate, alarmists will refer to their commitment \nto a higher moral authority or obligation. As evidenced by the Clean \nPower Plan, it doesn't matter if these policies provide any benefit in \nclimate change; crusaders certainly will not be dissuaded by the \nexorbitant costs.\n  It is ironic, however, that while touting a commitment to a moral \nobligation, which we have heard time and again from this \nadministration, the resulting policies will cause real economic \nhardship to this country and to the most vulnerable populations. This \nis something people need to pay attention to. The increase in the cost \nof fuel for Americans would be--and it has already been documented--the \nelectricity cost will go up by double digits in 43 States. And whom \ndoes it hurt the most? It hurts the poor people. Those individuals who \nspend the highest amount of their expendable income on heating their \nhomes will be hit the worst. This hypocrisy is kind of akin to jetting \naround the country in a 232-foot private plane on Earth Day to warn \nglobal citizens of the harm caused by increased CO2 \nemissions in the atmosphere.\n  The President's international discussions around climate change stand \nto be equally harmful to the American people. The President likes to \npoint to his recent agreement with China as evidence of international \ncooperation on climate change, but this agreement is nothing more than \nan exercise in theatrics.\n  China is sitting back right now licking its chops and hoping America \nwill start reducing its emissions and drive its manufacturing base \noverseas to places where they don't have these emission restrictions. \nThe farce of an agreement lets China continue business as usual, and \nthat is 800 million tons of CO2 a month until 2030. Boy, \nthat is until 2030, while hard-working American taxpayers are going to \nfoot the cost of the President's economically disastrous climate \nagenda.\n  Despite what the President might say to the international community, \nwithout the backing of the U.S. Congress, which the President does not \nhave, he has no authority to reach binding or legally enforceable \nagreements with other countries. I will remind the President of this \nagain in December.\n  Some people don't know that the United Nations has a big party every \nyear in December, and it has been going on now for 15 years. Every \nyear, they invite all the countries--this is all through the United \nNations--from all around the world, some 192 countries, to this big \nparty. I am talking about caviar and all you can drink and all that. \nAll they have to do is say they will agree to try to lower their \nemissions of CO2.\n  I remember the party in Copenhagen 2 years ago. As I recall, Obama \nwas there, Kerry was there, Pelosi was there, and Boxer was there. All \nthe far-left liberals were there to try to convince the people from \nthese other countries that we were going to pass a cap-and-trade bill, \nso they better do it too.\n  Well, I waited until they were all through with their things, and I \nwent over to Copenhagen. I tell the Chair, I was the one-man truth \nsquad. I went over to explain the truth to the other 191 countries. I \ntold them that these people are lying to them by saying we will pass \nlegislation. I said we are not going to pass legislation, and of course \nwe did not pass legislation.\n  I have to say this. The 191 countries over there all had one thing in \ncommon: They all hated me, but they all understood that I was right and \nthat there weren't the votes in this country to pass it.\n  The American people are starting to catch on, and that is why I am \nnot surprised, as I mentioned, that the Gallup Poll that was released \njust last March concluded that the current level of worry on \nenvironmental issues remains at or near record lows, and among those \nconcerns on the environmental issue, global warming is second to last. \nWhat Americans do care about is the economy and Federal spending and \nthe size and power of the Federal Government.\n  The disintegrating case for climate alarm coupled with an American \npublic that is quickly losing interest does not pan well for the \nPresident's climate agenda or his self-acclaimed environmental legacy. \nClimate alarmists have spent just as much energy, if not more, \nconvincing the world that it is bad to be a skeptic of what was once \nreferred to as global cooling and then became global warming and is now \nglobal climate change. The tenet of the modern climate change religion \ncannot withstand the scrutiny of the merits, primarily because it is a \nresult of political design and not scientific revelation. And that is \nwhy anyone who is\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nwilling to point out discrepancies within the climate change debate or \nraise legitimate concerns will be subjected to a barrage of arrogant \nsarcasm and personal attacks.\n  Whether the alarmists call it global warming or climate change, the \nAmerican people understand that the President's climate agenda is not \nabout protecting the public; it is about a power grab.\n  I will make three final points.\n  First of all, I think we all know that the climate is always \nchanging. I remember--and I will go from memory on this. We have \ncycles, and the cycles have been taking place all throughout history. \nIn 1895, we went into a period of cooling, and that was when they first \nstarted saying that another ice age was coming, and that lasted 30 \nyears, until about 1918. In 1918, a change came about. It started \ngetting warmer, and we went into a 30-year warming period. It was the \nfirst time the phrase ``global warming'' was used. In 1945, that \nchanged, and we went into a cooling spell, and the same thing has \nhappened since then. Right now, of course, we are in kind of a \nremission era.\n  This is what is interesting: No one can deny that 1945 was the year \nwhen we had the largest surge in the emissions of CO2 in the \nhistory of this country, and that precipitated not a warming period but \na cooling period. That is first.\n  The second thing is, in Australia--I wasn't going to mention this \nuntil I talked yesterday to one of the members of Parliament in \nAustralia. Several years ago, Australia bought into this argument and \nsaid: We are going to lead the way, and we will start restricting our \nemissions.\n  They imposed a carbon tax on their economy a few years ago, and it \ncost $9 billion in lost economic activity each year and destroyed tens \nof thousands of jobs. It was so bad that the government recently voted \nto repeal the carbon tax, and their economy is better for it. In fact, \nit was announced just following the repeal that Australia experienced a \nrecord job growth of 121,000 jobs--far more than the 10,000 to 15,000 \njobs economists had expected.\n  There is a country that tried it, and they found out what it cost, \nand you would think we could learn from their mistakes.\n  The third thing is to ask the question. What if I am wrong and they \nare right? There is an answer to that. I remember when President Obama \nwas first elected. He appointed Lisa Jackson, and she became the \nDirector of the Environmental Protection Agency. During the time she \nwas there, they were building this thing up, and we were holding \nhearings in the committee I chaired at that time.\n  I asked her: In the event that one of these bills passes on cap and \ntrade or the President comes up with some kind of proposal or a \nregulation that does the same thing, will that have the effect of \nlowering CO2 emissions worldwide?\n  Her answer: No, it wouldn't.\n  And the reason it wouldn't is because this is where the problem is. \nThe problem is in China, Mexico, and India. So the mere fact that we do \nsomething just in our country has a reverse effect because as we chase \naway our manufacturing base and it goes to one of those countries--and \nChina is hoping to be one of those countries--where they have no \nemission requirements, it would have the effect of not decreasing but \nincreasing emissions.\n  If you bought into this and you agree that I am wrong and they are \nright, just keep in mind that by their own emission this would not \nreduce CO2, and that is what we are supposed to be concerned \nwith.\n  The people of America have awakened. The economy and the Obama \nforeign policy of appeasement have captured their interest, and these \nare concerns that are real concerns and things we ought to do today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 23, 2015]\n\n                      The Climate-Change Religion\n\n                            (By Lamar Smith)\n\n       Earth Day provided a fresh opening for Obama to raise \n     alarms about global warming based on beliefs, not science.\n       ``Today, our planet faces new challenges, but none pose a \n     greater threat to future generations than climate change,'' \n     President Obama wrote in his proclamation for Earth Day on \n     Wednesday. ``As a Nation, we must act before it is too \n     late.''\n       Secretary of State John Kerry, in an Earth Day op-ed for \n     USA Today, declared that climate change has put America ``on \n     a dangerous path--along with the rest of the world.''\n       Both the president and Mr. Kerry cited rapidly warming \n     global temperatures and ever-more-severe storms caused by \n     climate change as reasons for urgent action.\n       Given that for the past decade and a half global-\n     temperature increases have been negligible, and that the \n     worsening-storms scenario has been widely debunked, the \n     pronouncements from the Obama administration sound more like \n     scare tactics than fact-based declarations.\n       At least the United Nations' then-top climate scientist, \n     Rajendra Pachauri, acknowledged--however inadvertently--the \n     faith-based nature of climate-change rhetoric when he \n     resigned amid scandal in February. In a farewell letter, he \n     said that ``the protection of Planet Earth, the survival of \n     all species and sustainability of our ecosystems is more than \n     a mission. It is my religion and my dharma.''\n       Instead of letting political ideology or climate \n     ``religion'' guide government policy, we should focus on good \n     science. The facts alone should determine what climate policy \n     options the U.S. considers. That is what the scientific \n     method calls for: inquiry based on measurable evidence. \n     Unfortunately this administration's climate plans ignore good \n     science and seek only to advance a political agenda.\n       Climate reports from the U.N.--which the Obama \n     administration consistently embraces--are designed to provide \n     scientific cover for a preordained policy. This is not good \n     science. Christiana Figueres, the official leading the U.N.'s \n     effort to forge a new international climate treaty later this \n     year in Paris, told reporters in February that the real goal \n     is ``to change the economic development model that has been \n     reigning for at least 150 years.'' In other words, a central \n     objective of these negotiations is the redistribution of \n     wealth among nations. It is apparent that President Obama \n     shares this vision.\n       The Obama administration recently submitted its pledge to \n     the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n     The commitment would lock the U.S. into reducing greenhouse-\n     gas emissions more than 25% by 2025 and ``economy-wide \n     emission reductions of 80% or more by 2050.'' The president's \n     pledge lacks details about how to achieve such goals without \n     burdening the economy, and it doesn't quantify the specific \n     climate benefits tied to his pledge.\n       America will never meet the president's arbitrary targets \n     without the country being subjected to costly regulations, \n     energy rationing and reduced economic growth. These policies \n     won't make America stronger. And these measures will have no \n     significant impact on global temperatures. In a hearing last \n     week before the House Science, Space and Technology \n     Committee, of which I am chairman, climate scientist Judith \n     Curry testified that the president's U.N pledge is estimated \n     to prevent only a 0.03 Celsius temperature rise. That is \n     three-hundredths of one degree.\n       In June 2014 testimony before my committee, former \n     Assistant Secretary for Energy Charles McConnell noted that \n     the president's Clean Power Plan--requiring every state to \n     meet federal carbon-emission-reduction targets--would reduce \n     a sea-level increase by less than half the thickness of a \n     dime. Policies like these will only make the government \n     bigger and Americans poorer, with no environmental benefit.\n       The White House's Climate Assessment implies that extreme \n     weather is getting worse due to human-caused climate change. \n     The president regularly makes this unsubstantiated claim--\n     most recently in his Earth Day proclamation, citing ``more \n     severe weather disasters.''\n       Even the U.N. doesn't agree with him on that one: In its \n     2012 Special Report on Extreme Events, the U.N.'s \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says there is \n     ``high agreement'' among leading experts that long-term \n     trends in weather disasters are not attributable to human-\n     caused climate change. Why do the president and others in his \n     administration keep repeating this untrue claim?\n       Climate alarmists have failed to explain the lack of global \n     warming over the past 15 years. They simply keep adjusting \n     their malfunctioning climate models to push the supposedly \n     looming disaster further into the future. Following the \n     U.N.'s 2008 report, its claims about the melting of Himalayan \n     glaciers, the decline of crop yields and the effects of sea-\n     level rise were found to be invalid. The InterAcademy \n     Council, a multinational scientific organization, reviewed \n     the report in 2010 and identified ``significant shortcomings \n     in each major step of [the U.N.] assessment process.''\n       The U.N. process is designed to generate alarmist results. \n     Many people don't realize that the most-publicized documents \n     of the U.N. reports are not written by scientists. In fact, \n     the scientists who work on the underlying science are forced \n     to step aside to allow partisan political representatives to \n     develop the ``Summary for Policy Makers.'' It is scrubbed to \n     minimize any suggestion of scientific uncertainty and is \n     publicized before the actual science is released. The Summary \n     for Policy Makers is designed to give\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n     newspapers and headline writers around the world only one \n     side of the debate.\n       Yet those who raise valid questions about the very real \n     uncertainties surrounding the understanding of climate change \n     have their motives attacked, reputations savaged and \n     livelihoods threatened. This happens even though challenging \n     prevailing beliefs through open debate and critical thinking \n     is fundamental to the scientific process.\n       The intellectual dishonesty of senior administration \n     officials who are unwilling to admit when they are wrong is \n     astounding. When assessing climate change, we should focus on \n     good science, not politically correct science.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis).

Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. In 1979, President Jimmy \nCarter established Asian Pacific Heritage Week. This week of \nrecognition was expanded to a month-long celebration in 1992. Every \nMay, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month provides \nAmericans the opportunity to reflect upon the many contributions made \nby the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in Nevada and \nacross the Nation.\n  May is a significant month in Asian American and Pacific Islander \nhistory. The first 10 days of May coincide with the arrival of the \nfirst Japanese immigrants in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the \ncompletion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869, which \nrelied heavily on the work of Chinese immigrants. But Asian American \nand Pacific Islander Heritage Month does not only recognize the past \nachievements of this vibrant community; this month is also a chance to \nhonor the civil rights activists, farmers, scientists, entrepreneurs, \nhealth professionals, educators, and other members of the Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander community, who continue to help shape our \nNation into an even better place culturally, economically, and \npolitically.\n  In Nevada, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are among the \nfastest growing populations and have enriched Nevada's history and \nculture. Hundreds of thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders \nlive in Nevada, and contribute to small business development and boost \nour economy. I am proud to represent such strong and innovative people, \nand I continue to work hard to enact legislation that positively \nimpacts the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. For \ninstance, I joined my colleague, Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono, earlier \nthis year in fighting for legislation that would reunite children and \nfamilies of Filipino World War II veterans, and I will continue my \nsteadfast support of family reunification efforts.\n  America is a nation of immigrants with diverse backgrounds and united \ncommon principles, which is part of what makes us strong, resilient, \nand unique. This month, we celebrate the wonderful and important \ncontributions of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in \nNevada and throughout the Nation, and I extend my best wishes for a \njoyous Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2682-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE DIGITAL INVESTIGATION CENTER AT CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month, I had the opportunity to visit \nthe award-winning Leahy Center for Digital Investigation at Champlain \nCollege in Burlington, VT. One of the Nation's top law enforcement \nofficers, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, joined \nme for a tour of this impressive facility. It was a fitting time to \nvisit the center; earlier in the week, the LCDI was recognized as the \nBest Cybersecurity Higher Education Program in the country by SC \nMagazine.\n  We all know that computers and technology have changed not only the \nway people commit crimes, but also the way law enforcement investigates \nand prosecutes criminals. Students here are learning firsthand how to \nhelp law enforcement agencies across the country in areas related to \ncomputer forensics and other forms of digital investigation. By giving \nthem this hands-on experience, Champlain College and the Leahy Center \nare training the next generation of analysts who will work to combat \ncyberthreats and other digital threats.\n  I was especially pleased that the FBI Director joined me in visiting \nthe LCDI. Both of us left with a deep appreciation for the excellent \neducation the next generation of cybersecurity professionals are \nreceiving at the Leahy center. These students receive intense hands-on \nexperience, dealing with the same issues that practitioners in the \nfield work on every day. With a 90 percent placement rate in relevant \nfields, the center is a critical part of ensuring that law enforcement \nhas the expertise and resources it needs to face the cyberthreats of \nthe future.\n  The cyberthreats we face are real, and the training students receive \nfrom the Leahy Center for Digital Investigation will help us face those \nthreats head on. I congratulate Champlain College and the center for \nthis achievement, and look forward to years of success to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2682-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2682-S2683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING RED HEN BAKING COMPANY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Red Hen Baking Company was founded in 1999 \nby Randy George and Eliza Cain in the Mad River Valley of Vermont. They \nstarted as a small operation, baking and delivering fresh bread to \nnearby stores and restaurants. They used pure ingredients, baked around \nthe clock, and soon, with the support of the surrounding community, and \nas the word-of-mouth testimonials spread, their small operation grew \ninto the Hen we know today. They moved their operation to the popular \nCamp Meade location, in my hometown of Middlesex.\n  Red Hen Baking Company exemplifies the spirit and the vision of \nVermont business. Randy often says that Vermont is the only State in \nwhich he could imagine starting and running a successful bakery of this \nkind. They tend to do things the right way, rather than the easy way--\nfrom the selection of the essential elements of their bread, to their \nemployee treatment policies and practices. Randy, Eliza and the Hen's \n``barnyard animals'' take pride in their product, and it shows.\n  Randy always reminds his customers that his employees are the most \nimportant part of his bakery business, so it was no surprise when he \nwas invited by President Obama and Labor Secretary Tom Perez to join \nthem at the White House as a ``Champion of Change'' for working \nfamilies. Employers from across the country shared their success \nstories, and the devastating and impossible choices working families \nface when paid sick leave is not among their benefits. The panel was a \ntremendous success, and I was proud to have Vermont represented by such \na steadfast supporter of fair treatment for employees.\n  Randy and Liza's message is clear. Put the people in your business at \nthe core of everything you do, and they will work hard for you for \nyears to come--in the Hen's case, even decades. Randy and Liza offer \nhealth coverage, fair, livable wages, and paid sick days. They want \ntheir employees to thrive both personally and professionally, and they \nhave encouraged other businesses to adopt similar standards.\n  Marcelle and I are so happy to live in Middlesex and to have our \nneighbors setting such high standards for the treatment of a dedicated \nworkforce. I want to congratulate Randy and Liza on their successful \nbusiness, and to thank them. Happy, healthy employees are productive \nemployees, and it is right to invest in each other's success.\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\nIt is the right way, and it is the Vermont way.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement \nin support of Division M of the Consolidated and Further Continuing \nAppropriations Act, 2015, the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification \nAct be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Senators Carper, Toomey, Coons, and Rubio in support of \n Division M of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations \n      Act, 2015, the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act.\n\n       At the end of the last Congress, a bipartisan group of \n     Senators and Members of Congress led by Senators Carper, \n     Toomey, Coons and Rubio, worked together to secure passage of \n     the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014. \n     That legislation, which was included as Division M of the \n     Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, \n     provides important technical clarifications of how the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) applies to \n     health coverage provided by U.S. insurers to globally mobile \n     employees. It puts those U.S. insurers on equal footing with \n     their foreign counterparts and protects jobs in this country.\n       As the Administration prepares to begin the rulemaking \n     process to implement the Expatriate Health Coverage \n     Clarification Act, we want to ensure Congressional intent is \n     clear so the Act is implemented properly. We are aware the \n     Congressional Record already contains two statements that \n     reflect Congressional intent on certain elements of the \n     Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act, but further \n     explanation will aid the Administration in its implementation \n     efforts.\n       The issues that we seek to clarify today are: relief from \n     the ACA's health insurer fee, the effective date of the \n     Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act, treatment of \n     groups of similarly situated individuals (including student \n     and religious missionary groups), who to take into account \n     when determining enrollment in expatriate health insurance \n     plans, locations where expatriate plans must provide coverage \n     for qualified expatriates assigned or transferred to the \n     United States, actuarial value, and reporting requirements.\n       One important clarification relates to the application of \n     the health insurer fee established in section 9010 of the ACA \n     to expatriate health insurance plans. Under the Expatriate \n     Health Coverage Clarification Act, premiums with respect to \n     persons covered by qualified expatriate health insurance \n     plans are not included in the calculation of the amount of \n     that issuer's share of the health insurance fee. To make \n     certain that the intent of that provision is abundantly \n     clear, we want to iterate that no health insurer fee will be \n     owed with respect to expatriate health insurance plans for \n     2016 and beyond.\n       Additionally, in implementing the special rule related to \n     the health insurer fee for 2014 and 2015, it is the intent of \n     Congress that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assess less \n     than the full ``applicable amount'' otherwise specified in \n     ACA section 9010 for 2014 and 2015, and that it refund or \n     credit any excess funds already paid by expatriate health \n     insurance issuers for 2014.\n       In addition to those important clarifications, we believe \n     additional clarifications will further ensure appropriate \n     implementation of the Expatriate Health Coverage \n     Clarification Act.\n       The Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act became law \n     on December 16, 2014. The legislative language provides that \n     the Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to expatriate \n     health plans issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2015, \n     unless otherwise specified. It is important to clarify that \n     Congressional intent is to provide immediate relief to U.S. \n     issuers of expatriate health insurance plans effective on the \n     date of enactment, and for the additional requirements \n     imposed by the Act to apply only to plans issued or renewed \n     on or after July 1, 2015, to give the Administration time to \n     issue guidance on these new requirements.\n       Another clarification relates to the treatment of ``groups \n     of similarly situated individuals,'' which includes student \n     and religious missionary groups, under the Expatriate Health \n     Coverage Clarification Act. Congress does not intend every \n     student or religious missionary or other similarly situated \n     group to have to endure a lengthy approval process through \n     which the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor \n     determine that international health care coverage is \n     appropriate for the group. Rather, if a health plan meets the \n     requirements of being an expatriate health plan and a group \n     of similarly situated individuals meets the requirements of \n     eligibility to purchase such a plan, we expect that these \n     groups can purchase plans as expeditiously as possible. We \n     expect the Secretaries will issue guidance on this matter \n     that is consistent with the language of the Expatriate Health \n     Coverage Clarification Act for these groups to access health \n     insurance and other related services and support in multiple \n     countries.\n       The Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act limits its \n     relief to expatriate health plans that meet the standards \n     established in the law. One of those standards is that \n     ``[s]ubstantially all of the primary enrollees in such plan \n     or coverage are qualified expatriates . . . .'' It is \n     important to clarify that Congress does not intend for \n     individuals who are enrolled in COBRA or other continuation \n     coverage under the plan to be taken into account when \n     determining whether substantially all of the primary \n     enrollees are qualified expatriates.\n       Another standard is that where an expatriate health plan \n     provides coverage for qualified expatriates who are \n     transferred or assigned to the United States, the plan must \n     provide certain coverages in ``. . . such other country or \n     countries as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Secretary of Labor, may designate (after taking into account \n     the barriers and prohibitions to providing health care \n     services in the countries as designated).'' It is important \n     to clarify that Congress does not intend that expatriates in \n     foreign countries receive duplicate or unnecessary health \n     insurance coverage. Instead, the Secretaries should \n     promulgate guidance establishing that, by virtue of having \n     U.S.-issued expatriate health coverage, qualified expatriates \n     need the full benefits and protections of the Expatriate \n     Health Coverage Clarification Act in such locations as are \n     necessary for the individual to perform his/her job \n     responsibilities.\n       The Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act says that \n     plan sponsors must reasonably believe that ``the benefits \n     provided by the expatriate health plan satisfy a standard at \n     least actuarially equivalent to the level provided for in \n     section 36B(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code.'' The \n     intent of Congress is to require expatriate health coverage \n     to meet the minimum-value as it is delineated in the Internal \n     Revenue Code 36B(c)(2)(C)(ii). We believe the law allows for \n     employers and issuers to retain the flexibility to design and \n     offer plans with a higher value as they may determine \n     necessary and appropriate to meet the needs and circumstances \n     of their covered population.\n       Finally, there is the issue of reporting requirements. The \n     ACA added section 6055 to the Internal Revenue Code, which \n     provides that every provider of minimum essential coverage \n     will report coverage information by filing an informational \n     return with the IRS and furnishing a statement to \n     individuals. The information is used by the IRS to \n     administer, and individuals to show compliance with, the \n     ACA's individual shared responsibility provision. It is \n     Congress's intent that any additional reporting that may be \n     required as a result of the Expatriate Health Coverage \n     Clarification Act or related guidance should be kept as \n     minimal as possible, recognize the unique nature of \n     expatriate health plans, and be incorporated into the \n     existing requirements under section 6055. Should future laws \n     or regulations streamline the reporting requirements for \n     domestic health plans, we expect that this relief be provided \n     equally to expatriate health plans.\n       We believe these are important clarifications that will \n     ensure the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act is \n     implemented consistent with Congressional intent and will \n     permit U.S.-based expatriate health insurance issuers to \n     compete with their foreign counterparts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2683-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2683-S2684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING FLIGHT OFFICER WILLIAM A. COLBERT, JR., OF THE TUSKEGEE \n                                 AIRMEN\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Flight Officer William \nAugust Colbert, Jr., for his honorable service to the United States as \na member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Mr. Colbert is a lifelong \nMarylander who was born in Annapolis and attended Anne Arundel County \npublic schools, graduating from Wiley H. Bates High School. Upon his \ngraduation, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps and was stationed \nin Allegany County, MD where he met and married his wife, the late \nVivian Lee Colbert. He ultimately made Cumberland his home.\n  After spending time working in the Baltimore shipyards, Mr. Colbert \nenlisted in the Army Air Force in 1943 and achieved the rank of flight \nofficer at the Tuskegee Army Air Field. He was alerted for overseas \nduty on two occasions, but the war ended prior to his deployment. While \nMr. Colbert never saw combat, he learned to fly with the best, and \nbecame a Red Tail. Mr. Colbert has always considered his contribution \nto the Tuskegee Airmen as what he was called to do as a U.S. citizen. \nHe did so without expectation of fame or fanfare.\n  When Mr. Colbert returned to Cumberland after his military service, \nhe worked as a tire builder for the Kelly-\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\nSpringfield Tire Company for 33 years until his retirement. He became a \nmember of Fulton Myers American Legion Post. He and his wife had two \nchildren but lost one due to complications of childbirth. They raised \ntheir son William Augustus Colbert, III, who went to Bowie State \nUniversity, where he met and married his wife Anna Hudson Colbert. Mr. \nColbert has been blessed with four grandchildren and six great-\ngrandchildren. Last July, Mr. Colbert became a great-great-grandfather. \nHe is an admired family man who has opened his home, heart, and \ntalents--including hunting, fishing, photography, and jazz--to family \nand friends alike. Mr. Colbert has enjoyed gardening and carpentry, and \nhe personally ensured that the U.S. flag was raised and lowered each \nday on the former Pine Avenue playground, which was located directly \nacross the street from his house.\n  The contributions of Mr. Colbert and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen--the \nfirst African American combat unit in the Army Air Corps--played a \ncrucial role in integrating the U.S. armed services. They helped to \nshatter stereotypes through their distinguished service at home and \nabroad.\n  In the 109th Congress, I was honored to cosponsor legislation \nawarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen in \nrecognition long overdue of their unique military record, which \ninspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces, and to join the \nPresident of the United States and my colleagues in Congress in \npresenting the medal to 300 members of the Tuskegee Airmen in a \nceremony in the U.S. Capitol. The medal features three Tuskegee Airmen \nin profile--an officer, a mechanic and a pilot. The eagle symbolizes \nflight, nobility, and the highest ideals of our Nation. The years 1941-\n1949 indicate the years during which these airmen were assigned to \nsegregated units. The reverse side depicts three types of airplanes \nflown by the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II: the P-40, P-51 and B-25. \nThe original gold medal remains on display at the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  Mr. Colbert was in failing health at the time, so he was unable to \nattend that ceremony and be presented with a copy of the medal. I am \npleased to announce that on Friday, May 15, 2015, Mr. Colbert will \nfinally receive the recognition he has earned during a presentation of \nthe Congressional Gold Medal along with presentations by State and \nlocal elected officials, veterans service organizations, and the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, in \nhis hometown of Cumberland, MD.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing sincere appreciation and \ncongratulations to Mr. Colbert for his outstanding service to our \ncountry in uniform and in his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2684-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MARY ELIZABETH CUNNINGHAM\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \na Connecticut resident who recently demonstrated extraordinary \ncapability and heroism. Mary Elizabeth Cunningham, a resident of \nNiantic, who works as an emergency room nurse at Yale-New Haven \nHospital, was flying from Chicago to Hartford on April 22. When she \nheard an announcement over the loudspeaker seeking the assistance of \nany medical professionals on board, she quickly volunteered to help a \npassenger experiencing respiratory difficulties. After successfully \nproviding aid, Ms. Cunningham was about to return to her seat when she \nwas asked to help another passenger, who had lost consciousness. While \nassessing the situation, she began to feel dizzy herself, along with \nother passengers and members of the flight crew.\n  Despite the challenging circumstances, she did not panic but instead \nurged the flight crew to make an emergency landing, fearing something \nwas wrong. The pilot swiftly landed the plane in Buffalo, and although \n17 passengers were later evaluated by medical personnel, it appears \nthat everyone has made a full recovery. Had Ms. Cunningham not been on \nthe plane to assist with handling the situation, that might not have \nbeen the case.\n  Ms. Cunningham deserves the highest praise, not just for her choice \nto become a health provider, but for her speedy and decisive actions to \nhelp those in need and recognizing a potentially disastrous situation. \nI am particularly pleased to recognize her on National Nurses Day, when \nwe recognize the essential services nurses provide in hospitals and \ncommunities all across the country. I know all of Connecticut joins me \nin honoring and thanking Ms. Cunningham for her exemplary performance \nin the line of duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2684-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TOP MONTANA TEAM IN CAPITOL HILL CHALLENGE\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Twenty contestants from across the United States and \nCanada were judged on public speaking, a personal interview, talent \npresentation, traditional dance, and an essay. Throughout the \ncompetition, contestants demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of their \nculture and tribal history. Cheyenne won awards for the Best Essay as \nwell as Best Dancer categories.\n  Cheyenne is a member of the Sac and Fox Nation, and also represents \nthe Hidatsa Arikara, Cheyenne, Pawnee, Otoe, Kiowa Apache, and Tonkawa \ntribes.

It is truly a great honor to have such a \ntalented young woman represent North Dakota and Indian Country on the \nworld stage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2684-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2684-S2685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVEN LEACH\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \ninspiring accomplishments of Steven Leach, a 20-year U.S. Army veteran \nand past department commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars from \nPawlet, VT, who is known by his fellow veterans, friends, and \nacquaintances as ``The Monument Man.'' Steve has long been a strong \nleader within the veterans' community, especially as a member of \nHarned-Fowler VFW Post 6471 in Manchester Center, VT, and a passionate \nadvocate for veterans and their family members.\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\n  Most recently, Steve has dedicated himself to preserving the memory \nof the service and sacrifice of wartime veterans for future generations \nof Vermonters, as well as visitors to the Green Mountain State. In \n2010, he spearheaded a major initiative to erect a monument \ncommemorating the thousands of Vermont veterans who served in the \nKorean war, including the 94 Vermonters who were killed in action \nduring ``the forgotten war'' and the 20 who remain missing to this day. \nFor more than 3 years, Steve planned, designed, coordinated, and \nfundraised to make the monument a reality, and on August 5, 2013, he \nhelped inaugurate the Vermont Korean War Monument in Manchester, VT.\n  Inspired by the overwhelming support for that effort and not one to \nrest on his laurels, Steve set out to erect a similar monument in honor \nof World War II veterans, to be installed at the new Bennington Welcome \nCenter on Route 279, also known as the Vermont World War II Veterans \nMemorial Highway. That project is almost complete and will be dedicated \non August 15 as part of the events commemorating the 70th anniversary \nof the conclusion of World War II. On that date, thanks in large part \nto Steve's efforts, Vermonters will gather to unveil a monument \nrecognizing the sacrifices of those who contributed to the defeat of \ntyranny 70 years ago, including the more than 1,200 Vermonters who died \nas a result of combat.\n  Between the two monument campaigns, Steve has logged hundreds of \nvolunteer hours, travelled thousands of miles, raised tens of thousands \nof dollars, and, most importantly, touched the hearts of countless \nVermonters in his quest to honor the service of our State's veterans.\n  Steve Leach is another one of those extraordinary veterans we all \nhave in our home States, who, although he took off his uniform, never \nreally quit serving his country. This humble man will be rather \nembarrassed that I have chosen to place him in the spotlight for his \nselfless devotion to public service. His tireless efforts deserve \nspecial recognition in this body, and I am so proud to share his \naccomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2685-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2685-S2687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-22. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     United States Congress to require the U.S. Department of \n     Defense to ensure that replacement aircraft are assigned to \n     Selfridge Air National Guard Base to compensate for the \n     proposed elimination of the A-10 fleet; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, The proposed U.S. Department of Defense budget \n     would eliminate the nation's A-10 fleet, including aircraft \n     at Michigan's Selfridge Air National Guard Base. Selfridge \n     currently is home to 18 A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft, \n     directly supporing 535 jobs related to that mission; and\n       Whereas, The proposed cuts would have a dramatic effect on \n     the lives and morale of the dedicated men and women who \n     choose to serve our country at Selfridge Air National Guard \n     Base and other U.S. military bases. The elimination of the A-\n     10 fleet would place in jeopardy more than 400 jobs at \n     Selfridge alone; and\n       Whereas, In Michigan, these proposed cuts would have \n     immeasurable impacts on Macomb County and the local \n     communities surrounding the Selfridge Air National Guard \n     Base. For nearly a century, the base has been a source of \n     community pride and local jobs, with the local economic \n     benefit worth more than $700 million to residents and \n     businesses in several surrounding cities and townships. In \n     addition, the base is a key component of disaster response \n     for the entire state and a vital base for our nation's \n     homeland security; and\n       Whereas, The A-10 fleet should not be eliminated until an \n     enduring fighter aircraft mission, or suitable enduring non-\n     fighter mission supplementary to the KC-135 Air Refueling \n     Tanker, can be assigned to Selfridge Air National Guard Base. \n     The elimination of the A-10 fleet will make Selfridge \n     vulnerable to closure in future Base Realignment and Closure \n     Commission recommendations. Assigning replacement aircraft \n     would not only maintain the viability of this important base \n     for homeland security, but would also be cost-effective: the \n     Air National Guard can operate aircraft at about half the \n     cost of an active duty unit; and\n       Whereas, The brave pilots and crew who serve in the A-10 \n     unit based at Selfridge Air National Guard Base have \n     performed brilliantly against the enemies of freedom on \n     battlefields across the globe providing desperately needed \n     close air support for our nation's warriors. It is vital to \n     our national security that those skilled airmen continue to \n     be utilized to defend our nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to require the \n     U.S. Department of Defense to ensure that replacement \n     aircraft are assigned to Selfridge Air National Guard Base to \n     compensate for the proposed elimination of the A-10 fleet; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-23.

That the Wyoming Legislature calls on Congress \n     and federal agencies to adequately fund and support all \n     efforts to manage free-roaming feral horses on rangelands in \n     the West at the appropriate management level, utilizing all \n     management and control methods authorized by Section 3(d) of \n     the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.\n       Section 2. That the Wyoming Legislature calls on Congress \n     in conjunction with all appropriate state and local \n     governments to engage in cooperative efforts to remediate and \n     minimize the environmental impact of free-roaming feral \n     horses on rangelands in the West. These efforts should \n     include the development and use of effective fertility \n     control methods to reduce the free-roaming populations of \n     feral horses on rangelands in the West.\n       Section 3. That the Wyoming Legislature calls on Congress \n     to prohibit the reintroduction of feral horses back onto the \n     western rangelands outside the current herd management areas, \n     nor onto existing herdo management areas at or above the \n     authorized management levels.\n       Section 4. That the Wyoming Legislature calls on Congress \n     and federal agencies to prioritize these requested management \n     activities to the sage grouse core areas and priority habitat \n     strongholds in order to reduce the possibility of an \n     endangered listing for the sage grouse and to stop the \n     resource-damage now occurring.\n       Section 5.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts memorializing the President of \n     the United States and the United States Congress to establish \n     a Presidential Youth Council; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                              Resolutions\n\n       Whereas, Young people have always played an important role \n     in the nation's history and development but continue to play \n     a disproportionately small role in American government; and\n       Whereas, Just over \\1/3\\ of the United States population is \n     comprised of Americans age 24 and under; and\n       Whereas, Youth participation, involvement and engagement \n     should be universally recognized as safeguards of democracy \n     but the existing mechanisms of the Federal Government are \n     designed in ways that inhibit youth participation, leading to \n     the underrepresentation of young people in the policymaking \n     process; and\n       Whereas, Policy decisions made today will have a profound \n     impact on future generations and all Americans should have a \n     voice in government, especially with regard to policies that \n     directly affect them; and\n       Whereas, A Presidential Youth Council would offer young \n     persons in America with a means of sharing their perspectives \n     and voicing their opinions at the highest level of government \n     while also providing the President and Congress with a \n     bipartisan source of information on the concerns facing \n     youths across the country; and\n       Whereas, Members of Congress, governors, state legislatures \n     and mayors have created youth councils that have proven to be \n     effective means of receiving input from young people and have \n     lead to more efficient policies and practices affecting young \n     people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts General Court hereby \n     encourages the creation of a Presidential Youth Council to \n     advise the President and Congress on the perspectives of \n     young people, to assist in the design and implementation of \n     youth policies and to allow young people to provide solutions \n     on the most pressing issues facing the future of America; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the Clerk of the Senate to the President of the \n     United States, to the Presiding Officer of each branch of \n     Congress and to the Members thereof from the commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-26. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California urging the President of the United States \n     and the United States Congress to work together to create a \n     comprehensive and workable approach to reform the nation's \n     immigration system according to specified principles; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, This country was built by immigrants seeking a \n     better life; and\n       Whereas, Estimates suggest that there are 11 million \n     undocumented immigrants living in the shadows in the United \n     States, including millions of children brought to this \n     country undocumented who have grown up here, call the United \n     States home, and are suffering from our dysfunctional \n     immigration policy; and\n       Whereas, A logical and streamlined path to citizenship for \n     individuals after they gain legal status would stimulate the \n     economy by allowing these individuals to get college degrees \n     and driver's licenses, buy homes, start new companies, and \n     create legal, tax-paying jobs, affording them a chance at the \n     American Dream; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress last enacted major \n     immigration legislation more than 25 years ago; and\n       Whereas, Since that time, fragmented attempts at \n     immigration reform have failed to create the rational and \n     effective systems needed to maintain international \n     competitiveness. Whether in industries like agriculture, \n     which requires large numbers of workers able to perform \n     physically demanding tasks, or in industries like technology \n     or health care, where the demand for employees with advanced \n     degrees is projected to exceed supply within the next five \n     years, immigration policy must be designed to respond to \n     emerging labor needs in all sectors of the United States \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, Our national interests and security are not served \n     by our outdated, inefficient, and slow-moving immigration \n     system. Patchwork attempts to mend its deficiencies undermine \n     our potential for prosperity and leave us vulnerable and \n     unable to meet the needs of the modern world; and\n       Whereas, Labor mobility is crucial to our economic \n     prosperity and our country's recovery from the economic \n     crisis. Yet our rigid, outdated immigration policies are \n     making it difficult for our companies and our nation to \n     compete. Information released in a study by the University of \n     California, Los Angeles, states that legalizing the status of \n     undocumented immigrants working and living in the United \n     States would create approximately $1.5 trillion in additional \n     gross domestic product growth over the next 10 years and \n     increase wages for all workers. Another study by the \n     University of California, Davis, indicates that the last \n     large wave of immigrants, from 1990 to 2007, inclusive, \n     raised the income of a native-born American worker by an \n     average of $5,000; and\n       Whereas, California has the largest share of immigrants in \n     the country. These immigrants are a vital and productive part \n     of our state's economy and are active in a variety\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\n     of industries, including technology, biotech, hospitality, \n     agriculture, construction, services, transportation, and \n     textiles. They also represent a large share of our new small \n     business owners and create economic property and needed jobs \n     for everyone; and\n       Whereas, Keeping these families, business owners, and hard \n     workers in the shadows of society serves no one; and\n       Whereas, Our state, for economic, social, health, security, \n     and prosperity reasons, must support policies that allow \n     individuals to become legal and enfranchised participants in \n     our society and economy; and\n       Whereas, Comprehensive immigration reform should include a \n     reasonable and timely path to citizenship for undocumented \n     immigrants who are already living and working in the United \n     States. Immigration reform should also include comprehensive \n     background checks, require demonstrated proficiency in \n     English and payment of all current and back taxes, and have \n     the flexibility to respond to emerging business trends; and\n       Whereas, The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan \n     research group in Washington, D.C., estimates that in 2012, \n     the federal government spent $18 billion on immigration \n     enforcement, and since 2004, the number of United States \n     Border Patrol agents has doubled; and\n       Whereas, Increased enforcement has given the federal \n     government the ability to prioritize the deportation of \n     lawbreakers and dangerous individuals and to ensure our \n     border's security. Nevertheless, this enforcement should not \n     be done in an inhumane way; and\n       Whereas, Immigration enforcement should continue to focus \n     on criminals, not on hardworking immigrant families, and not \n     at the expense of effective trade with two of our top three \n     economic partners; and\n       Whereas, The United States loses large numbers of \n     necessary, highly skilled workers due to the lengthy and \n     complicated processes currently in place to get or keep a \n     legal residency option; and\n       Whereas, Reform should include an expedited process for \n     those residing abroad and applying for legal visas. \n     Additionally, reform should offer permanent residency \n     opportunities to international students in American \n     universities who are highly trained and in high demand, and \n     in so doing avoid an intellectual vacuum after their \n     graduation; and\n       Whereas, Reform should recognize the societal and cultural \n     benefits of keeping the family unit intact. The system should \n     take into account special circumstances surrounding \n     candidates for probationary legal status, such as those of \n     minors who were brought to the country as children or workers \n     whose labor is essential to maintain our country's \n     competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to work together and \n     create a comprehensive and workable approach to solving our \n     nation's historically broken immigration system, using the \n     principles described in this resolution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and the Vice President of \n     the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-27.

A bill to amend the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007 to modify provisions relating to smart grid modernization, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Smart \nGrid Act of 2015.\n  America's trillion-dollar electricity grid is ill-equipped to meet \nthe needs of the future. Grid outages and interruptions are estimated \nto cost taxpayers $150 billion annually, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy DOE. At the same time, electricity demand is \nexpected to grow 24 percent by 2040 and electricity costs for American \nconsumers are expected to increase 18 percent over that same period.\n  Yet the news is not all grim, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates \nthat $46 billion to $117 billion could be saved in the avoided \nconstruction costs of power plants and transmission lines over 20 \nyears, if the United States transitions to ``smart grid'' technologies.\n  This bill promotes a more efficient and flexible electricity grid--an \nelectricity grid that supports low-cost renewable energy, electric \nvehicles and energy storage, and helps consumers save money while \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. The bill extends cost-share grant \nprograms created in the Energy Independence and Savings Act of 2007, \nEISA2007, and sets DOE on a path to help create technology \ncommunication standards that will pave the way for innovation in new \nhousehold appliances and save consumer dollars.\n  Specifically, the bill will establish two DOE competitive grant \nprograms to promote the modernization of the electricity grid. Among \ncritical areas identified by the electricity industry, the new \nauthorizations will promote grid efficiency and real time rate \nadjustments, in addition to driving innovations and deployment of new \nenergy technologies. The grant programs would require an equal matching \ninvestment from the grant recipient to ensure that beneficiaries are \nalso held accountable. The grant recipients will be required to \nexchange information and ideas to further the development of a \nmodernized electric grid. The bill will also direct DOE to begin \ndeveloping standards for data sharing and communication between \nelectricity users and providers on the grid, to improve grid efficiency \nand reliability.\n  I encourage my colleagues to review and ultimately support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978 to expand the electric rate-setting authority of States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the PURPA PLUS \nAct.\n  In my home State we have numerous emerging small renewable energy \ntechnologies, such as wave energy buoys, hydropower turbines in \nirrigation canals, biomass burning cogeneration facilities and rooftop \nsolar installations. Like Oregon, many States have sought to advance \nsuch new electricity technologies by allowing utilities to pay higher \nthan normal power purchase rates, called ``incentive rates'', for power \nfrom these desirable technologies. Incentive rates allow individuals \nand small businesses deploying these desirable technologies to recover \nthe money they invest in the infrastructure, such as solar panels or \nother electricity generation equipment, over a reasonable period of \ntime. The ability of States to award such incentive rates for small \nprojects is currently hampered by the need to go through a case-by-case \nreview process before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC.\n  The PURPA PLUS Act simply provides States the legal authority to set \nincentive rates for small renewable energy projects. Currently, under \nthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, PURPA, the FERC \nregulates the price that utility companies pay for electricity from \nsmall, independent power providers. Such prices can be no higher than \nwhat it would normally cost a utility company either to generate or to \nbuy additional power from the lowest cost provider. This structure sets \na limit on prices that is often too low for small renewable energy \nprojects to be financially viable, despite other clear benefits they \nprovide, such as local job creation, lower investment in high-voltage \ntransmission lines, diversity in an area's power generation portfolio, \nand the environmental benefits of green energy.\n  PURPA PLUS would transfer the authority for setting power purchase \nrates for small power projects of less than 2 megawatts from FERC to \nthe States on a voluntary basis. If a State chose to exercise this \nauthority to promote small wind energy development, or solar, or \ncogeneration projects, it could. If a State chose not to use this \nauthority, FERC would continue to regulate these projects as before. By \ncapping the project size at 2 megawatts, PURPA PLUS only extends this \nnew authority for small projects that are providing very small amounts \nof power to the local utility company, leaving regulation of large wind \nfarms, hydropower and other large renewable energy projects unchanged.\n  While I acknowledge that the power from these small projects may be \nmore expensive than a large central generation station powered by coal \nor gas, I\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\nbelieve that States, if they choose, should be able to consider the \nassociated benefits of small renewable power and set higher prices, \nwhen the market demands such action and when the benefits outweigh the \ncosts.\n  I urge my colleagues to review and ultimately to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``PURPA's Legislative Upgrade \n     to State Authority Act'' or ``PURPA PLUS Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies \n     Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3)--\n       (A) established a new class of nonutility generators known \n     as ``qualifying cogeneration facilities'' and ``qualifying \n     small power production facilities''; and\n       (B) encouraged the development of alternate sources of \n     energy with the requirement that utilities purchase energy \n     offered by qualifying facilities;\n       (2) since the date of enactment of that section, materials \n     and designs for qualifying facility technologies have \n     advanced and placed renewable resources and cogeneration \n     facilities within the reach of more consumers, including \n     technologies such as--\n       (A) solar photovoltaic panels;\n       (B) small wind turbines;\n       (C) storage technologies to support renewable energy;\n       (D) small hydroelectric generators on existing dams, \n     diversions, and conduits;\n       (E) hydrokinetic generators;\n       (F) gas microturbines;\n       (G) steam-cycle turbines;\n       (H) Stirling engines;\n       (I) fuel cells; and\n       (J) biomass boilers;\n       (3) States need additional regulatory flexibility and \n     authority to be able to incentivize the qualifying \n     facilities; and\n       (4) the avoided cost caps on qualifying facilities should \n     be removed so that States can set the rates for qualifying \n     facilities of not more than 2 megawatts capacity.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE AUTHORITY TO INCENTIVIZE QUALIFYING FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 210(b) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies \n     Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 824a-3(b)) is amended in the last \n     sentence by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, except that the rule shall provide that a \n     State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility, \n     acting under State authority, may set rates that exceed the \n     incremental cost of alternative electric energy for purchases \n     from any qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small \n     power production facility of not more than 2 megawatts \n     capacity''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2692-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 170--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n  TRAVEL AND TOURISM WEEK AND HONORING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \n                TRAVEL AND TOURISM TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Kirk, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Warner, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Heller, Mr. King, Mr. Rounds, Mr. \nCassidy, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Thune) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 171\n\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools that do not \n     charge tuition and enroll any student who wants to attend, \n     often through a random lottery when the demand for enrollment \n     is outmatched by the supply of available charter school \n     seats;\n       Whereas high-performing public charter schools deliver a \n     high-quality public education and challenge all students to \n     reach the students' potential for academic success;\n       Whereas public charter schools promote innovation and \n     excellence in public education;\n       Whereas public charter schools throughout the United States \n     provide millions of families with diverse and innovative \n     educational options for children of the families;\n       Whereas high-performing public charter schools and charter \n     management organizations are increasing student achievement \n     and attendance rates at institutions of higher education;\n       Whereas public charter schools are authorized by a \n     designated entity and--\n       (1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and \n     students in the United States; and\n       (2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, \n     choice, high-performance, and innovation;\n       Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, public \n     charter schools are held accountable by the authorizers of \n     the charter schools for improving student achievement and for \n     sound financial and operational management;\n       Whereas public charter schools are required to meet the \n     student achievement accountability requirements under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.) in the same manner as traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas public charter schools often set higher \n     expectations for students, beyond the requirements of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas 43 States and the District of Columbia have enacted \n     laws authorizing public charter schools;\n       Whereas, as of the 2014-2015 school year, more than 6,700 \n     public charter schools served more than 2,900,000 children;\n       Whereas in the United States--\n       (1) in 150 school districts, more than 10 percent of public \n     school students are enrolled in public charter schools; and\n       (2) in 12 school districts, at least 30 percent of public \n     school students are enrolled in public charter schools;\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n       Whereas public charter schools improve the achievement of \n     students enrolled in the charter schools and collaborate with \n     traditional public schools to improve public education for \n     all students;\n       Whereas public charter schools--\n       (1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools;\n       (2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and\n       (3) must prove the ongoing success of the charter schools \n     to parents, policymakers, and the communities served by the \n     charter schools or risk closure;\n       Whereas, between 2010 and 2015, research studies have found \n     that students attending public charter schools perform better \n     academically than their peers;\n       Whereas at least 500,000 students are on waiting lists to \n     attend public charter schools across the country before the \n     start of the 2014-2015 school year;

and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to hold \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during \n     National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for \n     public charter schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/06/senate-section/article/S2693-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 172--HONORING THE VITAL ROLE OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND \n  THE PASSION OF ENTREPRENEURS IN THE UNITED STATES DURING ``NATIONAL \n         SMALL BUSINESS WEEK'', FROM MAY 4, THROUGH MAY 8, 2015\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Peters, Mr. \nRubio, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Gardner, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Coons, Ms. Heitkamp, \nMr. Markey, Mr. Risch, Mr. Scott, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. Hoeven) \nsubmitted the following resolution;

Res. 173\n\n       Whereas Bashar al-Assad, through his actions and decisions, \n     has lost his legitimacy as a leader of the Syrian people;\n       Whereas forces loyal to the Assad regime have committed war \n     crimes and crimes against humanity, including starvation, \n     systematic murder, torture, rape and sexual violence, \n     enforced disappearance, and used weapons of mass destruction \n     including chemical weapons;\n       Whereas the actions of the Assad regime have egregiously \n     violated international laws of war and shocked the global \n     conscience;\n       Whereas the United Nations has documented the Assad \n     regime's campaign to defeat opposition forces by starving \n     rebels and civilians through calculated efforts to cut off \n     food supplies in opposition-controlled areas such as eastern \n     Aleppo and Homs;\n       Whereas there is evidence that the Assad regime conducted \n     systematic torture and killing of people who were detained by \n     regime forces;\n       Whereas rape and sexual violence against civilians by \n     regime forces has been cited as a primary reason families \n     flee Syria;\n       Whereas it has been reported that more than 11,000 people \n     have disappeared after being taken into custody by forces \n     loyal to the Assad regime;\n       Whereas the Assad regime continues to use helicopters to \n     indiscriminately drop barrel bombs, even after the United \n     Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2139 \n     on February 22, 2014, that ``[d]emands that all parties \n     immediately cease all attacks against civilians, as well as \n     the indiscriminate employment of weapons in populated areas, \n     including shelling and aerial bombardment, such as the use of \n     barrel bombs. . .'';\n       Whereas Syria once possessed one of the most advanced \n     chemical weapons programs in the Middle East;\n       Whereas there were multiple documented cases of chemical \n     attacks committed by the Assad regime, including the \n     deployment of sarin gas in Aleppo in March and April 2013, as \n     well as the devastating sarin and conventional attack \n     committed near Damascus in August 2013 that killed more than \n     1,400 innocent civilians, including 426 children;\n       Whereas sarin is banned under the Convention on the \n     Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and \n     Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, done at \n     Paris January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, 1997 \n     (commonly known as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention'');\n       Whereas, in September 2013, the Assad regime agreed to \n     eliminate its chemical weapons stockpile by handing over all \n     of its chemical weapons to international control, providing \n     inspectors immediate and unfettered access to all suspected \n     sites, and allowing international forces to destroy the \n     entire stockpile and production facilities;\n       Whereas the September 2013 agreement mandated that Syria \n     accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention;\n       Whereas, after Syria's accession to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, there continue to be numerous documented reports \n     that the Assad regime has repeatedly attacked civilians, \n     including women and children, and armed opposition groups \n     with chlorine gas, a substance that is banned for use as a \n     weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention;\n       Whereas, on March 6, 2015, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Resolution 2209 by a vote of 14 in favor, zero \n     against, and 1 abstention condemning in the strongest terms \n     the use of chlorine as a weapon in Syria and vowing that any \n     future use would result in the imposition of Chapter VII \n     measures;\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\n       Whereas, on March 6, 2015, the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations Samantha Power stated, \n     ``Despite having acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention, \n     the Assad regime has again demonstrated its brutality by \n     turning to chlorine as another barbaric weapon in its arsenal \n     against the Syrian people. . ..
