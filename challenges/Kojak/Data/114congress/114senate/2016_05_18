Now, on another matter, Mr. President, last week, the \ntop Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said that some would like to do \n``some sort of a pretend hearing'' on the President's Supreme Court \nnomination. He went on to dismiss the idea by noting that the Senate \n``is not a pretend office.'' Apparently, he was overruled.\n  Later today, Democrats will have what he called a ``pretend \nhearing.'' Senate Democrats initially invited a witness who, at the \nbeginning of the Bush administration, wrote this: ``The Senate should \nnot act on any Supreme Court vacancies that might occur until after the \nnext presidential election.'' He also wrote that this would be a \n``responsible exercise of the Senate's constitutional power.'' \nApparently, that witness is no longer available--interesting.\n  The would-be witness is Abner Mikva, a former Democratic Congressman, \nFederal judge, and White House Counsel. He wrote these words in the \nsecond year of President George W. Bush's first term. It was not, like \nthe situation today, in the eighth year of a term-limited President.\n  Democrats certainly have a complicated history when it comes to their \nown words and the Supreme Court. They have the Schumer standard: Don't \nconsider a President's nominee 1\\1/2\\ years before the end of his final \nterm. They have the Biden rule: Don't consider a President's nominee \nbefore he has even finished his first term. Now they have the Mikva \nmandate: Don't consider a President's nominee from, basically, the \nmoment he takes office.\n  It seems the more we hear from Democrats about the Supreme Court, the \nmore we are reminded, by comparison, of how reasonable and commonsense \nthe Republican position is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2915-6"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2915-S2916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, on one final matter, Mr. President, that our \ncolleagues will discuss further a little later today, a video recently \nsurfaced that should concern all of us. It was three of President \nObama's former speechwriters laughing it up. They were reminiscing \nabout the time they apparently helped mislead the American people with \na line that would one day become PolitiFact's ``Lie of the Year'': ``If \nyou like your health care plan, you can keep it.''\n  They laughed and laughed. It was, evidently, pretty funny to them. It \nis no laughing matter, however, for the millions--millions--who have \nlost their plans. It is no laughing matter for the millions who \ncontinue to suffer under this partisan law, this partisan attack on the \nmiddle class.\n  Health care costs are now the No. 1 financial concern facing American \nfamilies, according to a recent survey--No. 1--more than concerns about \nlow wages, more even than concerns about losing a job.\n  Another survey found a clear majority of Americans disapproving of \nthis partisan law. Yet another survey found that, of Americans who said \nObamacare had impacted them, more reported it hurting rather than \nhelping them.\n  If recent headlines are anything to go by, it is no wonder. Americans \nnow face premium hikes of up to 30 percent\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nin Oregon and 37 percent in Virginia. They face premium spikes as high \nas 43 percent in Iowa and 45 percent in New Hampshire. In Tennessee, \nthe State's largest health insurer is planning additional rate hikes \nthat are even higher than the 36.3 percent implemented just this past \nJanuary.\n  Remember, this is the same law whose champions promised it would make \nhealth care more affordable for American families. But nearly half of \nall Americans reported increases in their insurance premiums, and more \nthan a third reported increases in copays and deductibles in the past 2 \nyears.\n  Consider this dad from Jackson, KY, who learned that his insurer \nwould no longer offer his current plan as a result of ObamaCare. He \nsaid that the most inexpensive replacement plan would be an 80-percent \nincrease over his current monthly premium. ``This ill-conceived health \ncare reform,'' as he put it, ``is going to be the end of good-quality \ncare for the whole nation unless it is repealed and replaced.'' That is \nfrom Jackson, KY.\n  Part of the reason insurers are seeking such dramatic premium rate \nincreases is to help cover the losses they have experienced as a result \nof the unworkable policies of ObamaCare. Some are pulling out of the \nexchanges altogether. Several States and hundreds of counties now only \nhave a single insurer to pick from in the ObamaCare exchanges--just \none, no choices.\n  That is true in parts of Kentucky, too, and it is terrible for \nconsumers. What if these sole insurers pull out of the exchanges? An \nadministration official couldn't rule out that possibility, and it \ndoesn't appear they have a serious plan to deal with it either. The \nadministration hardly ever seems to have an ObamaCare answer that \ndoesn't boil down to this: more money from taxpayers.\n  Look, this is not a law that is working. This is not a law that is \nfair. This is a partisan law that is a direct attack--a direct attack--\non the middle class.\n  The Democratic leader recently said that Americans just need to ``get \nover it''--just get over it--``and accept the fact that ObamaCare is \nhere to stay.'' ObamaCare, he says, is ``doing so much to change \nAmerica forever.'' Maybe Democrats think the middle class should just \nget over double-digit premium increases. Maybe Democrats think it is \nfunny that millions of Americans lost their plans because of ObamaCare.\n  Republicans think we should work toward better care instead. That is \nwhy we recently passed a bill to repeal ObamaCare and start over with \nreal care. ObamaCare may be changing America, but this partisan law's \nattacks on the middle class do not have to go on forever, as the \nDemocratic leader would like. We can give our country a new and better \nbeginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2915-7"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend, the Republican leader, continues \nto complain about ObamaCare. This has been the mantra of the \nRepublicans since it passed. But the true facts are these: ObamaCare \nhas reduced the number of uninsured to the lowest rate since we have \nbeen keeping records in America. The uninsured are going down, not up. \nPeople are healthier now as a result of being able to go to the doctor \nor the hospital when they are hurt or sick.\n  Now, we talk about ObamaCare in a vacuum. What was going on before \nObamacare? Insurance companies ravaged the American people. The people \nwho were fortunate enough to have health care had to be aware that at \nany given time they could have their insurance canceled. If you were \ndisabled, there was no insurance. But that isn't all. If you had a \nprior malady of some kind--if you had cancer, if you had diabetes--you \ncouldn't get insurance--but not anymore. Under ObamaCare you cannot be \ndenied insurance for any condition.\n  They used to charge women more than men--for no reason, except that \nsome statistical analysis had taken place in some dark room by a guy \nwith green eyeshades who determined that maybe, statistically, women \ncost a little more than men. They can't do that anymore.\n  I am always so stunned by this mantra: ``We have to replace it.'' \nWith what? It has been 7 years. With what? The Republicans have come up \nwith nothing.\n  So, in short, is ObamaCare perfect? Of course not. Could we improve \nit? Yes, we could. But it would be nice to have a little cooperation \nfrom the Republicans. They are unwilling to do anything other than \ncomplain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2916-2"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2916-S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again the senior Senator from Kentucky \ncomplains about the fact that the most senior member of the Senate, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Pat Leahy, is going \nto have a meeting today, and he has invited all the Judiciary Committee \nmembers to come--Democrats and Republicans. He has invited all Senators \nto come because he is going to have some witnesses testify about the \nimportance of having a Supreme Court that is full of Justices--all \nnine. So that means full.\n  Republicans won't come to that hearing, meeting. Call it whatever you \nwant. They won't be there. No, they are blocking that, obstructing that \nlike they have everything else.\n  The American judiciary is in trouble, and that is why the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee is having this meeting today. To do \nits work, the U.S. Supreme Court needs nine Justices--not eight, not \nseven, but nine. But because of Senate Republicans' refusal to consider \na senior judge on the DC Circuit--the second most influential court in \nthe land--Merrick Garland, the Court is in trouble. The Court is short-\nstaffed. The Court doesn't have enough people to do its work. People--\nwe are talking about one person who has so much control over what goes \non in the Supreme Court. But that person is not there.\n  In recent weeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked on many important \ncases and questions before it. For example, the day before yesterday, \nthe Justices punted on two more cases, remanding both to lower courts. \nThese actions were a clear indication the Court was tied 4 to 4. Due to \nthe wisdom of the people on that Court, they decided it would be \nbetter, since they could not write the decision, to send it back to the \nlower courts and see if they could help work out the problems.\n  Not having nine Justices is a serious problem. As was written \nyesterday in a New York Times editorial: ``Every day that passes \nwithout a ninth Justice undermines the Supreme Court's ability to \nfunction, and leaves millions of Americans waiting for justice or \nclarity as major legal questions are unresolved.''\n  Litigants take their cases to the Supreme Court in search of justice. \nIt often takes years to get to that Court. They seek resolution. They \nseek clarity, but because of Republicans' unprecedented obstruction, \nAmericans have gained neither. They are not getting clarity, they are \nnot getting resolution, and they are not getting justice. The problem \nis only going to worsen, and that is the sad part of it. Already, the \nstalemate has created long-term issues for our Nation's highest Court.\n  This term, eight Justices on the Court have agreed to hear only 12 \ncases its next term, which begins in October through January 2017. If \nthe Court continues to accept or, I should say, not accept cases at \nthis glacial pace, the next term will have Justices hearing fewer cases \nthan has been heard by that Court in more than seven decades, 70 years. \nIt stands to reason that Chief Justice Roberts and his colleagues are \ncalling cases according to their ability to hear and process them. A \ngridlocked Court can't accomplish the same work as a fully staffed \nCourt. It is not the Supreme Court's fault. The blame belongs to Senate \nRepublicans for their blocking Merrick Garland's nomination. For 7\\1/2\\ \nyears, Senate Republicans have blocked anything President Obama has \nproposed. Who is behind this? Rightwing organizations led by the Koch \nbrothers. They want to keep it just the way it is. They want to keep \nthis Court so it can't do its job.\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n  For 7\\1/2\\ years, Senate Republicans have blocked anything President \nObama has proposed, including now a new Supreme Court Justice. Now, by \npreventing the Court from having nine Justices, Republicans are \nbringing gridlock in the legislative branch to the judicial branch. \nPreviously, for the whole time Obama has been President, they were \nblocking what has gone on in the legislative branch. They have now \nbroadened that to deadlock the Supreme Court. This is not acceptable. \nJustice delayed, we have heard, is justice denied, and that is \ncertainly true. By bringing the Court to a standstill, Republicans are \ndenying the justice all Americans deserve.\n  There is still time for my Republican colleagues to do the right \nthing--fill the Supreme Court vacancy--but to do that they must begin \nto process Garland's nomination. His questionnaire is here. It is \nfilled out. It is done. I wonder how many Republicans have even looked \nat it. Has there been any? Shouldn't there be a hearing? The reason \nRepublicans don't want a hearing is they know that a hearing, public in \nnature, would show the American people and the world what a good man \nMerrick Garland is, what a good lawyer he was, and what a good judge he \nhas been, but they have to start processing this. Republicans seem to \nbe refusing anything dealing with him. I think they should attend the \nmeeting today on the Garland nomination organized by Judiciary \nCommittee Democrats, calling on the finest people we can find to tell \nus what is going on in the judiciary.\n  My friend the Republican leader brings up Abner Mikva. Abner Mikva \nhasn't served in Congress in 40 years. He was a lawyer for President \nClinton. We have been through quite a bit since then, but he has \nnothing else to refer to so he talks about Abner Mikva, who was going \nto come, who is not going to come. Do you think part of it can be he is \nmore than 90 years old? Republicans should attend today's hearing.\n  The Judiciary chair, Senator Grassley, should proceed with committee \nhearings. The American people deserve a full and transparent accounting \nof Merrick Garland's record and qualifications. After a hearing, of \ncourse we should move his nomination for a vote on the Senate floor. \nEvery day that passes without confirmation, without a ninth Justice to \nserve on the Supreme Court, is another lost day for the Federal \njudiciary and American justice. Republicans claim their obstruction of \nPresident Obama's Supreme Court nominee is to give the people a voice, \nbut their actions are doing just the opposite. Republicans are denying \nthe American people the justice they deserve.\n  For example, take the cases they referred back to the lower courts. \nThey have already done it and litigants have waited years to get before \nthe Supreme Court. Now, in effect, they have to start over. Republicans \nare denying the American people the justice they deserve--the justice \nwe thought was guaranteed by the Constitution. So instead of silencing \nthe Supreme Court and gridlocking our entire judicial system, \nRepublicans should give the Court the ninth Justice it desperately \nneeds.\n  Focus has been on the Supreme Court, and it should be, but \nRepublicans are doing the same thing with trial court judges. The \nFederal judiciary has many districts that have declared judicial \nemergencies. They don't have enough judges to do their work. \nRepublicans are in a state of--the only thing they know to do very well \nis to block things. We, the American people, know we need to do \nsomething about the judiciary. Republicans should do their job and give \nMerrick Garland a hearing and a vote.\n  Mr. President, my friend from South Dakota is here. I would ask the \nChair, prior to the Senator being recognized, to tell us what the \nschedule is for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2916-3"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nCongress's efforts to combat the Zika virus. Combating Zika is a public \nhealth priority, and it is important that this not be turned into a \npolitical issue. The administration and Congress need to work together \nto combat the virus by funding necessary programs, such as mosquito \neradication efforts, before the threat escalates further. Congress has \nalready acted to provide incentives for manufacturers to develop new \nmedicines to prevent or to treat Zika. We have also approved the use of \nnearly $600 million to initiate a Zika response effort, including \nresearch into vaccines and treatments and improving mosquito control, \nbecause the best way to deal with any illness is to stop people from \ngetting sick in the first place. We need to make controlling mosquitos \na priority.\n  I introduced a measure to remove burdensome permitting restrictions \non mosquito control efforts so we can immediately free up additional \nresources to keep the mosquito population in check. A vaccine to \nprevent the Zika virus isn't likely to be available until next year, at \nthe earliest, which means our primary weapon in combating Zika right \nnow is controlling mosquitoes so people don't get infected. For that \nreason, we need to prioritize mosquito control programs and provide \nimmediate regulatory relief.\n  Aggressive mosquito abatement is the most timely step we can take to \nkeep women and children safe. I am pleased my approach was included in \nthe Cornyn amendment the Senate considered yesterday. I only wish it \nhad prevailed. I am hopeful we can still work with both sides of the \naisle to get timely regulatory relief for all impacted industries in \nthe final Zika response package. I believe it is important that if we \nare going to beat this thing, we do it by eradicating mosquitoes and \nmaking it possible for those who are responsible and tasked with that \nresponsibility to be able to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2917-3"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2917-S2921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, back when the President and Senate \nDemocrats were lobbying for passage of ObamaCare, they made a number of \npromises. The one thing they promised over and over again was that the \nPresident's health care plan would lower costs.\n  ``Bringing down costs of health insurance and making it more \naffordable is job one for this health care reform.'' That is a quote \nthat was made by the then-Democratic majority whip on the floor in \nDecember of 2009. Families will save on their premiums, President Obama \npledged that same month. The Affordable Care Act, Democrats made clear, \nwas the solution to the health insurance challenges facing American \nfamilies. Well, 6 years down the road it is clear the Affordable Care \nAct was no solution at all.\n  The President promised that health care reform would reduce premiums \nby $2,500 for the average family. Instead, the average family premium \nfor employer-sponsored health insurance rose by $4,170 between 2009 and \n2015. Forty-five percent of Americans report that their health \ninsurance premium has increased over the past 2 years, and 35 percent \nreport that their copays and deductibles have increased over the same \nperiod. The President promised that Americans who liked their insurance \nplan could keep it. Instead, the President's health care law pushed \nmore than 4.7 million Americans off their health care plans.\n  Then there is the centerpiece of the President's health care law, the \nexchanges. The exchanges were supposed to offer accessible, affordable \nhealth care to those who had struggled to get insurance, but a lot of \nAmericans are finding out the health care offered on the exchanges is \nneither affordable nor accessible. Last year countless consumers around \nthe country faced massive rate hikes on their exchange plans. One \nconstituent wrote to tell me that her plan would cost $1,600 a month \nfor\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\nher, her husband, and their four children--$1,600 a month. That is more \nthan $19,000 a year. A new car would be cheaper, and all signs point to \nconsumers being set to face yet huge rate hikes again this year.\n  Investor's Business Daily recently reported that Oregon's largest \ninsurer in the individual market is seeking an average rate increase of \n29.6 percent for its exchange and nonexchange plans for 2017. \nMeanwhile, over the weekend the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported \nthat Blue Cross exchange customers in Tennessee will face a ``major \nrate increase'' that may exceed the 36.3-percent rate increase exchange \ncustomers faced this January. The Associated Press recently reported \nthat insurers are seeking rate hikes ranging from 9.4 percent to 37.1 \npercent on the exchanges in Virginia--a 37.1-percent increase.\n  Think about that. Let's say you have a family health insurance plan \nthat costs $10,000 a year. A 37.1-percent increase would add more than \n$3,700 to the cost of your plan--$3,700--for just 1 year. That is a \nsignificant amount of money, and you could easily end up facing a \nsimilar rate hike the following year.\n  I could go on and on about ObamaCare. I could read from a steady \nstream of news stories reporting on ObamaCare's many failures, from \nhuge cost increases to bankrupt co-ops, to decreased access to doctors \nand hospitals. I could talk about the ways ObamaCare has hiked \nprescription drug costs or the challenges facing businesses, thanks to \nthe Affordable Care Act's taxes and mandates. I could read stories from \nmy constituents--constituents who have had to wrestle with the \ninefficient ObamaCare bureaucracy, constituents who lost their health \nplans as a result of ObamaCare, constituents who can't afford their \nObamaCare insurance, but since I don't want to use up all my \ncolleagues' time on the floor as well as my own, I will just say this: \nThree weeks ago, on April 27, Gallup published the results of a poll on \nthe financial challenges facing American families. The headline of the \narticle was this: ``Healthcare Costs Top U.S. Families' Financial \nConcerns.'' Let me repeat that. ``Healthcare Costs Top U.S. Families' \nFinancial Concerns.''\n  If 6 years on from the passage of the Affordable Care Act health care \ncosts top the list of American families' financial concerns, then the \nAffordable Care Act has failed, and it is time to repeal it. The \nRepublican-led Senate has already passed legislation to repeal \nObamaCare, but we need a President willing to work with us or \nsignificant support from Democrats in Congress if we want a repeal to \nbecome law. I hope we will see that kind of support in the near future.\n  The Affordable Care Act has been a disaster from the beginning, and \nit is time to lift the burdens the law has placed on Americans and \nreplace this law with health care reform that will actually drive down \ncosts for American families and consumers and increase access to care. \nThat is what we should--and I hope we will--be focused on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak, as \nSenator Thune has just spoken, about the disastrous health care results \nfor patients of ObamaCare. You have to go no further than this Sunday's \nNew York Times, the Sunday Review front page. It looks like a red cross \ntilted on its side with the headline ``Sorry, We Don't Take \nObamaCare.''\n  The minority leader, Harry Reid, comes to the floor and talks about \nhow wonderful it is. The President says: ``Forcefully defend and be \nproud.'' Of what? Of ``Sorry, we don't take ObamaCare''?\n  This is the New York Times, a newspaper whose editorial board has \nsupported this health care law. They talk about the pains of the health \ncare act frustrating patients.\n  It says:\n\n       Amy Moses and her circle of self-employed small-business \n     owners were supporters of President Obama and the Affordable \n     Care Act. They bought policies on the newly created New York \n     State exchange.\n\n  We have two Democratic Senators from New York. Where are they to \nrespond to what has happened to the people of their home State as a \nresult of this law?\n  They bought insurance policies on the New York State exchange. What \nhappened? Well, when they called doctors and hospitals in Manhattan to \nschedule an appointment, they were dismayed to be turned away--not \nonce, it says, but again and again. It says ``We don't take ObamaCare'' \nis the umbrella term for the hundreds of plans offered through the \nPresident's signature health legislation.\n  This is the New York Times, about New York. It is a big city, a place \nwhere there should be plenty of doctors, plenty of opportunity.\n  Ms. Moses said:\n\n       Anyone who is on these plans knows it's a two-tiered \n     system.\n\n  Is that what the President promised the American people--a two-tiered \nsystem? She is a successful entrepreneur in a two-tiered system. We are \ntalking about a number of women in New York who are entrepreneurs and \nare very successful.\n\n       Anytime one of us needs a doctor, we send out an alert.\n\n  Is that what we are supposed to have? Anytime anybody needs a doctor, \nsend out an alert? If you have a sore throat, send out an alert. That \nis what they need to do.\n  The alert they send out among this whole group in New York says: \n``Does anyone have anyone on an exchange plan that does mammography or \ncolonoscopy [who takes our insurance]?''\n  She said, ``It's really a problem.''\n  I could go on. This is what the President of the United States and \nthe Democrats in this body, who shoved this bill down the throats of \nthe American people, have found that they have created--a plan one in \nfour Americans says has hurt them personally.\n  That is just one story in the news in one major newspaper, but it \nsays a lot about the health care law in general.\n  We just heard from Senator Thune. We know this health care law is a \nlot more expensive than the President ever promised. People all around \nthe country remember the President saying that it will drive down \nhealth care premiums by $2,500 per family if it becomes law. Remember \nthat? People all across the country remember it. It just hasn't \nhappened. Costs have gone up, copays have gone up, and deductibles have \ngone up. People have lost their plans, lost their ability to see their \ndoctor, can't go to the hospital they want, and can't get the care they \nneed.\n  Insurance companies are cutting back on which doctors people can see, \nand they are cutting back on what drugs people can take. This health \ncare law has made health care worse across the United States of \nAmerica. We know that some insurance companies are dropping States \nentirely in terms of a place to do business, so millions of Americans \nare going to lose their insurance plan again next year.\n  Do you remember what the President said? ``If you like your plan, you \ncan keep your plan.'' Well, not next year, not last year, not the year \nbefore that. Even the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies these \nissues, says that there are more than 650 counties in which families \nwill have only one choice for insurance next year.\n  I pulled up an article from the New York Times. That is not the only \nplace there has been a similar article. This is Monday's paper, May 16, \nWall Street Journal: ``Health insurers quit rural exchanges.'' They are \nabandoning rural areas all across the country--in my home State of \nWyoming, but it is also happening everywhere. It is entire States--\nAlaska, Alabama, Wyoming. There is only one choice where people can buy \nObamaCare insurance next year.\n  If you only have one choice, often you are put in a situation where \nyou can take it or leave it. Not under Barack Obama. Oh, no. You must \nbuy it. You have no choice, other than to pay an expensive penalty. \nThat is what health care looks like now under Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats and Barack Obama and the Senators on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle who voted for this monstrosity. Take it or leave it. But you \ncan't leave it because you must buy it.\n  What happens when there is no competition? What happens when the \nhealth care law adds thousands of pages of expensive mandates and costs \ncontinue to go up? Premiums have gone through the roof. These are the\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nrequested premium hikes for ObamaCare plans for next year: We have seen \n33 percent requested in Virginia; Oregon, 32 percent; Iowa, 43 percent; \nNew Hampshire, 45 percent for some families. People are finding out \nthat their insurance premiums are now higher than their mortgage \npayment.\n  What do the Democrats say about all of this? Someone brought this up \nto Hillary Clinton at a campaign event in Virginia last week. A woman \nwho owns a small business said: ``I have seen our health insurance for \nmy own family go up $500 a month in just the last two years. We went \nfrom 400-something to 900-something [a month].''\n  What did Hillary Clinton have to say about this? What was her \nresponse? She said: ``What could possibly have raised your costs . . . \nthat's what I don't understand.''\n  Is she serious? It is ObamaCare that raised her costs. Where has \nHillary Clinton been the last 6 years that she doesn't understand it? \nThis was in Virginia. This small business owner--the woman who went to \nthe townhall meeting and asked Hillary Clinton a question--may see her \nrates go up another 33 percent next year.\n  It is not just Hillary Clinton who is clueless. Harry Reid, the \nDemocratic leader in the Senate, came to the floor last month and told \nthe world that ObamaCare is ``working.'' Does Harry Reid not understand \nthat millions of American are paying more for their health insurance \nand their health care than they did before ObamaCare? Many people are \npaying for insurance, but they can't get care, as we see from the New \nYork Times story. Does Senator Reid not understand that people are \npaying more for coverage and getting less care in return?\n  Does every Senator on the Democratic side of the aisle who voted for \nObamaCare not understand how this outrageous law is hurting America and \nAmericans and the people of this great country?\n  There was a new poll that came out last month that found that only 44 \npercent of Americans approve of the health care law but 54 percent \ndisapprove of the law. I remember Senator Schumer of New York saying: \nAfter we pass it, it will get more popular. Still, 54 percent \ndisapprove. That is the highest disapproval number in the last 2 years. \nIn this poll, almost one in three Americans said that the health care \nlaw has had a negative effect on their family--their personal family; \nnot that they know somebody but in their own family. Hillary Clinton \ndoesn't seem to understand that. She said that she wants to expand \nObamaCare. She wants more regulations, more restrictions, more of the \nterrible ideas that have driven up costs for American families.\n  There was another piece of news last week that shows one more way the \nhealth care law is failing. It turns out that the Obama administration \nhas been making illegal payments--payments found by a judge to be \nillegal--to big insurance companies to help prop up this health care \nlaw. That is what the Federal court ruled last Thursday.\n  In 2014 the administration asked Congress to appropriate money to pay \ninsurance companies above and beyond the subsidies they already get \nthat the government pays for insurance premiums. It is called a cost-\nsharing subsidy. Congress--power of the purse--refused to appropriate \nthe money.\n  Do you know what the administration did? The administration panicked. \nIt knew that without more Washington spending, people would pay even \nmore out of pocket for their health care costs, and that would make \nObamaCare even more unpopular than it is today. In the panic, because \nthey knew that if that happened, people would realize how expensive the \nlaw really is and the disaster it is turning into, and people would see \nthat all the President's promises about reducing costs were nothing but \nfairy tales, the panicked Obama administration went ahead and handed \nover the money anyway without the authority of Congress. The total was \nabout $7 billion over the last 2 years. That is how much additional \ntaxpayer money the administration has given away so far to hide the \nfact that the health care law is an expensive failure.\n  The American people have had enough of this costly and collapsing \nhealth care law. They have had enough of losing their insurance, losing \ntheir doctors, losing access to the prescription drugs they need, and \npaying 20 or 30 percent more every year to get less coverage.\n  The Democrats can come to the floor and pretend that ObamaCare is \nworking. The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, don't understand what is \ngoing on. The American people know exactly what is going on. They want \nus to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with health care that actually \nworks, that has fewer restrictions, more freedom--freedom for people to \nget the coverage that works for them and their families, not what \nPresident Obama says they have to have because he believes he knows \nwhat they need better than they do.\n  We need fewer mandates that drive up the cost for everyone and more \noptions for patients to see the doctors they want and to get the \nmedicine they need. That is what the American people want, and it is \ntime for Democrats to show that they are listening to the people of \nAmerica and that they understand, because up to this point, they have \nnot been listening and they do not understand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nwords. Obviously he is an expert on health care. He is somebody who \nspent his entire life treating patients and working to improve the \nhealth care of others in Wyoming and beyond. His expertise on this \nissue is particularly important as we debate the real-life \nramifications of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act--the so-called \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about the broken promise of \nObamaCare and the negative impacts this poorly planned law has had on \nmy State of Colorado. In essence, what ObamaCare did was create a pay-\nto-play scheme--mandates and dictates of a law where you will pay \nhigher premiums to abide by the law.\n  As ObamaCare continues on a downward trajectory, Americans are the \nones who are bearing the brunt of its failures, particularly those who \nare living in rural America, in rural Colorado.\n  Month after month, headline after headline, Americans are no longer \nsurprised when they hear of another ObamaCare disaster as they continue \nto foot the ever-increasing bill. There are fewer choices, less \ncompetition, and higher costs.\n  ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.'' Do you \nremember those famous words? The President assured Americans time and \ntime again not to worry. ``If you like your health care plan, you can \nkeep it.'' He said it countless times. It was echoed by almost every \nMember in this body who supported ObamaCare.\n  Coloradans and millions of Americans around the country learned that \nthis promise was far from the truth. In late 2013, roughly 335,000 \nsmall-group and individual policies in Colorado were canceled due to \nthe requirements of ObamaCare, 335,000 Coloradans who witnessed through \na letter in their mailbox--including a letter I received in my mailbox \ncanceling my insurance because of ObamaCare. Those 335,000 people \nrealized that ``if you like your plan, you can keep your plan'' was \nsimply not true.\n  The cancelations in 2013 were just the very beginning. In 2014, a \ncouple months later, the Colorado Division of Insurance canceled \nanother 249,000 plans because these plans didn't meet the requirements \nof ObamaCare. When we talk about these plans being canceled because \nthey didn't meet the requirements of ObamaCare, some people on the \nleft, those who supported ObamaCare, would argue they must have been \nbad plans, bad insurance, or bad policies. But that presumes that the \ngovernment knows what is best for everyone involved, that the \ngovernment has a better idea of what their insurance ought to be, and \nthat the government should take care of and think for people who chose \nthese plans themselves individually. But 249,000 people, on top of the \n335,000 people in January of 2014, had their insurance canceled.\n\n  Again, in 2015 the story continued with an additional 190,000 plans \non the individual and small group markets being canceled. In total, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service,\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nover 750,000 health insurance plans in Colorado were canceled between \n2013 and 2015. Three-quarters of a million people who were promised \nthat ``if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your plan'' \nhad their plans canceled under the broken promise of ObamaCare. That is \nstill not the end of it for Coloradans because Coloradans are still \nreceiving cancellation notices. Within the last 2 months, two of the \nNation's largest insurers, UnitedHealthcare and Humana, announced their \nintent to exit the individual marketplace. UnitedHealth Group's CEO \ncited that the marketplaces were a risky investment and that \nUnitedHealth could not serve these exchanges on an ``effective and \nsustained basis.'' This decision will impact roughly 20,000 more \nColoradans, and beneficiaries of these plans can expect cancellation \nnotices in July.\n  The disappointment and frustration over a canceled plan that your \nfamily once enjoyed is made worse by the rising costs of the remaining \nplans, and that is what many Americans are faced with today. After \nlosing 750,000 of them in Colorado--losing the health insurance plans \nthey were promised they could keep--they looked at the second promise \nmade under ObamaCare--that this will lower the cost of health care. Now \nthey are met with the second broken promise--the broken promise of \ncost. They were told they would see reduced costs with ObamaCare. Yet \nthe Colorado Division of Insurance found that individual insurance \npremiums for 2016 on the Western Slope of Colorado rose by an average \nof 25.8 percent. The Western Slope of Colorado had a nearly 26-percent \nrate increase. When people think of Colorado, that is often the part of \nColorado they think of most. Denver is on the Front Range. The \nmountains have the ski communities. The rural communities have farming \nand agriculture. The mining communities and the oil and gas industries \nare on the Western Slope. These rural areas watched their health \ninsurance premiums increase by 26 percent--premiums that were promised \nwould be going down.\n  A woman who lives on the Western Slope was recently interviewed by \nthe Denver Post. She said she saw her premium cost alone rise from $300 \nper month to $1,828 per month, or nearly $22,000 a year in increased \ncosts. She says:\n\n       It's actually like another mortgage payment. I have friends \n     who are uninsured right now because they can't afford it. \n     Insurance is hard up here.\n\n  The Western Slope of Colorado had two promises broken--the promise \nthat if you liked your health care, you could keep it and that this \nwould lower the cost of your health care. They had an increase of \nnearly 26 percent. If you live on the Western Slope of Colorado, you \nsaw your increase go from a premium of $300 a month to over $1,800 per \nmonth--a $22,000 a year increase. This is incredible.\n  In 2014, a study found that nearly 150,000 Coloradans saw their \ninsurance become 77 percent more expensive. Where is the promise of \nObamaCare? Where are the people who supported the Affordable Care Act \ntoday defending this law, defending the promise, or explaining how \nthese promises weren't broken? They are not here because they can't \nexplain it. They know the promise was broken. They know that 750,000 \npeople had their promises broken. In Colorado alone, there are people \nfacing 26-percent and 77-percent increases. As we approach the new \nrates for 2017, it appears there will be no limit to the additional \ncosts that Coloradans will have to bear as a result of this poorly \nconceived partisan law.\n  Marilyn Tavenner, president and CEO of America's Health Insurance \nPlans, or AHIP, served as a key Obama administration health official as \nAdministrator of CMS. She has testified multiple times before \ncommittees of the House and Senate and has made warnings that the \nAffordable Care Act premium increases are coming. She predicted that \nthe increases for open enrollment in 2017 will be higher than ever \nbefore. This is coming from a former administration official who helped \nrun ObamaCare and was in the room during the discussions and the \ncrafting of policies of ObamaCare.\n  In Colorado, insurers submitted their initial premium bids last \nFriday, May 13. We will soon know the rates that have been approved by \nthe Colorado Department of Insurance in late September or early \nOctober, but it looks like Coloradans are in for yet another rude \nawakening. The people in Colorado have already had their health \ninsurance plans canceled, and more are losing their policies in July of \nthis year and trying to figure out how to make ends meet. If they are \nin a situation like the one I spoke of before--the example I used \nbefore--this person is going to have to figure out over the next year \nhow they are going to basically create a $22,000 a year payment they \ndidn't face before.\n  I was speaking to an executive with an insurance company who said \nthey believe the rates they will be submitting for increases this year \nto their department of insurance commissioner will be between 60 and 70 \npercent. That is a 60- and 70-percent insurance rate increase under \nObamaCare for the 2017 cycle. Premiums are expected to rise and many \nparts of the country are going to experience double-digit rate hikes. \nPlans are getting canceled, plans are getting more expensive, yet the \nObamaCare mandates continue.\n  I believe what we need in this country is greater competition and \ngreater choice. That is what President Obama promised in the \nmarketplace, but data shows that because of unbearable bureaucratic \nhurdles, competition has actually decreased.\n  On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal published an article titled \n``Insurance Options Dwindle in Some Rural Regions.'' I live in a very \nrural part of Colorado, on the Eastern Plains, as opposed to the \nWestern Slope, which we spoke of before. I live in a town of about \n3,000 people. The nearest big town is 60 miles away, and that town has \n9,000 people. The article in the Wall Street Journal explains how rural \nareas have experienced the greatest decline in competition and how many \nrural counties will only have one insurance plan to choose from. I \nthink most people understand that rural areas aren't exactly the \nwealthiest areas in the Nation. There are pockets of \nwealth, absolutely, as there are in most places, but by and large our \nrural communities represent some of the poorest and least economically \ndriven counties in the country.\n\n  A Kaiser Family Foundation study found that over 650 counties across \nthis country will have only 1 insurer on the exchanges to choose from \nduring the open enrollment in 2017. This is a number which is up by 225 \ncounties from 2016. Let me say that again. There are 650 counties \nacross this country that will only have 1 choice when it comes to open \nenrollment. They will only have one plan to choose from under \nObamaCare. This is the plan for competition that the Affordable Care \nAct was supposed to address. But instead of adding more insurers to the \nmarketplace, it actually resulted in fewer insurers in the marketplace. \nWe will see 225 additional counties down to 1 choice in 2017. These 650 \ncounties are 70 percent rural, and these rural areas are fearful that \nthe dwindling competition will create a monopoly and costs will \ncontinue to rise.\n  The President also insisted that the competition would increase \nthrough consumer-run co-ops. Over 80,000 Coloradans felt the impact of \nthis broken promise when Colorado HealthOP was declared to be insolvent \nby the Colorado insurance commissioner and expeditiously liquidated.\n  To date, 12 of the 23 co-ops created by ObamaCare have been shut \ndown. That is an additional 80,000 people in Colorado who had their \ninsurance policies canceled because ObamaCare created a system that \nallowed insurance co-ops and companies to bank on a bailout. They were \nable to bank on a bailout and use that to create some aura of economic \nfeasibility on their balance sheets. When the government couldn't \nprovide any bailouts--because the government shouldn't be in the \nbusiness of bailouts--the ObamaCare promises were shown for what they \ntruly were--poor policy. Collectively the failed co-ops were loaned \nover $1 billion in taxpayer money to help get them off the ground. Now, \nwith these failures, the taxpayers will never get their money paid back \nand tens of thousands of people lost their insurance.\n  Today, this Congress has shown a path forward. With each passing dis-\naster of ObamaCare, it continues to become clearer how much of a \nfailure this law is. Americans continue to demand\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nreal health care reform that will increase competition, reduce costs, \nand expand access to lifesaving care that improves the quality of their \nlives and, most importantly, will provide predictability and \nsustainability in the marketplace.\n  This crisis demands real leadership, and I continue to remain \ncommitted to working with my colleagues on free-market solutions that \nwill bring about real change that will actually uphold the promises \nthat were made.\n  In Colorado, I heard from countless individuals who have been \ndisplaced from their plans, and it is time for Congress to stand up as \nwell.\n  The Denver Post article that I referred to about the broken health \ncare system in Colorado's Western Slope begins with a statement from \nTerri Newland of Glenwood Springs, CO. This is the headline: ``Colorado \nmountain residents struggle to pay for health insurance.'' The story \nstarts like this: ``The new era of affordable health care bypassed \nTerri Newland.''\n  Millions of Americans have seen the Affordable Care Act's era of \naffordable health care bypass them, and this body's responsibility for \nthat law can only be made up by repealing the law and putting in its \nplace a bill that actually increases the quality of care and decreases \nthe cost of care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2917-4"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2921-S2922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNITED STATES-CUBA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since December of 2014, when the United \nStates and Cuba ended 54 years of diplomatic isolation that had \naccomplished nothing good for the people of Cuba or the United States, \nthere has been an explosion of engagement between our two countries. \nThe number of U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba has skyrocketed. Talks \nbetween both governments resulted in agreements to resume direct \nairline, ocean ferry, and mail service. There is expanded cooperation \nin a wide range of bilateral and regional issues. These are encouraging \nsteps, but there is a long road ahead.\n  For more than half a century, whatever problems there were in Cuba \nthe Cuban Government could blame on the United States because of our \nembargo. Some Members of the House and Senate have expressed \ndisappointment, and criticized President Obama's opening to Cuba \nbecause the restoration of diplomatic relations has not quickly brought \nabout dramatic changes in Cuba's repressive political system and did \nnot reverse 54 years of history in 54 days.\n  Well, these Members of Congress are either naive or simply prefer to \nignore the positive changes that are occurring and choose to ignore or \ndismiss the views of the overwhelming majority of Cubans and Americans \nwho support the restoration of relations. They continue to defend a \ndiscredited policy of isolation that through all those decades, and \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, failed to achieve any of its \nobjectives.\n  As President Obama said, if you try something for 50 years and it \ndoesn't work, it is time to try something else. In the past 15 months, \nalthough the naysayers will not publicly admit it, the Cuban people \nhave a sense of hope about the future that has not existed since the \ntime of the 1959 revolution. I know. I have seen and heard it on my \ntrips there.\n  It is also important to recognize that the majority of Cubans alive \ntoday were born after the revolution. And just as Cuba's population has \nchanged, so the world has changed.\n  Overwhelmingly, Cuba's younger generation has experienced enough of a \npaternalistic, Communist dictatorship and economic stagnation to know \nthat is not what they want. It is no surprise that their reaction to \nPresident Obama's extraordinary speech in Havana was warmly and \nenthusiastically received by them, while several top Cuban officials, \nsensing the inspiring impact of the President's words, felt compelled \nto criticize our President. I was there for that visit. I saw the \nreaction of the Cuban people.\n  The raising of the American flag in Havana last August symbolized the \nbeginning of a new era in U.S.-Cuban relations, but change was \nhappening in Cuba well before then, and it is going to continue at its \nown pace. Ultimately, the Cuban people--not the United States--will \ndetermine that pace and what a post-Castro Cuba will look like.\n  My wife Marcelle and I stood there at our Embassy as the flag went \nup, and we heard the cheers of the Cuban people standing just outside \nthe gates of the Embassy.\n  We can contribute to the process of change in positive ways. One way \nis through student exchanges. Last month, Vermont students from \nBurlington, Essex, Shelburne, and Bristol traveled to Cuba to \nparticipate in a week of Little League baseball games and cultural \nexchange. Marcelle and I went to Burlington to see them off. I cannot \nbegin to describe thrill in their faces, the excitement they felt. We \ngave them an American flag to take with them. The Vermonters didn't \nspeak much Spanish, and the Cubans spoke almost no English, but it \ndidn't really matter. They had translators, and the game of baseball is \na language across cultures.\n  Here is a picture of the Vermonters with the Cuban ball players \nholding the American flag that we gave them, the Cuban flag, and a \nVermont flag. This was taken in Cuba. I love to take photographs. I \nwish I had been there to take that one. We know a picture is worth a \nthousand words. They show how just a few days of competing on a \nbaseball diamond can help bridge a half-century divide between two \ncountries and cultures. Anybody who has children--or grandchildren--who \nplay baseball or Little League ball recognizes these smiles. We know \nwhat it means. They don't speak the same language, but they speak one \nlanguage, which is the game of baseball.\n  The Vermonters voiced high praise for the Cuban players who won all \nthe games, except the all-star game at the end when they shared players \nand were evenly matched.\n  But winning isn't everything. As the Vermont players recounted after \nreturning home, it was not only a fun week of baseball, but one of the \nmost rewarding parts of the trip was the time spent after the game \ngetting to know the Cuban players, getting to know their families, and \nlearning about life in Cuba.\n  This is actually the second baseball exchange involving Vermont and \nCuban Little Leaguers, the first being in 2008 when a group from \nVermont and New Hampshire played a series of games on the outskirts of \nHavana. One of those players said the team went to Cuba just to have \nfun: ``We are not here to win. If they hear about us, maybe other teams \nwill want to do this or maybe even get a Cuban team to the United \nStates to play.''\n  Lisa Brighenti in my office took this photograph. I think it says it \nall. You can't see their faces, but we know one is Cuban and one is \nAmerican. These are kids playing a Little League game. And think of \nwhat this picture says to all of us.\n  Children don't care about the politics. They don't even care about \nthe differences in language. They just care about the things that unite \nthem.\n  I remember speaking with President Obama shortly after he became \nPresident and saying we had to change our policy toward Cuba. I told \nhim there would be a memo saying he should hold tight, the Castros will \nbe gone any day. I pointed out that same memo was sent to President \nEisenhower and President Kennedy and President Johnson and President \nNixon, and he said: I get your point.\n  Nothing changed during more than half a century when we tried to \nisolate Cuba. Now I think change will come.\n  Our governments remain far apart on key issues. A few Members of \nCongress continue to stubbornly obstruct efforts to end the embargo, \nbut as every poll has shown in this country the American people--like \nthese young Vermont athletes--are showing us a way forward by breaking \ndown barriers on their own.\n  I am so proud of these young Vermonters. They know. They know what \nthe future looks like. As for the rest of us, let's step toward the \nfuture with them.\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thought it would be useful for our \ncolleagues if I gave a brief update on where we are. First of all, I \nthink it is important to know that more than 70 Senators had input into \nthe Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development and Related Agencies \nfunding bill. I am sure if you added the number of Senators who weighed \nin on the VA-Military Construction bill, the number is even higher.\n  We worked very hard in the subcommittee process and the full \ncommittee process to incorporate suggestions from many of our \ncolleagues to produce a bipartisan bill. The ranking member, my friend \nand colleague Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, has been a tremendous \nleader in this effort. We have worked in a very transparent and \ncollaborative manner to bring us where we are today.\n  Since we started the debate on this bill, we have had 17 amendments \nthat have been adopted by unanimous consent on the two divisions of the \nbill. That has required a great deal of work, but I think it shows the \ngood faith of both of the managers of the bill and the sponsors of \nthese amendments that we were able to work together, compromise, \nnegotiate, and get them adopted in three separate packages.\n  We are continuing that process. More and more amendments have been \nfiled, and we are continuing to see how we can best accommodate the \nconcerns that have been raised by our colleagues while keeping the \nessential principles of this bill and the desire to make sure we keep \non track with the appropriations process.\n  I believe it is a great credit to the Senate, to the leaders, and to \nSenator Mitch McConnell, who has made as a goal that we would report \nall of the appropriations bills, bring them to the floor, one by one, \nfor full and open debate, the way it should be, and that we get our \nwork done so we avoid the situation of either having a series of \ncontinuing resolutions--which lock in last year's priorities and lead \nto wasteful spending, which is not a good solution and ends up costing \nus more because agencies can't plan, they can't do their contracting \nactivity--or having the other unfortunate outcome of bundling all 12 of \nthe appropriations bills into one huge omnibus bill that is thousands \nof pages long and is very difficult for Members to know exactly what is \nin the bill.\n  That is not a good way to legislate. It is not in keeping with our \nresponsibilities. I am proud the Appropriations Committee in this \nChamber is doing its job and that the Republican leader set as the goal \nthat we are starting the appropriations process earlier than ever \nbefore. The Energy and Water appropriations bill was passed earlier \nthan any appropriations bill in literally decades. I would note that \nwould not be possible without the cooperation we have had from our \nDemocratic colleagues on the committee. We have worked as teams. That \nis the way the process should work. I could not have a better partner \nin that regard than Senator Jack Reed.\n  We also had a very vigorous debate yesterday on the funding that is \nnecessary to combat the very serious threat posed by the Zika virus. We \nknow this virus causes very severe birth defects, in some cases, and \nhas been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis \nand even death. So this is a serious public health threat.\n  A couple of weeks ago, Senator Johnny Isakson and I went to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA. We were \nbriefed on the threat posed by Zika, which is carried by a mosquito \nthat is known as the cockroach in the mosquito world because it is so \ndifficult to get rid of. It can reproduce in water in a container that \nis size of a bottle cap. We know Zika has already become an epidemic in \nPuerto Rico and that there are confirmed cases in nearly every State in \nthe Union. That is because, even if you live in a far Northern State \nwhere the type of mosquito that causes Zika is not present, such as the \nState represented by the Presiding Officer, Zika is still a threat. \nPeople travel. We know it can be transmitted through sexual contact. \nThat is why we are seeing Zika showing up in virtually every State. We \nneed to get ahead of this epidemic. That is why we had three different \napproaches offered yesterday on the Senate floor. Cloture was \nsuccessfully invoked on a bipartisan proposal offered by Senators Blunt \nand Murray that provides more than $1 billion to counter effectively \nthe threat of Zika.\n  The last thing we want is not to have acted against this serious \npublic health threat and find that pregnant women, who are especially \nat risk, are going to be infected and, in some cases, have children who \nwill have a lifetime of serious disabilities as a result of the impact \nof Zika. We are hearing more and more about the dangers of the Zika \nvirus every day.\n  I have great confidence in the CDC, which is the major interface with \nour local and State public health agencies, to do an excellent job on \nprevention and education of providers and the public. They are also \nworking on diagnostic tests so we can have a more rapid response to \nZika. The National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine which \nwe hope will be available in another year, but in the meantime this \ntruly is a public health emergency.\n  I believe the Senate deserves great credit for putting the Zika \nsupplemental on our bill and providing adequate funding to do the job, \nto do the job that is necessary to counter this very serious threat.\n  We will have to proceed to a vote on the underlying Blunt-Murray \namendment now that we have invoked cloture by 68 votes. I would note \nalso that there is a 1 p.m. deadline today on filing first-degree \namendments to the substitute bill. I also anticipate that this \nafternoon we will have a debate on Senator Lee's amendment, which has \nto do with a rule the Department of\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nHousing and Urban Development has issued to implement provisions of the \nlandmark 1968 Fair Housing Act.\n  In addition, Senator Reed and Senator Cochran and I have offered an \nalternative amendment. At some point, we will have votes related both \nto the Collins-Reed-Cochran amendment and the Lee amendment. That is \ngoing to be a very important debate this afternoon on a very important \npolicy that I believe helps to further the goals of the 1968 civil \nrights-era Fair Housing Act. That will be an important debate on this \nbill.\n  In the meantime, we are continuing to work with our colleagues on \nother amendments, as the Presiding Officer is well aware. I believe we \nare continuing to make progress. I thank my colleagues for coming to \nthe floor, for working with us. That is the update I wanted to give my \ncolleagues at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                         Arkansans of the Week\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I would like to honor all Arkansas law \nenforcement officers as this week's Arkansans of the Week. This week \nmarks the 54th National Police Week. On Sunday, we marked National \nPeace Officers Memorial Day, a day set aside by President Kennedy in \n1962 to honor those law enforcement officers who lost their lives in \nthe line of duty.\n  Arkansas has over 7,000 law enforcement officers who protect our \nState every day. These men and women willingly put themselves in harm's \nway to ensure the safety of our residents, and maintain order in our \nState. National Police Week is also a time to remember and honor the \nnearly 300 Arkansans who have lost their lives in the line of duty as \nlaw enforcement officers. Their service and sacrifice is not forgotten, \nand Arkansas is safer because of their service.\n  There are many different types of law enforcement officers, but each \nplays an important and distinct role in our safety. There are officers, \nsuch as Chris Bunch of the Paragould Police Department, who protect \nArkansas' students as a school resource officer, officers such as Jeff \nPrescott and Sergeant Greg Herron, who are retiring from the Rison \nPolice Department after 30 and 20 years of service, respectively, and \nCorporal Kristi Bennett of the Texarkana Police Department, who serves \nas the public information and education officer. Kristi recently \nreceived the Silent Wilbur Award, which is given to an officer who \nshows leadership and works to motivate and move their community \nforward.\n\n  These are just a few of the long list of Arkansas law enforcement \nofficers who serve our State, but there are many more where those names \ncome from.\n  I know I join all Arkansans in extending our sincere thanks and \nappreciation to all Arkansas law enforcement officers, not only this \nweek but every week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are all too familiar with the famous \npromises President Obama made to sell the American people on his \nObamaCare proposal, and yes, I said, ``sell.''\n  We now know from White House revelations made by former Members who \nwork for the President that the White House has been actively engaged \nin selling their program, selling their proposals to the American \npeople through some admittedly sophisticated ways in using social media \nto achieve a goal. Just recently, White House National Security Advisor \nBen Rhodes did an interview and discussed openly how the White House \nmanipulated the media and the American people to sell the \nadministration's Iranian nuclear agreement.\n  With all the authority given to an American President, President \nObama made this statement to sell ObamaCare to the American people--and \nI quote: ``No matter how we reform health care,'' the President said, \n``We will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your \ndoctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your \nhealth care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, \nperiod.''\n  Why did the President add ``period'' to that statement? The \nstatements are clear. If you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If \nyou like your health care plan, you keep your health care plan. When \nyou add ``period,'' it basically says: Take my word for it. Count on \nit. It is a done deal. I am telling you, the American people, I am \nmaking you a promise--period. You can take this one to the bank.\n  I am not often a reader of the New York Times, but a recent headline \nin the paper caught my attention: ``Sorry, We Don't Take Obamacare.'' \nThe article discusses the growing number of doctors and hospitals who \nare no longer accepting patients who are covered by ObamaCare insurance \nplans. So much for ``If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep \nyour doctor, period.'' So much for that promise.\n  It is not just medical professionals who are saying no to ObamaCare. \nThe largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, recently announced it \nwill stop selling individual ObamaCare plans in Indiana next year \nbecause such plans simply are not profitable. It is pretty hard to run \na business if you are not making a profit. If you are losing money, you \ncan't pay the employees. You can't produce your product. \nUnitedHealthcare has said: We have lost so much money under this \nObamaCare mandate that we are going to stop selling individual plans.\n  According to the Indianapolis Business Journal:\n\n       In April, UnitedHealth said it would drop out of all but a \n     ``handful'' of state exchanges where it sells individual \n     Obamacare plans. It had said the exchange market was smaller \n     and riskier than it had expected.\n\n  I think I heard a lot of the Republican Members on the floor \nbasically saying what has been written and endorsed and imposed on the \nAmerican people is something that simply doesn't make economic sense. \nThere are going to be insurance companies that simply are not going to \nbe able to not only survive on this basis but will not make any profit \nwhatsoever. Obviously, with the case of UnitedHealthcare, they are \ndropping this because they simply cannot expose themselves to this kind \nof risk. It is said that they will lose $650 million on the plans this \nyear alone, and UnitedHealthcare sold coverage in 34 States on the \nObamaCare exchanges.\n  The UnitedHealthcare situation is not unique. According to the \nIndiana Business Journal, ``Roughly half of the health insurers selling \nplans on the Obamacare exchange in Indiana lost money on the business \nlast year.''\n  So much for the President's promise: ``If you like your health care \nplan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.'' So much \nfor the President's promise.\n  Decreased access to providers is just one of many problems with \nObamaCare. Another major problem is the rising cost of coverage for \nthose who are on this plan. Oh, yes, there were other promises made by \nthe President here also. You may recall the President promised that the \nannual health care costs would be cut by $2,500 per family if ObamaCare \nwere enacted. As recently as 2012, we were told by the President that \nthe health insurance premiums paid by small businesses and individuals \nwill go down because of ObamaCare--another promise to the American \npeople: Don't worry, folks. . . . Your costs are going to go down, not \nup.\n  Despite that promise that ObamaCare will cut costs and make coverage \nmore affordable for families and small businesses, many Americans are \nexperiencing higher premiums or paying outrageous deductibles when they \npurchase coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  I have been on this floor documenting literally hundreds, if not \nthousands, of inputs to my office through phone calls, emails, and so \nforth, saying: Wait a minute. I just got a notice from my insurance \ncompany that my deductible is skyrocketing from $1,000 to $5,000 or to \n$7,500 or $9,000. I can't afford this kind of stuff. I thought we were \npromised this wouldn't happen. It is not just the deductibles, it is \nthe copays.\n  All of a sudden, I walk in and a doctor's office says: Wait a second. \nYou have to put down the cash copay here. My copays have just gone \nthrough the roof.\n  Premium increases have dramatically increased. The average premium\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nfor benchmark silver plans in the Federal exchange, the ObamaCare \nexchange, is rising by 7.5 percent this year.\n  In Indiana, premiums for policies on the ObamaCare marketplace have \ngone up by an average of 14.4 percent per year since ObamaCare was \nimplemented, a total increase. Get this. We have had a total increase \nin premiums under ObamaCare in Indiana totaling 71.5 percent.\n  Tell the American people: You have my word, period. This isn't going \nto happen.\n  It happens, and what do we hear? What is this rhetoric we hear coming \nout of the White House? This is one of the most wonderful things that \nhas ever happened.\n  In the campaign--I mean, those running for office from the \nPresident's party are simply saying: You have to elect us to preserve \nthis wonderful ObamaCare health plan.\n  Is it any wonder the American people are turning out in record \nnumbers to vote against this kind of thing?\n  These are just a few of the many broken promises and the many \nproblems with the ObamaCare law. There are many other things I could \nget into, such as the failure of many State-run exchanges. Some States \nonly have one exchange or no exchanges left. The rollout of the plan--\nwhich cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of hard-earned tax \ndollars because this rollout was so botched nobody could get into the \ncomputers or even on the phone--the thing was rushed to meet a \ndeadline, and they weren't prepared. It was hundreds of millions of \ndollars just to get it on board so people could begin to ask questions \nas to what they were mandated they had to do. So from increasing \npremiums and increased health care costs to failures to keep your \ndoctor, to reduced access to doctors and hospitals, the bottom line is \nObamaCare is not working for the American people.\n  Rather than making health care more affordable and successful, \nObamaCare has actually driven up health care costs and a decreased \nchoice of doctors for too many Americans and too many American \nbusinesses. It is long past time for repeal of the President's \ndisastrous health care law. We need to replace it with more effective \nand clearly patient-centered solutions.\n  Despite numerous attempts by Republicans to repeal this fatally \nflawed legislation, all efforts have been rejected by the President and \nthe White House, but we are approaching the time when the American \npeople can express their response to these broken promises this \nadministration has made in relation to ObamaCare.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak once again about the rising \ncost of health care in the United States.\n  It has been a few months since I came to the floor to comment on the \nstate of our health care system. Sadly, over that time period, we have \nseen little, if anything, in the way of good news. Indeed, while the \nUnited States has some of the best health care law in the world, recent \nheadlines point to serious problems with how that system is working.\n  A little over 6 years ago, the Democrats on both sides of the Capitol \nand on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue forced the so-called Affordable \nCare Act on the American people without any Republican votes or any \nserious attempt to get bipartisan consensus. The result was an attempt \nat overhaul of roughly one-sixth of the American economy crafted with \nthe input and support of only one political party.\n  As I have said before, given its size and scope, the passage and \nsigning of ObamaCare was probably the largest exercise of pure \npartnership in our Nation's history. Quite frankly, our country hasn't \nbeen the same since.\n  At the time the law was passed, Republicans made a number of \npredictions about the negative impact this law would have for people \nbuying health insurance and for our economy overall. Six years later, \nmany of those predictions have already come to pass, with many more on \nthe way.\n  Still, looking back on it, I think we may have undersold our case at \nthe time. I don't think any of us could have predicted just how \ndetrimental the law would be, not only for the United States but on our \nNation's public discourse and our government institutions. As a result \nof ObamaCare, the divide between Republicans and Democrats has gotten \ndeeper, voters have become more cynical and distrusting of our \ngovernment and our leaders, and the government itself has expanded its \npowers well beyond the authority granted in the statute.\n  At the time the law was passed, many of us issued warnings of what \nwas to come, though much of that seemed to have been drowned out by the \nsounds of celebration emanating from the Capitol and the White House.\n  To quote some of my friends on the other side, passage of this law \nwas a ``big bleeping deal'' because once the law was passed, the \nAmerican people would finally get a chance to see what was in it. In \nthe midst of all that self-adulation, many promises were made about \nwhat the law would do for individuals and families throughout the \nUnited States of America.\n  Chief among those many promises was a claim that as a result of in \nlaw, the cost of health care for the average American family would go \ndown. That is what the American people were told in 2010. In 2016, the \nlaw has been implemented and in effect for 3 years. Despite those many \npromises, average health insurance premiums have gone up every single \nyear. As insurers begin to make decisions about rates and availability \nfor the 2017 plan year, we are looking at significantly higher \npremiums, double-digit increases in some places, for the fourth \nstraight year.\n  Reports about these premium increases seem to be coming in on a daily \nbasis. For example, in Virginia we know that among the five largest \ncarriers in the State, premiums could go up anywhere from 9 percent to \n37 percent, with a likely average of around 18 percent.\n  In Iowa, tens of thousands of people who buy their insurance from one \nmajor carrier will likely see increases in the neighborhood of 40 \npercent. In Oregon, the State's largest insurer in the individual \nmarket has requested a premium increase of nearly 30 percent. That \nnumber, 30 percent, is similar to the rate hikes requested by some of \nthe largest insurers in Maryland as well.\n  I could go on and on. I am not just cherry-picking States, this is a \ntrend. Unfortunately, it is having a real-world impact. People are \nconcerned, and they have every right to be. According to a Gallup poll \na few weeks back, health care costs are the No. 1 financial concern for \nfamilies in the United States. People are more concerned about health \ncare costs than they are about low wages, housing, education, or even \ndebt. As premiums go up, I can imagine that the number of families \nconcerned about health care costs will continue to go up as well.\n\n  In addition to higher premiums for 2017, we are also hearing many \ninsurers will be opting to drop out of the exchange markets. For \nexample, one of the country's largest insurers has, so far, decided to \npull out of more than two dozen State exchanges due to mounting losses. \nThis is the same company that currently offers plans in 34 different \nStates but has said it will continue to do so only in a small number of \nStates going forward.\n  In Utah, we recently saw the closing of an ObamaCare co-op that \ncovered roughly 45,000 people, all of whom had to find health insurance \nat the beginning of this year. Indeed, 12 of the 23 co-ops around the \ncountry have already closed, further reducing the number of health \ninsurance options available to people throughout the country.\n  The Obama administration is trying to downplay these reports and \nconvince people that a smaller number of insurers in various markets \nwill not be a problem. But the impact should be obvious: When an \ninsurer--let alone many insurers--drops out of a market, the patients \nand consumers in that market are left with fewer choices. And in any \nmarket, for any product, when consumers have reduced options, it \ngenerally leads to both lower quality and higher prices. That is \ndefinitely true in the health insurance market.\n  The question many are asking is, Why is this happening? Why are so \nmany insurers raising premiums or choosing not to participate in the \nObamaCare exchanges? The answer is relatively simple: ObamaCare is not \nworking and can't work the way it was designed.\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\n  I think it would be helpful at this point to briefly review its \ntimeline. From the time the law was first drafted, the Affordable Care \nAct included a number of insurance coverage mandates designed to \ndictate what insurance companies had to offer and what coverage \npatients would have to buy. Of course, imposing those kinds of \nrequirements was bound to increase the cost of insurance across the \nboard.\n  However, if you will recall, during the congressional debate over the \nlaw, the President and his supporters repeatedly claimed that because \nthe law was going to require everyone to have health insurance, more \nyoung and healthy patients would be coerced into the insurance risk \npools. According to their arguments, this shift in the market would \nmore than compensate for the costs associated with the new insurance \ncoverage mandates. In short, they claimed they could expand coverage \nrequirements and keep premiums from going up.\n  Now, fast forward to 2013, which is when the exchanges went online. \nAt that time, insurers entered the exchanges and set premium rates, \npresumably assuming the law would work as promised. As it turns out, \nthat assumption was ill informed in many cases, and insurance companies \nacross the board found they had priced their premiums too low. The \nexpansion of younger, healthier, less risky market participants never \ncame and, as a result, the industry suffered huge losses.\n  According to a report released last month by the Mercatus Center, in \n2014 alone, insurers nationwide suffered more than $2 billion in losses \nfor plans sold on the exchanges. This happened despite subsidies they \nreceived from the government to mitigate the risk of covering a mostly \nunknown population.\n  As we fast forward once again to the present day, we see that this \nsituation has not corrected itself over the first 3 plan years under \nObamaCare. In fact, it has only gotten worse. Premiums are going up, \nenrollment is lagging far behind the initial rosy estimates, and \nmillions of the younger, healthier population of insured people the \nsystem needs to properly function are either opting to pay the fines \nfor going without insurance, going undetected because they do not file \ntax returns, or staying on their parents insurance for as long as \nlegally possible.\n  A recent Blue Cross Blue Shield report compared three separate groups \namong the carrier's membership. These groups were, No. 1, individual \nmembers newly enrolled in the ObamaCare exchanges; No. 2, members who \nhad individual plans prior to the passage of ObamaCare; and No. 3, \nmembers currently enrolled in Blue Cross employer plans. According to \nthe study, the people newly enrolled in insurance under ObamaCare are \nsignificantly less healthy and require significantly more services than \nthe other two groups. The cost of care among that group is, not \nsurprisingly, significantly more expensive.\n  That is remarkable. If we assume what is happening in this study is \nin any way reflective of what is happening nationwide, not only did the \nAffordable Care Act fail to create more favorable risk pools for \ninsurers and patients sharing the costs, but the risk pools are, \noverall, more risky now than they were before.\n  While a number of complicated factors have likely contributed to this \noutcome, the major reason we are seeing this result is relatively \nsimple: ObamaCare did little, if anything, to address health care \ncosts. As a result, young and healthy people who are less in need of \nhealth insurance are making the calculation that it would be less \ncostly for them to go uninsured and pay a fine than purchase insurance \nthrough an exchange. Indeed, in countless polls and surveys of still \nuninsured Americans, we have seen the biggest reason people refuse to \nbuy health insurance is that it costs too much.\n  Under this status quo, insurers can stay afloat only in one of two \nways: They can raise premiums, which makes their coverage even more \ncostly, driving more young and healthy people out of the market, \nfurther depleting the risk pools, or they can exit unprofitable \nmarkets. Currently, we are seeing insurers do both, ensuring that the \nexchanges--and with them the entire system created by the Affordable \nCare Act--are becoming more unstable all the time.\n  Let's be clear: There is no solution to this problem that keeps the \ncurrent system in place. There is no way to reset or rearrange the \nincentives under the current system. There is no minor tinkering that \ncan fix these problems. It is not simply going to correct itself over \ntime. Quite frankly, the system is damaged beyond repair. The only \nthing we can do to give options to patients and bring down costs is \ncreate a different system.\n  Some of us have put forward plans to do just that. I have a plan that \nI put forward with Senator Burr and Chairman Upton over in the House. \nIt is called the Patient CARE Act, which I have mentioned a number of \ntimes here on the floor. However, ours isn't the only solution out \nthere. There are a number of ideas. We just need to get serious about \naddressing these issues. But that will not happen--that will not \nhappen--so long as people refuse to acknowledge there is even a \nproblem.\n  The supporters and authors of the Affordable Care Act have gotten \npretty good over the years at mining the available data for favorable \ncitations and moving the goalposts for what qualifies as ``success'' \nfor this law in order to fool the American people. Fortunately, the \npeople are not buying it.\n  Since the day the law passed, 90 percent of national polls show that \nmore people oppose ObamaCare than support it. I don't see that changing \nas long as premiums keep going up and people are left with fewer and \nfewer options.\n  However, as always, I am an optimist. I believe we can make some \nprogress here. I currently chair the Senate committee with jurisdiction \nover many of the most consequential elements of ObamaCare. Over the \nnext few months, I plan to do something that the authors of ObamaCare \nnever did--listen. I am going to take the time to engage with \nstakeholders from across the spectrum to get a clear sense of what \nneeds to be done to bring down health care costs for American families \nand get skyrocketing premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket limits \nunder control.\n  I plan to hear from experts, industry leaders, and advocacy groups to \nget their ideas in order to arrive at a workable solution. Then I am \ngoing to solicit the help of anyone in Congress--from either side of \nthe aisle--who is willing to put in the necessary work to right this \nship and craft meaningful legislation to address these problems.\n  As I said, the cost of health care is the No. 1 financial concern for \nAmerican families. It is an issue that deserves the attention of \neveryone in this Chamber. Finding a solution will require not only that \nwe acknowledge the failings of the system created by the Affordable \nCare Act but that we also work together to address these failings in a \nproductive, less political way--in a bipartisan way, if you will.\n  Now, that is my focus when it comes to health care, Mr. President. I \nhope all of my colleagues will be willing to work with me on this \neffort.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3897\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on Lee amendment No. 3897 \nthat deals with the Federal Fair Housing Act, and I want to describe \nwhy many of my colleagues and I are opposed to the amendment. The \namendment would eliminate the current affirmative furthering fair \nhousing enforcement regulations promulgated by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. I want to go into that.\n  I will start with a personal story. Before I was in partisan elected \npolitics, I was a civil rights lawyer in Richmond for 17 years. About \ntwo-thirds of my legal practice was fair housing cases. I will just \ntell you the story about my first client and two lessons I learned from \nmy first client that bear upon this amendment.\n  I had barely hung my diploma on the wall in my office, where I was \nthe junior person among 12 lawyers, when a client was referred to our \nfirm. They\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\ndid what is often the case; they sent it to the newest person. Somebody \nneeded some help--pro bono assistance. This young woman's name was \nLoraine.\n  Loraine was almost exactly my age. I think I was 25 at the time, and \nshe was the same age. I had just moved to a new city and had just gone \nout to find my apartment in that new city and started my first real job \nafter school. She was kind of in the same place--just out of college, \njust starting a new job, just looking for an apartment.\n  Loraine had been at work one day and had read in the newspaper an ad \nfor an apartment in a neighborhood she liked. So she called the \nlandlord and said: Hey, I am really interested in your apartment. Is it \nstill available? Yes, it is available. Could I come over on my lunch \nhour to take a look? Sure, come on over.\n  Well, about an hour later she went over to the apartment, and when \nshe met the owner, the owner looked at her and said: Oh, I'm sorry, \nthis place has just been rented.\n  This was in the fall of 1984.\n  Loraine drove back to her office and had this sinking suspicion that \nwhen the person saw she was African American, maybe that was why \nsuddenly the available apartment turned into one that wasn't available. \nWhen she got back to the office, she asked a Caucasian colleague to \nmake a call to the same owner and ask about the apartment. Within 20 \nminutes the colleague had made the call and asked: Hey, I'm calling \nabout this apartment. Is it still available? The owner, who had just \nturned Loraine away, said: Sure, it's still available. When do you want \nto come over and see it?\n  That was the first lawsuit I drafted. I know I am speaking to a \nPresiding Officer who is an attorney and who has done the same thing. \nFor the first client who was truly mine, the first pleading I drafted \nwas a Federal fair housing action. With the testimony of the coworker, \nit was a slam-dunk case. We settled it shortly after we filed it. So in \nthat sense, I don't have a big momentous trial story or anything to \ntell. Nevertheless, it made a huge impression on me as a brand-new \nattorney for two reasons. First, in hearing my client tell me the \nstory, I understood more deeply than I ever had how important your home \nis, how important housing is. I think most of us feel that what is \nimportant in life is relationships--not things, not physical objects. \nBut where you live is more like a part of your person than it is a \nphysical thing.\n\n  As she described this experience, obviously, that was what made it so \npainful. But the thing that really stuck with me about this was this: \nShe and I were so similar in many ways--about the same age, excited to \nbe coming out to find a house, having a new job. But my experience--I \nfound an apartment with no problem for my wife and me--was a positive \none. But Loraine's experience of being turned away--and then having the \nsinking suspicion that she was turned away because of her skin color \nand then finding out that was the case--was a very negative and painful \none. What really struck me, as I talked to her, was that the pain was \nnot just the pain of something in the past tense. The pain was also the \nanticipation: What about the next time I look for a house? What about \nthe next time? Am I going to be faced with this same differential \ntreatment because of the color of my skin?\n  That first case I had suddenly made me the expert in Virginia on fair \nhousing law--doing one case that was settled within a matter of weeks. \nSo for the next 17 years, this was the heart of my legal practice--\nrepresenting people who had been turned away from housing because of \ntheir race, disabilities--apartments, houses, mortgages, homeowner's \ninsurance policies. I learned an awful lot when I did it.\n  One of the things I learned was what a superb piece of legislation \nthe Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 is. It was the last of the major \npieces of civil rights legislation done in the 1960s. There was the \n1964 act of public accommodations, employment discriminations, and the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. In 1968, the Federal Fair Housing Act was \nreally the last of those big pieces of Federal legislation. I am proud \nto say that even over the course of my legal career, from 1984 until I \nstopped practicing in early 2002, in Virginia and elsewhere there was \nsignificant improvement. The Federal Fair Housing Act really did open \nthe doors so that people could live where they wanted to live and as \ntheir resources would allow them to live there. Yet, if we just looked \nat the statistics about residential segregation, in all 50 States, we \nwould see that we still have more work to do. There are still barriers \nthat people face, and some of them are just absolute, sharp, and clear \nbarriers, and some of them are more subtle.\n  HUD was directed by GAO in 2010 to do a study because they had been \nencouraged as part of the Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 to encourage \naffirmatively to advance the fair housing mission through agencies that \nare funded by HUD. The case that I described with Loraine was a private \nlandlord, and that is not necessarily relevant to this topic except to \nunderline how important the law is and how critical housing is. But \nthere are circumstances in which HUD is giving funding to \norganizations.\n  I was a mayor, and my city had a housing authority. HUD funding went \ninto the housing authority in my city, just like it goes into housing \nauthorities all around the United States. I was a Governor, and \nGovernors got CDBG funds that came from HUD. So whether it is to a \ncity, county, State, or to a CDBG program that then gets allocated \nout--even to worthy and strong housing nonprofits--HUD was under a \ndirective when it was funding organizations to make sure they were \naffirmatively advancing the commands of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. \nHUD was doing this sort of in fits and starts and in a little bit of an \nextemporaneous way. In 2010, the GAO said: You have an obligation to \naffirmatively further fair housing, but you are not exactly doing it \nthe right way. Can you really look at guidance that you can give to \nyour grantees?\n  Now, this was really important--that Federal grantees get this \nguidance and affirmatively further fair housing because it wasn't just \nthe private landlords of the world that had done bad things in the \nhousing industry. In fact, there had been a lot of policies of State \nand local governments, and even the Federal Government, that had cut \nagainst fair housing. There were zoning laws that cut against fair \nhousing. There were Federal appraisal standards to get FHA loans that \ncut against fair housing, and there were other Federal policies that \nactually cut directly against the goal of allowing people to live where \nthey wanted to live.\n  So that is the reason why these grantees that are receiving Federal \nmoney, are in a unique position to do something about it, and often are \ninheriting a history where in the past they did the wrong things, need \nto be encouraged and given clear guidance about how to affirmatively \nfurther fair housing.\n  So to follow the GAO directive, HUD, under this administration--and I \ngive Secretary Castro huge credit for getting this to the goal line--\ndid the work to come up with clear guidance so that organizations that \nreceive HUD funding know what it means to affirmatively encourage fair \nhousing and so that it is not just a vague platitude or something you \npay lip service to but you don't actually do it.\n  The rule announced by HUD is pretty straightforward. It doesn't \nmandate changes to local zoning laws. It doesn't require people to \nmove. It doesn't end local control of community planning and \ndevelopment. It allows communities to determine what the best \nstrategies are to comply with the Fair Housing Act. It provides local \ncommunities with data and tools that are needed to make fair housing \ndecisions, including allowing local communities to add any relevant \nlocal or regional data so that people can understand the effects of \ntheir actions.\n  It does include protected classes in the statute in the larger \ncommunity planning process. It prevents the use of Federal resources to \ndiscriminate against protected classes of individuals. It simplifies \ncompliance with the Fair Housing Act, and this is really important \nbecause a lot of small communities don't have a phalanx of lawyers to \npour through all the laws and regs. So simplified compliance guidelines \nare helpful. It does not require grantees to collect new data and data \nthey are not already collecting, and it encourages engagement with the \nlocal\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\ncommunity, including the real estate industry, residents, developers, \nand other organizations.\n  As somebody who was sitting on the other end of this as a mayor, and \nas somebody who was appointing members to a public housing agency in \nRichmond, I think this kind of guidance is actually very, very helpful. \nSo I was heartened when the GAO directed HUD to do this work. HUD did a \nsignificant period of study and put out guidance under Secretary \nCastro's leadership. I think it is actually something that is helpful--\nnot harmful--to those who are receiving HUD funds and should be using \nHUD funds to advance important goals, including the fair housing goals.\n  I know the Senator who is proposing the amendment--Lee amendment No. \n3897. I know it is well-intentioned, and the intention might be to not \nput too many burdens and obligations on the shoulders of local planning \nofficials or cities or counties. But as somebody who has been a mayor \nand been in that spot, guidance is helpful. I actually think this \nguidance gives clarity in an area where, before the guidance, there was \nsome confusion. I think the guidance strikes the right balance.\n  I don't know exactly when this is going to be called for a vote. I \ngather soon. But I just wanted to take the floor and hearken back to \nthe days before I ever knew I would be in politics and I was \nrepresenting people who desperately needed to just be treated equally \nto everybody else when it came to their housing. This HUD regulation \nreally furthers that goal in a positive way, and I think we should not \neliminate it by accepting Lee amendment No. 3897. So, for that reason, \nI encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I just want to thank the Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia for an excellent statement. As he has \nindicated, he comes to this issue from the perspective of an attorney \nwho is an expert in the Fair Housing Act, which, as he notes, is a \nlandmark civil rights law. But he also brings a very important \nperspective of having been a mayor who was the recipient of Federal \nfunds and who looked to HUD for guidance on how to make sure that, when \ncommunity development block grant monies, for example, were given to \nlocal communities, the communities used them in ways that carried out \nthe goals of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. It is very valuable that he has \nboth the technical understanding of an attorney who has practiced in \nthis very field for many years and also as a municipal official who had \nto live with the Federal rules.\n  The fact is, as he indicated, the Fair Housing Act regulation that \ncame out last year is intended to give clarity to local officials who \nare the recipients of Federal funds.\n  I am very much opposed to the amendment offered by Senator Lee that \nwould prohibit any funding for carrying out HUD's affirmatively \nfurthering fair housing rules.\n  It is important to recognize that this rule didn't just come out of \nthe blue. It is based on a specific requirement included in the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968, which mandates that HUD ensure that the recipients \nof Federal funds not only prevent outright blatant discrimination but \nalso act to affirmatively further the fair housing goals of the act.\n  In fact, Congress has repeatedly reinforced this concept in the \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, the Cranston-Gonzalez \nNational Affordable Housing Act, and the Quality Housing and Work \nResponsibility Act of 1998. All of those laws require HUD program \nrecipients to affirmatively further fair housing. It is probably a \nphrase that most of us are not that aware of, and it does not come \ntrippingly off of one's tongue. But it is an integral part of the 1968 \ncivil rights law, the Fair Housing Act.\n  It is also important to remember that when we are discussing fair \nhousing, we are not only talking about discrimination based on race but \nalso discrimination based on disabilities, national origin, and even \nagainst families with children.\n  It is important to note that more than 50 percent of all reported \ncomplaints of housing discrimination are initiated by individuals with \ndisabilities. That is one reason the Paralyzed Veterans of America \norganization has come out so strongly against the amendment that will \nbe offered by Senator Lee.\n  In a letter issued by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the \norganization notes:\n\n       HUD's AFFH rule helps curb discrimination against people \n     with disabilities, including veterans and the elderly. Each \n     year, over 50% of all reported complaints of housing \n     discrimination are initiated by people with disabilities.\n\n  The organization goes on to say:\n\n       This alarming trend will continue and affects Americans \n     returning from conflicts abroad with a disability and the \n     growing percentage of elderly Americans with a disability. \n     HUD's AFFH rule will help governments identify strategies and \n     solutions to expand accessible and supportive housing choices \n     for our veterans and elders with disabilities.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nParalyzed Veterans of America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n             Vote ``No'' on Lee Anti-Civil Rights Amendment\n\n       Senator Mike Lee plans to introduce an amendment to the \n     FY17 T-HUD/MilCon-VA appropriations bill which would prohibit \n     HUD from implementing or enforcing its ``Affirmatively \n     Furthering Fair Housing'' (AFFH) rule (FR-5173-P-01), keeping \n     long-awaited guidance and data intended to help state and \n     local govemments connect housing and community development \n     dollars to neighborhood opportunity. Any limitation or \n     reversal of HUD's AFFH rule will stop our nation from \n     ensuring that federal investments connect every neighborhood \n     to good schools, well-paying jobs, public transportation \n     options, and safe places for children to play and grow.\n       Senator Lee's amendment would halt implementation of the \n     Fair Housing Act and throw our nation back into the pre-civil \n     rights era. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was intended to \n     prohibit discrimination and dismantle historic segregation, \n     which continues to limit the housing choices and \n     opportunities of people of color, people with disabilities, \n     families with children, and religious groups. To achieve this \n     goal, the Fair Housing Act requires that recipients of \n     federal housing and community development funding \n     ``affirmatively further fair housing'' (AFFH).\n       HUD's AFFH Rule closes recommendations made by the GAO. In \n     2010 the GAO issued a report recommending that HUD reform its \n     process of implementing the AFFH provision of the Fair \n     Housing Act and the guidance that it provides to grantees. \n     HUD's rule implements the GAO's recommendations by providing \n     state and local governments and PHAs with data about the \n     demographics and housing needs of their communities as well \n     as a framework that they can use to identify and address \n     issues that contribute to isolation and economic inequality.\n       HUD's proposed rule emphasizes local control in the \n     development and implementation of solutions to remove \n     obstacles to opportunity. Once an analysis of the barriers to \n     fair housing is complete, governments and PHAs have the power \n     to decide for themselves which issues they and local \n     stakeholders identify are important to prioritize and \n     address. HUD leaves these choices to the discretion of local \n     governments and PHAs.\n       HUD's AFFH rule helps curb discrimination against people \n     with disabilities, including veterans and the elderly. Each \n     year, over 50% of all reported complaints of housing \n     discrimination are initiated by people with disabilities. \n     This alarming trend will continue and affects Americans \n     returning from conflicts abroad with a disability and the \n     growing percentage of elderly Americans with a disability. \n     HUD's AFFH rule will help governments identify strategies and \n     solutions to expand accessible and supportive housing choices \n     for our veterans and elders with disabilities.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. So I think it is important, as we debate this issue \ntoday, that we recognize what is at stake. The Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica organization was founded by a band of servicemembers who came \nhome from World War II with spinal cord injuries. I think we should \nlisten to their experience.\n\n  There are many other groups that have come out in opposition to \nSenator Lee's amendment. They include the Urban League. Those are big \ncities that receive a lot of Federal funds, but they are opposed to \nSenator Lee's amendment. The NAACP is opposed to the amendment. \nDisability groups have come out in opposition to the amendment.\n  There is another extremely important point that the Senator from \nVirginia made; that is, this rule, which has been criticized by some, \nis in direct\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nresponse to GAO criticizing HUD for not doing a good job in carrying \nout this part of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. That is so important.\n  How many of us in this Chamber have repeatedly looked to GAO for \nadvice on how we can improve how Federal programs work? Look to GAO. \nLook to its 2010 report, which is very critical of HUD. Surely, it is \nsignificant that when HUD issued the new regulations last year, the GAO \nsaid ``Fine'' and closed out its recommendations as being completed. \nThat is significant.\n  This wasn't some wild scheme that was dreamed up by bureaucrats at \nHUD, as some have claimed. This was in response to a report from the \nGovernment Accountability Office. We talk about how we want more \nefficiency, better accountability. That is why we have the GAO. This \nrule that was directly adopted in response to the GAO's report surely \nis significant.\n  I see the Senator from Texas has arrived and wants to speak. I will \nbe speaking more on this issue later today. Let me make one final \npoint.\n  There are those who have claimed that somehow HUD is going to get \ninvolved in dictating the zoning rules and ordinances of local \ncommunities. I don't believe that is the case, but we are going to \noffer an amendment and have filed an amendment to make sure that is not \nthe case.\n  The amendment that Senator Reed, Senator Cochran, and I am offering \nspecifically prohibits HUD from dictating in any way to any community \nwhat its zoning ordinances should be. If that is a possibility, we will \nforeclose it with our amendment.\n  I will be speaking further about this important issue later this \nafternoon, but I know there are many of my colleagues who are eager to \nspeak, and I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate our friend, the \nSenator from Maine, for doing a tremendous job of managing this bill. \nIt is never easy, given the fact that an individual Senator can slow \ndown the process or insist on their rights, which I am not disparaging \nat all. There comes a time in every piece of legislation where it is \nimportant for us to make sure that we invoke our rights as Senators on \nbehalf of the people we represent. I know it takes some patience and \ndiligence, and I admire the diligence, patience, and professionalism of \nour colleague from Maine on what is always a challenging piece of work, \nwhich is trying to get an appropriations bill passed.\n\n\n                  National Police Week and Police Act\n\n  I wish to speak on a different topic. This is National Police Week. \nEarlier this week I had the chance to visit with a police officer by \nthe name of Gregory Stevens of the Garland Police Department. For \npeople who are not aware, Garland is a city northeast of Dallas, TX. \nAround this time last year, it was a site of an attempted terrorist \nattack. There was a display of some artwork of the prophet Muhammad \nthat provoked a terrorist attack. Fortunately, Officer Stevens was the \nman in the right place at the right time when it happened.\n  Many of us remember that fateful day last May when two armed gunmen \nfrom Phoenix, AZ--clad in body armor with automatic weapons--pulled up \nto the conference center and opened fire. According to media reports, \nthe attackers were inspired by ISIS, the Islamic State. This is a real \nproblem because these folks, like the shooters in San Bernardino, \nhadn't actually traveled to Syria, although the San Bernardino couple \nhad been in Saudi Arabia and had traveled overseas--if I am not \nmistaken. But these people were radicalized in place by the ideology of \nthe Islamic State.\n  This is a big problem for the United States because, as the FBI \ndirector has commented, in every FBI field office in America, there are \nFBI investigations open on potential radicalization of people in place \nhere in the United States. It doesn't take people traveling from the \nMiddle East over here. It doesn't take people traveling from here, over \nthere, and coming back. This is the third leg of the stool or the third \nprong of the threat, of people being radicalized in place.\n  Getting back to my story, Officer Stevens responded decisively. He \nwas able to stop the two terrorists from hurting or killing hundreds of \npeople inside the conference center and, thankfully, he left unscathed.\n  I asked him: What sort of weapon did you have to protect yourself \nagainst these two terrorists in body armor with automatic weapons?\n  He said: I had a .45-caliber Glock with a 14-shot clip. He said he \nhad to do a tactical reload, but he never fired an additional shot \nafter he reloaded his weapon. For those of us familiar with such \nthings, that is the mark of a real professional--somebody who is very \nwell trained and responds as well as you could hope for.\n  I know the people of the city of Garland and the folks in Texas are \ngrateful to Officer Stevens for his quick response and his bravery. As \nI said, he saved potentially hundreds of lives and prevented injuries. \nI think it is appropriate during National Police Week for us to honor \npeople like Officer Stevens by telling their stories.\n  On Monday, President Obama presented Officer Stevens the Medal of \nValor, the highest honor given to a police officer. It is a fitting \ntribute to the heroic actions he exhibited that day.\n  During National Police Week, we should note that there are more than \n900,000 law enforcement officers serving our country. After 9/11, we \nhave come to talk about them as being first responders, but I am \ntalking specifically about the law enforcement officers, not the \nbroader category here during National Police Week. They are folks who \nget up every morning, kiss their families good-bye, go to work, put on \na uniform, and put themselves in harm's way to protect our communities \nand our families.\n  Tragically, we know that not all of them make it home at the end of \nthe day. Last year, the United States lost 124 law enforcement \nofficials; 12 of those officers were from the State of Texas. All of \nthem had their individual stories, but some left behind spouses and \nchildren. I have no doubt that all of them left behind loved ones and \npeople who care deeply about them and a community that, in their \nabsence, misses them terribly.\n  I am particularly proud of the men and women in my State who serve in \nlaw enforcement--not just in Texas but across the country, including \nhere at the Nation's Capitol. Our Capitol Police do a terrific job of \nkeeping all of us safe and not just Members of Congress but, obviously, \nthe hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the Capitol on an \nannual basis.\n  All of the professional law enforcement officials have dedicated \ntheir lives to public safety, and we should honor them for it. There is \nno doubt that our Nation is a better place because of their hard work \nand dedication, and we all owe them a debt of gratitude.\n  In the Senate, we need to do everything we can do to help \nprofessional law enforcement officials learn how to do their jobs as \neffectively and as safely possible. One simple way we could do that is \nby making sure they have access to the very best and latest training \ntechniques--active shooter training, for example.\n  I recall the situation at Fort Hood when MAJ Nidal Hasan killed 13 \npeople and wounded many more. Two police officers in active shooter \nmode crashed the site, exposing themselves to danger and ultimately \nparalyzing Nidal Hasan. More importantly, they took him out of action \nand saved a lot of lives.\n  This training they had and they exhibited with such great effect on \nthat day is what we need to give more of our law enforcement officials \naccess to. That is why I am glad to join my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Vermont, in sponsoring a piece of legislation called the \nPolice Act--a bill that passed out of the Judiciary Committee last \nweek.\n  This is pretty straightforward and it is bipartisan, so it doesn't \nmake a lot of news, but I do think it serves a useful purpose. It will \nallow the use of existing grant money for police training to be used \nfor this active shooter training. I know some of that training occurs \nat Texas State University in San Marcos. I have been to that site and \nwalked through some of the buildings they use for the training. It is a \nheart-thumping exercise to realize what law enforcement deals with when \nconfronting an active shooter. It is really important training.\n  We have seen terrorist attacks and sudden acts of violence in \ncommunities\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nacross the country and, thankfully, we have people like Officer Stevens \nwho helped avoid tragedy in Garland. But we should do everything we can \nto help equip our law enforcement officials with the training and tools \nthey need in order to do their jobs as effectively as possible.\n  The Police Act would help in this effort, and it would help protect \nthose who put their lives on the line on our behalf every day and \nsupport their efforts to guard the communities they serve. I look \nforward to passing this legislation soon. I can think of no better way \nto honor those who serve our country so well during National Police \nWeek than to pass the Police Act, which will in some small way provide \nthem access to the training they need in order to do their jobs better \nand help keep our communities safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I have been coming to the Senate floor \nand talking about a very important issue for our country that we should \nbe spending much more time focusing on, and that is the importance of \ngrowing our economy. With the exception of national defense, I believe \nthere is no more important moral imperative for this body and the \nFederal Government to focus on than this issue, but unfortunately, as \nwe have seen, the administration doesn't focus on it. They don't want \nto talk about the importance of growing the economy because the record \nthey have of economic growth for Americans, particularly middle-class \nAmericans, has been dismal.\n  I have been trying to get my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nfocus on this chart over the last several weeks because this chart says \na lot. If you look at the different records of different \nadministrations, both Democratic and Republican, the Obama years have \nbeen a lost decade of economic growth. This red line shows 3 percent \nGDP growth. That is decent growth but not great. We can see that \nReagan, Clinton, and Kennedy all had better numbers. This is the worst \nrecovery over a 7-year period. That is a fact. They don't want to talk \nabout it. We should talk about it a lot more.\n  I clearly think it is one of the most important things we should be \ndoing in this body, and one way we can reignite the American dream and \nour economic growth, especially for the next generation--like for our \npages--is to reduce burdensome and unnecessary regulations. Everybody \nagrees with that, including the Presiding Officer and all of my \ncolleagues here. We need to reduce burdensome and unnecessary Federal \nregulations and build infrastructure for America. That is exactly what \nmy amendment No. 3912 to the Transportation appropriations bill--which \nis so ably managed by my colleagues from Maine and Rhode Island--would \ndo, and that is what I will talk about for a minute.\n  My amendment would give States and communities throughout this Nation \nthe ability to expedite permitting for the maintenance, reconstruction, \nor construction of structurally deficient bridges. It is pretty simple. \nThe amendment is very narrowly tailored. It says: If you are going to \ndo maintenance, construction, or reconstruction on a bridge that is \nstructurally deficient and the Federal Government won't be burdened, we \nwill expedite the permitting by waiving many of the permitting \nrequirements. That is it. It is very simple. As a matter of fact, this \namendment only has two paragraphs.\n  It is a win-win for the country. Investing in our infrastructure will \nhelp boost our economy and economic growth, and importantly, it will \nkeep American families safe. It is a commonsense approach that I am \nhoping my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support.\n  Recently, President Obama was asked about the economy and our \ncrumbling infrastructure. He talked about the need for infrastructure \ninvestment, which I completely agree with; however, he laid the blame \nfor a lack of investment in infrastructure on Republicans, who he said \nwere unwilling to spend on our infrastructure. Well, I think with the \nhighway bill, the WRDA bill, and this appropriations bill, we are doing \nit. Again, it is very bipartisan. I don't think what the President said \nis true. We are certainly willing to invest in infrastructure, which is \nso important to our economy, but we need to do it wisely, and we need \nto make sure our taxpayer money does not go to unintended uses. In \nfact, I believe, as do many of my colleagues, that there is perhaps \nnothing more central to growing our economy and competing globally than \nsound infrastructure for America, but throwing money at projects that \naren't ready for development because of the burdensome permitting and \nregulatory requirements that we often see from the Federal Government \nis not a sound use of taxpayer dollars.\n  A recent column in the Wall Street Journal points out that of the \n$800 billion of taxpayer money that was passed several years ago as \npart of the President's stimulus package, only $30 billion was spent on \ntransportation infrastructure. That is remarkable. Out of the $800 \nbillion, only $30 billion was spent on infrastructure. Why? One of the \nbig reasons is because these infrastructure projects were not shovel-\nready because of the onerous permitting requirements and environmental \nreviews.\n  Consider this: The average time for an environmental review for a \nmajor transportation project in the United States has increased to a \nstaggering 8 years. In 2011, it took 8 years to get a transportation \nproject approved in terms of Federal permitting, and that is up from \n3\\1/2\\ years in the year 2000. We have more than doubled the time in \nless than 7 years because of the Federal permitting requirements.\n  The average environmental impact statement was about 22 pages when \nNEPA, which requires EIS's--and that is important. When that bill \ninitially passed, the average EIS was 22 pages. Today's highway \nprojects often have EIS's that are well above 1,000 pages. On average, \nit takes over 5 years to permit a bridge in the United States. Nobody \nwants this.\n\n  As a matter of fact, former President Bill Clinton highlighted the \nneed for reform in this area in a well-known Newsweek article. In 2011 \nhe was on the front cover of Newsweek. His article talked about how to \nget Americans back to work. One of his top recommendations was to make \nsure that when we have infrastructure projects, the permitting \nrequirements don't take forever. He said that we need to ``keep the \nfull review process when there are real environmental concerns, but \nwhen there aren't, the federal government should be able to give a \nwaiver to the states to speed up start times on construction \nprojects.'' That was former President Bill Clinton's recommendation. \nWell, that is exactly what my amendment does. Again, if you are going \nto repair or build a bridge and keep it in the same capacity--a two-\nlane bridge stays a two-lane bridge, not a four-lane bridge--and in the \nsame place and the same size, then the permitting process should be \nexpedited.\n  Let me spend a few minutes on why this is so important for our \neconomy and the safety of our citizens. I think most people in this \nbody know our bridges are in poor condition. About 1 in 10 of America's \nroughly 607,000 bridges is termed and classified as ``structurally \ndeficient.'' Let me repeat that in a different way. In the United \nStates, there are more than 61,000 bridges in need of repair. The \naverage age of our bridges is 42 years old. Americans cross these \nstructurally deficient bridges 215 million times a day.\n  Here is a chart that shows where they are located. If you look here, \nthis classifies different bridges. The red category shows the most \nbridges--over 25 percent--that are structurally deficient. The lighter \nred represents 20 to 25 percent, and the lightest shade of red \nrepresents 15 to 20 percent. As we can see, every State has \nstructurally deficient bridges that Americans are crossing 215 million \ntimes a day.\n  Let me be clear. It is not just about the economy, where truckers and \ncommerce are crossing these bridges every day; it is about the safety \nof our children when they ride on schoolbuses and parents when they \ncome home from work. Every State in the Union is impacted by this.\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\n  Let me give a few quick examples of some structurally deficient \nbridges across the country.\n  This is the Magnolia Bridge in Seattle, WA. It was built in 1929. \nThis bridge carries over 18,000 cars per day and has been declared \nstructurally deficient.\n  The Greenfield Bridge in Pittsburgh, PA--Pennsylvania has the most \nstructurally deficient bridges in the country, and this chart shows one \nof them. It was built in 1921. It carries almost 8,000 cars per day. In \n2003 a 10-inch chunk of concrete went through a car windshield, \ninjuring the driver. This structurally deficient bridge has been \ncrumbling for decades.\n  I have one more example, which the Presiding Officer will find of \nsignificant interest. This is the Russell Street Bridge in Missoula, \nMN. Transportation for America rates the deck of the Russell Street \nBridge a 4 out of 10 in terms of structural soundness. It was built in \n1957 and carries over 22,000 cars a day.\n  I think we would all agree that we need to fix these 61,000 \nstructurally deficient bridges. There is no doubt about it. I don't \nthink there is any Member of this body or anyone in the Federal \nGovernment who would disagree about that, but what happens when we try \nto do that? In fact, the efforts, especially in the local communities, \nare strangled by bureaucratic redtape.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently had an article titled ``The Highway \nto Bureaucratic Hell,'' and it talked about this very issue of what \nhappens when communities try to fix their structurally deficient \nbridges. They gave a number of examples, but I wanted to read one that \nimpacts Americans in the New Jersey-New York area of the country. The \nWall Street Journal article stated: Another illustration of what \nhappens is the Bayonne Bridge that connects New Jersey to Staten Island \nand at 150 feet tall blocks large cargo ships. The Port Authority of \nNew York and New Jersey plans to raise the bridge from 150 feet to 215 \nfeet. They wanted to do that to allow cargo ships to go under it. They \nplanned to keep the bridge the same size; they just wanted to raise it \nso they wouldn't have to spend over $3 billion to build a tunnel.\n  The article goes on to say that their reward for thinking rationally \nwas that it took 6 months to have the lead agency identified for an \nenvironmental review--an environmental review that dragged on for more \nthan 5 years and spanned 20,000 pages. That is not good for New Jersey, \nthat is not good for New York, and that is not good for America.\n  Again, what my amendment would do would fix this issue. It is very \nnarrowly tailored, and it would simply make sure that when we are \ntrying to fix the 61,000 structurally deficient bridges in the United \nStates, we can do it in an expedited manner, not in the way in which \nthis Wall Street Journal article described--5 years and 20,000 pages.\n  This amendment is a win-win-win. It will help spur economic growth, \nhelp us with the safety of our citizens, and help our workers get back \nto work so we can do the maintenance and reconstruction on these \nbridges. Everybody here talks about regulatory reform and how we need \nit. Even the President, in his State of the Union speech, talked about \nthe need to cut redtape in order to grow this economy. But we rarely \nact on it. We talk about it, but we don't act on it.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--my colleagues \nparticularly from older States, where this amendment will help them \nmore than the rest of the country--to vote on this amendment which will \nkeep our families and kids safe, help grow our economy, and put workers \nback to work. It is a commonsense thing to do for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it has now been 62 days since Judge \nGarland's nomination--62 days. As we all know, our Founding Fathers \nentrusted all of us in the Senate with the role of providing advice and \nconsent to the President of the United States in relation to his \nappointments to the Supreme Court. We have the option--in fact, I \nbelieve the responsibility--to meet with the nominee in person. We are \nresponsible for holding hearings through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Based on his responses to questions, we then have the \nopportunity to vote yes or no on the nomination. But we don't have the \nresponsibility of doing nothing. We have to proceed to consider the \nnomination.\n  Unfortunately, Senators in the majority are refusing to do that. They \nhave said they will not hold hearings--no hearings, zero--on a nominee \nfor the U.S. Supreme Court. And too many have refused to even meet with \nthe nominee, and I believe it is a matter of respect to meet with the \nnominee, Judge Merrick Garland. This is our job in the Senate. This is \ntheir job--the job established for them--for us--by America's Founding \nFathers. Unfortunately, the majority is refusing to do it.\n  I have talked with a lot of hard-working people in Michigan and, \nfrankly, people around the country about what would happen if they \ndecided to not do one of the most basic parts of their job; if they \nsaid: For the next year, I think I am just not going to do this major \npart of my job description. Usually, when I ask people about that, they \nlaugh and say: Well, that is simple; I would be fired. That is the \nresponse of the majority of Americans.\n  If we go back in history and look at how long it usually takes for \nthe Senate to process a President's Supreme Court nomination, we see \nhow unprecedented these delays really are. If this Republican-\ncontrolled Senate did its job as previous Senates have, then there \nwould have been a hearing of the Judiciary Committee by April 27, which \nwas 3 weeks ago--3 weeks ago--but that hasn't happened. The Judiciary \nCommittee would have held a vote on May 12, but that vote never came, \nand there is no sign it is coming anytime soon, if at all, this year. \nBased on historical precedent, the Supreme Court nominee would then \ncome to the floor for a vote on confirmation, up or down, yes or no, by \nMemorial Day. That is not going to happen either.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to schedule a hearing so that the \nAmerican people can hear directly from Judge Merrick Garland in a \ntransparent and open way. Ask the tough questions. Talk about his \nalmost 20 years on the circuit court bench and his role as chief judge. \nWe should also talk about the fact that he was confirmed for that \nposition overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, by the U.S. Senate.\n  Because there is not a willingness to hold hearings, to debate, to \ndiscuss, to have a vote, I think that is why polls show that the \nmajority of Americans support holding the hearings and a vote for Judge \nGarland and don't understand what is going on.\n  Meanwhile, the eight Justices of the Supreme Court have been unable \nto reach a final decision on two important cases, and I am sure there \nwill be more. Those cases are Zubik v. Burwell and Spokeo v. Robbins. \nAs a result, the law remains unsettled and is likely to remain \nunsettled for a year or more as to whether women who work for certain \nnonprofits will continue to have seamless access to contraceptive \nhealth care coverage. Given the gravity of the decision the Supreme \nCourt must make, we can't afford to let it continue with less than the \nnine Justices who make up the Supreme Court.\n  This is supposed to be a separate branch of government that will \nplace a check on the administration and on Congress, the third branch \nof government.\n  It is time that we get about the business of doing our job and for \nour Republican colleagues to say they are going to do their job and \nprovide advice and consent on the nomination. Again, if there is not \nsupport for this nomination after rigorous debate, after hearings, \nafter questions, after hearing from Judge Garland, then so be it. Then \nthe President of the United States will have to come back with another \nnomination. But right now nothing is happening to reflect the fact that \nthe third branch of government will be left ineffective, unable to \nfully function for probably a year, and it could be longer. That makes \nno sense.\n  It is time to do your job. It is time to do your job so that the U.S. \nSupreme Court can do its job on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss important \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nbefore the U.S. Senate this week--the combined Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nappropriations bill.\n  As chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee and an active \nmember of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I am pleased \nthat this appropriations bill includes a number of critical \ntransportation and infrastructure initiatives that I have advocated for \nduring my time in the Senate. A safe, efficient, and reliable \ntransportation system is crucial to the economic growth of our country.\n  Last year Congress passed a much needed 5-year highway bill known as \nthe Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or the FAST Act. I was \nproud to work with my colleagues on this bipartisan legislation and \nusher in the first multiyear Transportation bill in over a decade.\n\n  The Transportation appropriations bill before the Senate fully funds \nthe highway bill. Because of the FAST Act, Americans will benefit from \nincreased investment in our Nation's transportation system. Rural and \nurban communities across Nebraska and our country will have new \nopportunities to secure funding for essential freight infrastructure \nprojects. Meanwhile, a new national strategic freight program within \nthe FAST Act will help our States and local communities prioritize \nfreight traffic and increase safety. Through this program, States will \nbe provided with the discretion to direct new funds to rural and urban \nfreight corridors with higher commercial traffic.\n  As States work to develop their freight plans and designate \ncorridors, stakeholders across all modes will have the opportunity to \nparticipate and provide valued feedback. First and last mile connectors \nfor freight at airports, trucking facilities, and rail yards will also \nbe eligible for increased investment under this national freight \nprogram.\n  Railroad infrastructure is also a pivotal component of our national \ntransportation network. According to the Nebraska Department of Roads, \nmy State hosts more than 3,000 at-grade rail crossings that will be \neligible for Federal dollars. Additional funding is provided for \nrailroad safety and research programs, including positive train control \ninstallation and resources to address highway-rail grade crossing \nsafety.\n  I am also pleased that T-HUD advances key pipeline safety efforts, \nwhich I worked with my Commerce Committee colleagues, including the \nPresiding Officer, to include in the bipartisan SAFE PIPES Act. \nAmerica's pipeline infrastructure transports vital energy resources to \nhomes, businesses, schools, and commercial centers across our country. \nAccording to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \nAdministration, or PHMSA, more than 2.5 million miles of pipelines \ntraverse the United States. Pipelines are often renowned as the safest \nway to transport crude oil and natural gas. Nevertheless, Congress must \ncontinue to increase safety on America's vast pipeline network. Our \nNation's hazardous materials emergency responders and our firefighters \nare supported by T-HUD report language that encourages PHMSA to update \nimportant training curriculum programs.\n  The Surface Transportation Subcommittee has also been working on \nlegislation to strengthen our Nation's maritime programs. For example, \nthe Maritime Security Program is responsible for ensuring a fleet of \nU.S. merchant marine vessels stands ready and available to assist our \nNation's military in times of war or national emergency, and I \nappreciate that T-HUD bolsters this very valuable program.\n  Furthermore, DOT and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy will be \ncompelled to provide more information to Congress on efforts to combat \non-campus sexual assault. Addressing on-campus sexual assault is \nsomething I have been seeking to address as part of my bill, known as \nthe Maritime Administration Enhancement Act of 2017. Through meaningful \nprevention and response efforts, we can provide a more secure \nexperience for the Academy's men and women, many of whom will go on to \nserve our country.\n  America's aviation and aerospace system will benefit from increased \nresources without raising ticket fees on our Nation's passengers. The \nbill's report tasks the Federal Aviation Administration with evaluating \nand updating commercial airline onboard emergency medical kits, \nparticularly for families traveling with young infants. This is \nsomething I fought for in the Senate FAA bill.\n  Full funding is provided for the Contract Tower Program, which allows \nsmaller airports to contract with the private sector for air traffic \ncontrol services. Airports across the country, such as the Central \nNebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island, NE, will benefit greatly \nfrom this program.\n  T-HUD allocates critical funding for our Nation's multimodal \ntransportation network, and I am pleased the bill advances many of my \nown key initiatives.\n  I would also like to address some of the important provisions \nincluded in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs portion of \nthe bill. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our veterans and we \nhave a responsibility to help them in their time of need. These men and \nwomen answered the call to serve our country and to defend our freedom. \nSome have deployed around the world, often into the heart of danger, to \nfight or provide humanitarian assistance. Many of these veterans return \nfrom service with both the visual and the unseen scars of battle.\n  These brave men and women deserve timely access to quality health \ncare. Unfortunately, veterans living in rural States can be forced to \ntravel great distances to receive the care they need. Through this \nlegislation, the VA would be prevented from diminishing services at \ncertain existing Veterans Health Administration medical facilities. It \nwould also require the VA to take a more holistic approach to planning \nand executing realignment.\n  Throughout Nebraska, veterans are fortunate to receive quality care \nfrom dedicated VA medical providers. At the same time, the lack of \nmodern infrastructure and outdated facilities are hindering efforts to \nprovide the latest treatments and support. The VA must continue to \nexplore innovative strategies to hasten updates and the completion of \nour new facilities.\n  Although this bill offers progress, we are not finished in our \nefforts to address problems at the VA. I will continue to do whatever I \ncan to ensure that every veteran has access to the health care they \nneed.\n  As I mentioned, the appropriations bill before us moves forward a \nnumber of significant national transportation priorities and enhances \nprograms beneficial to America's veterans. I greatly appreciate the \nhard work of Senators Collins, Kirk, and their Appropriations \nsubcommittee staffs on this critical bill. It will allocate much needed \ndollars to advance our Nation's transportation system and strengthen \nveterans programs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. \nFischer, for her comments. She is such a leader on so many issues in \nthe Senate. We work closely together on transportation issues, and she \ngave us very valuable input for the bill that is before us. So I \nacknowledge her help and assistance and guidance and thank her for her \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over the last few months, we have \nwitnessed ObamaCare crumbling in my home State of Arizona. Several \nObamacare-established co-ops collapsed, including Arizona's Meritus \nMutual Health Partners, forcing nearly 63,000 Arizonans scrambling to \nfind new coverage. Last month, UnitedHealth, the Nation's largest \nhealth insurer, announced it\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\nwill exit the Arizona marketplace and leave about 45,000 Arizonans to \nfind new coverage in 2017. Now, as a direct result of the President's \nfailed law, health insurer Humana just announced it, too, will exit the \nmarketplace in 2017 in my home State. All together, over half of \nArizona's counties will be left with a single insurer, and another \nthird will be left with just two. In turn, this will cause premiums to \nskyrocket even higher than last year. While Democrats continue to stand \nby a failed law, Arizona families are bearing the burden. This is \nunacceptable.\n  More than 6 years after ObamaCare was rammed through Congress without \na single Republican vote--and I was on the floor on Christmas Eve \nmorning as it was passed on a strict party-line vote--Democrats are \nstill trying to spin their overhaul of America's health care system. We \ncontinue to hear from advocates of ObamaCare who make their claims that \ncontinue to leave me speechless, such as that insurance markets are \nstable and premiums are not rising quickly. Unfortunately, as is often \nthe case with advocates of the President's disastrous law, these \nstatements are largely devoid of reality.\n\n  ObamaCare's upheaval and disruption to our Nation's health care \nsystem is a direct result of the efforts of the White House and \nDemocratic leadership to write this massive bill behind closed doors, \nwith no input from this side of the aisle. The process was anything but \nbipartisan, as promised on the campaign trail by the then-Presidential \ncandidate, Barack Obama. Instead of crafting health care reform that \nworks for the American people, the administration cut deals with drug \ncompanies to get their support, ensuring they would see increased \nprofits and consumers would face increased costs.\n  Democrats' partisan effort to write and pass ObamaCare without \nRepublican participation flies in the face of how every other major \nreform in American history was enacted. I have worked with Democrats on \nmany occasions to solve some of the country's most urgent problems. \nNever in my experience has one party attempted to increase the \ngovernment's influence in one-sixth of the American economy over the \nunanimous opposition of the other party.\n  Unfortunately, Americans are now facing the consequences of this \nmassive overhaul of our health care system. The biggest problem in our \nhealth care system, and Americans' most pressing concern, is out-of-\ncontrol cost increases, but ObamaCare does nothing to address this \nissue. That is why we continue to see health care costs balloon, while \nhealth insurance becomes increasingly expensive and unaffordable for \ncitizens and their employers.\n  Sadly, as we have seen in recent weeks, the situation is only getting \nworse. Just last month, a poll by Gallup found that Americans cite \nhealth care costs as the most important financial burden facing their \nfamilies. They name health care costs ahead of other financial burdens, \nsuch as low wages, debt, and being able to afford college or a \nmortgage.\n  The American people are now experiencing firsthand exactly what \nRepublicans have been warning about ever since ObamaCare was written: \nThe law will ultimately do far more harm than good, and they have every \nright to question what the future holds. The fact is, the crumbling of \nObamaCare should come as no surprise to anyone.\n  UnitedHealth--which will exit from all but a handful of States in the \nindividual marketplace in 2017--lost $475 million on the ObamaCare \nexchanges in 2015 and is projected to lose $650 million on the \nexchanges in 2016. Its exit from ObamaCare exchanges will send an \nestimated 45,000 citizens of my State, Arizona, scrambling to find new \ncoverage with even fewer options to choose from.\n  Humana's announcement that it will follow in UnitedHealth's footsteps \nby exiting Arizona's exchanges should also come as no surprise, given \nthe fact that it continues to incur losses as a result of ObamaCare's \nonerous regulations. Humana and UnitedHealth's exit means fewer \noptions, less competition, and most certainly higher costs for \nconsumers. This is especially true after Blue Cross Blue Shield, the \nonly remaining provider in several Arizona counties, increased premiums \nlast year by 27 percent merely to recover the $185 million in losses it \nincurred in the ObamaCare marketplace between 2014 and 2015.\n  The health insurer has noted that continuing to suffer losses in the \nmarketplace is unsustainable, meaning significant premium increases are \non the horizon for 2017. All of this news of insurance companies \nexiting the marketplace and others increasing premiums is only the tip \nof the iceberg when it comes to the consequences of this disastrous \nlaw. Since ObamaCare became law, prescription drug costs have continued \nto skyrocket.\n  Instead of encouraging innovation and competition, ObamaCare places \nheavy taxes on manufacturers and prescription drug importers to the \ntune of $27 billion over 10 years. According to Standard & Poor's, the \ncost of drugs on the individual insurance market jumped 50 percent in \n2015. Just as some are forgoing a visit to the doctor because of higher \nout-of-pocket costs, we are starting to see more and more individuals \nwith chronic conditions not getting their prescriptions filled because \nof the increasing cost of drugs.\n  The fact is, ObamaCare was a failure from the start and Americans are \npaying the price. The best thing government can do to expand access to \nhealth insurance is to institute reforms that will rein in costs and \nmake health care more affordable. I have introduced legislation to \nreplace ObamaCare with real reform that would expand quality access to \nhealth care without compromising individual liberty, competition, or \ninnovation.\n  Regrettably, every Republican effort to meaningfully bring down the \ncost of health care has been met with rigid opposition by Democrats who \nare more concerned with protecting President Obama's legacy than making \nhealth care accessible and affordable. Every day that goes by, with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle continuing to dig in their \nheels, leads to another day that millions of Americans face higher \nhealth care costs, decreased quality of care, and fewer choices.\n  It is past time for the President of the United States and Democrats \nin Congress to answer to the thousands of citizens across my State and \nthe Nation who have been let down time and again by this disastrous \nlaw.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commend the \nleaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee for accepting \ntransparency language that I requested be included in the fiscal year \n2017 spending bill for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The good governance provision, which I championed after years of \noversight work, will ensure greater accountability in public housing \nauthorities' use of the Federal money that they receive in this annual \nappropriations bill.\n  For the last 6 years, I have raised concern about HUD's failure to \nconduct proper oversight of how local housing authorities use those \nFederal dollars. Specifically, my concerns relate to HUD's practice of \nallowing local housing authorities to spend hundreds of millions of \nFederal dollars each year with virtually no Housing and Urban \nDevelopment oversight and no transparency to the public. We all have \nreason to be concerned about this lack of transparency because some \nlocal housing authorities rely on the Federal Government for up to 90 \npercent of their funding.\n  That is why I thank Senator Collins, Senator Kirk, and other members \nof the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee for recognizing \nthat Congress must insist on HUD's paying closer attention to the use \nof taxpayer dollars by housing authorities.\n  The good governance provision that the Transportation-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee included in this year's appropriations \nreport ensures that in the future the housing money we appropriate for \nlow-income families will retain its Federal designation even\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nafter it is transferred to the housing authorities.\n  I want to stress that this designation is no small matter. In other \nwords, Federal money is going to be considered Federal money when it \ngets to the local housing authority, and no games can be played with it \nas are being played with it now.\n  U.S. taxpayers spend about $4.5 billion every year to help low-income \nAmericans put a roof over their heads. We can be proud that we do so \nmuch for people in need. We should not let any of that money \nspecifically for people of need be wasted or spent to feather the nests \nof local public housing authority bureaucrats.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to explain why the appropriations \nlanguage that I championed and is in this legislation is so sorely \nneeded. Some local housing authorities have devoted these limited \nfunds, which are meant to help low-income people find affordable \nhousing, to high salaries and even for perks for the people who run \nhousing authorities around the country. I will just use three examples, \nbut there are dozens of examples that can be given.\n  At the Atlanta Housing Authority, at least 22 employees earned \nbetween $150,000 and $303,000 per year.\n  The former executive director of the Raleigh Housing Authority in \nNorth Carolina received about $280,000 in salary and benefits plus 30 \nvacation days.\n  The executive director of the Tampa Housing Authority is paid over \n$214,000 per year, and the housing authority spends over $100,000 per \nyear on travel and conferences.\n  After I called attention to these wasteful practices a few years ago, \nHUD limited the executive salary paid by local housing authorities. \nThat is good news, right? Well, it didn't work out that way, even after \nthe salaries were capped at level IV of the Executive Schedule pay \nscale, which today amounts to about $160,000 a year. As I say, it \ndidn't turn out to be good news. Unfortunately, as it did turn out, \nthis compensation cap had little impact in limiting housing authority \nsalaries.\n  I will explain how this works. HUD provides over $350 million in \noperating fees annually to local housing authorities. Right now, these \nfees are considered income earned by the housing authorities for \nmanaging programs instead of considering them as what they are--grants \ngiven by the Federal Government. That is where the Federal money gets \nmixed up with local money and the Federal money isn't followed by HUD. \nThat is why they get away with the waste of taxpayers' money.\n  Despite their source, when these fees reach housing authorities, they \nare no longer considered Federal funds. I say that a second time for \nemphasis. Once these funds lose Federal designation, housing \nauthorities then can use the tax dollars as they see fit--and they do. \nThen, when they use it as they see fit, HUD is not required to conduct \noversight of how the money is spent. Believe me; HUD hasn't done much \noversight.\n  This means that many employees of housing authorities can continue to \nearn annual salaries well in excess of the $160,000 without technically \nviolating the Federal salary cap. You can see the games that are being \nplayed to let these local housing people get these massive high \nsalaries and fringe benefits and waste taxpayers' money that should be \nspent helping low-income people get safe housing. Sadly, these salaries \nexceed limits that were imposed by the Federal Government to ensure the \nmoney we appropriate goes to low-income families in the greatest need \nof our assistance.\n  After I began publicly voicing my complaints about this practice, the \nOffice of Management and Budget in December 2013 issued a government-\nwide guidance that should have--should have--put a stop to it, but it \ndidn't. But let me tell you what the guidance called for. So-called \nfees for service would then be designated as program income so the \nFederal funding would retain its Federal designation after it is \ntransferred into housing authority business accounts. Making sure it \nkept its Federal designation meant it had to be subject to HUD \noversight. HUD initially agreed to fully implement the OMB guidance, \nbut they did not.\n  Later, the Department quietly--very quietly--requested a waiver that, \nif that waiver was granted, would have allowed housing authorities to \nsidestep the new OMB rule and then continue to avoid commonsense \noversight because, with that waiver, the Federal dollars would not have \nFederal designation. They would be considered local money and could be \nspent any way people wanted to spend it.\n  I might never have learned of this HUD effort to get around this OMB \nrule but for the very good work of the HUD inspector general. After I \nlearned from the inspector general's staff that HUD was requesting a \nwaiver of the OMB guidance, I sent a letter to OMB expressing my \nconcerns. But as so often happens with bureaucrats in this town, I \ndidn't hear from OMB until I attempted to include amendment language \naddressing the fee designation in the Transportation-HUD appropriations \nbill before Thanksgiving of last year, when the issue was on the floor \nof the Senate. As we all know, that bill was pulled from the floor. But \nneither the inspector general nor I were ready to give up, and that is \nwhy we are here today.\n  Just recently, I received good news that reinforces my belief that \ncongressional oversight works. HUD has finally agreed to implement its \ninspector general's recommendations requiring that funding provided by \nthe taxpayers to public housing authorities will keep its Federal \ndesignation. In other words, HUD will be responsible for making sure \nthat Federal funding is used as intended, and that is very clear. It is \nwhy we have public housing--to provide safe, affordable housing for \nthose in need and, consequently, then, not to use that Federal money to \npay exorbitant executive salaries.\n  My concern now is the timeframe for implementation and ensuring that \nHUD does not request another waiver.\n  HUD expects the final rule to be completed by December 2017, more \nthan 1\\1/2\\ years from now. That is a very long time to finalize \nregulations. I hope HUD isn't delaying the process in the hope that \neither the inspector general or this Senator will give up. I can assure \nyou that will not happen. We need to ensure that this reform is \nimplemented by including language in this appropriations bill to not \njust keep salaries in check but also to ensure that HUD exercises \noversight authority over how these funds are used and that more money \nis actually used for the poor.\n\n  I hope HUD uses that oversight authority to combat waste, such as in \nthe following three examples: The Housing Authority of the City of Los \nAngeles misused over $3.9 million in operating funds for salary, \ntravel, bonuses, and legal settlements. The Stark Metropolitan Housing \nAuthority in Canton, OH, misused $4 million in operating and capital \nfunds to build a commercial development, and an additional $2 million \nwas misused for salaries and benefits. The Hickory, NC, housing \nauthority paid over $500,000 in operating funds to a maintenance \ncompany owned by the brother of a board member--a clear conflict of \ninterest.\n  It is also vital that Congress be aware of any effort by HUD to once \nagain avoid implementing this rule the way they tried to get around the \nOMB rule I just talked about. For that reason, the report language I \nrequested requires HUD to notify both the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees quarterly during fiscal year 2017 if they \nrequest any waiver from implementing these provisions.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this effort to ensure that HUD \nimplements these much needed changes and does its part to provide \nbetter oversight of our scarce Federal funding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2922-2"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2933-S2935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           POLICE ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here on the floor \nwith the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the ranking \nmember, our colleague from Vermont, whom I have worked with on so many \nissues, to ask unanimous consent to take up a bill that I talked about \na little earlier this morning called the POLICE Act. This bill uses \nexisting funding to support local law enforcement but specifically to \nmake sure funding is available for active-shooter training.\n  For example, in San Marcos, TX, at Texas State University, they have \ntrained 80,000 local law enforcement officials in active-shooter \ntraining. The\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\ntime I remember most poignantly when this was put to good use and saved \nlives was at Fort Hood, TX, when MAJ Nidal Hasan stood up and killed I \nthink about 13 people and then wounded about 30 more. There were two \nlaw enforcement officials who crashed the site, put themselves in \nharm's way, but thanks to the great training they had, they were able \nto disable Major Hasan before he was able to do any more damage. So \nthis is very important training.\n  We want to make sure there are funds available--using existing \nfunding streams but available for active-shooter training wherever it \nmight be provided around the country.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier today, this week is National \nPolice Week--a time to honor those men and women who have fallen in the \nline of duty.\n  One way we can better support our Nation's law enforcement officers \nis by helping them get the training they need to keep themselves and \nthe communities they protect safe.\n  The POLICE Act is a bill that would do exactly that.\n  This bipartisan legislation would allow existing grant money \navailable for police training to be used for active shooter training--a \ncommonsense way to put these funds to good use in a way that does not \nand will not spend additional Federal money.\n  Right now, current law will not allow local police departments and \nfirst responders to use a substantial amount of grant funding through \nthe Justice Department for this kind of critical training. Our bill \nwould change that.\n  With all the threats they face every day on the job, we have an \nobligation to equip as many officers as possible with the skills and \ntraining they need to respond to an active shooter situation.\n  I would like to thank Senator Leahy for working with me on this \nlegislation. I also would like to thank Chairman Grassley for his \neffort in getting this bill passed out of committee last week. I \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy.\n\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 464, S. 2840.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2840) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and \n     Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use \n     grant funds for active shooter training, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the bill having \nbeen read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (S. 2840) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2840\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Lives by \n     Initiating COPS Expansion Act of 2016'' or the ``POLICE Act \n     of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF COPS FUNDS.\n\n       Section 1701(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \n     Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (16), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) by redesignating paragraph (17) as paragraph (18);\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following:\n       ``(17) to participate in nationally recognized active \n     shooter training programs that offer senario-based, \n     integrated response courses designed to counter active \n     shooter threats or acts of terrorism against individuals or \n     facilities; and''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (18), as redesignated, by striking \n     ``(16)'' and inserting ``(17)''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I had a chance to speak on this earlier. I \nwould defer to my colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nor Senator Leahy from Vermont, my principal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week is National Police Week, and many \nof us have paused to thank our Nation's law enforcement officers for \ntheir important work. But it is not enough for us to simply pay tribute \nto these men and women. We must also provide them with the training and \nthe resources they need to remain safe while they protect our \ncommunities.\n  That is why I pushed for years to enact legislation to reauthorize \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, which President Obama \nsigned into law on Monday. I authored this legislation with Senator \nGraham because every single law enforcement officer deserves to be \nprotected by a lifesaving vest. Since its inception in 1998, this \nprogram has provided more than 1.2 million vests to more than 13,000 \nlaw enforcement agencies. The reauthorization signed into law this week \nensures that hundreds of thousands more officers will be similarly \nprotected. I have personally met with officers who were saved by vests \npurchased through this program. They will confirm that these vests are \nworth every penny.\n  Today the Senate passed the Protecting Our Lives by Initiating COPS \nExpansion Act, or the POLICE Act. This legislation will provide law \nenforcement officers with training to handle active shooter situations. \nThe bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, National District Attorneys \nAssociation, Major County Sheriffs Association, and the Sergeants \nBenevolent Association. I was proud to join Senator Cornyn as the lead \nDemocratic sponsor of this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn for this. We have worked together on many law \nenforcement things over the years, and I think both Senator Cornyn and \nI have tried to demonstrate that law enforcement should not be a \npartisan matter, and we have done this in a bipartisan fashion.\n  So many officers have heroically responded to active shooter \nsituations. This week the President bestowed upon several officers the \nMedal of Valor for their response to active shooters, including three \nCalifornia officers who confronted a gunman during a rampage at a \ncommunity college that left five people dead in 2013; a New York \nofficer who arrested, at a crowded hospital, a gunman who already had \nkilled another officer; and a New York sheriff's deputy who confronted \nand subdued a gunman who had wounded others and posed a threat to \nstudents at a nearby school.\n  But I think we cannot rely on heroism alone. Senator Cornyn mentioned \nthe training that helped end an active-shooter incident in Texas. \nUnfortunately, active-shooter incidents have become all too common, \noccurring in shopping malls and schools, the workplace, anywhere people \ngather. No State is immune, including my own State of Vermont. All of \nour Nation's officers should receive training on how to handle such \nsituations so they can respond effectively to protect the public and to \nprotect themselves. The POLICE Act will help make such training \navailable.\n  However, the burden of protecting the public from active shooters \nshould not fall solely on the shoulders of our law enforcement \nofficers. Congress must do more to prevent active shooter situations. \nThat means preventing criminals and those who seek to cause harm from \nacquiring firearms in the first place. That is why the Senate should \npass the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act that I sponsored with \nSenator Collins, which would provide law enforcement the tools they \nneed to investigate and deter straw purchasers and gun traffickers. \nCongress must not become so numb to tragedy after tragedy that we fail \nto fulfill our duty to legislate, even when the issue involves \nfirearms.\n  As I said, Senator Cornyn and I have made it very clear that \nsupporting our Nation's law enforcement officers in reducing gun \nviolence is not a partisan issue. While we are making progress, much \nmore remains to be done. I stand ready to work with anyone--Republican \nor Democrat--on commonsense\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nways to keep our law enforcement officers and communities safe.\n  I applaud the Senate for passing this, I urge the House to quickly \npass it, and I know the President will sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2933-1"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2935-S2969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                             Wind Turbines\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in 1867, when the naturalist John Muir \nfirst walked into the Cumberland Mountains, he wrote: ``The scenery is \nfar grander than any I ever before beheld. . . . Such an ocean of \nwooded, waving, swelling mountain beauty and grandeur is not to be \ndescribed.'' In January, Apex Clean Energy announced that it would \nspoil that mountain beauty by building twenty-three 45-story wind \nturbines in Cumberland County.\n  I can still recall walking into Grassy Cove in Cumberland County one \nspectacular day in 1978 during my campaign for Governor. I had not seen \na prettier site. Over the last few decades, pleasant weather and \nnatural beauty have attracted thousands of retirees from Tennessee and \nacross America to the Cumberland Plateau.\n  The proposed Crab Orchard Wind project would be built less than 10 \nmiles from Cumberland Mountain State Park, where for half a century \nTennesseans and tourists have camped, fished, and canoed alongside \nherons and belted kingfishers and around Byrd Lake. It will be less \nthan 5 miles from the scenic Ozone Falls State Natural Area, where the \n110-foot waterfall is so picturesque, it was filmed as scenery in the \nmovie ``Jungle Book.''\n  So here are my 10 questions for the citizens of Cumberland County and \nthe people of Tennessee:\n  How big are these wind turbines?\n  I have a picture somewhere; maybe it will show up in the next few \nminutes. Each one is over two times as tall as the skyboxes at the \nUniversity of Tennessee football stadium, three times as tall as Ozone \nFalls, and taller than the Statute of Liberty. The blades on each one \nare as long as a football field. Their blinking lights can be seen for \n20 miles. They are not your grandma's windmills.\n  Question No. 2: Will they disturb the neighborhood?\n  Here is what a New York Times review of the documentary ``Windfall'' \nsaid about New York residents debating such turbines:\n\n       Turbines are huge . . . with blades weighing seven tons and \n     spinning at 150 miles an hour. They can fall over or send \n     parts flying; struck by lightning, say, they can catch fire . \n     . . and can generate a disorienting strobe effect in \n     sunlight. Giant flickering shadows can tarnish a sunset's \n     glow on a landscape.\n\n  Question No. 3: How much electricity can the project produce?\n  A puny amount--71 megawatts. But that is only when the wind is \nblowing, which in Tennessee is only 18.4 percent of the time, according \nto the Energy Information Administration.\n  Question No. 4: Does TVA need this electricity?\n  The answer is no. Last year TVA said there is ``no immediate need for \nnew base load plants after Watts Bar Unit 2 comes online.'' That is a \nnuclear reactor. And just last week TVA put up for sale its unfinished \nBellefonte nuclear plant.\n  Question No. 5: Do we need wind power's carbon-free electricity to \nhelp with climate change?\n  No, we don't. Nuclear power is a more reliable option. Nuclear \nproduces over 60 percent of our country's carbon-free electricity, \nwhich is available 92 percent of the time. Wind produces 15 percent of \nour country's carbon-free electricity, but the wind often blows at \nnight when electricity is not needed.\n  Question No. 6: How many wind turbines would it take to equal one \nnuclear reactor?\n  To equal the production of the new Watts Bar reactor, you would have \nto run three rows of these huge wind turbines along I-40 from Memphis \nto Knoxville. And don't forget the transmission lines. Four reactors, \neach occupying roughly 1 square mile, would equal the production of a \nrow of 45-story wind turbines strung the entire length of the 2,178-\nmile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Relying on wind power to \nproduce electricity when nuclear reactors are available is the energy \nequivalent of going to war in sailboats when a nuclear navy is \navailable.\n  Question No. 7: Can you easily store large amounts of wind power and \nuse it later when you need it? The answer is no.\n  Question No. 8: So even if you build wind turbines, do you still need \nnuclear, coal, or gas plants for the 80 percent of the time when the \nwind isn't blowing in Tennessee? The answer is yes.\n  Question No. 9: Then why would anyone want to build wind power that \nTVA doesn't need?\n  Because billions of dollars of wasteful Federal taxpayer subsidies \nallow wind producers in some markets to give away wind power and still \nmake a profit.\n  The 10th question: Who is going to guarantee that these giant wind \nturbines get taken down when they wear out in 20 years and after the \nsubsidies go away?\n  Good question. The picture that was just put up--and I have another \nslide as well--is what Palm Springs, CA, looks like after it has been \nlittered with these massive wind turbines. My question for the people \nof Tennessee is, Do you want Cumberland County and Tennessee to look \nlike that? That is the question we need to ask ourselves.\n  Many communities where wind projects have been proposed have tried to \nstop them before they go up because once the wind turbines and new \ntransmission lines are built, it is hard to take them down. For \nexample, watch the documentary ``Windfall'' that I mentioned earlier.\n  In October, the residents of Irasburg, VT, voted 274 to 9 against a \nplan to install a pair of 500-foot turbines on a ridgeline visible from \ntheir neighborhood.\n  In New York, three counties opposed 500- to 600-foot wind turbines \nnext to Lake Ontario. People in the town of Yates voted unanimously to \noppose the project in order to ``preserve their rural landscape.'' Take \na look, and you can see why.\n  In Kent County, MD, the same company that is trying to put turbines \nin Cumberland County--Apex Clean Energy--tried to put down twenty-five \nto thirty-five 500-foot turbines a quarter to a half mile apart across \nthousands of acres of farmland where the air serves as a route for \nmigratory geese.\n  According to the Baltimore Sun, Stephen S. Hershey, Jr., a local \nState legislator, had introduced a bill that would give county \nofficials the right to veto any large-scale wind project in their \njurisdiction. Hershey said he put the bill in after learning that the \nturbines would be nearly 500 feet tall and spread across an area of \nthousands of acres. He called that a ``massive'' footprint ``in a \nrelatively rural and bucolic area.''\n  William Pickrum, president of the Board of County Commissioners, \nwrote the Senate committee that the project ``will certainly have a \nnegative effect'' on farming, boating, and tourism in the county and \nhurt property values. The legislation had the support of local \nconservation groups and of Washington College in Chestertown. The \nschool's interim president, Jack S. Griswold, warned in a letter to \nschool staff and supporters that the turbines would ``despoil this \nscenic landscape.''\n  I mentioned a little earlier how big these wind turbines are. These \nare not your grandma's windmills. I happen to know, even though the \nPresiding Officer is from North Carolina, he was born in Tennessee and \nknows a little bit about the football stadium in Knoxville.\n  This is one wind turbine, when placed in Neyland Stadium in \nKnoxville, which will hold 102,000 people. The turbine is over twice as \ntall as the skyboxes. Its blades go the whole length of the football \nfield. Its blinking lights can be seen for 20 miles. These are not your \ngrandma's windmills.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I voted to save our mountaintops from destructive \nmining techniques. I am just as eager to protect mountaintops from \nunsightly wind turbines. I have voted for Federal clean air legislation \nand supported TVA's plan to build carbon-free nuclear reactors, phase \nout its older, dirtier coal plants, and put pollution control equipment \non the remaining coal plants. Already the air is cleaner and our view \nof the mountains is better.\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\n  I hope citizens of Cumberland County--and all Tennesseans--will say a \nloud ``no'' to the out-of-State wind producers that are encouraged by \nbillions in wasteful taxpayer subsidies to destroy our mountains and \nmake them look like that.\n  Some say tourists will come to see the giant turbines. They may--\nonce. But do we really think tourists or most Tennesseans want to \nexchange a drive through the natural beauty of the Cumberland Mountains \nfor a drive along 23 towers that are more than twice as tall as Neyland \nStadium and whose flashing lights can be seen for 20 miles? If you do, \njust take another look at the photograph of what has happened in Palm \nSprings, CA.\n  If there is one thing Tennesseans agree on, it is the pride in the \nnatural beauty of our State. There are few places more beautiful than \nCumberland County. We should not allow anyone to destroy the \nenvironment of our State in the name of saving.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                            Opiate Epidemic\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise, as I have for the past few weeks, \nto bring stories of the opiate crisis that we have throughout my State, \nthe Presiding Officer's State of North Carolina, and all over this \ncountry.\n  This epidemic is something we have to face because it affects every \nperson in America right now. There is not a person I know of and not \nanyone, I believe, in America who doesn't know somebody in their \nimmediate family, extended family, or close friend who hasn't been \naffected by prescription drug abuse or illicit drug abuse.\n  I have been dealing with this since my days as Governor of the great \nState of West Virginia. As the Presiding Officer knows, it has ravaged \nmy State. We have been hit harder than any other State in the country. \nDrug overdoses have soared by over 700 percent since 1999. Just last \nyear alone, we lost over 600 West Virginians to opioids. These are \nlegal prescription drugs that are made legally in the country by a \nlegal manufacturer of pharmaceuticals. They are approved by the Food \nand Drug Administration, a Federal agency that is supposed to look out \nfor our well-being. They are being prescribed by the most trusted \nperson next to our family members, our doctors, and they are killing \nus.\n  Our State is not unique in that it has hit everybody. Fifty-one \nAmericans are dying every day--every day. We have lost over 200,000 \nAmericans. Two hundred thousand Americans have died since 1999. If we \nthink about that in epidemic proportions--we are talking about Zika. We \njust put $1.1 billion toward Zika. We spent $500 million on Ebola. All \nof these horrible epidemics that can cause devastation in America, we \nwill rise up and face. We haven't done a thing in this line. We need a \nserious culture change to get through the problem, and we need to \nchange approval of opiate drugs. Basically, FDA does not need to be \nputting out these powerful drugs. We don't need them. Think about the \nUnited States of America. Less than 5 percent of the world's population \nlives in our great country. Yet we consume over 80 percent of the \nopiates produced in the world. How did we become the most addicted? How \ndid we become so intolerant to pain that we have to have the most \npowerful drugs ever produced? We have to treat the way we look at this \ndrug coming to the market.\n  Also, 10, 20 years ago, anybody who did drugs, if they committed a \ncrime, we put them in jail. We have spent over $500 billion in the last \ntwo decades incarcerating people for nonviolent crimes. They come out \nas bad as they went in. We haven't cured anything. We have to change. \nWe are looking at sentencing guideline changes on nonviolent crime--\nnonsexual, nonviolent crime. Most addicts commit thievery. That is a \ntheft. It is larceny. That is where they get their sentencing from. So \nthey get sentenced, they get a criminal record, and they can't get a \njob. They are out of the market.\n  My State of West Virginia has the lowest workforce participation. \nOnly three things take you out of the workforce if you are an adult: If \nyou have an incarceration record, people will not hire you; if you have \na lack of skill sets; if you are addicted, you can't pass a drug test--\nor a combination of those three.\n  Something is going on. We can't fill jobs. People are telling me how \nbad the economy is. Then I talk to the employers who say: We can't get \npeople to pass a drug test. We can't get people into the marketplace. \nSo it is something we have to do.\n  My office continues to get flooded. I get letters from all over the \ncountry now because I invite that. I want them. Let me read your \nletter. Let's put a face and let's put a family on it. It is not just a \nhardship, it is not just poverty, it is basically every walk of life in \nAmerica. They are writing stories.\n  I want to read another story to you right now. This is Carolyn's \nstory. This is the grandmother writing to me:\n\n       Dear Senator Manchin,\n       I am enclosing a copy of the letter I sent to ``The \n     Journal'' in Martinsburg concerning the death of our son's \n     step-daughter. She died of a heroin overdose.\n       I consider myself Devon's grandmother, and at my age words \n     are my best weapon to fight the scourge that killed her.\n       Please, Senator, read my letter and then use it in any way \n     you see fit in the fight for the passage of ``Jessie's Law.''\n\n  We have talked about Jessie's Law. The Presiding Officer has been \nhelpful, and I appreciate it very much. It basically says: If you go to \nthe hospital and you know your child or a loved one in your family is \naddicted and the child is trying to overcome the addiction, then the \nhospital has the responsibility to stamp on their record ``addiction'' \nso they will be watching how they discharge them and the type of \nopiates they give them. You can't reaffirm an addiction by giving more \npills. So this is what we are fighting against.\n  She said:\n\n       Our granddaughter, Devon, that tall exuberant redhead who \n     laughed her way into our hearts, is now a statistic. Several \n     days ago our son called us to tell us that she had died the \n     night before from a heroin over-dose.\n       It wasn't her first over-dose by far, but the other times \n     someone had always managed to get her to the hospital. That \n     last time the friend shooting up with her couldn't help. He \n     died at her side. She still held the needle in her hand [that \n     killed her].\n       It was that quick.\n       Devon started her drug journey with prescription opiates.\n\n  She had been injured, she had an ailment, and she had pain.\n\n       When those pills weren't enough anymore, heroin stepped in, \n     and the downward spiral began.\n\n  Heroin steps in every time.\n\n       It isn't just the problem kids from poor neighborhoods who \n     get hooked, you know.\n\n  Everybody thinks it is because of the economic downturn. That is a \npart of it but not all of it.\n\n       Our granddaughter came from a stable, affectionate upper-\n     middle class home. Even though her parents tried their best \n     to save her with countless sleepless nights, multiple trips \n     to rehab, tough love and loving persuasion, that drug won the \n     battle.\n       Now, we are not even allowed to grieve. We must also \n     contend with the many forms of our anger; impatience with \n     Devon for not being stronger, rage at those who sold her the \n     drugs, frustration with the authorities for not doing more to \n     stop the trafficking or establishing more treatment centers, \n     and self-recrimination for maybe not doing enough. We also \n     are trying to cope with the guilt of feeling relief that her \n     hell has finally ended. There is nothing more we can do for \n     her now, no more treatments that we can try.\n\n  Can you imagine living with that? You tried everything, and then, \nfinally, when the end comes like that, you have a feeling of relief--\nand then you feel remorse for that. Can you imagine grandparents going \nthrough this?\n  Finally:\n\n       She's just gone. Just . . . gone . . .\n\n  People are now coming out. Before, people didn't want to tell me. \nThey were afraid. They had a son or a daughter in rehab, and they felt \nthat would be a scourge on their family. They didn't want to be \nembarrassed. So we never knew about it. It was a silent killer.\n  Then we saw young people--going through the obituaries, it doesn't \ngive the cause of death, but we can pretty much figure it out.\n  People are now saying: If we don't come out of the closet and talk \nabout it, we are not going to fix it. There is a lot that needs to be \ndone.\n  I am going to read another story that has a happy ending. I am going \nto read Chelsea's story, which I have read before.\n  This is a young girl from Boone County, WV. This young girl had \nstarted using drugs when she was 12 years\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nold--12 years old. Anything and everything that could happen to a human \nbeing--her dad was mayor of the town. He was mayor. She had gone \nthrough everything, hit bottom as far as bottom could be. The person \nshe went through drug court and drug rehab with died, couldn't get out. \nShe made it.\n  I am going to read hers now so we see a happy ending. Most of these \nstories are about the pain and heartache associated with opiate abuse, \nbut Chelsea's story is a little different. In February, on the Senator \nfloor, I read Chelsea Carter's powerful story on how she has overcome \nher opiate addiction, and today I am proud to say she just received her \nmaster's degree in social work from Concord University.\n  She said:\n\n       After being addicted to drugs since I was 12 years old [by \n     a neighborhood friend], I decided to go back to school and \n     teach others what I have been taught my whole life.\n       I received my bachelor's degree from West Virginia \n     University in the Art of Psychology in May of 2013 and last \n     Saturday May 7, 2016 I graduated with my Masters in Social \n     Work from Concord University.\n       I am currently working on my Alcohol and Drug Counseling \n     Licensure and also myself and seven other people are in the \n     process of opening up a Sober Living home in Danville, West \n     Virginia [her home area] called the Hero House.\n\n  They get no funding. They don't qualify for Medicaid, Medicare--\nnothing. What they are going to do is all going to be on love and \nkindness. Also, with the record she has now--because she has a felony \nrecord for grand larceny--it will be hard for her to get a job. We are \ntaking a person now with a master's degree out of the workforce. It is \nunbelievable.\n  She said:\n\n       I currently work for Appalachian Health Services as an \n     addiction therapist--\n\n  They went beyond that and hired her anyway. Most people will not.\n\n     --but my dream is to one day open my own inpatient treatment \n     facility and help other people who are just like me.\n       A message I would like people to know is that recovery is \n     possible, but you have to be willing to work at it.\n       It is a lot easier to go out on the streets and buy drugs \n     instead of trying to change your life, but the one thing that \n     recovery gives you that the drugs will never is your life \n     back.\n       I am living proof that if you want something bad enough you \n     can change.\n\n  We have to give them hope. We have to give them reasons. We have to \ngive them the ability to get back in the mainstream. This is the best \nexample of what can be done if we make investments, and the investments \nwe make are investments in human capital in the United States of \nAmerica and the spirit of America. This is what we are doing.\n  For the many stories I read that have such horrible endings, this has \na happy ending, and it helps many people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. He \nhas been a tiger on this issue, and I hope we will answer his call. The \nepidemic is no better in Connecticut, where most of our cities are on \ntrack to see a doubling of overdose deaths this year from last year, \nand last year was quadruple the number it was 3 or 4 years ago. I say \nthank you very much to my colleague from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3897\n\n  Mr. President, I am on the floor today to talk about an amendment to \nthe pending bill. It is an issue that a lot of us thought was decided \nby this body decades ago; that is, the prohibition of discrimination in \nhousing based on race, sex, religion, national origin, physical or \nmental disability, and family status. It is the Fair Housing Act.\n  In many ways, the Fair Housing Act was the culmination of the \nlegislative fight for civil rights in the 1960s. It was the first \neffective Federal law guarding against discrimination in the sale and \nthe rental of housing in the United States. For nearly 50 years, it has \nbeen employed to ensure that every American can choose where to live, \nfree from discrimination and the immoral and unconstitutional \nconsequences of residential segregation.\n  We have come a long way since the 1960s, but we are by no means all \nthe way there. Today, discrimination is still a reality in housing \nmarkets across the country. In every single State, there are cases of \nlandlords misrepresenting the availability of housing or outright \nrefusing to sell or rent to certain protected individuals or groups of \npeople. There are others who are given different terms and conditions \non a mortgage or on a rental contract, based on their race, their \ngender, or their physical disability. I hear these stories even in my \nState of Connecticut, which is a pretty progressive State.\n  For instance, Crystal Carter was a homeless single mother living in \nHartford, CT, with her five children, one of whom is developmentally \ndisabled. This is what she said, in her own words:\n\n       For two years, my family had jumped between homeless \n     shelters and staying with family and friends. I had searched \n     for affordable housing for several hours a day, every day, \n     and submitted dozens of applications. Then, I found out about \n     an open waiting list for rental vouchers in a suburban area. \n     I was excited at the chance to move to a safer area with \n     better schools for my children. But when I called the \n     suburban housing authority that managed the program, I was \n     told I couldn't even have an application because I didn't \n     already live in one of the approved nearby towns. I was also \n     told that it was someplace I wouldn't want to live anyway and \n     that I should be looking in Hartford or Bridgeport instead.\n\n  Johnnie Dailey is another victim of housing discrimination. Here is \nJohnnie's story:\n\n       In 2013, I was searching for a new home for my family, \n     including my young niece and grandson. I found a single-\n     family home that would have been perfect for my family. It \n     was on a quiet street where my niece and grandson could play \n     outside, and the rent was less than my current apartment. My \n     real estate agent called the listing agent for the property \n     and told her that I was very interested in renting the \n     property and that I had a Section 8 voucher. The listing \n     agent responded that the owner of the property, a Boston-\n     based company, would not rent to me because they were not \n     interested in accepting a Section 8 voucher. I was \n     discriminated against and denied the opportunity to rent the \n     property solely because I am someone who uses a Section 8 \n     voucher to pay part of my rent. To this day, when I think \n     about the discrimination I experienced, I feel upset and \n     embarrassed.\n\n  Crystal's and Johnnie's stories are two of tens of thousands of \nstories from across the country that underscore the need for the Fair \nHousing Act. We have made progress, but we aren't done. While the Fair \nHousing Act rose out of the fight for civil rights for African \nAmericans, we also need to remember today that over half of all \nreported complaints of housing discrimination are initiated by people \nwith disabilities. There are veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan with debilitating injuries that have altered their lives \ncompletely. These individuals also include a growing number of elderly \nAmericans who are living with disabilities.\n  As a Nation, we know we are stronger and better when we assure access \nand opportunity for all Americans, including the 57 million Americans \nwho are living with disabilities today.\n  Unfortunately, civil rights laws are under attack today. It is not a \nposition that is endorsed wholesale by the Republican Party, but there \nis a coordinated effort on the right to use every tool possible to \nstrip civil rights protections from African Americans, Hispanics, the \ndisabled, and the poor. We saw this in the successful campaign to get \nthe Supreme Court to invalidate portions of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Now on the floor of the Senate, we are talking about an amendment \nthat would gut the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. This amendment, \nwhich is offered by my friend Senator Lee, would effectively stop the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development from being able to enforce \nthe Fair Housing Act. The law would stay on the books, but the \nDepartment couldn't enforce some of the most important elements.\n  One of the elements, passed in the 1960s, is an affirmative \nrequirement that States and cities take steps to remedy discrimination \nthat exists in their community. The Fair Housing Act, which is a \nbedrock of our civil rights laws, has held for decades that it isn't \nenough to band discrimination based on race, disability, or gender. \nLocal jurisdictions have to do something to make discrimination less \nlikely for renters and home buyers. This isn't new; this has been on \nthe books since the 1960s. But a few years ago, GAO discovered in a \nreport that most localities weren't doing this; they were ignoring that \naspect of the law. Appropriately, HUD clarified the obligations\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\nunder this section of the Fair Housing Act so that cities and towns \nknow exactly what they need to do to assess the scope of discrimination \nin their area and to better understand their obligations under the act \nto fix the problems.\n  Senator Lee's amendment would strip from HUD the ability to enforce \nthis part of the law, and that is a shame. We can close our eyes, box \nour ears, and pretend discrimination doesn't exist, but if that is what \nmy Republican friends want to do, it is a grievous mistake. We aren't \nin a postracial world. We don't live in a society where the disabled \nalways get a fair shake. Discrimination exists, and the Federal \nGovernment, since the beginning of this Republic, has taken seriously \nits moral and constitutional responsibility to ensure that everyone \nliving under the protection of this government gets an equal chance at \nsuccess--no matter their race, their gender, their ability, or their \ndisability.\n  I am dismayed that 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights \nAct, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act, the fundamental \ncivil rights that have been granted to every American still need to be \ncontinually shielded from attempts to dismantle them. Any limitation or \nreversal on HUD's ability to enforce the Fair Housing Act would for us, \nas a Senate, be to ignore the moral compass that has guided our \nNation's commitment to civil rights over decades and decades of \nprogress.\n  I am encouraged that Chairwoman Collins and Ranking Member Reed both \nintend to oppose the Lee amendment. I urge all of my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am waiting on Senator Reid, who will be \ncoming here to make a motion with regard to the Zika crisis. While we \nhave a moment, I want to set the table.\n  Can you imagine being a pregnant woman in the southern part of the \nUnited States this summer in a poor county that does not have the funds \nfor mosquito control? That pregnant woman knows that if she gets bitten \nby the aegypti mosquito carrying the Zika virus, there is a good chance \nthe virus is going to infect the baby in her womb and could have \nconsequences, all of which we have seen in these very disturbing photos \nof children born with deformed heads.\n  As a matter of fact, the doctors in the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention tell us that the baby can be born with no abnormalities \nbut the abnormalities appear later in the child's development after \nbirth. Can you imagine being a pregnant woman in the southern part of \nthe United States in a poor county--a poor county such as counties in \nthe State of the Presiding Officer--that doesn't have the funds for \nmosquito control? What about a rich county that has run out of funds \nbudgeted for mosquito control?\n  If you are going to control the Zika virus, you either have to have a \nvaccine, which they are working on, or you have to be able to stop the \nmosquito from being able to reproduce. They are working on genetic \nalterations, but both of those take time. In the meantime, there is \nonly one thing to do.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON. I want to finish my statement.\n  In the meantime, if you don't have a vaccine and you don't have the \nability to stop the mosquito population, the particular strain that \ncarries the virus, there is only one thing to do, and that is mosquito \ncontrol. That is what local counties, cities, and States are begging us \nnow, as was indicated by the letter that I introduced from Osceola \nCounty, which is right next to the county of Orlando, Orange County. It \nis a relatively well-off, affluent county, but they don't have any more \nmosquito control funds. As we go into this summer with the rains, that \nraises the concern that it doesn't have to be a pond with stagnant \nwater; it can be a bottle cap that is filled with water where the \nmosquito lays her larvae and they hatch.\n  Yes, I will yield to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Florida \nyielding for a question.\n  I wish to ask the question, Is the Senator aware that $580 million of \nunspent Ebola funds has been reprogrammed by the Obama administration \nas a down payment on dealing with this impending crisis?\n  Mr. NELSON. Indeed, this Senator is aware of that. Thank goodness \nthere was this pot of money so that the administration could start this \nbecause we haven't been doing anything in Congress to produce the \nemergency appropriations. Thank goodness there was a pot of money they \ncould borrow.\n  Did you know that there is Ebola that is erupting in Western Africa \nright now? Don't we have a responsibility to replenish that Ebola fund?\n  Mr. President, I said I was going to talk until Leader Reid arrived. \nHe is here, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a long, pleasant relationship \nwith the senior Senator from Florida. We served in the House together. \nWe have served in the Senate together. I have great admiration for him \nand his loving wife Grace, and I am happy to be on the floor with him \ntoday. People in Florida are so fortunate to have this good man \nrepresenting them.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3038\n\n  Mr. President, look at this map behind me. There are two types of \nmosquitoes that carry this disease--this condition, this virus. We see \nthis map here, which covers 39 States. It goes without saying that they \nare not subtropical States. They are not Florida. They are not \nLouisiana or southern Texas. They are places like Boulder, CO, and Las \nVegas, NV. Are those States subtropical? No, I don't think so. We get 4 \ninches of rain a year. It goes up into Maine.\n\n  This is a serious issue which will affect 39 States. As the weather \nwarms, the mosquitos will multiply and people will be bitten by these \nvicious little insects.\n  Mosquitos have been causing problems in the world for centuries, but \nnever to anyone's knowledge has a mosquito caused the types of birth \ndefects that are now happening with the Zika virus.\n  The virus was discovered in 1947 or 1948 in Uganda. In fact, ``Zika'' \nis the name of a forest there and means ``overgrown.'' Over the \ndecades, something has happened and these mosquitos have become so \ndangerous.\n  This virus is a threat to people living in these areas, and it is as \nreal as it gets. Right now, the focal point is on two places, but it is \nchanging as we speak. The American citizens of Puerto Rico have been \nhammered. That poor territory of ours has had so many problems--all the \nmoney problems they are having, compounded by the fact that tourism is \nbeing damaged significantly as a result of this Zika virus.\n  It is not only the birth defects this virus causes, which are so \nrepugnant and scary, but this virus also has the ability to create very \nserious problems with paralysis in human beings. It has happened, and \nthere are already reported cases of that.\n  This is a ravaging problem. Puerto Rico now has almost 1,000 reported \ncases, which include at least 128 pregnant women and probably more. One \ncitizen died in Puerto Rico as a direct result of the Zika virus. It is \nestimated that 20 percent of the Puerto Rican people--or 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion--will be infected with this virus. We are talking 700,000 \nAmerican citizens.\n  As of May 11, there were 1,200 Zika cases on the mainland, and \nSenator Nelson has talked about that in detail--as well he should as a \nrepresentative of that State. No State is on the frontlines of this \nravaging problem more than the State of Florida. It is a nightmare, and \nwho knows how long before this map becomes our national nightmare. No \none is making this up. This is serious.\n  Somehow, the Republican-controlled Congress still hasn't sent a bill \nto the President's desk to provide emergency funding so we can fight \nthis devastating virus.\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\n  If we were here talking about a national emergency--floods, fires, \nearthquakes, all of the many issues we often come to the floor to talk \nabout--my friend from Texas is on the floor. How many times have we \ncome to this floor to help the State of Texas? We have helped Texas so \nmany times, and we were all glad to do it, to pass emergency \nsupplemental bills to help the citizens of the State of Texas. There is \nno reason that I can understand why we don't have a piece of \nlegislation on the floor just like we would if there were a flood, \nfire, or some other emergency in a State. But, no, we are going through \na process that will never end in time to take care of the problem.\n  Under the present process we have, this emergency spending is part of \nthe appropriations bill. Everyone knows that the House can't even get a \nbudget. They can't do their appropriations bills. How are we going to \ntake these issues to conference when the House can't even come up with \na budget? I don't know how we can do it any sooner than sometime toward \nthe end of this fiscal year, which is September or October. By then, \nthe summer will be beginning to be gone, but the mosquitos and the \ndevastation they have left will not be gone.\n  Experts tell us they need this money and they need it now. Yesterday \nI met with the President's Director of Management and Budget, Sean \nDonovan, and it is clear that they desperately need this money.\n  It sounds as if my friend from Texas is saying: We have the Ebola \nmoney; use that. They are still working on Ebola. What was the \nemergency we had here 2 years ago? It was Ebola. What did we do? We \nprovided the money so they could do the research to alleviate the \nspread of this scourge, and they are doing that now. We are robbing \nPeter to pay Paul. That is actually what we are doing.\n  The $1.1 billion for Zika that we invoked cloture on yesterday is a \nbandaid. It is not enough. Congress isn't moving fast enough to give \nthe researchers, doctors, and public health officials what they need to \ncombat this virus.\n  Now the House is going to make it even worse by passing a bill for \n$622 million. What would you guess they are going to use to fund this \nmoney? Let's see. What could it be? Oh, maybe ObamaCare, which they \nhave tried to defeat 67 times, and each time it ends up the same. \nEinstein's definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over \nagain and expecting a different result. That is what we have with the \nHouse Republicans, and I am sorry to say this, but it has spilled over \nhere too. They haven't tried to eliminate it over here that many times \nbut as many times as they could. They are going to come up with a bill \nto provide $622 million, which will come from a number of resources, \nbut it will principally be ObamaCare money. And $622 million is a \nfraction of what is needed. It is approximately 25 percent of what is \nreally needed.\n  To say that the appropriations process is too slow is a gross \nunderstatement. We need to get this done now. I don't know when, if \never, these appropriations bills will be signed into law.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases, has been at the forefront of all of these dreaded \nproblems we have had in recent decades. He was a leading advocate \nscientifically during the AIDS epidemic we had. Here is what he said: \n``When you've got an emergency situation, you really need to get \nfunding as quickly as possible.''\n  The time to act is now. This summer, when Zika is on the news every \nday, which it will be, Senators will regret that they did not act \nquickly to address this crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to take care of this today and provide the $1.9 \nbillion in emergency money, just as we have done with any other \nnational emergency we have taken care of on this floor numerous times, \nand do it in a procedural way that will get the money to them the \nquickest.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 157, H.R. 3038; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken; that the Nelson substitute \namendment to enhance a Federal response and preparedness with respect \nto the Zika virus, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that there be up \nto 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended, and there be no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, our \nDemocratic colleagues won't take yes for an answer. Yesterday the \nMurray-Blunt language, which now the Democratic leader calls a bandaid, \nactually obtained cloture, and I expect it will pass tomorrow as part \nof the underlying appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, $1.1 billion on top of the $585 million that has \nalready been reprogrammed from the Ebola fund to be used to combat the \nZika virus is not a bandaid; it is a serious effort in a nonpartisan \nway to address a public health challenge.\n  As we can see from the map, Texas is right in the crosshairs. We are \nground zero in the United States, along with Florida, Louisiana, and \nother Southern States where this mosquito is present. Thank goodness no \nmosquito-borne transmission has occurred yet. But I agree with my \ncolleague from Florida. This is a serious matter, and we need to treat \nit seriously, but that is not what is happening now.\n  This is a bill that the Senate defeated cloture on yesterday, and \nthis is an attempt to end run that defeat of a vote before the entire \nSenate. I am compelled to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know what my friend from Texas is going to tell the \npeople from Texas this summer when there is no money available. We \nheard the Senator from Florida talk about the need for local \ngovernments to prepare for this virus. Some of this stuff is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  How do you get rid of mosquitoes? You can't wish them away. They \ndon't go away that way. We get rid of mosquitoes by mosquito control, \nand that takes money. Where does that money come from? It comes from \nlocal governments. That is why Florida is desperate for money, and they \nwill be desperate for that money in Texas and everyplace else. Using \nthe logic of my friend from Texas, don't worry about it. We will get \nyou some money this fall. The money we voted on yesterday at the very \nearliest will not come until we wrap up our appropriations bills.\n  I remind everyone that the House is stuck. They can't do \nappropriations bills because they don't have a budget. They can't get \npeople to agree to what they want to do. My friend Paul Ryan has seen \nwhat John Boehner had to put up with all of those years before they ran \nhim away from the Speakership, and he is having the same problem. This \nman who talked about budgeting--that was his key. He was the idea man. \nPaul Ryan can't get a budget with his own Republicans in the House.\n  I think that my friend is saying: We got a downpayment. We took the \nmoney from Ebola. We will worry about Ebola later, and maybe we will \nborrow that money from someplace else to continue our research on \nEbola.\n  Senator Schumer mentioned in a meeting we had a short time ago that \nthe one thing he remembered about the last time Dr. Fauci came to our \ncaucus and talked about this dread problem was that he said that the \nNational Institutes of Health is very close to coming up with a vaccine \nfor this. But we take this money--just like when we had sequestration, \nthey were close to a flu vaccine, and that is gone. You have to do it \nwhen you can, and right now is an opportunity for us to do something to \nsave the lives of people and especially these unborn infants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I apologize to the Democratic leader. \nApparently I wasn't able to communicate my point, which is that there \nis already $580 million available today to combat the Zika virus. \nFinally, the administration took the advice of those on this side of \nthe aisle and said: Let's take the unused Ebola funds to fight it today \nwhile we have an orderly process by which we appropriate the money in a \nresponsible way.\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\n  I think the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, and Senator Blunt, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, \nhave done a good job of winnowing down the $1.9 billion request to the \n$1.1 billion which I agree is the right figure. While we have some \nother differences, I think the Senate is acting in a responsible and \nbipartisan way, which is the only way things can actually get done \naround here.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it wasn't because of the good graces of the \nMembers of the Republican Senate that President Obama took the money \nfrom Ebola and put it into fighting the problems we have with Zika. The \nPresident asked for this money 3 months ago. They took that money out \nof desperation because they had no other place to go for the money. \nThat money is not sitting there waiting to be spent; it has been spent.\n  They need money. They are out of money. There is no more robbing \nPeter to pay Paul. This is an emergency, and it should be handled now \nbecause under the process we have, the earliest there will be help for \nthis will be this fall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3038\n\n  I have to say that I am really disappointed that Republicans once \nagain rejected the administration's full emergency supplemental \npackage.\n  It has been more than 3 months since President Obama first put \nforward a proposal to fight this Zika virus. He laid out what he \nthought he needed to respond to a crisis in a way that protected our \nfamilies the best. His administration was here. They testified at \nhearing after hearing after hearing about the details of this proposal \nand made it clear that there was absolutely no reason for Congress to \nwait.\n  But, for months, our Republican leaders did nothing. They delayed. \nThey came up with one excuse after another. They ignored the experts, \nignored the scientists, and ignored the facts.\n  Some Republicans were saying that Zika wasn't something they were \nwilling to give the administration a penny more for. Others said they \nwould think about more money to fight Zika but only in return for \npartisan spending cuts. And others spent more time thinking about how \nto get political cover rather than actually trying to address this \nenormous problem.\n  But many of us knew how important this was, and we were not going to \ngive up. We kept the pressure on. We kept pushing to get serious about \ndealing with this emergency, and we made sure that the mothers and \nfathers across the country who are scared and who wanted their \ngovernment to fight this horrific virus had a voice in this process.\n  So while it shouldn't have taken so long, I am glad that this week \nmany of our Republican colleagues in the Senate did finally join us at \nthe table to open up a path for an important step forward. This was a \ncompromise proposal, and it certainly isn't what I would have written \non my own.\n  For example, I want to note that throughout this process, I have made \nit clear that a top priority of mine is making sure that women do have \naccess to reproductive health care in light of the impacts of this \nvirus. So I was disappointed that the Republicans insisted on including \nunnecessary language that simply reiterates the preexisting ban on \nFederal funding for abortions.\n  But this bipartisan agreement that we voted on yesterday would \nsupport community health centers and other providers in making sure \nthat women have access to contraception and other critical health care. \nIt would help make sure that women in Zika-affected areas have the \nability to plan their families and prevent these tragedies, like so \nmany we have already seen, especially compared to the House legislation \nthat includes no support for preventive health care or outreach for \nfamily planning. I believe these resources are extremely critical, and \nI am going to keep fighting to continue getting us to expand this to \nthe full range of reproductive health care that women need.\n  We also didn't get the full amount we had hoped for in this \ncompromise. Democrats still believe that Congress should give the \nPresident the full funding this administration has asked for and needs.\n  But I am glad that, with every Democrat and 23 Republicans willing to \ndo the right thing, we are going to pass a $1.1 billion down payment on \nthe President's proposal and do it as an emergency bill without \noffsets--the way it ought to be.\n  So I want to thank Senator Blunt, who worked with me to get this \ndone, as well as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who voted for \nit. Our bipartisan agreement will provide direct investments with a \nZika response in Puerto Rico. It will ramp up prevention and support \nservices for pregnant women and invest in foreign aid for Latin America \nand the Caribbean. It will help accelerate development of a vaccine and \nbackfill nearly $100 million in funding the administration was forced \nto reprogram due to the Republicans' refusal to act.\n  Our agreement would accelerate the administration's work and allow \nmoney to start flowing to address this crisis, even as we continue to \nask for more as needed.\n  Unfortunately, now we know that House Republicans have gone in a very \ndifferent direction. They released an underfunded, partisan--and, \nfrankly, in my opinion--mean-spirited bill that would provide only $622 \nmillion, which is less than a third of what is needed for this \nemergency, without any funding for preventive health care or family \nplanning or even outreach to those who are at risk of getting the Zika \nvirus.\n  They are still insisting that funding for this public health \nemergency be fully offset and that the administration should siphon the \nmoney away from the critical Ebola response and from other essential \nactivities in order to fund Zika efforts.\n  The choice between the Senate and the House Zika bills is a choice \nbetween acting to protect women and families and doing nothing at all. \nIt is a choice between a bipartisan compromise that takes an important \nstep forward to address this emergency and a partisan embarrassment \nthat is intended to do nothing more than provide Members with political \ncover. That doesn't solve this emergency.\n  The partisan House bill is a nonstarter, but we do have a path \nforward. The Senate bill has the support of Democrats and Republicans. \nIt can move through the House, it can be signed into law, and it can \nget resources moving quickly to tackle this emergency quickly.\n  So let's get this bill to the House as quickly as possible. Every \nDemocrat and a little less than half of the Republicans supported the \nbill. Let's send it to the House right now and urge them to pass it as \nquickly as possible.\n  There is no reason to keep it attached to this bill we are on and \nallow House Republicans to get it and slow-walk it into the fall, as \nour leader suggested would happen. There is no reason this funding \ncannot be approved and signed into law next week in time for the summer \nand the peak of mosquito season, which the Senator from Florida knows \nis coming very rapidly.\n  It has the support of the Senate on its own. Let's send it to the \nHouse on its own. Women and families in this country have been looking \nto Congress for action on Zika for months, and we here in the Senate--\nand House Republicans--should not make them wait any longer.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 157, H.R. 3038; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken; that the Blunt-Murray substitute amendment \nto enhance the Federal response and preparedness with respect to the \nZika virus be agreed to; that there be up to 1 hour of debate, equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, again, our \ncolleagues won't take yes for an answer. The amendment of the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nWashington, along with Senator Blunt, the chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee responsible for this, actually obtained \ncloture and will pass tomorrow--tomorrow--as part of this underlying \nappropriations bill, assuming that there are no other objections or \nthat people want to finish that legislation. So I don't really \nunderstand why they continue to refuse to take yes for an answer.\n  I would say to my friend from Washington: Would the Senator modify \nher request to include my language at the desk, which has the exact \nsame funding levels as the Blunt-Murray amendment but includes a pay-\nfor using the prevention fund in the Affordable Care Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Washington so modify her \nrequest?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \njust say that the spending bill that this has now been attached to may \ntake months--into the fall or even into the winter months--before it is \napproved. The Zika virus isn't going to wait for the winter months. The \nmosquitoes are here now, and they will continue to move very rapidly \nacross the country, as our leader has outlined before. So taking it out \nof this bill--it has now been approved by a number of Senators on a \nbipartisan basis--and moving it quickly to the House and getting it to \nthe President's desk means they will have the resources as quickly as \npossible to deal with this and to begin to deal with this in a \nresponsible way.\n  Secondly, let me just say that the request that the Senator from \nTexas has just broached means that we are going to have to fight over \ncuts--cuts to women, cuts to families, cuts to critical health care \nefforts in order to fight the Zika virus. That is objectionable. This \nis an emergency supplemental, as we agreed to yesterday, and it needs \nto move forward that way. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to respond briefly to my friend \nfrom Washington. The prevention fund that was created by the Affordable \nCare Act that is part of the President's signature health care bill has \nmore than adequate money in it to pay for the research, the mosquito \neradication, and the other services that are necessary. It is not \ndepriving anyone of money that they otherwise would have coming.\n  What it does do is it alleviates the financial burden on future \ngenerations to actually pay the money back that we insist on spending \nwithout providing for adequate offsets. So increasing deficits is why \nthe national debt has almost doubled under this President because of \nthe reckless spending.\n  We are trying to do this in a responsible, bipartisan, and, indeed, I \nwould say, nonpartisan sort of way, but apparently that is not \nacceptable to our friends on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I have listened attentively to the \ndebate over the last 15 minutes about Zika, and it has been very \nentertaining to me. But it has also been interesting just to hear the \nnumbers being thrown around. There is a series of numbers being thrown \naround as if it is an apples-to-apples comparison.\n  So let me try to break down a few things with an apples-to-apples \ncomparison about Zika and the funding.\n  The President has asked for $1.9 billion for Zika. The Senate has now \nresponded back to say: We will do the $500 million the President has \nalready moved over from Ebola funding and add to it $1.1 billion to \ncome up with about $1.6 billion--almost $1.7 billion--so about $200 \nmillion short, which is being declared as grossly inadequate. That is \n0.2 short from what the President had asked for.\n  There is also being thrown around the House proposal, saying the \nHouse proposal is grossly inadequate to be able to cover what is being \ndiscussed there because it is a little over $600 million. The President \nwants $1.9 billion, and the House is offering $600 million. But what is \nnot being stated is that what the Senate has done and what the \nPresident has asked for is $1.9 billion over 2 years. The House has \nsaid a little over $600 million this year and added to the Ebola \nfunding that was already there--meaning $1.1 billion this year and then \nin our normal appropriations process to take it up again next year. It \nmay be the same amount.\n  It has become very fascinating to me to hear some say: Well, they are \ncutting it in half, and it is insulting and it is all these things.\n  I think to myself: It is the same numbers. They are just cutting the \ntimes to be able to break it down into different numbers.\n  So all of these number games are very interesting, but they still \ndon't drive at one essential thing. We do need to deal with Zika, but \nwe also need to deal with Zika in a fiscally responsible way. The \nassumption that to deal with Zika means we have to throw the budget out \nand there is no way we can find $1 billion in a $4 trillion budget to \ncover Zika is laughable.\n  So what I propose is something very simple. Right now, the Department \nof State, HHS, and USAID have $86 billion in unobligated balances--\nright now. There is absolutely no reason $1 billion of that could not \nbe moved to deal with Zika right now. It would be the exact same \nproposal that Senator Murray and Senator Blunt have proposed but \nactually doing it with unobligated balances. There is absolutely no \nreason that wouldn't occur.\n  We know that $500 million had already been moved over from Ebola \nfunding. That would be $1.6 billion moving over to help fight Zika.\n  The real issue to fighting Zika is three simple things. CDC is \nactually tracking the movements so we can stay attentive to it. The \nsecond thing is dealing with the mosquito population, which is \naggressive spraying. The third thing is working on a vaccine. All three \nof those things we can do, and all three of those things have already \nbegun. The research has already begun on the vaccine. The mosquito \nspraying has already begun, and working through the tracking and the \nmovement of the disease has already started. The implication that \nnothing can start until this body acts is not true.\n  The administration, starting in January and February, came in and \nsaid: This is urgent. We need to be able to move funds, and we need to \nbe able to have funds to do it.\n  Ironically, in January and February, they came and held hearings on \nthat, but in March of this year--2 months ago--this same administration \ntook half a billion dollars out of the economic support fund that \nCongress had allotted to them last December, which was earmarked \nespecially for--get this--infectious diseases. So in March of this \nyear, the administration took half a billion dollars out of the \ninfectious diseases account for international infectious diseases and \nmoved that over and gave it to the U.N. for the Green Climate Fund. Now \nthey come to us, high and mighty, and say we need $1 billion, when the \none-half billion dollars we already allotted that can be used right now \nalong with the one-half billion from Ebola, equaling $1 billion, was \nalready allotted by Congress--was already there--and could be in \noperation right now. They chose to reallocate to a different priority. \nSo it disturbs me to hear the administration saying, ``Why aren't you \ndoing anything about this,'' when we did last year, and then they spent \nthat money on green climate funds rather than spending it on Zika--what \nit was allotted for--infectious disease control.\n\n  So here is my issue. We need to do both. We need to deal with Zika, \nand we need to do it in a fiscally responsible way, and we can. I \nunderstand the term ``emergency'' means one simple thing, spend more--\nspend more and add more debt because it is an emergency.\n  I don't think Americans believe that with a $4 trillion budget, we \ncannot cover $1 billion from previous accounts. In fact, if we want to \nbe specific, the three accounts the Blunt-Murray amendment puts money \ninto--they are putting $1.1 billion into a set of accounts. If we took \nthose accounts alone, those accounts alone that they are adding $1 \nbillion to already have $15 billion in unobligated balances in those \naccounts right now.\n  We can be efficient in what we do and still treat things seriously, \nand I think we should. I think it is fiscally responsible to not just \nsay the Zika virus is\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\nmoving quickly so we need to add more debt to our children to respond \nto it. I think we can take care of our debt and take care of Zika.\n  For anyone who would say it is unheard of to be able to move funds \nfor an emergency like this, may I remind you in 2009, this same Obama \nadministration facing the H1N1 virus moving around the world, asked for \npermission to move unobligated balances out of some of these same \naccounts to deal with the H1N1 virus. We are just saying, if it is OK \nfor the H1N1 virus, why is it suddenly not allowable now dealing with \nZika? This is not about Zika anymore; this is about breaking the budget \ncaps.\n  We need to be responsible in our spending and responsible in how we \ndeal with Zika. Both things can be done.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer my amendment No. 3955 to the \nBlunt amendment No. 3900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I like the \nSenator from Oklahoma. He is a great friend, and it pains me to reserve \nthe right to object because I do consider him an excellent Senator.\n  However, the issue he raises in his unanimous consent request is to \ntake the emergency funding of $1.1 billion out of the appropriations \nbill and replace that emergency funding by raiding a number of funds \nthat would cut medical research and public health in order to address \nthe Zika virus. What I am talking about is raiding money from cancer \nresearch, children's immunizations, and the CDC's efforts to fight \nother infectious diseases that are already so important to the health \nand welfare of this country.\n  The Senator, whom I consider a friend and a good Senator, is from \nOklahoma in the heart of the country. Oklahoma is covered with these \ntwo strains of mosquitoes, both of which carry the Zika virus. This one \nis the real culprit. This is the one that gets inside your house. This \nis the one that lurks in the dark corners of the house. This is the one \nthat lays larvae in a rain-filled bottle cap that is sitting upside \ndown.\n  I would say to the Senator from Oklahoma that this Senator has \nprobably been bitten by more mosquitoes than any other Senator. There \nwas a time when I was a kid that I was bitten so much that I was almost \nimmune, but I do not want to be bitten by this critter carrying that \nZika virus.\n  The truth is, if you have an earthquake in the State of Oklahoma, \nthat is an emergency, and we are going to respond in kind. If the \nSenator from Texas has a hurricane coming into Galveston, that is an \nemergency, and we are going to respond. Likewise, this is an emergency. \nIf you don't realize it now in May, the summer months are coming.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands why we need to get this \nseparate from the appropriations bill that the Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Murray, is talking about. In order to get an appropriations bill, \nwe have to get an agreement with the House. The House just passed a \nbill for $622 million, and they are going to raid ObamaCare to pay for \nit. There is no way we are going to get an agreement that the President \nis going to sign going through that appropriations process. The summer \nis going to be long gone, and the aegypti is going to be biting all the \nmore, sucking the blood of Americans, and therefore, while doing that, \ntransmitting the virus into the bloodstream of Americans.\n  This Senator has already described the disastrous consequences for a \npregnant woman. We ought to be petrified if they are in a county where \neither it is poor and they don't have the funds for mosquito control or \nit is a well-off county and it is not budgeted and they are not ready.\n  It pains me to have to clash with my friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, there is one clarification I would like \nto be able to make. This amendment I have proposed--and would still \nstand by--allows us to be able to continue what is going on with \nmosquito eradication right now. That doesn't stop. I would hate for \nanyone in this body to promise every American that if we give DC enough \nmoney, we will make sure they are never going to be bitten by a \nmosquito. I am not sure that is a promise we would ever want to make \nbecause we can't keep that promise, but the amendment I propose gives \nthe administration the latitude to be able to select which accounts \nthis money would come from. We are talking about $86 billion of options \non multiple accounts from the State Department, USAID for international \naid, and also HHS. That is not for medical research and not for \nchildren getting immunizations. There is enough money in those \naccounts.\n  I will repeat back the same thing I said before. This administration \ntransferred one-half billion dollars just 2 months ago from the \ninfectious diseases account, noting, apparently, that we didn't need \nmoney in the infectious diseases account and moved that money to the \nGreen Climate Fund. So for the administration to say it is more \nimportant that the U.N. get green climate funds than dealing with the \nZika virus is a different set of priorities than where we are in this \nCongress and a different set of priorities than we put into place in \nDecember of last year.\n  This is an issue this administration already has the authority to \ndeal with. It doesn't have to come from cancer research. It can come \nfrom allocating accounts. But there is no reason to add debt to our \nchildren to also deal with mosquito eradication in the United States. \nWe can do both, and we should do both.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to address the subject before the \nSenate with regard to the HUD proposed rule, the Lee amendment, and the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. I do so as \none who has 35 years of experience in the housing business affected by \nthe Civil Rights Act, affected by the 1968 Fair Housing Act, and one \nwho has a good deal of working knowledge about what that accomplished. \nWhat that accomplished was the end of prejudice against African \nAmericans in the South and ethnic minorities in the Northeast and \naround the country to ensure that everybody had an equal opportunity--\nunderline the word ``opportunity''--to have safe, affordable housing. \nThat took place in 1968.\n  It has been a long time since 1968. Prejudice in America, although \nnever eradicated, is almost gone. Housing access is almost universal, \nbut there is one group of people in America who had very little access \nto housing because there is none available to them. We can identify \nthem not by their name, not by their region but by their ZIP Codes. \nThey are the neighborhoods of America that have contributed to the \ndecline of many families and much hope and opportunity for individuals. \nShow me a school system or a school that is not performing, and I will \nshow you rough neighborhoods. Show me an individual community that \ndoesn't have the tax base it needs, and I will show you a community \nthat doesn't have neighborhoods that are employed.\n  I want to bring to the attention of the Senate what I spoke on a year \nago on this floor--a gentleman by the name of Thomas G. Cousins from \nAtlanta, GA, who founded Cousins Properties, the most successful \ndeveloper in the history of Atlanta, GA; one of the leading developers \nin the United States of America and a man who gives back more than he \never takes.\n  He created the Cousins Foundation and set out in the early 1990s to \nfind a way to address the problems of poverty, ignorance, and crime in \ninner-city neighborhoods. He bought something called East Lake Meadows. \nSome of you have watched the Fed-Ex Championship on TV and seen $10 \nmillion prizes won by professional golfers. That is on a golf course \nthat 25 years ago\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nhad trees growing up in the fairway, dilapidated houses around it, and \nwas described as Little Vietnam.\n  But it is an area that Tom Cousins changed by changing minds, by \nchanging attitudes, and by talking about the things that could be done, \nrather than what could not be done. He knew that the best way to bring \nthose people out of poverty was to provide them with a good education. \nSo he came to the State Board of Education, which I chaired, and asked \nfor a waiver to create the first charter school in the Atlanta, GA, \npublic school system's history in East Lake.\n  He leased the school for $1 a year for 25 years and then built for \nthat neighborhood its own elementary school, called Drew Elementary.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Drew Elementary was the poorest testing school \nin the State of Georgia. This year, it is one of the top 10 in the \nState of Georgia out of 1,400. He changed the minds and attitudes of \npeople--not their race. But he changed their minds and their attitudes \nabout opportunity and about hope. He went into the community of \ndilapidated houses, crack houses, and meth houses, and bought those \nhouses up and raised housing prices. He fixed them up and began to \ncreate a market for those houses.\n  The kids that formed gangs on the streets became caddies at the new \ncountry club named East Lake Country Club. They went to Georgia State \nUniversity on Panther grants, granted to kids who are in need to get an \neducation. Many of the kids in Atlanta, GA, who are getting MBAs today \nwere educated in East Lake Meadows at Drew Elementary and had their job \nat the East Lake Country Club.\n  People do not associate golf courses, golf tournaments, and country \nclubs with areas of poverty and no housing, but East Lake is such a \nplace. Because they built a blend of all types of housing--section 8 \nhousing, rental housing, low- and moderate-income housing, midlevel \nhousing, upper level housing, and shopping centers and the like--they \ntook all of the things that the community did not have and then created \na market for them to come.\n  They created a movement with Warren Buffett called Purpose Built \nCommunities. Now, the HUD rule, which I have read, which is the issue \nof discussion today on the floor, is a rule that portends gathering \nmore information to try and find ways we can end the lack of housing \navailability for certain Americans by bringing in data and trying to \ncreate new ways to do that.\n  Tom Cousins did it with private sector money. He did it in \ncooperation with the banking industry. He created an idea and a dream \nand an investment. He began to bring down the barriers of \ndiscrimination and a lack of hope and brought prosperity to a community \nthat had not seen it--better educated kids, better developed \ncommunities, better schools, and the like.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article from the Wall Street \nJournal about Thomas G. Cousins and Purpose Built Communities printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 13, 2013]\n\n   Thomas Cousins: The Atlanta Model for Reviving Poor Neighborhoods\n\n                         (By Thomas G. Cousins)\n\n       America's greatest untapped resource isn't hidden in the \n     ground but is sitting in plain sight: the human capital \n     trapped in poor neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. The \n     people living where crime and incarceration are rampant \n     represent trillions of dollars in potential economic \n     activity. Investing in their well-being can be a social and \n     economic game-changer, but only if done in a way that \n     produces results.\n       For a half-century, charities, nonprofits and local and \n     federal governments have poured billions of dollars into \n     addressing the problems plaguing these Americans. But each \n     issue tends to be treated separately--as if there is no \n     connection between a safe environment and a child's ability \n     to learn, or high-school dropout rates and crime. This \n     scattershot method hasn't worked. A better approach is to \n     invest comprehensively in small, geographically defined \n     neighborhoods.\n       That's what our East Lake Foundation has discovered, \n     focusing on one corner of southeast Atlanta. Fifteen years \n     ago, East Lake Meadows, a public-housing project with 1,400 \n     residents, was a terrifying place to live. Nine out of 10 \n     residents had been victims of a crime. Today it is a safe \n     community of working, taxpaying families whose children excel \n     in the classroom.\n       How did this happen to a place that police officers once \n     wouldn't go without backup? We targeted a single neighborhood \n     in 1993 and worked with community and city leaders on every \n     major issue at the same time: mixed-income housing, a cradle-\n     to-college education program, job readiness, and health and \n     wellness opportunities.\n       The results are stunning. Violent crime is down more than \n     90%. Crime overall is down 73%--a level 50% better than the \n     rest of Atlanta. Employment among families on welfare has \n     increased to 70% from 13% in 1995. (The other 30% are \n     elderly, disabled or in job training.)\n       The income of these publicly assisted families has more \n     than quadrupled. In the surrounding area, home values have \n     risen at 3.8 times the city average (to over $250,000 per \n     home). A Wells Fargo bank, Publix grocery and Wal-Mart have \n     moved in, and restaurants, shops and other services have \n     returned.\n       The foundation started by focusing on housing. In 1996 and \n     1997, the Atlanta Housing Authority helped us secure \n     temporary housing for the East Meadow occupants while AHA and \n     the foundation rebuilt the place as Villages of East Lake. \n     With city and federal government approval, we reserved half \n     the units for families on welfare and the rest for those able \n     to pay the market rate. This was key: A mixed-income \n     community ensures that children are around role models--\n     employed adults who take care of property and spend time with \n     their children.\n       After negotiating with Atlanta Public Schools to secure the \n     city's first public charter, we built Charles R. Drew School. \n     The K-8 school, which opened in 2000, offered longer school \n     days and an extended school year. It now serves 90% of the \n     children in the East Lake neighborhood. Based on measures by \n     the Georgia Department of Education, Drew is the top \n     performing elementary school in the Atlanta school system.\n       The foundation also bought up surrounding residential and \n     commercial properties, including the old East Lake golf \n     course, once home to Grand Slam champion Bobby Jones. We \n     restored the golf course, which created 179 jobs. Then came a \n     smaller public course and a golf academy, where young people \n     now learn the caddy trade and golf course agronomy. Today, \n     East Lake Golf Club is the home of the annual PGA Tour \n     Championship and final playoff for the FedExCup.\n       Thanks to private investors, such as Warren Buffett and \n     Julian Robertson, we created Purpose Built Communities, which \n     helps other neighborhoods adapt the East Lake model. The \n     Meadows Community in Indianapolis and the Bayou District in \n     New Orleans have achieved considerable gains by emulating the \n     method in Atlanta.\n       Other organizations have slowly begun to adopt our \n     approach. Habitat for Humanity, which once focused on putting \n     up one house at a time, now partners with neighborhood \n     associations, churches, business groups and the like to help \n     lift up entire neighborhoods.\n       A better house by itself doesn't make children feel safe. \n     East Lake's charter school alone doesn't make children eager \n     to learn. But a decent place to live, a secure environment \n     with adult role models, and a great school with specially \n     trained teachers together produced change. Recently, a young \n     woman whose life began in the old East Lake public housing \n     project, where less than 30% of children graduated from high \n     school, graduated summa cum laude from Georgia Tech. She's \n     one of more than 300 Drew graduates since 2008 now heading to \n     college.\n       On the national level, challenges like the ones we faced in \n     southeast Atlanta are widespread and urgently need to be \n     addressed. More than 25% of American children under age 3 \n     live in poverty. Three million children drop out of school \n     every year, rendering them ineligible for 90% of jobs. Only \n     59% of students graduate from high school in the 50 largest \n     U.S. cities, and dropouts commit 75% of crimes.\n       These harsh realities make the way we choose to try to \n     change them all the more important. Charities, foundations \n     and government representatives are welcome to visit East Lake \n     to check out this turnaround story. They won't need to bring \n     backup.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Now, the current amendment before us deals with the rule \nthat is being promulgated by HUD dealing with the Civil Rights Act of \n1968. But I want to caution everybody. It is not about discrimination \nbecause of prejudice. It is about discrimination because of lack of \naccess. You read the testimony that went into a lot of the rule, and \nthat is quite clear. There are a number of paralyzed veterans groups \nand handicapped groups that have sent letters against this amendment. \nLet me tell you why are they against it. They don't think anybody \ndiscriminates against them because they are handicapped. They just \nthink they have no choice of housing because there is nothing that fits \ntheir wheelchairs or the walls in the bathroom are not reinforced or \nthe kitchen countertops are too high.\n  What has happened in East Lake Meadows and in Atlanta, GA, where \nPurpose Built Communities set standards, is that 5 percent of all \napartment buildings are built with convertible units. So up to 5 \npercent of the units can be converted to handicapped access: 36-inch \ndoors, not 30-inch doors;\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nwainscoting on the side walls in the bathroom that allow reinforcement \nrods to be put in and for handles to be put on the walls; kitchen \ncountertops that can be lowered by 8 inches so that somebody in a \nwheelchair can work their kitchen.\n  That is the type of access they want. Through the changes in code, in \nterms of construction code, and changes in attitude like Mr. Cousins \ndid, we now have handicapped people that have access to affordable \nhousing in Atlanta, GA, that is built to meet their specific needs. It \nis not discrimination of prejudice. It was discrimination of lack of \nopportunity.\n  The way I read the proposed rule, they are looking to take a chance \nto take advantage of things like Promise Built Communities and try and \nhave private developers use Federal access to funds to create ways to \ncreate new housing that will have more accessibility and affordability \nfor people in those type of situations.\n  Now, I understand that Senator Collins and Senator Reed have an \namendment they are going to offer, either as a side-by-side or as a \npart of the bill, which will clarify one important point: Nothing in \nhere contains anything that portends to promulgate a rule or regulation \nor any zoning at a local land use authority by the Federal Government.\n  None of us ever wants the Federal Government to do that. But we have \nprovided a lot of programs that have passed this Congress, this Senate, \nand this U.S. Government that promotes housing, such as section 8 \nhousing, FHA housing, and VA housing. I can go on and on. We want to \nmake sure that those finances that are available to finance purchases \nhave houses to be purchased that meet the needs of all Americans, \ngiving them a public accommodation and access that some of them never \nhad before.\n  So with the amendment adopted by Senator Collins, I think you are \nprotected against any nefarious activity that could ever be taken on by \nHUD, and you are doing a good thing for the State, a good thing for the \nUnited States, and a good thing for the Senate. I commend Senators Reed \nand Collins on what they are doing.\n  I rise in support of the Collins-Reed amendment, and I will vote for \nit on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I just want to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Georgia for his extremely eloquent and persuasive \npresentation. The example he gave us of the development in Georgia, \ndone by Mr. Cousins, is precisely what the HUD rule is intended to \npromote. That is why it is called affirmatively advancing fair housing, \naffirmatively furthering fair housing.\n  With the amendment that Senator Jack Reed, Thad Cochran, and I are \ngoing to be offering, we will make absolutely clear that it is not \nHUD's role to dictate or interfere with local zoning ordinances. But \nwhat we should embrace in this country is the goals of the 1968 Fair \nHousing Act. The Senator from Georgia, who knows more about housing \nthan any Member of this Senate, has stated very clearly and very \neloquently in the example that he has given us what the goals are of \nthe 1968 Fair Housing Act and the regulation that was issued by HUD \nlast year.\n  Again, I would note that the regulation issued last year came from a \nGAO report issued in 2010 that found that HUD was not doing a \nparticularly good job in this area. So it was not something that was \ndevised by some out-of-touch bureaucrat. It was directly the result of \nthe GAO report. The kind of mixed development, which has transformed \nneighborhoods in Atlanta and throughout this country and given hope and \nopportunity to those who may feel they are in the shadows of society, \nis exactly the goal of this regulation and of that famous civil rights \nera law, the 1968 Fair Housing Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to talk about housing issues \ncontained in the bill we are debating, and I want to talk specifically \nabout a project in Florida that we became aware of in October. It is \nnamed Eureka Gardens. It is a low-income, affordable housing project \nthat uses Section 8 funds to house people of lower income, as you are \nall aware of that program. It is run and owned by an organization \ncalled Global Ministries Foundation. It is run by a reverend, Richard \nHamlet. It is organized as a 501(c)(3), the organization that owns this \nbuilding. Mr. Hamlet, Reverend Hamlet, is the head of the organization.\n  If you look at the Web site for Global Ministries, there is a link \nthat says: ``What We Do.'' If you go to that section of the Global \nMinistries Foundation Web site, this is what it says they do: \n``Providing affordable housing across the United States and ministering \nto the physical, spiritual and emotional needs of our residents.'' That \nis what they state as their business purpose. I imagine that is what \nthey needed to state because of their 501(c)(3) not-for-profit status. \nHowever, we have a quote from Reverend Hamlet, who has said that his \ninvolvement in housing is purely business-related. He said:\n\n       This is a business. This isn't a church mission. These are \n     business corporations that we set up, but we're no different \n     from a real estate investment trust or a private equity \n     group.\n\n  That is how he described his 501(c)(3), not-for-profit Global \nMinistries Foundation.\n  Global Ministries has over 40 properties in multiple States--Alabama, \nFlorida, Indiana, Louisiana, North Carolina, New York, Tennessee, and \nGeorgia. In all of these States, in all of these properties, they have \nover 5,000 units that qualify as assisted. In 19 locations across \nFlorida, they have over 2,000 assisted units. This particular project \nin Jacksonville, FL, Eureka Gardens, has 396 assisted units.\n  This is the problem we found with some of these properties. In Eureka \nGardens, in the last year, the property was found to be in horrifying \ncondition. I have spoken of it on the floor before. I am talking about \npeople living in a place where there was mold on the walls, where the \nappliances were 15 years old, where the apartments hadn't been painted \nin 13 years, where windows didn't open, where staircases were literally \nfalling down, and where the city had to come in, evacuate people, and \ncondemn the property.\n  Those were the conditions in Eureka Gardens. We got involved last \nOctober to get those remedied. So there was the thinking, well, maybe \nthis is just one property. Maybe Global Ministries only has one \nproperty that is run this way but generally they are a good actor.\n  This is what we found: They have two properties--Warren and Tulane \nApartments in Memphis, TN--that have such poor living companies as well \nthat HUD pulled their Federal funding from the housing.\n  In Atlanta, we found that their Forest Cove property has been plagued \nby rodents and sewage. This is what news crews reported about their \nproperty in Atlanta. It said ``building, siding, and ceiling tiles \npeeling from many of the buildings. . . . Garbage and stagnant green \nwater were feet from playing children.''\n  At Forest Cove, this is what a tenant said to news reporters:\n\n       I'm homeless right now. I moved out to be homeless.\n\n  Because the conditions were so bad, the guy moved out of the \nproperty. In other words, he would rather be homeless than live in a \nGlobal Ministries Foundation property.\n  So we have two properties in Memphis, TN, we have a property in \nAtlanta, and then there is another property in Jacksonville that they \nown. The property is called Washington Heights. It also has been noted \nfor violation. HUD's most recent review resulted in the property barely \npassing Federal inspections. And I will have more to say about Federal \ninspections in a moment.\n  At the Goodwill Village property in Memphis, one resident said that \nhe thought the issue was snakes on the property--snakes on the \nproperty. He thought they were being caused because they were coming to \n``eat the rats.''\n  At Goodwill Village, the same property, a resident had an issue with \na gas leak. The resident's home had the sink torn out, her stove and \nhot water disconnected, and a hole put into her wall.\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nTwo months after all of that, no one had come by to fix it.\n  In Orlando, at the Windsor Cove Apartments owned by the Global \nMinistries Foundation, reporters saw holes in the walls where roaches \nand rodents came into the apartment. The same woman has a gap between \nher bathtub and the wall that lets water leak into the apartment below.\n  After issues with his properties were exposed, here is what Reverend \nHamlet said: ``No one should have to live under these conditions.''\n  They are your properties. It is not just one property; there are \nmultiple properties across multiple States. I want to focus \nspecifically on the one I visited last week in Jacksonville. It was an \namazing experience. Forty-eight hours before we announce we are coming, \nnothing--literally nothing--is happening at this property. When we \nannounce we are coming to visit the property, suddenly a bunch of \ncontractors show up. They put up a banner welcoming the residents to \nall the great stuff they do there. Suddenly work crews are walking all \nover, fixing the place up. All of a sudden, because we are coming to \nvisit, all these work crews mysteriously show up.\n  Eureka Gardens's problems have been going on for a long time, but \nthey only became known in October of last year when a local television \nstation and other local media began to highlight them.\n  My Jacksonville office staff toured Eureka Gardens in early 2015 and \nin October of 2015. I want to report what they found in that one \nbuilding. As I said, we have now had reports about other buildings with \nsimilar conditions run by this Global Ministries 501(c)(3), but I want \nto share what my staff found when they visited Eureka Gardens. They saw \ncrumbling stairs disguised with duct tape and covered with apparent \nblack mold. When I am talking about the stairs, I mean the stairs that \nconnect the first floor of the building with the second floor of the \nbuilding, these metal stairs. They would just put duct tape over the \nareas where the stairs and the wall were cracking and almost falling. \nThey just put duct tape on it. There was mold on these stairs; they \nspray-painted over it. My staff found faulty electrical wiring. Do you \nknow what they did with the faulty electrical wiring? They covered it \nup with a garbage bag so no one could see it. They could smell the \nnatural gas odor being sucked from an outdoor piping system into the \nair-conditioning units of residents, and they found all sorts of other \nhealth and safety issues.\n\n  At Eureka Gardens, when residents were asked about housing, one \nresident said, ``Dogs live better than this.'' In fact, there was a 4-\nyear-old living in Eureka Gardens who was suffering from lead \npoisoning, which her mother has a right to believe she got in her \nEureka Gardens apartment--an apartment, by the way, paid for with your \ntaxpayer money. Section 8 housing is Federal taxpayer money going into \nthe hands of these slumlords, and a child now has lead poisoning \nbecause of it.\n  In December of last year, HUD declared Eureka Gardens to be in \ndefault of the contract, and it set a February 24, 2016, deadline to \nmeet requirements. In February, Eureka Gardens passed this inspection, \nbut by March HUD had written to Eureka Gardens saying the Department \n``does not believe the property would currently pass another REAC \ninspection.''\n  Last Friday I visited Eureka Gardens. I saw, for example, an \napartment where the window did not open. I saw an apartment where the \nwindow did not open. The window had been cracked, and do you know how \nthey fixed it? Somebody came and put a glob of glue where the window \nconnects next to the pane, and if you tried to open the window, it \nwouldn't go up. That means if there was a fire in that house, the \nperson sleeping in that room would not be able to get out of that \nwindow unless they break it. I saw that with my own eyes last week when \nI was there. I saw an apartment that hadn't been painted in 13 years. I \nsaw a stove where the knobs were unrecognizable because they were \ncovered with glue, basically, and grime. I saw a refrigerator that \nlooked like it was from North Korea. It had to be 15 years old. There \nwas all sorts of rust on the side and they just spray-painted over the \nrust.\n  As I said earlier, 48 hours before I visited, Global Ministries \nstarted to fix some of these cosmetic issues. By the way, that included \nputting up a piece of wood with exposed nails and calling it a door. \nThis apartment has two exits--in the front and in the back. This lady \ngets home from work and she opens her back door. They have boarded up \nthe door, and there are nails sticking through the wood. She has little \nchildren. The nails were the kind that if you ran into that door \nbecause you didn't know it was there, you would get a nail to the face, \nto the heart, to the gut.\n  So you would ask yourself, all right, you have these owners of all \nthese units and they are getting this Federal money under this HUD \ncontract. Where does all the money go? What are they doing with all \nthis money they make? Well, you can look at their 990 tax forms, which \nare available for all 501(c)(3) organizations.\n  Let me tell you about the 2014 tax year, which is the most recent one \nthat is available. In the year 2014, the Reverend Richard Hamlet paid \nhimself $495,000 plus $40,000 in nontaxable benefits. Also in 2014, the \nReverend Hamlet's family members were paid an additional $218,000.\n  By the way, he had previously failed to disclose his family members' \ncompensation on tax forms, which is in violation of IRS rules that \nrequire CEOs to disclose the compensation of all family members who \nwork for an organization.\n  The IRS reports also show that between 2011 and 2013, Global \nMinistries Foundation--the landlord that owns all of these units in all \nof these buildings that your taxpayer money is paying for--shifted $9 \nmillion away from its low-income housing not-for-profit to its \nreligious affiliate. There is no one here who is a more strident \nproponent of private and public partnerships, of faith-based \ninitiatives, but you have these building that are crumbling. You have \nthese people living in these deplorable conditions. In addition to \npaying himself half a million dollars and his family another $218,000, \nthey took $9 million, and instead of using it to fix these units, they \ntransferred it to the other entity they had for religious purposes.\n  They don't seem to want to spend the money--including the taxpayer \nmoney--on making repairs, on making sure places like Eureka Gardens are \nliveable. Let me tell what you they do spend their money on. They spend \ntheir money on public relations specialists, because last week when I \nvisited Eureka Gardens, they had a public relations firm on the \npremises counterspinning me with the media, saying things like: Oh, \nwell, where has Rubio been all this time? Well, this became available \nin October, and since October we have been involved in it.\n  So they have the money to hire a law firm. They have the money to \nhire a lobbying firm. They have the money to hire a public relations \nfirm. They have the money to transfer $9 million from the not-for-\nprofit sector into their religious uses. They have the money to pay \nthemselves half a million dollars per year, plus $40,000 in nontaxable \nbenefits, plus $200,000 for family members, but they don't have the \nmoney to fix these units--and not just in Florida but all across this \ncountry.\n  Let me tell you what this behavior is. Let me tell you what Global \nMinistries Foundation is. It is a slumlord. They are slumlords. There \nare people who are living in these deplorable conditions while your \ntaxpayer money is going into their bank account, and they are laughing \nat us.\n  By the way, the other day, this minister--he has now put these \nproperties up for sale. He told the press: This is such a profitable \nbusiness. We have so many bidders who want these properties.\n  Well, No. 1, if it is such a profitable business, why are you \norganized as a 501(c)(3)? And No. 2, where is all the money? Where are \nall the profits? Why aren't they being invested?\n  I am all in favor of faith-based organizations being involved in the \npublic and civic life of this country, but as an organization that was \norganized on the principles of caring for others, this is not caring \nfor people. This, my friends, is the stealing of American taxpayer \nmoney, subjecting people to slum-like conditions, pocketing the money, \nliving off the money, and transferring the money.\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\n  For the life of me, I don't know how they passed any inspections. I \nam not a building inspector. You don't have to be one to visit this \nbuilding and know there is no inspection that building should ever \npass.\n  I would just say that this is the most outrageous behavior I have \nseen in public housing, and now I am hearing that the same conditions \nexist in Orlando and in other buildings in Jacksonville. We know they \nexist in Memphis. In fact, they just lost their HUD contract in \nMemphis. A judge just issued a ruling against them yesterday on another \nissue in Memphis, TN.\n  As a result of these conditions and other issues, I have filed four \namendments I wish to briefly talk about. The first is amendment No. \n3918, which passed. What it does is it shortens the required response \ntime for contract violations from 30 days to 15 days. Within the 30 \ndays that they found that gas leak at Eureka Gardens, four people at \nEureka Gardens were hospitalized due to gas leaks. So I am glad \nshortening the timeframe will be a part of it.\n  Another amendment we passed is one that basically asks HUD to \ndetermine the state of the assessments. Even the Secretary himself has \ntold me it is time to revisit these assessments. If you look at this \nproperty, there is no way it should have ever passed any inspections. \nWe need to fix the inspection process in HUD because there is no reason \na property like this should pass any inspection.\n  The third amendment I filed, and that I hope we can pass, would give \nState and local governments more say when HUD renews contracts for \nowners who have violated previous contracts. In essence, the amendment \nwould allow the Secretary to refuse to withdraw a notice of default if \nthe Governor of the requisite State petitions HUD to do that.\n  Currently, the only trigger for the Secretary to withdraw a notice is \na REAC score of 60 or above. If this amendment became law, if the \nproperty passed the inspection but the Governor of the State in which \nthe property is located requests the Secretary to overturn the result, \nthe Secretary would have the power to do so.\n  This impacts Eureka Gardens and these other places because flawed \ninspections led HUD to recertify properties that are not up to \nstandard. The Jacksonville City Council has been engaged and Mayor \nCurry of Jacksonville is supporting this amendment. It would grant them \nthe ability to seek the Governor's support in having a say over the \nproperties.\n  The last amendment I filed is Rubio amendment No. 3986, and it is to \nmake temporary relocation assistance available for residents in \nsituations such as those I have just described. This amendment would \nmake tenant protection vouchers available for tenants living in units \nwhere the owner has been declared in default of a HUD Housing \nAssistance Payments contract due to physical deficiencies, allowing the \nSecretary to consider granting tenant relocation vouchers sooner in the \nprocess.\n  The lack of temporary relocation assistance has kept these tenants \ntrapped in Eureka Gardens. The inability to temporarily relocate \nresulted in tenants being hospitalized because of gas leaks and other \ndifficult conditions. For example, a man had to sleep in his bathtub \nfor a week at Eureka Gardens, and tenants could not cook because the \nheat was shut off for days at a time.\n  One of the things we hear from HUD is: Well, we can take away the \ncontract, but then what happens to all these people? We don't want to \ndo that, and slumlords like Reverend Hamlet and his group know they can \nget away with this as a result.\n  There is probably more to be done. I said publicly that I think the \nJustice Department should look into these people. I think the Justice \nDepartment should look into places such as this. I think the IRS should \nexamine their tax status. I think people like this should never again \nbe allowed to have a single HUD contract anywhere in America. This is \nunacceptable, and it is happening right under our noses.\n  Today it is Eureka Gardens, but I mentioned all those other States. \nIn fact, I encourage my colleagues who live in the States of Alabama, \nIndiana, Louisiana, North Carolina, New York, and Georgia to look into \nthe properties that Global Ministries Foundation operates in your \nStates. If the trends continue, if the trends hold up, then I almost \nguarantee you are going to find slumlike conditions in your State the \nway they were found in my State and the way they were found in \nTennessee.\n  I hope I can earn my colleagues' support in bringing these reforms as \na part of the bill before us today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Overtime Pay\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe that real long-term economic \ngrowth is built from the middle out, not from the top down, and our \ngovernment and our economy and our workplaces should work for all of \nour families, not just the wealthiest few.\n  Across the country today, millions of workers are working harder than \never without basic overtime protection. That is why I am very proud to \ncome to the floor today to express my strong support for the new \novertime rule to help millions of workers and families in our country.\n  Back in 1938, Congress recognized the need for overtime pay. Without \novertime protection, corporations were able to exploit workers' time to \nincrease their profits. So the Fair Labor Standards Act set up a \nstandard 40-hour workweek. By law, when workers put in more than 40 \nhours, their employers had to compensate them fairly with time-and-a-\nhalf pay. But those protections have eroded over the past several \ndecades.\n  In today's economy, many Americans feel as if they are working more \nand more for less and less pay, and in many cases, they are. Right now, \nif a salaried worker earns just a little more than $23,000 a year, he \nor she is not guaranteed time-and-a-half pay. That salary threshold is \nmuch too low. In fact, it is less than the poverty level for a family \nof four.\n  Workers should not have to earn poverty wages to get guaranteed \novertime protection. It is clear that overtime rules in this country \nare severely out of date. Consider this: Back in the mid-1970s, 62 \npercent of salaried workers had guaranteed overtime pay. Today, just 7 \npercent of salaried workers have that protection. Big corporations use \nthese outdated overtime rules to their advantage. They force their \nemployees to work overtime without paying them the fair time-and-a-half \npay. That might be good for a big corporation's profit, but it is a \ndetriment to a working family's economic security.\n  Today, the Department of Labor has issued a final rule to raise the \nsalary threshold from about $23,000 to just over $47,000 a year. That \nwill restore protections for millions of Americans, and it is \nespecially important, by the way, for a parent. Think about what it \nwould mean for a working mom, who right now works overtime and doesn't \nget paid for it. By restoring this basic worker protection, she could \nfinally work a 40-hour week and spend more time with her kids or, if \nher employer asks her to work more than 40 hours a week, she would have \nmore money in her pocket to boost her family's economic security.\n  That is why this is so important for our struggling middle class. \nWhen workers put in more than 40 hours a week on the job, they should \nbe paid fairly for it. That is the bottom line.\n  I have heard from some of my Republican colleagues who don't want to \nupdate these overtime rules. If you listen closely, it sounds as though \nthey are trying to argue that businesses in this country can't operate \nunless they are able to exploit workers' time and refuse them overtime \npay.\n  Well, Democrats fundamentally disagree. In fact, when workers have \neconomic security, when they are able to make ends meet and succeed, \nbusinesses succeed, our economy succeeds. That virtuous cycle is part \nof what makes America great.\n  If Republicans want to take away these basic worker protections, they \nwill have to answer to millions of hardworking Americans putting in \novertime without receiving a dime of extra pay. They can try, but I \nknow that I and many others are going to be right\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\nhere fighting back for the workers and families we represent--families \nlike Meryle's from Bellingham, WA. She said that early in her career \nshe worked low-wage jobs and oftentimes her overtime hours went unpaid.\n  When Meryle heard about the Obama administration updating overtime \nprotections, she wrote in to comment on that new rule. She said those \nunpaid overtime hours hurt her pocketbook, but she said she lost more \nthan money. She was working overtime without being paid fairly for it \non top of missing out on important time with her daughter.\n  Boosting wages and expanding economic stability and security is good \nfor our families, and it is good for our economy. By the way, that is \nexactly what we should be focused on here in Congress to help build our \neconomy from the middle out, not the top down.\n  For workers who want fair pay for a day's work, for the parents--like \nMeryle--who have sacrificed family time for overtime and not seen a \ndime in extra pay, for families who are looking for some much needed \neconomic security, I urge all of my colleagues to support restoring \nthese important overtime protections.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Gillibrand and Mr. Grassley pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2944 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to revisit my discussion with \nSenator Durbin yesterday regarding my amendment No. 3925 to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs funding bill.\n  As I made clear yesterday, this is a commonsense amendment protecting \nconstitutional rights. It is designed to make every effort to ensure \nthat the Second Amendment rights of veterans are protected under the \nlaw. Yet the Democrats have objected. Because of that, our veterans \nwill continue to not be protected by their Second Amendment \nconstitutional rights.\n  Let me make myself very clear. Senator Durbin said my amendment \n``doesn't solve the problem.'' ``Doesn't solve the problem'' are his \nwords. Well, the Department of Veterans Affairs is reporting names to \nthe Department of Justice which are then placed on the national gun ban \nlist, and the VA is doing so merely when a veteran is appointed a \nfiduciary--which does not mean he or she is dangerous. That is the \nproblem.\n  As I explained yesterday, my amendment requires the VA to first \ndetermine that a veteran is a danger to self or others before reporting \nnames. That simply solves the problem.\n  Senator Durbin also said that under my amendment, ``mental health \ndeterminations would no longer count as prohibiting gun possession.'' \nAs I stated yesterday, I do not want people who are known to be \ndangerous to own and possess firearms. My amendment makes that very \nclear.\n  Further, given that plain language, it is obvious that under my \namendment, mental health determinations do count because some mental \nhealth problems equate to a very dangerous condition. Again, my \namendment is centered on forcing the Federal Government to determine \nwhether a veteran is a danger to self or others before revoking his or \nher constitutional rights to own a firearm.\n  Senator Durbin said that ``tens of thousands of names currently in \nthe NICS system''--the gun ban list--``would likely need to be purged, \nmeaning these people could go out and buy guns.'' Now, that is not so. \nIf anything, my amendment would require the Federal Government to look \nover the VA records sent to the gun ban list and verify that those \npersons on it are dangerous to themselves or others.\n  That doesn't have to be purging. Rather, the Federal Government would \nnow have the burden of proving a veteran should not be able to exercise \nhis or her fundamental Second Amendment rights. Since there is no \npurging, but rather dangerous persons will be identified via a \nconstitutional process, it is not accurate to say that ``these people \ncould go out and buy guns.'' Therefore, Senator Durbin has not studied \nmy amendment and its outcome. Really, the government should always \nprovide constitutional due process before infringing on a fundamental \nconstitutional right.\n  Senator Durbin mentioned 174,000 names were supplied by the VA to the \ngun ban list and about 15,000 of them had serious mental illnesses. \nActually, as of December 2015, the VA has supplied 260,381 names out of \nthe 263,492 in the mental defective category. That happens to be 98.8 \npercent of the total number of people on the mental defective list that \nare there because of the VA and not because it has been determined \ntheir constitutional rights should be taken away.\n  Assuming Senator Durbin is correct about the 15,000 who had a serious \nmental illness, that leaves about 245,000 who did not. Those are \n245,000 people whose constitutional rights are being restricted without \ndue process for no good reason. Not a single individual was determined \nto be dangerous before the VA submitted their name to this list so \ntheir constitutional rights could be violated.\n  My amendment, and my remarks last night, make clear that if a person \nis dangerous, they will not be able to possess a firearm. Therefore, \nSenator Durbin's concern that my amendment will allow dangerous people \nto buy firearms is simply inaccurate.\n  Importantly, Senator Durbin even admitted that not all the names \nreported to the VA are dangerous. Senator Durbin said: ``I do not \ndispute what the Senator from Iowa suggested, that some of these \nveterans may be suffering from a mental illness not serious enough to \ndisqualify them from owning a firearm, but certainly many of them do.''\n  Then, Senator Durbin said: ``Let me just concede at the outset that \nreporting 174,000 names goes too far, but eliminating 174,000 names \ngoes too far.'' I am glad that Senator Durbin acknowledged that many of \nthe names on the gun ban list supplied by the VA do not pose a danger \nand should be removed.\n\n  But again, my amendment is not about purging names from the list. I \nwould be happy to take him up on his offer to work with him on that \nproblem. Surely, we can agree that, going forward, the VA should start \naffording due process to veterans before they are stripped of their \nSecond Amendment rights. If you really want a solution to this problem, \nstop objecting to this amendment.\n  As I stated yesterday, my amendment does three things. First, it \nmakes the ``danger to self or others'' standard applicable to the VA. \nWe all agree that dangerous persons must not own or possess firearms. \nSecond, it shifts the burden of proof from the veteran and back to the \nGovernment where it belongs. Third, it fixes the constitutional due \nprocess issues by removing the hearing from the VA to the judicial \nsystem.\n  The last thing I will note is something on which I wholeheartedly \nagree with Senator Durbin. Yesterday, he said: ``We need to find a \nreasonable way to identify those suffering from serious mental illness \nwho would be a danger to themselves, their families or others, and to \nsort out those that don't fit in that category.''\n  As I have made clear, my amendment does exactly that. Why, then, are \nthe Democrats refusing to fix this problem if they admit the problem \nexists? This is an outrage. We all know that veterans are being treated \nunfairly. My amendment fixes the problem, yet Democrats object.\n  What is dangerous is that Democrats are allowing veterans to be \nsubjected to a process that casts their Second Amendment rights aside. \nAll of this smells of hypocrisy. For months, the Democrats and their \nallies have been attacking me and the Republicans for not voting on the \nSupreme Court nominee. But the Democrats will not even allow a simple \nvote on protecting veterans' constitutional rights.\n  Can you imagine the chaos that would reign over this Chamber again if \nthe Democrats were to take control over the Senate? I will continue to \nstand firm in defense of our veteran population. I will continue to \nfight to protect their constitutional rights from offensive and \noppressive government outreach.\n  Our veterans are a special group. They give life and limb for our \nsafety so that we can sleep in peace at night.\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\nThe iron fist of government must submit to the constitutional rights of \nveterans, and those constitutional rights have been taken away by the \nVA willy-nilly just because somebody needs a fiduciary--nothing to do \nwith the competence of that veteran to not be able to buy a gun.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about \namendment No. 4012. I want to thank my cosponsors--Senators Sessions, \nVitter, Cotton, and Inhofe. This amendment addresses a very serious \npublic safety threat; that is, the threat posed by sanctuary cities. \nThis is a problem that is not a theoretical abstraction. It is a \nproblem that some Americans know all too well--one father, in \nparticular.\n  On July 1, 2015, Jim Steinle was walking arm in arm with his daughter \nKate on a pier in San Francisco. A gunman opened fire and hit Kate. \nWithin moments, she died in her father's arms. Her last words were: \n``Help me, Dad.''\n  What is maddening about this is that the shooter should never have \nbeen on the pier in the first place. He was an illegal immigrant. He \nwas here illegally. He had been convicted of seven felonies, and he had \nbeen deported five times. But it gets worse.\n  Just 3 months prior to his shooting and killing Kate Steinle, the San \nFrancisco police had him in custody. Federal immigration officials knew \nthat the San Francisco police had him in custody. They knew he was here \nillegally, in violation of multiple deportations--a violent criminal \nconvicted on multiple occasions. They said: Hold him until we get \nsomebody there to pick him up and deport him. But the police refused to \nhold him. Instead, they released the shooter into the public.\n  Why did they do that? Because San Francisco is a sanctuary city. That \nmeans that they are a city that specifically--and by law, within the \ncity--forbids their police from cooperating with Federal immigration \nofficials. Even when the police wants to cooperate, it is against the \nlaw in the city to do so.\n  The local police and President Obama's administration agree that, \nwith respect to a dangerous person, the Federal and local law \nenforcement authorities ought to cooperate, but the local politicians--\nin San Francisco, in this case--have overridden that judgment. Instead, \nthe police, who had every opportunity to prevent this man from being on \nthe pier that night, released him, and he went on to kill Kate Steinle.\n  As a father of three young children, I can't even imagine the pain \nthat family has gone through. Sadly, the Steinles are not alone. \nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security--our current \nadministration's Department of Homeland Security--during an 8-month \nperiod that they examined last year alone, sanctuary city jurisdictions \nreleased over 8,000 illegal immigrants, and 1,800 of them were later \narrested for criminal acts. It included two cities that released \nindividuals who had been arrested for child sex abuse. In both cases, \nthe individuals released sexually assaulted other children again.\n  In the wake of these tragedies, you would think that elected \nofficials across America would end this practice of having these \ndangerous sanctuary city policies. Sadly, that is not the case.\n  In the biggest city in my State, Philadelphia, they have taken the \nopposite approach. In fact, they imposed one of the most extreme \nversions of sanctuary cities anywhere in America. Two weeks ago, \nPresident Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security visited Philadelphia \nfor the specific purpose of trying to persuade the city government to \nmake a tiny exception to their sanctuary city policy. He wanted to \nchange the policy so that the Philadelphia police would be able to \nnotify Federal immigration officials if they are about to release from \ntheir custody a person who has been convicted of a violent felony or \nconvicted of a crime involving a gang or is a suspected terrorist. The \nmayor of Philadelphia refused.\n  Even under those circumstances, the police of Philadelphia are \nforbidden from cooperating and sharing the information with Federal \nimmigration officials.\n  What are the kinds of consequences for this? Consider the case of \nAlberto Suarez. In 2010, Alberto Suarez kidnapped and raped a girl from \nMontgomery County, which is just outside of Philadelphia. He bragged to \nthe girl that the police would never be able to catch him because he is \nhere illegally. Five months later, he kidnapped a 22-year-old woman \nfrom a Philadelphia bus stop, and he raped her. He has been \napprehended, he has plead guilty, and he is awaiting sentencing. But \nsome day, he will be released. Under the current Philadelphia city \npolicy of being a sanctuary city, the police cannot inform Federal \nimmigration officials when they are releasing him. This is ridiculous.\n  Imagine that the Philadelphia police have in their custody an illegal \nimmigrant whom the FBI suspects of plotting a terrorist attack. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security might very reasonably say to the \npolice: Hold on to him until we can get an agent down there to take him \ninto custody and ask him some questions because we suspect that he is \ninvolved with a terrorist plot. The Philadelphia police's response--not \nby their choice but by virtue of Philadelphia's being a sanctuary \ncity--to the Federal official is this: Could you come back again after \nhe has actually committed the terrorist attack and been convicted of \nit, and then we will see if we can help you?\n  This makes no sense at all. This is not partisan. This policy has \nbeen criticized by the former Philadelphia mayor, former Pennsylvania \nGovernor, and Democrat Ed Rendell. It has been criticized by President \nObama's Secretary of Homeland Security and Pennsylvania law enforcement \nofficials across the political spectrum.\n  Let me be very, very clear. This is not principally about \nimmigration. It is not about immigration at all. It is about violent \nand dangerous criminals. Everybody knows--I certainly know--that the \nvast majority of immigrants are never going to commit a violent crime. \nIt isn't about them. It is about the fact that if you have any \nsignificant population--and, certainly, 11 million people are here \nillegally--some subset of that population will be violent criminals. We \nknow that.\n  I have an amendment. It is modeled on a bill that the Senate voted on \nlast October. It was supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators in \nthat vote. It deals with this problem. First of all, there is an \nunderstandable reason why some communities have become sanctuary \ncommunities, and that is because a court decision has created a legal \nliability for the cities if they, at the request of the Department of \nHomeland Security, detain someone who later turns out to have been the \nwrong person. That legal liability has scared a number of communities. \nIt is understandable.\n  This amendment changes that. It makes it clear that when the local \npolice are in compliance with a Department of Homeland Security \ndetainer request, the local police have the same authority as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. If that person has been identified \nwrongly, then the liability still exists. If the person's civil rights \nhave been violated, they can sue. But the liability is with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, as it should be, and not against local \nlaw enforcement officials who are temporarily acting on behalf of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Having corrected that problem, if this amendment passes, what we say \nis this: If you want to, nevertheless, be a sanctuary city and refuse \nto allow the local police to cooperate with Federal immigration \nofficials, then we are going to withhold community development block \ngrant funds from such a community. As you know, these are the funds \nthat have great discretion in the hands of local elected officials to \nspend on various projects.\n  The fact is that sanctuary cities impose a very real cost--a real \ncost for the Federal Government. The most important cost, by far, is \nthe danger to society that it imposes. It is entirely reasonable for \nthe Federal Government to withhold some of these grants in the event \nthat a city chooses to inflict that cost on the rest of us.\n  This legislation is endorsed by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the National Sherriffs' Association, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, and the International Union of \nPolice Associations,\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\nwhich is a division of the AFL-CIO. It is a simple, commonsense \namendment, and it stands for the simple principle that the safety of \nthe American people matters, and the life of Kate Steinle matters.\n  Right up front, I want to debunk some of the misinformation that is \noccasionally promulgated about this amendment. One is the idea that it \nwould discourage people from coming forward and reporting crimes or \nreporting that they witnessed a crime or that they were a victim of \ncrime, and that, therefore, it is a bad idea. The fact is that our \nlegislation has been drafted in such a way that if a local community \nhas a law that says that local law enforcement shall not inquire about \nthe immigration status of a crime victim or witness, according to our \nlegislation, that doesn't make you a sanctuary city. Any city would \nstill be free to offer that protection to people so that they would not \nhave to fear deportation for disclosing a crime.\n  The fact is that this amendment is germane, and it was timely filed. \nIt satisfies all of the relevant rules. This is the right time, and \nthis is the legislation to consider this. It is time to stop with this \npolitically correct nonsense and being so worried that we can't offend \nanyone that we are going to risk the safety of our communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so I may offer my amendment No. 4012.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I reserve my right to object. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has very thoughtfully pointed to significant issues \nwith respect to immigration law and public safety, but I believe the \nremedy of cutting off CDBG funding is not the appropriate response to \nthese very serious problems. Indeed, CDBG funding is available \nthroughout the Nation to large communities and small communities, and \nin many cases it provides support for public safety projects, such as \ninfrastructure that protects people, and on and on and on.\n  With all due respect to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I object to \nmaking the amendment pending at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island, I just have to say that this is exactly \nwhat Americans are so fed up with. There is a real problem out there \nwith public safety, and they know it. This is a ridiculous and \nindefensible policy, but I am willing to have a debate about it. I did \nnot ask for unanimous consent to have my amendment adopted. I asked \nunanimous consent to have it debated and have a vote. If a majority of \nSenators disagrees with me, then I don't know why they can't come down \nhere and cast a vote and let us know. It is germane, it is in order, \nand it complies with all the rules.\n  The status quo means dangerous criminals are being released onto our \nstreets. That is a fact.\n  I will tell you what is going on here. We have colleagues who are \nafraid to cast a vote. They are afraid of having to make a choice. They \nare afraid that if they vote with me to put pressure on cities to end \nsanctuary cities, it will offend some people, and they don't want to do \nthat. If they vote against it, they know they are endangering their own \nconstituents, and they don't want their constituents to know that. \nRather than standing up and making a decision, what do they do? They \nsay: Let's not allow the debate; let's not allow the amendment. This is \nexactly what the American people are so fed up with.\n  I am not giving up on this. This is a very important issue. We have a \nresponsibility to be stewards of the money that we give these cities. I \nthink the vast majority of Pennsylvanians, the people whom I represent, \nwant me to be a steward who is looking after their safety, and the \nstatus quo doesn't do that. This amendment would solve a very important \nproblem. It is outrageous that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are afraid to have this debate, afraid to go on record, and \nafraid to let their constituents know whether they support sanctuary \ncities or not. We are not finished with this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, Senator Grassley came to the \nfloor advocating for an amendment. His amendment dealt with access to \nguns for those who have been determined by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to be mentally incompetent due to injury or disease.\n  Senator Grassley's amendment was 10 lines long. It would simply cut \noff funds for the VA to ``treat'' any person who the VA has determined \nto be mentally incompetent under its current administrative process as \na prohibited gun purchaser under Federal firearms laws.\n  On behalf of myself and other Senators, I objected to this amendment. \nI pointed out that Senator Grassley's amendment would likely require \npurging the NICS background check database of thousands of records of \npeople who have already been diagnosed with serious mental illness and \nreferred to NICS by the VA.\n  As Senator Grassley no doubt knows, current law requires a Federal \nagency that submits a record to NICS to notify the Attorney General if \nthe basis upon which the record was submitted to NICS no longer \napplies. The Attorney General is then obligated to remove the record \nfrom NICS within thirty days.\n  If the Grassley amendment were to pass and prohibit the VA from \ncontinuing to ``treat'' a mentally incompetent person as a prohibited \ngun purchaser, then it casts into doubt the basis upon which tens of \nthousands of NICS mental health records were submitted.\n  So Senator Grassley's amendment would likely purge those records from \nNICS. Tens of thousands of people with serious mental illnesses would \nbecome able to buy guns.\n  Senator Grassley came to the floor earlier this afternoon to \ncriticize my objection. He made two main points that I want to respond \nto.\n  First, he said that Democrats were being hypocritical for not \nallowing a vote on this issue.\n  Senator Grassley must have only started paying attention to this \nissue recently. I can remember at least three votes we have had on the \nSenate floor on this issue.\n  In April 2013, when the Senate was under Democratic control, an \namendment offered by Senator Burr that was very similar to Senator \nGrassley's amendment was voted upon and failed to pass.\n  An alternative and more sensible proposal for addressing the issue of \nVA referrals to the NICS database was included in the Manchin-Toomey \nlegislation which the Senate voted upon in April 2013 and again last \nDecember.\n  In contrast to the Burr and Grassley amendments, which specified no \nprocess for reviewing the thousands of VA mental health referrals that \nhave already been made to NICS, the Manchin-Toomey amendment set up a \nnotification, review, and appeal process. It wasn't perfect, but it was \nvery credible process, and I voted for it.\n  That is how we should be approaching this issue, with thoughtful \nauthorizing legislation, not 10-line appropriations riders that are \nairdropped in on the Senate floor.\n  Second, Senator Grassley said that the VA has been depriving veterans \nof their constitutional rights willy-nilly.\n  I would urge Senator Grassley to look at the actual process the VA \nundertakes.\n  In connection with an award of veterans benefits, the VA formally may \ndetermine as ``mentally incompetent'' a person who ``because of injury \nor disease lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or \nher own affairs, including disbursement of funds without limitation.''\n  The types of mental disorders that qualify as ``injury or disease `` \nfor this purpose are set forth in 38 C.F.R. 4.130 and include diseases \nsuch as schizophrenia, dementia, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and bipolar disorders, among others. Such illness or disease \nmust be responsible for a person's inability to manage his or her own \naffairs for a VA determination of incompetency.\n  Like all VA benefit determinations, incompetency determinations are \ngoverned by clearly defined procedures to ensure due process.\n  Where the VA becomes aware that a veteran may be unable to manage his\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nor her affairs, an incompetency rating is proposed and the individual \nin question is provided with notice and the opportunity to submit \nevidence and appear before a VA hearing officer. Determinations are \nbased on all evidence of record. Unless the medical evidence is clear, \nconvincing, and leaves no doubt as to the person's incompetency, no \ndetermination is made. Reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of \ncompetency.\n  All VA determinations of incompetency may be appealed within the VA's \nadministrative appeals process, which includes the opportunity to seek \nreview by the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Final BVA decisions may be \nappealed to the independent United States Court of Appeals for Veterans \nClaims.\n  Here is the bottom line: All of us respect our veterans, but we know \nthat gun access by those with serious mental illness increases the risk \nof suicide and violence, and the VA has identified tens of thousands of \npeople with serious mental illness.\n  We can work on a reasonable process, like the Manchin-Toomey \nlegislation proposed, to make sure that the VA is not submitting mental \nhealth records inappropriately, but simply invalidating all the records \nthat the VA has supplied to the background check database is \nirresponsible and dangerous.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nheroin and prescription drug epidemic that is gripping my State and the \ncountry. I come to talk about the 200,000 people in Ohio who are \naddicted. I come to talk about the police officers during National \nPolice Week who are doing their jobs to address this issue and why they \nneed more help from us and how we should provide that to them.\n  This is the sixth time I have come to the floor since the Senate \npassed on March 10 the legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act. It was voted on by a 94-to-1 vote in this Chamber, \nwhich is highly unusual. That never happens around here. It happened \nbecause in every single State people are seeing this addiction \nepidemic, overdose issue. We need to address it.\n  The House has been working on its own legislation. I have come here \nevery single week we have been in session since we passed our \nlegislation to urge the House to act. I come this week to thank the \nHouse for acting because on Friday of last week the House of \nRepresentatives passed legislation--again, a large bipartisan vote--18 \ndifferent bills that were combined into one bill to deal with this \nopioid epidemic.\n  In some respects, it is very similar to the legislation we passed in \nthe Senate. In other respects, it has additional provisions that I \nthink are very helpful. In other respects, it doesn't pick up \neverything that is in the Senate legislation.\n  Our focus in the Senate would be to have a comprehensive approach, \nand I believe, by including some of the provisions in the House-passed \nversion, we will come up with a more comprehensive approach, and that \nis what is needed. In fact, in the Senate we spent 3 months working \nwith the House on companion legislation. We had a number of conferences \nhere in Washington, DC--five different conferences to deal with this \nissue--and we came up with legislation that took best practices around \nthe country and included them in the legislation to deal with a very \nreal problem in our communities.\n  It has to be comprehensive. Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak \nwith the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, \nMichael Botticelli, as well as Dr. Kana Enomoto, who is the Acting \nAdministrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration. It was a hearing of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. We were talking about how to come up \nwith the right response to this issue in so many different respects. \nThe bottom line is, both of them strongly agree it has to be a \ncomprehensive approach if we are going to make a difference, if we are \ngoing to begin to turn the tide and begin to save lives and get people \nback on track to deal with this level of drug addiction and overdose \nthat is happening in our communities. We have to provide the resources, \nbut we also have to ensure that the resources are wisely spent. In \nother words, we have to be sure we are spending the money on things \nthat are going to be effective. I was grateful that both Director \nBotticelli and Dr. Enomoto said they would work with us to try to get \nthis conference between the House and Senate done as quickly as \npossible. The House and Senate bills coming together is important so we \ncan get it to the President and, more importantly, so we can get it to \nthe communities to begin to help. They offered to continue to work with \nus going forward, and I appreciate that, and we will need them. \nEverybody needs to pull together on this.\n  It has been 67 days since the Senate acted. In those 67 days, if we \nassume that about 120 Americans are lost every day to drug overdoses, \nabout 8,000 Americans have lost their lives through drug overdoses \nsince the Senate passed this legislation on March 10. Think about that. \nThat is what I call an epidemic.\n  Unfortunately, my State of Ohio has been particularly hard hit. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention said that Ohio had the \nsecond most overdoses of any State in the Union, and the fifth highest \noverdose death rate. On average, we are losing about five Ohioans every \nday to overdoses. We lost 330 since the Senate passed the CARA \nlegislation on March 10.\n  Unfortunately, since March 10 the headlines have continued to show \nthat families are being torn apart, communities devastated. These \nheadlines make it clear this is not slowing down. I talked to some \nexperts on this in Ohio last week, and I asked: Tell me, are things \ngetting better? Are we beginning to change the attitudes to turn the \ntide? The answer was, no, the hotline is lighting up more than ever, \nmore people are coming for treatment, and there is more crime than ever \nrelated to this. Sadly, I do not believe, at least in my home State of \nOhio, that we have begun to make the progress we have to make.\n  It is happening everywhere--in the cities, suburbs, and rural areas. \nAddiction is affecting everybody of every age no matter where you are \nfrom, no matter what neighborhood you live in. It knows no ZIP Code.\n  Just in the time since I spoke on the floor this last week, in the \npast week in Ohio, here are some things that have happened. In \nNortheast Ohio, in the city of Lorraine, police searched three \ndifferent drug houses. This happened last Thursday. They arrested seven \npeople possessing more than 120 grams of heroin. In Southwest Ohio, in \na rural area in Brown County, a couple was arrested for possession of \nheroin. They have four children between the ages of 3 and 6. This \nhappened last week. In the suburbs of Dayton, OH, this time in the \nsuburbs, Harrison Township, police say a man was driving under the \ninfluence of heroin, veered into the wrong lane and struck a vehicle \nhead-on, killing an innocent woman and injuring her husband. More and \nmore traffic accidents are being linked to addiction.\n  In Central Ohio, in the Columbus area, the city has now spent \n$144,000 last year alone on Narcan, which is a miracle drug that will \nbe able to deal with overdoses and save people's lives. Paramedics in \nColumbus spent 10 percent of their entire budget just on Narcan last \nyear, reversing over 100 overdoses. Paramedic Pete Bolen says that \nsometimes he takes up to four overdose calls per day. I have been to \npolice stations and firehouses around Ohio, and they tell me they are \nresponding to more overdoses than they are fires.\n  Dr. Eric Adkins of Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center says that their \nemergency room sees two to four overdose patients every day. Last year, \nWexner spent $1.2 million treating overdose patients. That is one \nmedical center in one city.\n  In Chillicothe, Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Creed says that overdose \ncalls are on pace to double this year compared to last year. Again, \nthey will tell you there are more overdoses than fires.\n  Rita Gunning of Grove City, OH, lost her daughter Sara, who was just \n30\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\nyears old, to a heroin overdose. Last year, Sara was trying to fight an \nopioid addiction and managed to stay clean for 50 days, but she \nrelapsed, and 3 days later she died of an overdose. Rita is now raising \nSara's three children and trying to increase the availability of \nnaloxone across Ohio. She is on a mission because she believes this \nmiracle drug naloxone could have saved her daughter. She said: ``Maybe \nif they had it that night, they could have saved Sara's life.'' She \nshouldn't have to say that. By the way, making naloxone more available \nis one thing the legislation does that was passed in the Senate. We \nhave to be sure the House and Senate legislation does that and also \nprovides the training that goes along with it.\n  Our legislation also says that when they provide naloxone, or Narcan, \nthey provide not only training with it but also information about where \nto get treatment because it is not enough to apply Narcan, we need to \nget these people into treatment so we don't have to apply Narcan again \nand again and again.\n  Karen Young of Columbus lost her daughter Kayla when she was just 22. \nShe had surgery when she was 20, and she was prescribed pain pills, as \nmany of us have after surgery. She became addicted to those pain pills, \nand like so many others, when the pills ran out, she switched to a less \nexpensive and more accessible alternative--heroin. She went to rehab \nfor about 7 weeks, but she relapsed, overdosed, and died--just like \nthat. In the span of 2 years, she developed an addiction because she \nwent in for surgery and she died from it. As Karen put it, ``her Dad \nwill never get to walk down the aisle with Kayla.''\n\n  Unfortunately, that is true with so many thousands of people whose \nlives are cut short across Ohio and across the country. The stories are \nheart-wrenching. You hear about kids who go in to have their wisdom \nteeth pulled. They are given prescription pain pills. They get addicted \nto the pain pills. They then turn to heroin--or maybe not. Maybe they \neven die of an overdose from the pain pills themselves, which has \nhappened.\n  This should not be happening. Overprescribing of pain medication is \nobviously one of the huge issues. Four out of five of the heroin \naddicts in Ohio started with prescription drugs. People need to know \nthat. By the way, our legislation would allow people to know that \nthrough an awareness campaign about that very issue.\n  Unfortunately, these overdoses are just the tip of the iceberg in the \nsense that in addition to the 8,000 we have lost since March 10 in this \ncountry, there are hundreds of thousands more who are among the \nwounded. What do I mean by that? They have lost their jobs. They have \nbeen driven to theft or fraud to pay for their habit. They have gone to \njail. They have broken relationships with loved ones because of an \naddiction.\n  I hear this time and again from recovering addicts saying: When I had \nthis addiction, the drug was everything. It was everything. That is how \nmy family broke up. That is how I lost my job. That is how I lost my \nself-respect.\n  I have seen the consequences firsthand. In Ohio on Monday, I visited \na treatment center that was for women only. It is an extraordinary \nplace, the only place in my hometown of Cincinnati where women can take \ntheir kids and get treatment, which has been very effective. I got the \nchance to meet with a number of women who are in recovery. Each had a \nheart-wrenching story to tell about how they got there. Each was \nabsolutely committed to dealing with their addiction not only for their \nsakes but also for their baby's sake because these women were pregnant.\n  In the last 12 years in Ohio, there has been a 750-percent increase \nof babies born with addiction. This syndrome, babies born with \naddiction, requires babies to be taken through the same kind of rehab \nthat adults are taken through, of course at different levels of \ntreatment. It is a very sad situation. Many doctors and nurses, who are \nincredibly compassionate, tell me they don't know what the long-term \nconsequences are.\n  At this treatment center called First Step Home, which is in my home \ntown, they are doing impressive work. They are teaching women how to be \nbetter moms in addition to providing the treatment they need. They \ndon't just get medication, they get a sense of home and security. \nTalking to these women and listening to their stories inspires me to \nmake the Federal Government a better partner with First Step and other \nnonprofits around the country to ensure that we are, indeed, beginning \nto turn this tide.\n  Today and tomorrow, the Addiction Policy Forum, which is a coalition \nof advocacy groups, is leading a CARA Family Day on Capitol Hill here \nin Washington, DC. I will be joining them in that effort. I thank them \nfor calling attention to this pressing issue and for their strong \nsupport of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA.\n  With this being National Police Week, I would also like to thank our \npolice officers who are confronting this epidemic on the frontlines \nevery single day. Police, other first responders, and medical personnel \nconfront this epidemic more than anyone else. I have been told by \nprosecutors back home that in some counties in Ohio, more than 80 \npercent of the crime is directly related to this issue of heroin and \nprescription drug addiction. I am told that in some areas, nearly all \nof the thefts that are committed are done by those struggling with \naddiction to pay for their habit.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police has been incredibly helpful to us in \nthis legislation. They contributed valuable advice and feedback during \nthe 3 years we were crafting CARA. I am grateful for their help and for \ntheir endorsement of CARA, which was very important to getting such a \nstrong vote on the floor of the House and Senate.\n  Police officers across Ohio have told me about the extent of the \nepidemic. They have told me about the need for the Federal Government \nto take action that is comprehensive.\n  Major Jay McDonald, who is the president of Ohio's Fraternal Order of \nPolice has told me that ``heroin mixed with fentanyl is the most deadly \ndrug cocktail I've witnessed in my entire career.'' I visited a place \ncalled Jody's House with him. It is a residential house for women in \nrecovery in Marion, OH. Major McDonald told me that our response should \ninclude enforcement, prevention, and treatment. In other words, it has \nto be comprehensive. He is absolutely right.\n  Our police want CARA for a lot of reasons. For example, CARA would \nauthorize new law enforcement task forces around the country to \ninvestigate trafficking in heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines, and \nprescription drugs. Police know that these extra resources will help \nthem to do their job. By the way, these task forces are not included in \nthe House-passed legislation. We have to get that in conference to \nensure that we are helping our police officers who are out there on the \nfrontlines.\n  Another reason I think the law enforcement community wants CARA \npassed is that they are using naloxone more and more every day. First \nresponders used it 16,000 times in Ohio last year--16,000 times. CARA \nwould increase access to naloxone. It would improve the training so \nthat they could be more effective in administering this miracle drug in \ntime to save a life.\n  It would also insist, again, as it is being administered, that the \ndrug treatment programs in the community locally are made available--\ninformation available to people--so that we are not just seeing this \nrevolving door. If we give our police the tools they need, they will be \nable to save even more lives and get more people into treatment.\n  Our police are also helping to take drugs off the street. Since 2014, \nDEA agents in Ohio, working with local police departments, have seized \nmore than 171 kilograms of heroin. Federal agents have now arrested \nmore than 70 drug traffickers or drug dealers in Ohio in the last year \nalone.\n  Sometimes the intervention of a police officer is exactly what it \ntakes to get somebody into treatment. I have found that again and \nagain. Two weeks ago, there was a heartbreaking story of a woman in the \nMiami Valley area--Dayton area--named Cheri, who said she was glad her \nson was in jail because ``I would rather have him sitting behind bars \nin jail than have to carry him out in a body bag.''\n  Two weeks ago in Wellington, OH, there was a town meeting held about\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\nthe crisis. Nicole Walmsley told the story of how, after postpartum \nsurgery at age 19, she was prescribed a prescription pain killer. She \nbecame addicted. She ended up being arrested 18 times and convicted of \ntwo felonies. ``I sold my morals; I sold my soul. Drugs became \neverything.''\n  After an overdose in Youngstown, she begged her probation officer to \nsend her to jail. That is how bad it is. That is how difficult it is \nsometimes to find treatment. She asked the police officer and the judge \nto send her to prison because that is the best way to get good \ntreatment, to be convicted of a felony. Even then, sometimes the best \ntreatment is not available.\n  That is the status quo today. Unless and until we get a more \ncomprehensive bill to the President and signed into law, this \ncontinues. Too many are going without treatment. Too many are afraid to \ncome forward. Too many are treating this not as a disease that needs to \nbe treated, which it is, but instead are concerned about the stigma.\n  We need to get people to come forward and come into treatment. But \nthanks to help from police, in the case of Nicole, as I mentioned, she \ndid get treatment. For 3 years now, she has been living a clean and \nproductive life and helping others do so too. Police across Ohio have \nbeen offering treatment to those struggling with addiction.\n  I am impressed with what is going on in Lucas County, Ohio, which is \nin the Toledo area. Sheriff Tharp has started a drug abuse response \nteam that offers addiction counseling, free rides to treatment for \nthose who need it, and followup visits for those who have overdosed. In \ntalking to Sheriff Tharp and some of his deputies about this, they have \nmade an incredible difference in people's lives.\n  In Lodi, OH, anyone can simply turn themselves in to the police, and \nthey will get treatment with no questions asked. This is done using \nprivate donations entirely. This year they have already placed in \nrehabilitation 28 people who had no insurance and no income. The police \nthere report that since they started the program, overdoses and \nproperty crimes have decreased considerably.\n  In Wellington and in Auglaize County, police make the same offer: \nTurn yourself in and get treatment. We will not ask any questions. We \nwill get you the help you need. I am told this is also the case in \nCreston, OH, and Newark, OH. So locally, police departments are taking \nup this issue and dealing with it effectively. I salute them for that.\n  I also salute them for putting their lives on the line every day for \nall of us and for their compassionate care of those they run across who \nneed this treatment. I know the statistics about drug abuse are \nheartbreaking. They can certainly be discouraging, including the \nrelapse rates. But thanks in part to our police officers and good \ntreatment providers around the country, such as those I visited on \nMonday, there are a lot of stories of hope, too, that encourage and \ninspire us. Many of those who are struggling have inspirational stories \ntoo.\n  In Colerain Township, near my hometown, police have started what is \ncalled a quick response team of police, paramedics, and addiction \ncounselors. When they arrest someone or save them from an overdose, \nthey get them into treatment--again, not just applying Narcan but \ngetting them into treatment. Last summer, they found Damon Carroll, who \nwas just 22 years old, on his bedroom floor after an overdose. They got \nhim counseling and treatment. Damon is now living a clean and \nproductive life working at a restaurant. You know who stops by his \nhouse and stops by the restaurant and makes sure he is okay? The police \nofficers who found him. Thanks to our police, he is beating this. There \nis hope. They saved a life. They are helping this young man to live out \nhis God-given potential.\n  I hope we can send comprehensive legislation to the White House as \nsoon as possible because it is needed. It is urgent. It is an \nemergency. We have lost nearly 8,000 Americans since the Senate passed \nthis Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act. That is the status quo \ntoday. Again, that does not begin to tell the story of those who have \nnot died because of an overdose but struggle with addiction every day.\n  Our police officers and those nonprofits I talked about, those \ntreatment centers, those who are struggling with addiction--all of them \ndeserve better. They deserve us to act. Again, we are not going to \nsolve the problem here in Washington, DC, but we can be better partners \nwith State and local governments, with these nonprofits, with these law \nenforcement officials around the country who are dealing with this \nissue every day. They deserve a better partner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was pleased to come over here early \nbefore I spoke and listen to my colleague from Ohio. We have the same \nissues in Indiana. I think probably the Presiding Officer's State and \nevery State has serious opioid addiction issues, particularly with our \nyoung people. We cannot solve all of the problems here. We have passed \na piece of legislation. Hopefully we can reconcile with the House \nshortly and put it on the President's desk. In a number of ways, that \nwill provide the support for dealing with this problem.\n  It is a national issue, it is a State issue, it is a city issue, it \nis a smalltown issue, and it is a rural America issue. It is all hands \non deck here. We are losing precious lives through this scourge of \naddiction that is sweeping through our country.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. President, today I am back, as I have been every week for now 43 \nweeks for the waste of the week. The ``Waste of the Week'' is where I \nhighlight waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government system that \nis using hard-earned taxpayer dollars that ought to be able to be used \nby the taxpayer to pay the mortgage, pay the bills at the end of the \nweek, to put aside some money hopefully for the children's education as \nthey grow, or for any number of needs out there.\n  We have the responsibility and the duty to be carefully managing the \ntax money that is assessed to our public. ``Waste of the Week'' has \npointed out some significant examples, yet drop-in-the-bucket of \nexpenditures that have not been successful, have not been used for the \npurpose they are supposed to be used, part of the waste, fraud, and \nabuse category of now nearly--well, nearing $200 billion. That is not \nsmall change.\n  This week, I am highlighting a Federal program that has a lousy track \nrecord and over $7 billion in leftover money--funds Congress has \nappropriated for this program. Let me explain the program. In 2008, \nshortly after the economic recession began, Congress created something \ncalled the Home Affordable Modification Program; in short, HAMP. This \nis a new emergency program established to help homeowners facing \nfinancial distress to avoid foreclosure by reducing their monthly \nmortgage payments.\n  All this occurred at a time when our country truly was in distress--a \nserious recession. People were working less hours or no hours. Those \nwho owned homes were finding it difficult if not impossible to pay the \nmonthly mortgage payments.\n  So the HAMP program, which is a voluntary program for homeowners and \nmortgage lenders--if the two of them get together and agree to \nrestructure their home loan payments, they can stay in their home, and \nit doesn't have to go through foreclosure. It is a sensible program at \na time of real need. Lenders work through the Treasury Department to \nreduce those monthly mortgage payments to no higher than about one-\nthird of the homeowners' income.\n  Historically, if you are telling your kids about buying a home or you \nare graduating from school and you want to buy a home, the solid advice \nhas always been, don't commit yourself to more than 25 percent of the \nincome you are earning to pay on your mortgage. You are going to need \nthe rest of that money to pay the rest of your bills--all the \nutilities, food, transportation, buying a car, and so forth and so on. \nWell, this program said all the way up to a third. If you qualified on \nthat, we would use 33 percent instead of 25 percent and restructure \nyour mortgage so that you had a lower payment you had to make each \nmonth on that mortgage.\n  The Department of Treasury put this program in place. It was \nscheduled to expire at the end of 2012. In 2013, after the program had \ntechnically expired,\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nan inspector general found that the number of participants who ended up \nredefaulting on their new modified mortgage was ``increasing at an \nalarming rate.''\n  What is this word ``redefaulting''? Look, if you don't pay your \nmortgage payments, you are in default. If you are in default long \nenough, the bank or the mortgage company that is holding your mortgage \nsays: We are going to foreclosure and take your house back because you \nare not making payments. This program was designed to help people avoid \nthat catastrophe.\n  Redefaulting is the process by which the person, having already \nagreed to--with the mortgage company and with the support of the \nFederal Government, the person agreed to a program to lower the \npayments so they could keep their house. They defaulted again, so the \ntechnical term is redefaulting, but it is two defaults. So if Joe Smith \nhas problems and he gets with his lender, he gets a new program, but \nthen down the line, he defaults again.\n  According to the inspector general, this became something that needed \nto be addressed because we simply cannot continue to proceed with this \nprogram with the taxpayers' dollars if the participants aren't doing \ntheir share.\n  Despite the poor performance, the administration unilaterally--and \nhow many times have we seen this happen during the Obama \nadministration?--bypassing Congress, they unilaterally extended the \nprogram beyond its December 2012 expiration date. Interestingly enough, \neven with this extension, the number of applicants steadily declined. \nPeople either couldn't meet the measures or they didn't need it. The \neconomy was improving, and they didn't need to do this. According to \nthe Treasury Department, the number of HAMP participants declined \nbecause there was a shrinking number of eligible mortgagees.\n  Given that the outcomes of those receiving help were largely subpar \nand the number of applicants was declining, you would think we would \ncome to the conclusion that the program needed to be terminated. It was \nalready extended past the deadline, but on the basis of what was \nhappening with the program, essentially we should terminate that.\n  When HAMP was created, the goal was to help about 4 million \nhomeowners. Unfortunately, as it turned out, the program ended with \nonly 1.3 million homeowners making it through the trial phase and \nultimately being accepted into the program. Of those people, about one-\nthird ultimately redefaulted, costing taxpayers an additional $1.5 \nbillion.\n  We had a broken program. What was left in the fund with the Treasury \nwas $7 billion. Some people call these slush funds. This is money that \nhas been appropriated, put into a program--not expended in the program \nbut sits there. How many times have we heard about government agencies \nwith excess taxpayer money saying: Don't give it back.\n  Now, of course, this is the Treasury. Sometimes we say: Give it back \nto the Treasury. This is the Treasury itself. Well, don't terminate \nthis and give it back; we might want to use it for something else.\n  That is a classic way of describing how Washington often works. Spend \nall the money that is appropriated to you, or they will reduce the \nmoney they give you next year. I previously sat on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and this is not a one-off proposition. Every year, we have \nto scrub through these agencies' expenditures, and we find that there \nis excessive spending at the end of the fiscal year so that they don't \nget a reduced amount of funds sent to them for the next fiscal year.\n  Think of the ways this money could be used if it was put back into \nthe Treasury. No. 1, it could be used for essential Federal functions. \nWouldn't NIH like to have $7 billion to be able to hopefully break \nthrough on a wonder drug that would address Alzheimer's or diabetes or \nsomething else? Wouldn't the Department of Defense want to have this \nmoney for the shortcomings they have had because of the drastic \nreduction in expenditures for our national defense and security? \nWouldn't any number of Federal agencies that produce essential programs \nthat have to be addressed financially want to use that money for the \nright purposes? Most important of all, wouldn't the taxpayer want to \nget that money back or not have it spent at all or use it? Wouldn't the \nTreasury want to use it to reduce our ever-deepening national defense? \nSo there are a lot of uses for this money that is sloshing around in a \ntrust fund--not a trust fund, but sloshing around in the fund held by \nthe Treasury Department.\n  This is a waste because it is sitting there. It is going to be spent \non something that it was not intended to be spent on. For that reason, \nit becomes the waste of the week. As the waste of the week, we add $7 \nbillion to our ever-growing total of waste, fraud, and abuse, taking \nour total overall to $170 billion. This is not small change. We have \npeople struggling in America to make ends meet. They live paycheck to \npaycheck. They want their hard-earned dollars that are taken from their \npaycheck used for the right purposes. If the money is not used for the \nright purposes, they don't want to send it; they want it back.\n  We have an accountability to the American people, the people we \nrepresent, to do the best we can to provide the most efficient, \neffective use of their tax dollars. If we can't provide that--this is \njust, as I said, a drop in the bucket. I could be standing here every \nday with a waste of the day. I could be standing here every hour with a \nwaste of the hour. We have a responsibility to be accountable to the \npeople whose money is taken by the Federal Government and used. They \ndon't mind using it for the right things. Maybe a veterans program \nneeds that $7 billion to treat more veterans better than the way they \nare treated now.\n  In any event, we add this, and we have $170-plus billion in \ndocumented waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I will be back next week with the next version, and we will continue \nto expose funding that is unnecessary and is putting a real burden on \nour hard-earned tax dollars being paid to the Federal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                   Iran's Influence on Iraq and Syria\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \npernicious and malign impact that the Iranian Government and its \nintrusion into Iraq and Syria are having on regional security, on the \ncondition of people in those two countries, and on the stability and \nfuture of that whole region.\n  Today, Iraq is riven by sectarian divides, confronted with the \npresence of barbaric ISIS terrorists in its north and west, and led by \na tragically fragile government. Meanwhile, the oppression of the \nmurderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria has helped create a \nhumanitarian crisis on the scale of nothing we have seen since the \nSecond World War.\n  Iran claims that it wants to be a legitimate, contributing member of \nthe international community, but despite those claims, Iran has played \nand continues to play a major role in fomenting instability in Iraq and \nSyria and in exacerbating security, political, and military crises in \nboth countries.\n  Today, I wish to give just a brief overview of the tragedies of Iraq \nand Syria, explain Iran's destabilizing role in each country, and \nhighlight a number of the steps I think the United States can take to \ncounter Iran's dangerous influence.\n  Let's begin with where we are today in Iraq. In recent months, Iraqi \nand coalition forces have reduced the territorial presence of ISIS in \nIraq by roughly 40 percent. Since taking office in 2014, Prime Minister \nHaydar al-Abadi has taken concrete steps to reduce corruption, to share \npower with Kurdish and Sunni leaders, and to form a competent, \ntechnocratic government that can deliver real results for the Iraqi \npeople and reduce the many grievances that have forced Iraqis into the \narms of extremists. Yet dangerous divides continue to paralyze the \nAbadi government, hindering Iraq's ability to fight ISIS and to defend \nagainst the terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of people, 200 \nin the last week alone.\n  As coalition forces retake land previously captured by ISIS, ISIS \nappears to be bringing its savage and barbaric tactics to the capital \ncity of Baghdad in brutal attacks in recent days and in other attempts \nto stoke sectarianism and to distract the Abadi government\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nfrom its efforts to retake the major city of Mosul. Sectarian divisions \namong the Iraqi people and within the government itself make political \nreconciliation and a coherent national military campaign against ISIS \neven more difficult.\n  Syria, meanwhile, faces a nearly unimaginable humanitarian crisis. \nSince March of 2011, more than 400,000 Syrians have been killed and \nmore than 1 million injured because the Assad regime has engaged in a \nmurderous campaign against its own people in order to cling to power. \nSome estimates put the number of dead as high as half a million \nSyrians. Nearly 5 million Syrians have been forced out of their own \ncountry, with 6.5 million displaced internally and 13.5 million in need \nof humanitarian assistance. Even more tragically, a huge number of \nthose Syrians have been unable to receive international aid or relief \nbecause the Assad regime blocks access to international aid \norganizations.\n  Rather than playing a constructive role in this tortured, difficult \nregion, such as by contributing more meaningfully to the anti-ISIS \nfight or by moderating conflicting factions, Iran continues to prop up \nthe Assad regime. In fact, without Iran's help, I believe Assad would \nhave likely fallen or come to the table to negotiate peace by now. \nInstead, Iran continues to foment instability, sectarian violence, and \nsupport terrorism.\n  In Iraq, Iran continues to fund Shia militias who seek to capitalize \nupon and exacerbate tensions between Iraq's Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish \npopulations. Iranian-backed Shia militias have pushed ISIS out of some \nareas, but rather than allowing Sunni civilians to peaceably return and \nrebuild, they have engaged in killings and human rights violations \nagainst the very Sunni communities they have just liberated from ISIS.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, in response to ISIS bombings in the \nIraqi town of Muqdadiyah in January of 2016, Shia militias ``demolished \nSunni homes, stores, and mosques'' and abducted and killed dozens of \nSunni civilians. This is just one of many examples of atrocities \ncommitted by Iranian-backed Shia militias in recent months. These \nkillings further raise tensions and drive more recruits to ISIS and \nother extremist groups.\n  In Syria, Iran has joined Russia in providing the aid that has kept \nthe Assad regime in power, despite hundreds of thousands willing to \nfight against Assad and despite the coordinated effort of many \ncountries.\n  Although Iran's Government denies the presence of its military forces \nin Syria, it is clear that in addition to financial support and \nweapons, Iran has sent thousands of its own troops to reinforce the \nmurderous regime of Assad. One estimate puts the number of Iranian \nforces in Syria at 3,000, including 2,000 of the elite Quds Force, a \nselect group of fighters from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, \nthe hard-line group dedicated to preserving the reactionary Iranian \nGovernment. In total, more than 700 Iranians are believed to have been \nkilled in Syria, directly contradicting Iran's claims that it is not \ninvolved in the conflict. In fact, Iraq recently doubled down on its \nsupport for Assad by sending soldiers from the regular Iranian army to \njoin the IRGC troops on the ground in Syria. There are rumors that they \nare even mobilizing and deploying Afghans and others from the region to \njoin militias in support of Assad.\n  Although it remains clear that a lasting resolution to the Syrian \nconflict will be impossible until Assad leaves power, Ali Akbar \nVelayati, a senior adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei, said in \na recent televised interview that ``the removal of Assad . . . is a \nredline for us.''\n  As long as Iran continues to increase its support--its military \nsupport, its financial support--for Assad, it will bear direct \nresponsibility for the carnage in Syria, rising extremism on all sides \nof the conflict, and the humanitarian exodus from Syria that is causing \nmassive suffering and destabilizing countries on three continents.\n  This behavior from Iran is a clear sign that the regime is not to be \ntrusted, does not intend to comply with international norms, and \ndeserves close scrutiny and constant pushback from the United States \nand our allies.\n  Briefly--noting another colleague who stands to speak soon--there are \na number of steps the United States and our allies have to take in \nresponse. At the very least, to prevent Iran from obtaining the \nmaterial necessary to advance its nuclear program, we must work with \nour allies to tightly enforce all four corners of the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, the nuclear agreement between Iran, the \nUnited States, and other world powers.\n  We must continue to work with our allies and their navies to \ninterdict Iran's ongoing illegal weapons shipments to support the \nHouthis and other of their terrorist proxies in the region, not just in \nYemen, but in Gaza, Bahrain, and Lebanon. Since February, U.S. forces \nand allied navies have, on at least three occasions, interdicted in \ninternational waters shipments of thousands of AK-47s, anti-tank \nmissiles, grenade launchers, sniper rifles, and other weapons destined \nfrom Iran to the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\n  The United States must continue to maintain sanctions on Iran for its \nsupport for terrorism, its human rights violations, and its continued \nillegal ballistic missile tests. We must be willing to sanction both \nindividuals and entities linked to the IRGC and Iran's continued and \nillegal ballistic missile program. In addition to punishing Iran for \nits dangerous and provocative behavior, these actions send a signal to \nIran that the international national community will not tolerate its \nongoing bad behavior.\n  We have to use diplomatic channels to urge countries such as Russia \nto not sell more dangerous arms to the Iranian regime--allegedly \ndefensive arms that will simply further destabilize the regime--and to \npress Russia to allow U.N. Security Council action in response to \nIran's recent ballistic missile tests.\n  Finally, we have to continue to make smart investments in training, \ntechnology, and innovation, on which our military depends. America's \nability to push back on Iran critically depends on maintaining a \ncredible conventional military deterrent.\n  The United States must do everything we can to support our allies in \nthe Middle East, in particular by strengthening our partnership with \nthe State of Israel, by concluding a new 10-year memorandum of \nunderstanding that provides a reliable long-term and significantly \nenhanced pathway toward support. Senator Graham and I, along with 81 of \nour colleagues, recently wrote a letter to the President urging the \nadministration to support a stronger MOU to ensure Israel has the \nresources it needs to defend itself in this chaotic region.\n  In closing, in the years to come, I hope this body will be just as \ndedicated to enforcing the terms of the nuclear agreement with Iran and \npushing back on Iran's continued dangerous behavior outside the \nparameters of the deal as we were in the months leading up to its \nconsideration in this body. Iran continues to exercise a malign \ninfluence on Iraq, on Syria, and the region. It is our responsibility \nto use every tool we have to make it clear to Iran that we will contain \nits bad behavior and we will not tolerate its ongoing actions.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment with \nSenator Blumenthal that would extend the Veterans Choice Card Program \nfor 3 years and restore funding that was moved out of the program last \nyear.\n  Our amendment is critically important. It extends the Veterans Choice \nCard Program so it does not expire prematurely next year. It restores \nfunding removed from the program last year to pay for other VA \nprograms, provides additional funding to stabilize the VA Choice Card \nProgram for the next 3 years while Congress works on a long-term \nsolution to reform veterans health care, and allows the Secretary of \nthe VA to standardize and modernize the way it pays all the doctors, \nhospitals, and clinics participating in the many programs the VA offers \nto veterans to get the care they need in their communities.\n  I was very proud 2 years ago that Congress acted quickly to pass \nmajor VA reform legislation following the scandal in care that resulted \nin the deaths of hundreds of veterans waiting endlessly for care. We \nnow know that\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nwhat was originally uncovered in Phoenix, AZ, had been occurring \nthroughout the country. Fortunately, we acted decisively, and in a \nbipartisan manner, by passing the Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act in near-record time. That law provided extra \nemergency funding for the VA to hire doctors and nurses and to build \nmore hospitals and clinics.\n  Perhaps the most important and the most promising piece of the \nlegislation was the $10 billion emergency fund for the Veterans Choice \nCard Program. This program allows any veteran who has to wait more than \n30 days for an appointment or lives more than 40 miles from a VA \nfacility to visit a participating doctor in their community instead of \ncontinuing to wait for care with no options. After an extremely \ndifficult start, the Veterans Choice Card Program is now authorizing \nmore than 150,000 appointments for veterans care per month--over 6,000 \nper workday.\n  According to the VA, as of the end of March, nearly 1 million \nappointments for veterans had been scheduled under the Veterans Choice \nCard Program. Each of these appointments represents a veteran's \nappointment that would have otherwise been delayed potentially for \nmonths in the VA's scheduling system.\n  An extra advantage of the Choice Card is it also helps veterans who \ndon't use it. By enabling some veterans to receive care in their \ncommunity, the VA is able to free up its appointment backlog and \naccommodate veteran appointments sooner.\n  Over the last year, the number of participating doctors and medical \nprofessionals in the Veterans Choice Program in the western region has \njumped from around 95,000 to nearly 160,000. The turnover rate is very \nlow. More than 90 percent of all doctors are being paid within 30 days, \nand the great majority of doctors are choosing to stay in the Veterans \nChoice Card Program to treat our Nation's veterans.\n  Unfortunately, under current law, the Veterans Choice Card Program is \nscheduled to expire in the middle of next year. The Veterans Choice \nCard Program is capped at $10 billion in emergency spending and 3 years \nof operation, whichever is reached first.\n  I know Members on both sides of the aisle don't want to return to the \nstatus quo of never-ending wait times for appointments and poor care at \nthe VA. Too many of our constituents have been harmed, too many lives \ndevastated.\n  I remember standing on the Senate floor in 2014 and urging passage of \nthe Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. At that time, we \nacknowledged the Veterans Choice Program was a first step toward fully \nreforming the VA. That law created a blue-ribbon Commission on Care \nthat is still meeting and owes Congress recommendations this summer on \nlong-term reform, but we need time for hearings, investigations, \noversight and analysis of the Commission's report to get long-term \nreform right.\n  As the chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nwill attest, this is the dictionary definition of an emergency. While \nwe cannot rush the reforms the VA health care system needs, we also \ncannot bring the Veterans Choice Program to a full stop. Too many \nveterans and VA hospitals depend on the Veterans Choice Program to \nprovide care in a timely fashion.\n  I have heard from multiple Administrators and VA officials who have \ntold me and my staff that they do not know what they will do if the \nVeterans Choice Card Program ends. I urge my colleagues to adopt this \namendment and commit to continuing the hard work of enacting long-term \nreform to the VA health care system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up amendment No. 4039 with the changes that \nare at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, John \nMcCain is my good friend for whom I have ultimate respect. I was just \ninformed of this amendment and was informed it would not enable--we \nhave a real problem in Rochester, where they do not have enough VA \nservices. They have to drive very far away to go to a big metropolitan \narea.\n  I am going to object, hoping I can talk to my friend from Arizona to \nsee if we can work this out. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't know what the credentials are of \nthe Senator from New York as far as veterans are concerned, but I know \nthis. I know that what the Senator from New York is stopping is 160,000 \nveterans--160,000 veterans--from participating in this program in the \nwestern part of the United States.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield. What I am simply asking for \nis not to block it but to sit and talk with him to see what exactly his \namendment does and the effect it will have on Rochester.\n  I was just told of it. That is all I want to do. I don't know the \ndetails. I have great respect for my friend, but I have an obligation \nto the veterans in Rochester who have come to me about their problem, \nand so I want to talk to my colleague about it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I hope very strongly that my colleague \nand friend the Senator from New York and Senator McCain will succeed in \nresolving this potential roadblock to amendment No. 4039, because I \nvery fervently support it.\n  The amendment would extend the temporary Veterans Choice Program for \nan additional 3 years and provide funding to do so. The extension of \nthis program is vital, and the current authorization is coming to an \nend. At this point, we lack a path forward on any of the proposals to \noverhaul the VA's care in the community program.\n  While the Veterans Choice Program has been far from perfect, \nrequiring multiple legislative and administrative changes to make it \nfunction for veterans, extending it for an additional 3 years will \nallow us to address these necessary changes that Senators Tester and \nBurr have provided in a bipartisan way in the committee earlier this \nyear. I remain committed to working with them and with Chairman Isakson \nto make further changes to the program as well as continuing to improve \naccess to care within the VA, which is the preferred choice for many \nveterans.\n  In addition to extending Choice, this amendment also would allow the \nVA to move closer to consolidating existing programs for care in the \ncommunity, eliminating some of the bureaucratic hurdles to smooth \ncontracting for the VA. I thank my colleague from Arizona Senator \nMcCain for championing this cause because this amendment will ensure \nthat all veterans currently using Project ARCH to access care through \nthe VA will be grandfathered into the Veterans Choice Program. This is \nimportant for some veterans in rural areas to maintain continuity in \ncare. It is of great interest to our colleagues from Maine and Kansas \nand other States where these veterans live, primarily, but to all of us \nwho care about veterans health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well as to support \nThe Veterans First Act, another bipartisan bill I was pleased to work \non with Chairman Isakson to achieve--that bill makes additional changes \nto veterans health care to improve opioid therapy, access to \nchiropractic care, as well as ensuring strong accountability within the \nDepartment.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to my colleague and friend Senator \nMcCain and say that I look forward to working with him closely on this \namendment, which would be helpful, in my view, to the Veterans Choice \nProgram. Without this extension, the Veterans Choice Program would \nexpire next year before Congress enacts long-term reform for veterans \nhealth. The stability provided by this extension and funding will help \nensure maximum participation by doctors, hospitals, and clinics in the \ncommunity who wish to treat our veterans.\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n  This amendment is one I support, having worked with my colleague \nSenator McCain on it, and I am very hopeful we can move forward with \nthe support of this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would tell Senator Schumer's staff that \nhe may want to come back.\n  What Senator Schumer is asking for is a 25-year lease on a clinic in \nRochester, NY, according to his staff.\n  I have been privy to examples of blocking the greater good because of \na specific geographic area, but I have to say that I haven't seen \nanything quite like this one.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I will talk one \nmore time with the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this is an important issue that is being \ndiscussed on the floor. I join Senator Blumenthal certainly in my \ncommitment to do whatever we can to extend more choice to veterans.\n  I believe there are less than a handful of issues in which the VA is, \nin all likelihood, the best provider. They should be better at post-\ntraumatic stress than anything else. The VA should be better at IED-\nattack injuries. They should be better at prosthetics. There is no \nreason they should be the better place to have your heart valve \nreplaced or your kidney cancer dealt with.\n  More choice for veterans is better for veterans, and will make the VA \na better provider than the VA is today. So I am certainly supportive of \nthat discussion.\n  Mr. President, Senator Warner and I today have filed an amendment to \nthe transportation bill, which is the part of this debate that deals \nwith transportation. The BRIDGE Act creates new ways to help us fund \nour Nation's infrastructure.\n  Last year, Congress was finally able to come together to pass a \nbipartisan highway bill, the FAST Act. It took a while to get to the \nFAST Act. We had 37 short-term extensions of the highway bill from 2009 \non, but we finally have a 5-year highway bill that provides certainty \nfor the next 5 years. This is a chance when, at every level of \ngovernment, we can now put extra tools in the toolbox, and we can \ninvolve the private sector in ways that it has not been involved as a \nfunding partner. There are many things the private sector can do in \npartnership with the public sector.\n  Strengthening our overall infrastructure, especially our \ntransportation network, is vital to boosting economic growth, to \ncreating jobs, and to increasing competitiveness in Missouri, in \nSenator Warner's State of Virginia, and across the Nation. Current \ninfrastructure fails to meet our current needs, including our drinking \nwater, highways and ports, and energy transmission.\n  In addition to all the things we see above ground, there are many \nthings below ground that need to be dealt with. Part of the storm water \nsystem in the city of St. Louis was built while Abraham Lincoln was \nPresident. It is amazing how long wood will last if you keep it soaked \nin water for 152 years or so, but that is what a part of that system is \nall about. We are way short in infrastructure investments. Senator \nWarner and I, for three Congresses now, have been trying to find the \nbest way to add more ability to do more of the things that need to be \ndone. We have a transportation system that is interconnected, with an \nextensive network of highways, roads, and bridges, and of freight and \npassenger railroads, urban and rural rail transit systems, airports, \nwaterways, and pipelines. All of those things make us more competitive \nthan we would be otherwise, and more competitive means better jobs. It \nmeans that people living paycheck to paycheck have an opportunity to \nhave paycheck to paycheck plus savings. They have an opportunity to \nhave paycheck to paycheck plus retirement. They have an opportunity to \nsee those things happen that need to happen in their lives and for \ntheir families.\n  The transportation system links our country. It links urban and rural \nAmerica. It serves as the backbone for interstate commerce, and it \nconnects the United States to the rest of the world. Our economic \ncompetitiveness and our ability to export in the most competitive way \nis very dependent on our infrastructure.\n  The American energy revolution is directly related to the ability to \naccess unconventional oil and gas. We have more new American energy \nthan we ever dreamed possible. We can access that energy, but we don't \nhave a way to transport the energy that we need to use it most \nefficiently.\n  The Greater Mississippi River Basin--the biggest contiguous piece of \nagricultural land in the world--is where the waterways of the country \ncome together. These waterways allow us to be more competitive. They \nallow farmers to easily ship their products to domestic and foreign \nmarkets. A modern transportation system will be key to remaining \ncompetitive with other grain producers elsewhere in the world. Brazil \nis a great example of a country whose ability to grow agricultural \nproducts has far outgrown its infrastructure. The ability to compete--\nthe ability to get things to market, the ability to get things all over \nthe world--is dramatically impacted by that.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers continues to give the United \nStates poor marks on our infrastructure and says that we need billions \nof dollars in investment over the next several years to bring it up to \nadequate conditions.\n  The BRIDGE Act is not a way for Federal taxpayers to become \nresponsible for every local obligation but for States and communities, \nalong with the Federal Government, to have new ways to do the things \nthat need to be done. We can't continue to ignore the infrastructure \nneeds of the country. We particularly can't continue to ignore the \ninfrastructure needs of the country that we can't see.\n  We just saw appropriate attention in Flint, MI, to a problem that \ndidn't meet the eye because it is underground. The gas lines, the water \nlines, the storm sewer lines all need attention. The capital markets \nand private sector investors have growing interest in being a part of \nmeeting that great infrastructure need. The BRIDGE Act will incentivize \nprivate sector investment by establishing an independent infrastructure \nfinancing authority to provide loans and loan guarantees to critical \ninfrastructure projects, including transportation, water, and energy \ninfrastructure. It is a proposal like the ones we need to help close \nthe gap that needs to be closed.\n  During this week--a week in which I am not sure how the planning \nworked here--we have the transportation bill on the floor during \ninfrastructure week. I think we ought to give serious consideration not \njust to the infrastructure that we appropriate money for but the \nprocess and the tools we put in place so that the infrastructure needs \nof the country can be met.\n  I am certainly pleased to get to work with Senator Warner on this \nproject. We have had lots of input from people who understand the \ninfrastructure needs of the country. I hope the Congress will look at \nthis as one of the things that can be done to help meet those needs.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner from Virginia and \nSenator Schumer from New York. They are committed to the veterans in \ntheir States and in this country.\n  I believe we have worked out an agreement to try to get the veterans \nthe services they have earned and are not receiving at this time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4039 to Amendment No. 3896\n\n  Mr. President, the usual calm and quiet conversation has led to a \nconclusion that now I can ask unanimous\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\nconsent to set aside the pending amendment in order to call up \namendment No. 4039.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4039 to amendment No. 3896.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To extend and expand eligibility for the Veterans Choice \n    Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs and to establish \nconsistent criteria and standards relating to the use of amounts under \n   the Medical Community Care account of the Department of Veterans \n                                Affairs)\n\n       At the end of title II of division B, add the following:\n\n\n           extension and expansion of veterans choice program\n\n       Sec. 251.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nworking with us on this very important issue of making sure that \nveterans in a number of our States are able to get quality care in a \nlocation that is convenient to them, and I appreciate his partnering \nwith me and Senator Schumer and others on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I was going to rise earlier when the Senator from \nMissouri spoke to talk about the question around infrastructure \ninvestment. This is infrastructure investment week, and stakeholders \nfrom across the country are here to continue to raise the question that \nwe need to do more to rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. We \nall know that recently we passed a 5-year highway bill, and I supported \nit. The FAST Act--as it was called--was a good bill, but it included \nonly modest increases in funding. Whether we look at our region's Metro \nor the Memorial Bridge that many of us travel on a regular basis or \nairports or water systems all over the country, it is clear that we \nneed to look at additional ways to invest in our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  Senator Blunt and I have filed an amendment to the current \nTransportation appropriations bill that we had before us that would \nestablish a National Infrastructure Financing Authority. The BRIDGE Act \nthat is cosponsored by six Republicans and six Democrats is bringing \nabout a new tool to make innovative ways to finance projects. I believe \nmy friend, the Senator from Connecticut, is a supporter of this type of \napproach.\n  Our bipartisan BRIDGE Act creates a $10 billion government loan \nfund--a loan fund that will repay. It doesn't add a single dime to the \nFederal deficit. All experts say this modest initial investment \nultimately could unlock up to $300 billion in private sector capital to \ninvest in our Nation's infrastructure.\n  Let's be honest. We all know why we are here. The funding mechanisms \nthat our transportation system relies on are simply unsustainable. We \nspend more money each year just in maintaining our highway trust fund \nand highway system than our highway trust fund brings in, yet our needs \ncontinue to grow.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave the United \nStates a D-plus grade on infrastructure. I don't know about my friend, \nthe Senator from New York, but I am sure that he often preferred grades \nbetter than D-plus when he was a student.\n  If we look over recent times, this is not a Democrat or Republican \nissue; this is a problem that has been gnawing at this country for some \ntime. There has been a 50-percent decrease in infrastructure investment \nas a percentage of our GDP since the 1970s. The United States spends \nless than 2 percent of our gross domestic product on infrastructure.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, underinvestment \nin our national infrastructure will cost each American family $3,400 a \nyear. That is wasted time. That is a city in gridlock. That is not \nbeing able to get to work and not being able to be with one's family. \nThe most significant gap, of course, is not only in water but, \nobviously, in transportation, where it has been estimated that an \nadditional $1 trillion is needed across the network--including roads, \nbridges, rail--during the next decade. Again, I point to many of the \nMembers in this body and so many of the folks who work for us simply \ntraveling across the Memorial Bridge, one of our Nation's icons, which \nis basically in a crumbling state.\n  Meanwhile, if we look at nations around the world in terms of what \nthey are doing--remember the United States is under 2 percent of GDP \ninvestment and infrastructure--Europe and India spend about 5 percent \nof their GDP on an annual basis in infrastructure. China spends nearly \n9 percent. Australia already has a national infrastructure financing \nauthority. China also has a national infrastructure funding authority \nthat is building out national high-speed rail networks.\n  Think about it. For most of the 20th century, it was American \ninfrastructure that led to America's economic dominance in the 20th \ncentury. Today, whether that is flying into our airports, looking at \nour rail system, or looking at our crumbling roads and systems, in many \nways, America's infrastructure is a disgrace and actually retards \neconomic growth.\n  As we tighten our belts at the State level--and I say that as a \nformer Governor--and at the Federal level, we\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\nneed to do everything we can to invest in infrastructure as a means of \nnot only providing jobs but helping the flow of goods and people and \nservices to stay competitive in the global economy.\n  Despite the recent passage of the so-called FAST Act, only 6 percent \nof infrastructure funding in the United States is from the private \nsector. With over $2.2 trillion sitting on private ledgers looking for \na place to invest, that meager 6-percent figure, in terms of private \nsector investment in infrastructure, could be dramatically increased.\n  The BRIDGE Act, the bill I am working on with Senator Blunt, \nestablishes such an authority. It complements existing Federal programs \nscattered across several ages. It allows us to consolidate the \nexpertise it takes to go against Wall Street in putting together \ninfrastructure financing programs.\n  This new authority could provide an important new tool for State and \nlocal governments to partner with the private sector to invest in our \nNation's infrastructure.\n  Let me be clear. Infrastructure financing alone isn't a silver \nbullet. If you finance, you have to pay those dollars back. But when we \nare looking at interest rates at record lows, failure to take advantage \nof accessing these private markets with interest rates at these low \nlevels is the equivalent of political malfeasance. In terms of the \nBRIDGE Act, this program would complement existing programs such as \nTIFIA and WIFIA, which already provide good work.\n  My hope is that joining with Senator Blunt and 12 of our colleagues--\nequal numbers of Democrats and Republicans--if not on this bill, we \nwill act on the BRIDGE Act and provide this critically important needed \ninfrastructure tool to our tool kit to make sure that our roads, \nbridges, airports, water and sewer systems are functioning and allow \nAmerica to compete in the 21st century economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be very brief. A number of us have \nclinics that serve our veterans population. I have one in Rochester. \nThe Senator from Virginia has one in Hampton Roads, and there are \nothers on both sides of the aisle where there is a potential problem \nbecause of the way CBO scored it. We have agreed that, rather than \npiggyback on the McCain amendment, we would figure out a bipartisan way \nto solve this problem in the NDAA bill. I very much appreciate the \ncommitment of my friend from Arizona to help us solve that problem.\n  I know we will have the complete cooperation of our ranking member, \nSenator Reed, and I look forward to trying to solve the problem for the \nbenefit of veterans throughout the country who don't get the services \nthey need, and we can move forward at least in 17 areas where they \nwill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the VA \nCommittee, I want to join my colleague from New York, and having worked \nwith Senator McCain on this amendment, I am very pleased that the \nMcCain-Blumenthal amendment has been made pending and that we have an \nagreement to authorize those VA leases that were requested over the \nlast fiscal year when we turned to the National Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  I want to stress that these leases have been requested over the last \nseveral fiscal years, and this agreement embodies a situation that has \nto be addressed. I thank my colleague from Arizona for working with me \non the amendment and now being so understanding on these requests, at \nleast in committing to make sure that we address this very strongly \nfelt need.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Virginia for his work on this \nissue and for his work on the infrastructure spending measure that he \nhas offered and that I have supported for years. I hope that we can get \nit done because the infrastructure of our Nation, as well as that of my \nState, requires that we commit the money as an investment. It is not \nfunding. It is not spending. It is an investment in our future. We \ncan't have a 21st century economy unless we have a 21st century \ninfrastructure--roads, bridges, rail, airports. I am pleased and proud \nto join him in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3897\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in a piece of legislation of this size, this \nscope, and this magnitude, there is always much to praise. \nUnfortunately, from time to time there is much to criticize.\n  Specifically, I rise today to try to correct one major mistake in \nthis bill. As currently written, it permits the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development to proceed to the implementation of its radical \nnew regulation, the insultingly misnamed affirmatively furthering fair \nhousing rule, or AFFH.\n  Proponents of AFFH, including President Obama, claim that AFFH \nfulfills the original purpose and promise of the Fair Housing Act of \n1968. The truth is, HUD's new housing rule isn't the fulfillment but a \nbetrayal of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The purpose of the Fair \nHousing Act was to protect the God-given right of individuals and \nfamilies, regardless of their skin color or their ethnicity, to buy and \nrent homes where they please. By contrast, the explicit purpose of \nHUD's new rule is to empower Federal bureaucrats to dictate where a \ncommunity's low-income residents will live. This is not what progress \nlooks like.\n  AFFH not only grants unprecedented new powers to HUD--powers that \nwere not contemplated and have no legitimate basis in the Fair Housing \nAct of 1968--but it will ultimately hurt the very people it purports to \nhelp--public housing residents, especially African-American public \nhousing residents who too often find themselves trapped in \ndysfunctional, broken neighborhoods.\n  To make matters worse, this new rule will end America's unique and \nuniquely successful commitment to localism and diversity and make \nneighborhood-level construction decisions subject to the whims of \nfuture Presidents. If this past year has not yet done enough to give \nyou pause about handing over such power to the executive branch, then \nyou are not paying close enough attention.\n  I am offering an amendment today, No. 3897, that would prohibit HUD \nfrom using Federal taxpayer money to carry out the affirmatively \nfurthering fair housing rule. The House of Representatives has already \npassed this amendment twice and will likely do so again in the near \nfuture. We should follow the lead of the House of Representatives in \nthis regard.\n  Here is how the rule works. AFFH requires cities and towns across the \ncountry to audit their own local housing policies under close \nsupervision by HUD regulators who may have never lived anywhere near \nthe city, town, or municipality in question. If any aspect of a \ncommunity's housing and demographic patterns fails to meet HUD \nbureaucrats' expansive definition of ``fair housing,'' the local \ngovernment must submit a plan to reorganize the community's housing \npractices according to the preferences and priorities set not by the \ncommunity in question but by the bureaucrats--the bureaucrats in \nWashington, possibly hundreds or even thousands of miles away.\n  Critics of AFFH often say and I have said myself that this rule turns \nHUD into a sort of national zoning board with the power to unilaterally \nrewrite local zoning laws and land use regulations in every city and \ntown in America. But that is not quite how the rule works, and that is \nwhy Senator Collins' amendment would not do anything to prevent the \nimplementation of the very things we worry about with AFFH. In the 10 \nmonths since the rule was finalized, it has become clear that the \nmechanics of AFFH are much more underhanded and subversive than critics \nhave often claimed. Under the new rule, HUD doesn't replace local \nhousing authorities, it conscripts them into its service. This gets to \nthe very heart of the difference between my amendment and the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, \nMs. Collins.\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\n  The danger of AFFH is not that HUD will direct local governments and \npublic housing authorities to make specific changes to their zoning \npolicies; it will just threaten them by tying obedience to Federal \ncommunity development block grants. Obedience to the commands of \nFederal regulators will be a conditional precedent of sorts to the \nongoing receipt of Federal funds under the CDBG Program.\n  CDBG is a Federal grant program controlled by HUD, one that allocates \nsome $3 billion per year to local governments to help them address a \nvariety of community development needs, including providing adequate \nand affordable public housing for their community. Traditionally, local \nofficials have been more or less free to use their CDBG funds according \nto their own community's unique needs and specific priorities, but \nunder AFFH, HUD officials will withhold local government CDBG funds \nunless that local government adopts HUD's preferred housing policies.\n  Predictably, proponents of the rule claim this will be a \ncollaborative process, with local government officials in the driver's \nseat while the bureaucrats at HUD merely provide support and guidance, \nbut the 10-month track record of AFFH suggests that precisely the \nopposite will be true. In fact, I have already heard from the housing \nauthority of Salt Lake County, predicting that the cost of complying \nwith AFFH will stretch their already thin resources, add hundreds of \nhours of bureaucratic paperwork to their workloads, and eliminate their \nautonomy to determine the best ways to provide adequate, low-cost \nhousing to their community.\n  The problem with HUD's new rule has nothing to do with the stated \nintentions behind it. In a press release announcing the finalization of \nAFFH, HUD Secretary Julian Castro said: ``Unfortunately, too many \nAmericans find their dreams limited by where they come from, and a ZIP \ncode should never determine a child's future.'' I completely agree. \nThere is no disputing that the neighborhood in which a child grows up \nmight affect his educational, social, and professional outcomes in the \nfuture. Nor is there any disagreement that far too many children today \nare raised in dysfunctional neighborhoods because it is the only place \ntheir parents can find affordable housing. The lack of affordable \nhousing is not a new problem in America--just ask anyone who has ever \nhad to pay rent in one of the major metropolitan areas controlled by \nthe Democratic Party--but neither is the solution. The best way to make \nhousing more affordable is to allow more housing to be built, and the \nbest way to help low-income citizens find fair and affordable housing \nis to empower them to live in a neighborhood that meets their needs.\n  The history of Chicago is instructive here. In the 2000s, the Chicago \ncity government demolished many of its public housing facilities \nwithout any kind of a plan to replace them. Those with the resources \nand wherewithal to choose where to live moved to places where housing \nwas cheap and economic opportunity was plentiful, but the less \nfortunate were relocated to more remote, less prosperous towns, towns \nlike Dubuque, IA, at the behest of--who else?--the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  In 2008 the city of Dubuque was struggling to meet the needs of its \nown public housing residents. Yet in stepped the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development declaring that the city's housing \npolicies would fail to meet the agency's fair housing standards and \nthat therefore the city would be ineligible to receive Federal funding \nfrom HUD unless the local government actively recruited Section 8 \nvoucher holders from Chicago. Unwilling to lose access to Federal \nfunding on which the city had come to rely, the small Iowa town \nacquiesced to HUD's demands--aggressive and unacceptable as they were. \nThis imposed an enormous administrative burden on the city's resource-\nstrapped housing agencies, but HUD's real victims were Chicago's public \nhousing residents who were forcibly displaced to an unknown town 200 \nmiles from the city they used to call home. Unless we pass this \namendment to defund the disastrously misguided AFFH rule, this is what \nthe future of public housing in America will look like.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and \nreaffirming that low-income families are not statistics to be managed \nby distant bureaucrats; they are human beings--our neighbors in need \nwho deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the \npresentation made by my colleague from Utah, Senator Lee, and I wish to \nrespond to the concerns he raised. Indeed, if the picture he drew were \naccurate, I might be a supporter rather than an opponent of his \namendment.\n  First, let me be clear that there is nothing in our bill that \nauthorizes this rule. This rule was issued pursuant to HUD's normal \nregulatory authority in response to a report, which I will discuss in a \nmoment, that was issued by the GAO, the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Lee would prohibit funding for HUD's \nrule that is known as the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule. \nIt was finalized in July of last year, but it is based on a requirement \nfrom the landmark civil rights-era law, the 1968 Fair Housing Act. That \nlaw mandates that HUD ensure that recipients of HUD funding not only \nprevent discrimination but also act to further the goals of fair \nhousing that are outlined in this landmark law. In fact, repeatedly \nover the years, Congress has reinforced this goal. As recently as 1998, \nthe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act required HUD program \nrecipients to affirmatively further fair housing.\n  When we talk about fair housing, it is important that we remember we \nare talking about not only prohibiting discrimination based on race but \nalso discrimination based on disabilities, ethnic origin, and even \nagainst families with children. In fact, in fiscal year 2015, 56 \npercent of all reported complaints of housing discrimination were \ninitiated by people with disabilities, and that is why so many \norganizations that are representing our disabled citizens are so \nstrongly opposed and concerned about Senator Lee's amendment.\n  For example, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, an organization that \nwas founded by servicemembers who returned home after World War II with \nspinal cord injury, believes that HUD's rule will help curb \ndiscrimination against people with disabilities, including our veterans \nand our seniors. According to the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the \nalarming trend of more than 50 percent of complaints about housing \ndiscrimination being initiated by individuals with disabilities will \naffect Americans returning from conflicts abroad, as well as a growing \npercentage of our seniors who are suffering from or living with \ndisabilities. The organization also believes that HUD's rule will help \nlocal governments identify strategies and solutions to expand \naccessible and supportive housing choices for our seniors and our \nveterans.\n  I wish everyone had heard Senator Isakson's eloquent speech on the \nfloor this afternoon when he talked about a wonderful, inclusive mixed-\nincome housing development in Atlanta that has included a charter \nschool and a Y. The children's test scores have gone up and crime has \ndecreased because of the model that was adopted for this particular \ndevelopment.\n  Earlier I mentioned that it is important to know that HUD issued this \nnew rule in response to a specific 2010 GAO report.\n  Members in this Chamber are always looking to GAO for information, \nadvice, and recommendations on how we can improve the effectiveness and \nthe efficiency of Federal programs to make sure they are fulfilling the \nmandates we have written and to make sure they are serving the people \nthey are intended to serve in the manner Congress intended.\n  GAO took a look at the fair housing requirements and particularly the \nrequirement in the Fair Housing Act that recipients of HUD's grants \nwere to affirmatively advance fair housing. It was very critical of the \nhaphazard nature of HUD's oversight and the fact that communities \ndidn't know whether they were in compliance. There was\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nalso a lack of tools, of community involvement, and of assessments to \nmake sure those goals were being met.\n\n  Once HUD issued its final rule, the GAO was satisfied and closed out \nits recommendations. As the Presiding Officer is well aware, there are \ntimes when Federal agencies never implement GAO's recommendations, or \ntake years to do so, and we in the Senate have to hammer the agencies \nover and over again on why they didn't implement GAO's recommendations. \nWell, in this case, HUD did so.\n  So not only was the origin of the rule the GAO report but also \ncommunities were seeking better tools and more guidance. Senator Kaine, \na former mayor of Richmond and a former Governor of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, was eloquent in describing the fact that he welcomed these \nrules because it was so hard when he was the mayor to know exactly how \nto accomplish the goal of affirmatively advancing fair housing. What \nexactly did that mean to HUD?\n  Indeed, there is an excellent article that appeared in The Hill today \nby the director of the PolicyLink Center for Infrastructure Equity and \nthe codirector of the Promise Neighborhoods Institute that talked about \nthe history of this rule. In particular--and I want to quote--the \nauthors say:\n\n       The opposition ignores the fact that the rule was developed \n     in response to city- and state-level requests for better \n     tools and improved guidance; that it involved significant \n     input from local-level innovators and experimenters; and that \n     it was piloted in 74 regions nationwide over five years in \n     the Sustainable Communities Initiative through a tool called \n     the fair housing and equity assessment.\n\n  It lists cities across the country, including Salt Lake City, \nironically; Denver, St. Paul, and Dallas, which have all invested in \naffordable housing, in transit-oriented developments to ensure that \nresidents would have access to affordable transit and housing choices, \njust as examples.\n  So the idea that this rule came out of thin air is just not accurate. \nIt is based on a law that has been on the books for decades--a law that \nis a landmark civil rights-era law--the 1968 Fair Housing Act. It is \nbased on a GAO report in 2010 which said HUD wasn't doing a good job. \nIt is based on requests from States and communities for more tools and \nmore guidance from HUD.\n  So this rule was not developed by our committee. It was not \nauthorized by our committee. It comes from the 1968 law which, as I \nsaid, has been reaffirmed in at least three subsequent laws that this \nbody has passed. It comes from a GAO report, and it involved a lot of \ninput.\n  Now, according to Senator Lee, and we heard him speak about it today, \nhe fears HUD is going to be turned into--I believe he called it a \nnational zoning authority for every neighborhood, and Federal \nbureaucrats thousands of miles away in Washington will be in charge of \nour local communities.\n  First, let me say I do not believe that to be the case, and I believe \nit is a misreading of the guidance. However, I would never want that \neither. That is why, along with my colleagues Senator Jack Reed and \nSenator Thad Cochran, we have introduced an amendment to ensure that \nHUD cannot do that, to prohibit HUD from being involved in local zoning \ndecisions so the recipients of Federal dollars will continue to make \ntheir own local decisions to address the Federal requirements.\n  Because there has been so much misrepresentation about our amendment, \nlet me read to my colleagues exactly what it says. It couldn't be more \nclear: None--none--of the funds made available by this act may be used \nby the Department of Housing and Urban Development to ``direct a \ngrantee to undertake specific change to existing zoning laws as part of \ncarrying out'' the final rule entitled ``affirmatively furthering fair \nhousing.''\n  I don't know how the amendment could be any clearer than that. We \nhave made sure the worst fear, the worst scenario the sponsor of this \namendment has conjured up, cannot occur if our amendment passes.\n  On the other hand, I want to point out what Senator Lee's amendment \nwould do. It would prevent HUD from providing the necessary technical \nassistance, guidance, and help that localities have continuously asked \nHUD to provide to ensure that they don't get sued, that they are not \nsusceptible to costly and unnecessary fair housing litigation brought \nby individuals or outside groups. They want HUD's help, but under the \nLee amendment no funding could be used to give them that kind of help. \nI don't see how that makes sense. That is how broadly written his \namendment is.\n  I want to correct something else that was said. Senator Lee talked \nabout the enormous burden this rule will impose on the recipients of \nHUD funds. To be clear, the rule requires the recipients to complete \nthe fair housing analysis only once every 5 years--once every 5 years--\nsimilar to all other HUD requirements in their consolidated plans. So \nthat argument, in my judgment, also falls.\n  Let me say that we are all aware of concerns, despite the tremendous \nprogress that has been made in this country, about the lack of progress \nin providing housing opportunities to all Americans. That is why in our \nbill we try to deal with homeless veterans--we do deal with homeless \nveterans. We put in $57 million for additional vouchers for homeless \nveterans, even though the administration wanted to eliminate that \nimportant program. We are continuing to work on that.\n  Finally, let me respond to a specific case that Senator Lee mentioned \ninvolving Chicago and Dubuque. To begin with, it is simply a mistake in \na statement to say that Chicago residents were ``forced to relocate to \nDubuque.'' That is just not accurate. It is true that this is a Federal \nvoucher program and, as Republicans, we usually like vouchers because \nwe want Americans to have choices about where they live. So the section \n8 program, for example, which is a voucher-based program, doesn't say \nthat you can only use it in Portland, ME, or Providence, RI, or Salt \nLake City, UT, or Chicago, IL. It is a program that allows people to \nlive where they want to live, but it is a program with a long waiting \nlist in most cities. Nothing--also, despite what has been written--\nnothing in the rule requires that Dubuque be considered part of \nChicago. That is not a statement that the sponsor of the amendment made \ntoday, but it is a statement that has been circulated by some outside \ngroups and it is simply ridiculous. It is absolutely absurd.\n  The concerns raised with Dubuque are related to a settlement that the \ncity reached with HUD in 2013, which was well before this rule was \nfinalized. The agreement was the result of a compliance review under \nthe Civil Rights Act--title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--which \nprohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in \nprograms receiving assistance. Sadly, the city of Dubuque was found to \nnot be in compliance with the Civil Rights Act because the city was \npurging and closing wait lists for the section 8 voucher program and \ncreating residency requirements that are not allowed. Indeed, it is sad \nto say, in the letter of finding, HUD wrote: ``The City of Dubuque knew \nits actions would limit or deny the participation of African Americans \nin its Section 8 program.'' I would hope we could all agree--I am sure \nwe could all agree--that is just wrong.\n  So the Dubuque case, rather than being an example of the bizarre \nconsequences of this rule, as has been portrayed, is in fact yet \nanother reminder that even in this day and age there continue to be \nsome clear violations of the Fair Housing Act.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against Senator Lee's \namendment. I am sure he is well-intentioned, but the effects of this \namendment would be very harmful to the goals we all share of fair \nhousing in America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to support my colleague, the chairman \nof the subcommittee, Senator Collins of Maine, in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Utah. This amendment would \nprohibit HUD from implementing or enforcing its Affirmatively \nFurthering Fair Housing regulations.\n  I think it is important to remind everyone of the reasoning for and \nhistory behind these regulations. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was \nenacted because banks, landlords, and developers were excluding people \nfrom buying or renting in certain neighborhoods based on race. Under \nthe Fair Housing Act, communities are required to take steps to further \nfair housing in order to prevent discrimination and segregation.\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\n  I think we have come a long way since 1968, and I don't think anyone \nis arguing the premise, purpose, or beneficial aspects of the Fair \nHousing Act. The law is based on trying to ensure that Americans have \nfair access to housing, no matter their race, physical ability, family \nstatus, or religion.\n  People should be able to live according to their own choice and \nresources. I hope that we can all agree that people should not be \nturned away from a home or neighborhood because of their religion, \nfamily status, disability, or race. Frankly, that was the aspiration in \n1968 and still, too often, remains an aspiration. HUD is trying to give \nlocal communities the tools and resources needed to live up to the \nlegislative mandate that we imposed and continue to impose.\n  As the chairman said so well, these regulations don't emanate from \nsome person in a room thinking a great thought. In 2010, the Government \nAccountability Office did an audit to assess compliance with the Fair \nHousing Act. That is the GAO's job. That office checks whether Federal \nagencies are doing what we--the Congress--tell them to do. GAO found \nthat many HUD grantees did not analyze impediments to fair housing--\nthat we were giving money to organizations throughout this country and \nthat they were not even making attempts to analyze the impediments that \nexisted to fair housing.\n  GAO also found that those organizations that did analyze impediments \nto fair housing often failed to establish any goals or objectives to \naddress them. The organizations just found them and did not act. That \nis not what the Fair Housing Act requires.\n  GAO also found that HUD was unable to determine if a community was \nactually meeting its obligations under the Fair Housing Act. HUD simply \ndid not know whether the requirements of the Fair Housing Act were \nbeing implemented at the local level.\n  HUD is often criticized for not effectively responding to GAO, but \nhere they responded. HUD developed regulations that insist that \ngrantees conduct a fair housing analysis and submit that assessment to \nHUD for review.\n  As a result of this proposed regulation, HUD went through a 2-year \nrulemaking process. This was not some whimsical spur-of-the-moment \ndecision or press release to say: Let's do this.\n  The process was 2 years long, fully open to public hearing, comment \nand review, and susceptible to challenge in court if it did not measure \nup to the Administrative Procedure Act or the Fair Housing Act. This \nprocess has resulted in regulations that will actually carry out the \nintent of the Congress.\n  To reinforce and clarify what the chairman has said, these \nregulations do not change existing law and do not in any way dictate \nlocal zoning decisions. In fact, these regulations simplify the \nresponsibility of grantees to comply with the Fair Housing Act because \nthey give grantees the data and tools to help communities comply with \nthe law.\n  These regulations do not require grantees to gather new data because \nHUD provides the data to them. To help communities comply with the Fair \nHousing Act, HUD is working closely with grantees, providing technical \nassistance, and holding training sessions across the country. This is a \ncollaborative effort. It is an effort that does not dictate a national \noutcome. HUD is helping localities, working with their particular \nsituation, to develop a response to the legislative requirements that \nwe have been emphatically insisting upon since 1968.\n  We are also working, as we should, to ensure that this process is \ncontinually evaluated by HUD, and streamlined and simplified--\nparticularly, when it comes to dealing with small communities that \ncannot bear the administrative overhead that some larger cities might \nbe able to bear. HUD is providing assistance to ensure that these \ngrantees are complying with the Fair Housing Act.\n  We all understand--and this principle applies not just to HUD \nprograms, but every program--that grantees have an obligation to use \nFederal resources responsibly and consistently with legal requirements. \nThe Fair Housing Act requires that access to housing not be denied \nbecause of race, disability, or other protected category. This is what \nwe should expect for all recipients of Federal support--that they \nfollow the law.\n  This improved process, in my view, protects communities and ensures \nthat they still have a choice of how they meet their obligations under \nthe Fair Housing Act. There is nothing in these regulations that \nundermines the ability of a local community to determine these \nsolutions, but these communities must recognize their responsibilities. \nTheir solutions are ones that will be organic to the community--what \nworks for them, given the objective of ensuring that there are no \nartificial impediments to access housing.\n  It is also important to note that, if HUD is prevented from \nimplementing these regulations, there is no change to the obligations \nthat these communities have under the Fair Housing Act. This law has \nbeen in place for 48 years. Those requirements will still remain in \nplace and will not only be opportunities, but also obligations to take \naction in certain cases.\n  Senator Kaine was on the floor this morning stating that, as a young \nlawyer in Richmond, VA, he became an advocate for fair housing because \npeople came to him with complaints, and he took those complaints to \ncourt. What we are trying to do, interestingly enough, is to avoid all \nof that by having a process where the impediments have been removed by \na local solution.\n  The amendment that Senator Lee proposes would prevent HUD from \nsatisfying these GAO recommendations to provide guidance, clarity, and \nsupport for these grantees. This amendment makes grantees liable for \ncompliance without the tools and data needed to comply. Ironically, it \nprobably puts grantees in a worse position.\n  So I join the chairman and urge all of my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe 2017 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. Senator Collins and Senator Reed deserve \ntremendous credit for their leadership on this bipartisan bill.\n  Congress has the basic responsibility to determine how we spend hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars. It is a responsibility that my colleagues and \nI on the Appropriations Committee take very seriously. Debating and \npassing these annual bills provides accountability. It is an important \npart of setting priorities, making choices, and reducing waste.\n  Last week, the Senate passed an energy and water appropriations bill \ncrafted by Senators Alexander and Feinstein. While I don't serve on \ntheir subcommittee, I was very proud to support their bill, and I \ncongratulate them on moving forward and making the process work.\n  The 2017 Transportation and HUD appropriations bill is the latest \nexample of the Senate's return to regular order. This process enables \nall Senators to play an active role in the legislative process and to \naddress concerns that are important to their States. This bill is \ncrafted with bipartisan support, and it helps to drive the growth of \nour Nation. Senators Collins and Reed have put in a lot of work to \nprepare this bill for consideration, as have both of their staffs. The \ndiscretionary spending in this bill is within the budget caps, and it \nreflects a responsible approach. The bill strengthens our country's \ninfrastructure and transportation system.\n  This week is recognized as Infrastructure Week, and I have heard from \nseveral Arkansans that this must remain a priority. Our citizens have \nopportunities, and our Nation is a powerful economic force, thanks in \npart to our roads and bridges, airports, waterways, and related \nstructures. We need to maintain our roads because they provide a \nreliable way to move goods and services around the country and, with \nthe rest of our infrastructure, to countries around the world. These \ninvestments lead to job creation and greatly benefit our economy.\n  The bill provides critical funding to modernize air traffic control. \nWhile our current system is second to none in safety, the FAA must \naccelerate its progress toward operating a more efficient system. A \nmodern air traffic control system will be more convenient for \ntravelers, it will save money, and it will clean the environment by \nreducing the amount of fuel used by aircraft.\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\nThe bill provides critical funding to improve air traffic certification \nservices. These improvements can help aircraft manufacturers, including \nthose in Arkansas, that are fighting to win in a competitive global \nmarket.\n  The bill provides critical highway funding that is consistent with \nthe long-term highway bill we passed last year under the leadership of \nSenators Inhofe and Boxer. I am pleased that this bill includes a \nprovision I offered to empower the State to designate a portion of \nHighway 67 in Arkansas, from North Little Rock to Walnut Ridge, as \n``Future I-57.'' Arkansas has invested hundreds of millions of dollars \nto build an interstate-quality road, and we are now calling it what it \nis. The presence of an official interstate highway is one of the \ninitial key factors that developers consider when determining where to \nmake major investments such as building new factories.\n  Community leaders along this stretch of road shared their excitement \nabout the future designation. Buck Layne, executive director for the \nSearcy Regional Chamber of Commerce, says this will improve the \ntransportation network and expand economic development opportunities.\n  Jon Chadwell, executive director for the Newport Economic Development \nCommission, says this will open up opportunities to Arkansas business \nand give companies an even greater access to national and global \nmarkets.\n  Walnut Ridge mayor Charles Snapp says this designation will open a \nlot of doors, and Walnut Ridge aldermen voted this week to support this \ndesignation.\n  Resolutions of support for the I-57 designation have been passed by \nthe Newport Economic Development Commission, as well as the chambers of \ncommerce in Bald Knob, Cabot, Jacksonville, Lawrence County, Newport, \nSherwood, and Searcy. Other expressions of support will be received in \ncommunities throughout the central Arkansas and northeast Arkansas \nregions.\n  This designation is an important step to make Arkansas a better \nconnected State that is open for business. This bill also sets high \npriorities and provides critical funding through programs like \ncommunity development block grants. These programs work because they \nallow decisions to be made at the local community level.\n  I appreciate the efforts to make sure rural States like Arkansas are \nnot left behind by housing and development programs.\n  I compliment the chair and ranking member on working to address \nMember priorities under these programs.\n  We are also jointly considering the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs bill. Senators Kirk and Tester have worked very hard \nto put together a good package for the Senate to debate. Their bill \nfunds the VA at record levels and invests in priorities such as \nveterans health care, benefit claims processing, the Board of Veterans' \nAppeals, and the VA inspector general, as well as prosthetic research. \nIt includes funding for projects to ensure military readiness and \nimprove the quality of life for our military families.\n  I grew up in a military family, and I have been honored to serve on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee since my first day in the House of \nRepresentatives. The needs of veterans are very important to me, and I \nam proud to support the work that Senator Kirk and Senator Tester have \ndone to provide funding for 2017. These are funding and policy \npriorities for both sides of the aisle.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation because it \ncreates an environment that helps grow our economy, reins in spending, \nand takes care of our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the work of \nthe chairman and ranking member on the Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development Appropriations Subcommittee for their good work on \nthis very important appropriations bill.\n  I recognize that, while we haven't had a multiple series of votes on \namendments on this bill, I know the floor managers have been working \naggressively to process amendments and make this appropriations bill--\nnot only the T-HUD bill but also the MILCON bill--a good appropriations \nmeasure. So I thank my colleagues for their respective efforts, and I \nam pleased to see us processing appropriations bills here on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this evening to talk \nabout the Affordable Care Act and some of the impacts that we are \nseeing in my State of Alaska. We referred to this as the ACA, the \nAffordable Care Act, but most of the folks, when I talk to them back \nhome, call it the ``un-Affordable Care Act'' because we are not seeing \nhow it is making health care insurance--any kind of care--more \naffordable.\n  Last year, nationally, we saw a dozen co-ops fail that were created \nby the ACA, which literally threw people into turmoil, leaving in \nquestion if they had any insurance at all.\n  UnitedHealth, one of the largest providers in the country, has been \nforced off the exchanges in numerous States.\n  Just last week we had the news back home that Moda Health was going \nto be withdrawing from the Alaska market in 2017. What that means is \nthat we will be a State with only one option in the individual market \nnext year. So what that means for the some 14,000 Alaskans who are \ncurrently on a Moda plan is that they are going to be forced to change \ninsurers next year. But I guess it is an easy choice when you only have \na choice of one on the individual market there.\n  Then, of course, just last week we saw signs that the \nadministration's payments of the cost-share reduction were \nunconstitutional. So we can only assume that is going to further \nexacerbate problems.\n  This week in the Wall Street Journal, there was an article about the \never-shrinking market for rural areas. The article mentioned a small \nbusiness owner in Kodiak, AK, a bookkeeper, who is worrying about what \nthe price of premiums will be when you are left with only one option. \nShe made this statement:\n\n       It's going to be a monopoly, basically; ``here's the price, \n     take it or leave it.''\n\n  That is what happens when you have just one.\n  As the market continues to fail in other States, we are seeing other \nStates lose their options as well. Alabama and Wyoming are also now \nleft with only one choice. More States may be facing this in the near \nfuture.\n  The Wall Street Journal article goes on to point out that the \n``patchwork of coverage reflects continued instability in the \nindividual market as companies shift their geographic footprints to \navoid areas that have turned out to generate steep losses and focus on \nplaces that they believe that they can get their ACA business into the \nblack.''\n  So what that means for States like Alaska that are very rural and \nthat have some of the highest health care costs in the Nation: We are \njust not attractive enough to foster competition. At the end of the \nday, who suffers? It is the Alaskans. It is those who are seeking the \ncare.\n  The administration says the market just needs to ``stabilize and \nevolve,'' but what about this bookkeeper in Kodiak? What about the \neducators out there? What about parents who are left wondering: What do \nwe do in the meantime?\n  It used to be that the Federal Government broke up monopolies and \nworked to foster competition in order to benefit consumers, but now \nwhat we are seeing at least playing out in my State is, through bad law \nand failed policies, we see that same government creating de facto \nmonopolies in the individual marketplace.\n  I find it deeply troubling that as these health insurance options \ncontinue to shrink, any hope of curbing the rapid increase of premium \nrates also disappears. We are constantly asked by our constituents: Are \nmy premiums going to continue to increase? We are talking about monthly \npremiums in the State of Alaska amounting to $3,000 a month for a \nfamily. Think about that. That is not affordable in anybody's book. It \nis not beyond the realm of possibility given what we have already seen. \nLast year in Alaska, between Moda and Premera, the two that are \ncovering on the individual market, the increases were over 30 percent, \nsomewhere between 32 and 35 percent increases over the previous year.\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\n  I have been on the floor, and I have shared stories of hard-working \nAlaskans who are paying a couple of thousand dollars a month for the \ncheapest bronze plan that is available on the exchange. I have spoken \nabout how the ACA has been called the single greatest threat to quality \npublic education. The reason for that is our school districts are being \nfaced with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines under the Cadillac \ntest when it is imposed. I have relayed stories from employers who are \nsaying: I can't afford to expand my business. I won't expand my \nbusiness because of the employer mandate--harming not only the \nbusinesses but the workers themselves.\n  The bottom line, and I hear it from all corners of the State, is that \nthe ACA is not working for us in Alaska.\n  I had a group of Realtors from around the State visit me in my office \nhere last week. One woman in the group said that she was paying $2,500 \na month. She has a family of four. She has a $6,000 deductible for her \ncoverage. She said: You know, it is really hard for us to keep making \nthese payments every month. They don't qualify for the subsidy.\n  I talked to another young family from Eagle River who was forced to \nswitch from Premera to Moda after the ACA passed because the premium \nincreases were not sustainable, and even then, when they switched, they \nwere paying $1,200 a month with a $10,000 deductible. So what happens \nwhen you have a deductible like that? You put off that health care.\n  But think about it. It just makes it so hard to run a business. It \nmakes it so hard to pay for your day-to-day experiences.\n  Worse yet, for that family from Eagle River, they went from Premera \nto Moda because their premiums were too high. Now Moda is leaving, so \nthey have to go back to the insurer that was too high before. This \nfamily is scrambling. What are they going do? How are they going to be \nable to afford insurance in the future?\n  As the costs continue to rise, these small businesses are wondering: \nHow long do we keep our doors open if these costs continue at these \nrates?\n  In Anchorage, a couple who has Moda has been paying $2,500 a month, \nwith a $10,000 deductible--an increase of $1,000 a month over their \npremiums for last year. Now they are going to be switching to the only \ncompany on the individual market in 2017. They are going to see yet \nanother increase.\n  A woman in Anchorage whom we talked to has watched year after year as \nher rates increased from $500 a month to nearly $2,000 a month. She is \nbasically holding her breath for what the 2017 premiums rates will \nhold. We don't know yet in Alaska. Because of the announcement from \nModa, we are not sure what the increase will be coming from the other \ninsurer.\n  More and more, I am hearing from folks who say that they feel it is \njust cheaper to simply not buy insurance, to pay the tax penalty and \nthen hope and pray that nobody in the family gets sick. Hoping to not \nget sick is not a health plan. As more and more Alaskans are dropping \nout, costs for those who stay in go up, driving more to drop out, and \nyou have this death spiral within the system.\n  The deeper we get into life under the ACA, the deeper Alaskans fall \ninto a hole. The ACA has failed the people of our State. This one-size-\nfits-all approach rarely works for a State as diverse as Alaska. It \ncertainly has not worked in the realm of health insurance.\n  This is not the only place where we are seeing the law failing. There \nis more that needs to be done to make the Affordable Care Act work for \nrural parts of the country that have specialized needs thanks to higher \nmedical costs, lack of access, and now fewer insurance options.\n  We in Congress need to take a serious look at the trends we have seen \nand work on solutions that will provide the flexibility that is needed \nfor the States to make a difference when it comes to access to \naffordable care.\n  I have consistently supported full repeal of the ACA. I voted to do \nso on several occasions now. But I have also recognized that it was \ngoing to be difficult, if not impossible, in this administration to do \nso. But I have supported steps that will reduce the burdens of the ACA \nand I think work to address some of the most harmful provisions in the \nlaw. One example is full repeal of the Cadillac tax I just mentioned. \nThe Cadillac tax will only worsen conditions in Alaska, with nearly 62 \npercent of customers who will be facing that tax if the Cadillac tax \nwere to be implemented. Again, I repeat, in our State, not only are our \nhealth care costs so high, but our insurance costs are so high.\n  Whether you are in what would be considered a Cadillac plan because \nof the benefits or it is just because you are paying so much for it, it \nis assumed that those benefits are good. Sixty-two percent of the folks \nin Alaska would be impacted by this tax. It is a prime example of the \nACA hurting small, rural States, because so many of us have more \nexpensive health care due to the remoteness and due to our lower \npopulation size. Then those States are forced to take money away from \nthings, like our school districts, where they are trying to put the \nmoney into public education, into other services, to pay for the cost. \nSo our State suffers, boroughs suffer, our schools suffer, and our \nAlaskan families suffer.\n  As we look to the end of this administration and looking to next \nyear, I would hope that we can seriously address the problem that the \nACA has created for so many areas of our country.\n  For rural States like Alaska, the approach to health care needs to \nfocus on more than forcing people to just buy insurance and, \nunfortunately, buy expensive insurance. We need to work to find \nsolutions to these issues, whether it be through the creation of a \nnationwide insurance pool so that policies are not limited to one \nState, as they are currently. Right now, as I say, Alaska is not a very \nattractive market. We have small numbers. We have high costs. Who is \ngoing to come? How are we going to get a greater pool?\n  We need to look more critically at how we improve the cost of \ntransparency of medical procedures. We need to look critically at these \nspecial enrollment periods and see if people are finding loopholes that \nallow them to game the system.\n  Expanding both health savings and flexible spending accounts will \nallow people to save what they think they should and make the choices \nfor themselves instead of the government forcing things on individuals.\n  When we think about those areas where we can save money through not \nspending it in the first place--an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure--we should be incentivizing people to live healthier lifestyles \nin order to prevent and bring down the incidence of chronic disease. \nType 2 diabetes--largely preventible through lifestyle changes--costs \nan estimated $176 billion a year. Obesity-related illnesses cost an \nestimated $190 billion a year. A recent study found that a 10-percent \ndrop in smokers could save $63 billion in health care costs per year. \nIt makes zero sense to be paying providers to treat these problems \nafter they have arisen rather than trying to focus on the front end, \npaying for lifestyle changes and case management that would \nsignificantly reduce the cost of treating these diseases.\n  I have been working to find solutions that will help support Alaska's \nrural needs, especially those related to access and workforce \ndevelopment because if we can improve the overall access to treatment \nand options to medical providers, we then take steps to reduce the cost \nof medical procedures.\n  I have supported the Family Health Care Accessibility Act that will \nimprove the care provided by community health centers by enabling them \nto utilize volunteer primary care providers. Community health centers--\nI think so many of us recognize the benefits and the crucial role they \nserve in meeting the needs of rural and underserved communities, \nallowing patients to receive local treatment instead of being forced to \ntravel far from home for treatment.\n  Steps like these that help to improve access are just some of the \nways I think we should be rethinking our approach to health care in the \nbroader sense as we seek to alleviate the burdens that have been \nimposed by the ACA.\n  I have continued over several Congresses now to introduce the \nMedicare Patient Empowerment Act. This is legislation that would give \npatients the\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\noption to negotiate with their provider. Medicare would pay the typical \nfee the patient negotiates for the difference there, but we face a very \nunique situation in our State. Again, a one-size-fits-all prescription \ndoesn't work for us. We have incredibly low reimbursement rates for \nMedicare in Alaska, so you have very few providers that will accept \nMedicare. When you are newly Medicare eligible or you come into the \nState, it is tough to find anybody who will see you.\n  If there is some flexibility to negotiate prices, what we are trying \nto do with this bill is cut through the redtape, allow Medicare \nbeneficiaries to benefit from increased access, and enable patients to \nhave the relationships they have built with their physicians. We have a \nvery fast-rising senior population in the State, and it is going to be \nincreasingly important to make sure they have the option to seek the \ncare they need.\n  I do not support compulsory health insurance but do believe \nindividuals with preexisting conditions should receive care. As we \ndiscuss these important issues in the Senate, I continue to work to \naddress--again--these issues that have presented themselves with \nimplementation of the ACA. So working to a place where we fully repeal \nand replace the ACA is where we need to be.\n  There have been several Republican proposals that would not only \nreplace this unworkable law but replace it with consumer-based reforms. \nSenator Burr of North Carolina, Senator Hatch of Utah, and Senator \nCassidy of Louisiana all have been working on important measures that \ntake steps to get us to a place where what we are talking about is \naffordable health care, a reality that works for all Americans, whether \nyou are in Alaska or you are in North Carolina.\n  Obviously, there is much work in front of us. Again, it is important \nto recognize the frustration so many are feeling as they are seeing \ntheir costs increase, their access going nowhere, and let them know we \ncontinue to work on these very difficult issues. Alaskans deserve it. \nAmericans deserve it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                     Memorial for Fallen Educators\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for just a few moments \nabout the Memorial for Fallen Educators in conjunction with the \nNational Teachers Hall of Fame located on the campus of Emporia State \nUniversity in Emporia, KS.\n  When someone asks the question, ``Other than your family, name a \nperson who has made a difference in your life,'' the answer has never \nbeen my Senator, my Congressman. More often the response is a teacher. \nThat answer speaks volumes about the influence of an educator on the \nlives of young people. Teachers fulfill a variety of roles by \nencouraging our children, instilling values, and challenging them. Too \noften we take this profession for granted, and the people who make \neducation possible are teachers.\n  Each one of us remembers a teacher. We remember in the first grade or \nsecond grade when they helped us sound out the big words or guided our \nhands as we struggled to make out the shapes of letters.\n  We remember the middle school teacher or the gym teacher who taught \nus how to spike the volleyball or sink the winning hoop while playing \nin the playoffs. We remember the high school science teacher who helped \nus dissect frogs or build a box made of toothpicks that would protect \nthe egg as it dropped from a two-story building.\n  Our teachers are our friends, our mentors, and our role models. The \nlessons they teach us stick with us for a long time after we have left \ntheir classrooms. Their jobs are never done, and educators know that \noften the last ringing bell of the afternoon, rather than signaling the \nend of their workday, begins the beginning of a new kind of work--\ngrading homework, tutoring individual students, or prepping for the \nnext day's lesson plan.\n  Educators work round-the-clock on behalf of the kids they instruct. \nThey take on a job that requires more hours than there are in the day \nbecause they believe in their students and because they know how \ncrucial their efforts are in seeing these students succeed. I believe \nwe change the world one person at a time, and it happens in classrooms \nacross Kansas and around the country every day.\n  Teachers often forfeit material gain for the thrill of seeing a \nstudent's eyes light up when they discover a new concept or grasp a new \nidea. Teachers have long understood they truly shape the world by their \nwork, and their greatest product is an educated society.\n  Unfortunately, each day teachers walk into their classrooms they are \nalso subject to threats of bullying or violence. Far too many educators \nhave lost their lives in the line of their professional duty. Teachers \nhave been killed at the hands of students, and many have been killed \nprotecting their students from adults perpetrating violent acts.\n  To honor these slain teachers, the National Teachers Hall of Fame, \nunder the leadership of the director, Carol Strickland, created the \nMemorial for Fallen Educators. The memorial, which was dedicated 2 \nyears ago at Emporia State University, stands alongside the National \nTeachers Hall of Fame. I had the honor of visiting the site last \nSeptember.\n  Already built and paid for, the memorial lists the names of educators \nacross the country since 1764 who have lost their lives while working \nwith students. It is owned and cared for by the National Teachers Hall \nof Fame and Emporia State University.\n  I introduced legislation last year that would designate the Memorial \nfor Fallen Educators as a national memorial. The more than 100 fallen \nteachers whose names are etched in marble taught in schools across the \ncountry. As a nation, together we should recognize the incredible \nsacrifices they each made because of their dedication to educating \nyoung people--their dedication to caring, loving, and protecting young \npeople.\n  This legislation has no cost to the taxpayer and private funds will \nbe used to maintain the memorial. It simply brings the site--the only \none in the United States dedicated to fallen educators--the national \nprestige it merits.\n  As the Senate considers the national memorials proposed for \ndesignation, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nworthy tribute to our fallen teachers. Anyone who has ever been \ninspired by an educator should visit the memorial and recognize and \nremember those honorable lives which have been lost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

AUTHORIZATION OF CERTAIN MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY \n                   PROJECTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, which was passed \n     by the Senate on November 10, 2015, without a single vote \n     cast against the bill, and the Consolidated Appropriations \n     Act, 2016 include the following amounts to be appropriated to \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs:\n       (A) $35,000,000 to make seismic corrections to Building 208 \n     at the West Los Angeles Medical Center of the Department in \n     Los Angeles, California, which, according to the Department, \n     is a building that is designated as having an exceptionally \n     high risk of sustaining substantial damage or collapsing \n     during an earthquake.\n       (B) $158,000,000 to provide for the construction of a new \n     research building, site work, and demolition at the San \n     Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n       (C) $161,000,000 to replace Building 133 with a new \n     community living center at the Long Beach Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center, which, according to the Department, is a \n     building that is designated as having an extremely high risk \n     of sustaining major damage during an earthquake.\n       (D) $468,800,000 for construction projects that are \n     critical to the Department for ensuring health care access \n     and safety at medical facilities in Louisville, Kentucky, \n     Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, Perry Point, \n     Maryland, American Lake, Washington, Alameda, California, and \n     Livermore, California.\n       (2) The Department is unable to obligate or expend the \n     amounts described in paragraph (1), other than for \n     construction design, because the Department lacks an explicit \n     authorization by an Act of Congress pursuant to section \n     8104(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, to carry out the \n     major medical facility projects described in such paragraph.\n       (3) Among the major medical facility projects described in \n     paragraph (1), three are critical seismic safety projects in \n     California.\n       (4) Every day that the critical seismic safety projects \n     described in paragraph (3) are delayed increases the risk of \n     a life-threatening building failure in the case of a major \n     seismic event.\n       (5) According to the United States Geological Survey--\n       (A) California has more than a 99 percent chance of \n     experiencing an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the \n     next 30 years;\n       (B) even earthquakes of less severity than magnitude 6.7 \n     can cause life threatening damage to seismically unsafe \n     buildings;

Under the \n     legislation, the National Park Service (NPS) would administer \n     the river segments in partnership with an advisory committee \n     composed of local representatives. Based on the cost of \n     similar management partnerships in the region, CBO estimates \n     that NPS would provide about $170,000 annually to the \n     advisory committee to manage the river segments.

It would \n     authorize the sale of certain federal land and permit the \n     proceeds from those sales to be spent. The bill also would \n     establish a fund to carry out deferred maintenance projects \n     on lands administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and \n     would permanently authorize the transfer of funds to the Land \n     and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).\n       CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase both \n     direct spending and offsetting receipts (which are treated as \n     reductions in direct spending) by $65 million and $80 million \n     respectively over the 2017-2026 period; therefore, pay-as-\n     you-go procedures apply.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about a column written \nby Ms. Karen Budd-Falen, a Wyoming attorney, entitled ``Major \nRegulatory Expansion of ESA Listing and Critical Habitat Designation.'' \nThe article was published in the Wyoming Livestock Roundup on March 19, \n2016.\n  Through a variety of rules, regulations, and seemingly innocuous \nproposals, agencies under this administration have gone outside their \ncongressionally given authorities and willfully ignored the intent of \nthe very statutes that authorize Federal management of public lands and \nresources.\n  In the article, Karen raises a series of concerns, concerns I share, \nabout the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's calculated efforts \nto change key parts of the Endangered Species Act. Through a series of \nadministrative revisions, the Service has substantially changed the way \ncritical habitat is designated for species listed for protection under \nthe act. Critical habitat, as Karen recognizes in her article, is ``. . \n. generally habitat upon which the species depends for survival. \nImportantly critical habitat can include both private and/or federal \nland and water.'' Karen outlines that, through piecemeal revisions, the \nService has effectively removed all limitations of this definition.\n  No longer will the Service be limited to enact Federal policy on a \nprecise area where a species lives. Now a Federal agency may implement \nany number of restrictions on a ``significant portion'' of the range a \nspecies may or may not inhabit, for an undetermined period of time. The \nService has made it clear that even ``potential habitat'' can be \ncontrolled, even if it is unclear whether the species will ever use \nthat area.\n  Karen also raises concerns about notification of private landowners, \nconsideration of economic impacts, and the undeniable link between \nchanges the Service has made and an increase in Federal permitting. The \nlink between these changes and the intent of this administration is \nclear: any action taken on any land, no matter whether private or \npublic, can now be considered under Federal jurisdiction if the Service \nso chooses. Not only is this arbitrary, but it is a clear case of \nFederal overreach.\n  In Wyoming, we know that the most successful habitat conservation \nefforts are conducted by people on the ground who have a vested \ninterest in the health of wildlife and the landscape they inhabit. \nThese people are local business owners, local landowners, ranchers, and \nState experts. These people understand both the needs of the landscape \nand the scope of appropriate conservation efforts, things that \nWashington officials seemingly fail to grasp or willfully ignore.\n  Unfortunately, the alarm that Karen has sounded is one of many \ncurrently deafening the American people. Karen has likened the \nService's critical habitat reforms to the Environmental Protection \nAgency's controversial waters of the United States campaign. The \ncomparison is apt. This administration has perpetuated a culture of Big \nGovernment by ignoring the biological, economic, and social realities \nof its irresponsible policies.\n  Federal actions such as this dilute the effectiveness of successful \nconservation efforts and create limitless uncertainty for private \nlandowners. I urge my colleagues to continue to stand with rural \nAmericans who must not bear the brunt of irresponsible Federal \noverreach.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article written by Karen Budd-Falen.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup; Mar. 19, 2016]\n\n    Major Regulatory Expansion of ESA Listing and Critical Habitat \n                              Designation\n\n                         (By Karen Budd-Falen)\n\n       While private property owners were vehemently protesting \n     the EPA's expansion of jurisdiction under the Clean Water \n     Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, collectively FWS, \n     were bit-by-bit expanding the federal government's overreach \n     on private property rights and federal grazing permits \n     through the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This expansion is \n     embodied in the release of four separate final rules and two \n     final policies that the FWS admits will result in listing \n     more species and expanding designated critical habitat.\n       To understand the expansiveness of the new policies and \n     regulations, a short discussion of the previous regulations \n     may help. Prior to the Obama changes, a species was listed as \n     threatened or endangered based upon the ``best scientific and \n     commercial data available.'' With regard to species that are \n     potentially threatened or endangered ``throughout a \n     significant portion of its range'' but not all of the \n     species'' range, only those species within that ``significant \n     portion of the range'' are listed not all species throughout \n     the entire range.\n       Once the listing is completed, FWS is mandated to designate \n     critical habitat. Critical habitat is generally habitat upon \n     which the species depends for survival. Importantly critical \n     habitat can include both private and/or federal land and \n     water. Critical habitat is\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n     to be based upon the ``best scientific and commercial data \n     available'' and is to include the ``primary constituent \n     elements'' (PCEs) for the species. PCEs are the elements the \n     species needs for breeding, feeding and sheltering. Final \n     critical habitat designations are to be published with legal \n     descriptions so private landowners would know whether their \n     private property or water was within or outside designated \n     boundaries. Critical habitat designations are also made with \n     consideration of the economic impacts. Under the ESA, \n     although the FWS cannot consider the economic impacts of \n     listing a species, all other economic impacts are to be \n     considered when designating critical habitat, and if the \n     economic impacts in an area are too great, the area could be \n     excluded as critical habitat as long as the exclusion did not \n     cause extinction of the species.\n       With regard to the critical habitat designation itself, \n     critical habitat determinations are made in two stages. \n     First, the FWS considers the currently occupied habitat and \n     determines if that habitat (1) contains the PCEs for the \n     species and (2) is sufficient for protection of the species. \n     Second, the FWS looks at the unoccupied habitat for the \n     species and makes the same determinations, i.e., (1) whether \n     areas of unoccupied habitat contain the necessary PCEs and \n     (2) if including this additional land or water as critical \n     habitat was necessary for protection of the species. The FWS \n     then considers whether the economic costs of including some \n     of the areas are so high that the areas should be excluded \n     from the critical habitat designation. In simplest terms, FWS \n     would weigh or balance the benefits of designation of certain \n     areas of critical habitat against the regulatory burdens and \n     economic costs of designation and could exclude discreet \n     areas from a critical habitat designation so long as \n     exclusion did not cause species extinction. This was called \n     the ``exclusion analysis.''\n       Starting with a new 2012 rule and extending to the 2015 \n     rules and policy, those considerations have all changed, and \n     in fact, FWS has admitted that the new rules will result in \n     more land and water being included in critical habitat \n     designations.\n       The first major change is the inclusion of ``the principals \n     of conservation biology'' as part of the ``best scientific \n     and commercial data available.'' Conservation biology was not \n     created until the 1980s and has been described by some \n     scientists as ``agenda-driven'' or ``goal-oriented'' biology.\n       Second, the new Obama policy has changed regarding a \n     listing species ``throughout a significant portion of its \n     range.'' Now, rather than listing species within the range \n     where the problem lies, all species throughout the entire \n     range will be listed as threatened or endangered.\n       Third, based upon the principals of conservation biology, \n     including indirect or circumstantial information, critical \n     habitat designations will be greatly expanded. Under the new \n     regulations, FWS will initially consider designation of both \n     occupied and unoccupied habitat, including habitat with \n     potential PCEs. In other words, not only is FWS considering \n     habitat that is or may be used by the species, FWS will \n     consider habitat that may develop PCBs sometime in the \n     future. There is no time limit on when such future \n     development of PCEs will occur, or what types of events have \n     to occur so that the habitat will develop PCEs. FWS will then \n     look outside occupied and unoccupied habitat to decide if the \n     habitat will develop PCEs in the future and should be \n     designated as critical habitat now. FWS has determined that \n     critical habitat can include temporary or periodic habitat, \n     ephemeral habitat, potential habitat and migratory habitat, \n     even if that habitat is currently unusable by the species.\n       Fourth, FWS has also determined that it will no longer \n     publish the text or legal descriptions or GIS coordinates for \n     critical habitat. Rather it will only publish maps of the \n     critical habitat designation. Given the small size of the \n     Federal Register, I do not think this will adequately notify \n     landowners whether their private property is included or \n     excluded from a critical habitat designation.\n       Fifth, FWS has significantly limited what economic impacts \n     are considered as part of the critical habitat designation. \n     According to a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, \n     although the economic impacts are not to be considered as \n     part of the listing process, once a species was listed, if \n     FWS could not determine whether the economic impact came from \n     listing or critical habitat, the cost should be included in \n     the economic analysis. In other words, only those costs that \n     were solely based on listing were excluded from the economic \n     analysis. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit Court took the \n     opposite view and determined that only economic costs that \n     were solely attributable to critical habitat designations \n     were to be included. Rather than requesting the U.S. Supreme \n     Court make a consistent ruling among the courts, FWS simply \n     recognized this circuit split for almost 15 years. However, \n     on Aug. 28, 2013, FWS issued a final rule that determined \n     that the Ninth Circuit Court was ``correct'' and regulatorily \n     determined that only economic costs attributable solely to \n     the critical habitat designation would be analyzed. This rule \n     substantially reduces the determination of the cost of \n     critical habitat designation because FWS can claim that \n     almost all costs are based on the listing of the species \n     because if not for the listing, there would be no need for \n     critical habitat.\n       Sixth, FWS has determined that while completing the \n     economic analysis is mandatory, the consideration of whether \n     habitat should be excluded based on economic considerations \n     is discretionary. In other words, under the new policy, FWS \n     is no longer required to consider whether areas should be \n     excluded from critical habitat designation based upon \n     economic costs and burdens.\n       The problem with these new rules is what it means if \n     private property or federal lands are designated as critical \n     habitat or the designated habitat only has the potential to \n     develop PCEs. Even if the species is not present in the \n     designated critical habitat, a ``take'' of a species can \n     occur through ``adverse modification of critical habitat.'' \n     For private land, that may include stopping stream diversions \n     because the water is needed in downstream critical habitat \n     for a fish species or that haying practices, such as cutting \n     of invasive species to protect hay fields, are stopped \n     because it will prevent the area from developing PCEs in the \n     future that may support a species. It could include stopping \n     someone from putting on fertilizer or doing other crop \n     management on a farm field because of a concern with runoff \n     into downstream designated habitat. Designation of an area as \n     critical habitat--even if that area does not contain PCEs \n     now--will absolutely require more federal permitting, i.e. \n     Section 7 consultation, for things like crop plans or \n     conservation plans or anything else requiring a federal \n     permit. In fact, one of the new regulations issued by Obama \n     concludes that ``adverse modification of critical habitat'' \n     can include ``alteration of the quantity or quality'' of \n     habitat that precludes or ``significantly delays'' the \n     capacity of the habitat to develop PCEs over time.\n       While the agriculture community raised a huge alarm over \n     the waters of the U.S., FWS was quietly implementing these \n     new rules, in a piecemeal manner, without a lot of fanfare. \n     Honestly, I think these new habitat rules will have as great \n     or greater impact on the private lands and federal land \n     permits as does the Ditch Rule, and I would hope that the \n     outcry from the agriculture community, private property \n     advocates, and our Congressional delegations would be as \n     great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2970-2"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER WAITES\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n65th anniversary of Bueno Foods, a New Mexico family-owned business and \none of the Southwest's premier producers of New Mexican foods, \nincluding our State's iconic chile from Hatch, NM, and the surrounding \nRio Grande Valley.\n  In 1946, when several brothers from the Baca family returned home \nfrom serving in World War II, they scraped together enough money to \nstart a small grocery business. Although the business started off \nsuccessfully, the Bacas soon learned how difficult it was for a small \ncommunity market to compete with larger grocery store chains, so they \ndecided to specialize, manufacturing corn and flour tortillas and \ntraditional holiday favorites like tamales and posole. The Baca \nbrothers also noticed that more households owned freezers, and they \nasked themselves around the family dinner table: Why don't we take our \nheritage and preserve it?\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\n  With this idea, Bueno Foods was born in 1951. Today Bueno Foods \nmanufactures a full line of more than 150 authentic New Mexican and \nMexican food products and currently employs more than 250 employees.\n  I commend Buenos Foods for taking an active role in the community and \ncontributing to organizations that serve some of our most vulnerable \nNew Mexicans, including impoverished children, the homeless, and the \nhungry.\n  Bueno Foods is a strong partner with New Mexico's renowned chile \npepper farmers. The chile industry in New Mexico, including both \ngrowers and processors, is an integral part of our agricultural and \ncultural heritage and New Mexico-grown chile peppers remain the most \nsought after. New Mexico is a leading producer of American-grown chile \npeppers, and I am pleased that our State's chile farmers and Bueno \nFoods have come together to protect authentic New Mexico-grown chile.\n  I congratulate Bueno Foods on 65 years of success as they work to \nkeep our State's chile industry strong and produce the quality foods \nthat can only be from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2971-2"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              300TH ANNIVERSARY OF STRATHAM, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the town of Stratham in New \nHampshire is celebrating its 300th anniversary this year. Today \nStratham is a classic New England community, proud of its family-\nfriendly quality of life and looking forward to its annual town fair in \nJune. The culmination of this year's fair will be the 300th anniversary \ndinner dance at Stratham Hill Park on June 25, celebrating the \nestablishment of the township of Stratham in 1716.\n  Of course, the human history of what is now Stratham, located between \nthe Great Bay and Exeter in southeastern New Hampshire, goes back many \ncenturies prior to the arrival of the first English explorers and \nsettlers. The land was originally inhabited by the Pennacook Tribe, \nAlgonquian-speaking Native Americans, who were among the first to \nencounter European colonists in what is today New England.\n  In 1640, an Englishman named Thomas Wiggin established the first \nsettlement in what was then called Squamscott Patent, and through the \nremainder of the 1600s, people continued to arrive in the settlement. \nBy the early 1700s, residents petitioned George Vaughn, Lieutenant \nGovernor of the Province of New Hampshire, to incorporate a new town. \nOn March 20, 1716, he granted their request and ordered that \n``Squamscott Patent land be a township by the name of Stratham, and \nthat there be a meeting house built for public worship of God with all \nconvenient speed.'' The town was given authority under King George I to \nelect selectmen, hold town meetings, collect taxes, build a meeting \nhouse and hire a ``learned and orthodox minister.'' At the initial \ngathering of town leaders, they appointed a committee of five to take \ncare of building a meeting house, which would be used both for church \nservices and meetings of the selectmen. Stratham Community Church now \nstands on the site of that original meeting house.\n  As a resident of the Seacoast, I regularly visit Stratham. It is \nhometown and headquarters to corporate giants Lindt chocolate and \nTimberland footwear, whose products include the Stratham Heights line \nof women's high-fashion boots. The town also takes pride in its smaller \nstores, cafes, and restaurants, places where people know your name and \nwhere the small businessowners are right there every day. But \nStratham's greatest assets are its citizens, who are unfailingly \ngracious and friendly.\n  Of course, the big event in Stratham is its annual town fair, one of \nthe oldest in the Granite State. The fair got its start in 1966, when \nStratham held a giant party to celebrate its 250th anniversary. A half \ncentury later, that party has evolved into a sprawling fair that draws \nvisitors from across southeastern New Hampshire, nearly tripling \nStratham's usual population of 7,250. This year, as I said, the fair's \ngala dinner dance at Stratham Hill Park will be the culmination of the \ntown's 300th anniversary celebrations.\n  Stratham's motto is ``inspired by the past, committed to the \nfuture.'' The town does indeed have a long and rich history, and it has \nentered the 21st century as a forward-thinking community with a vibrant \neconomy. Even as Stratham grows, it has preserved its small town charm, \nhospitality, and lifestyle.\n  I congratulate all the folks in Stratham on this landmark 300th \nanniversary. I wish everyone a wonderful celebration in June.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2972-1"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2972-2"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2972-3"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, WITH \n              RESPECT TO THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ--PM 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

 By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 2944. A bill to require adequate reporting on the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefit program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill I am \nintroducing along with Senator Grassley called the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits Improvement Act.\n  When our first responders make the decision to join a police \ndepartment or a fire department or an EMT squad, they do so knowing \nthey might encounter hazards on the job that threaten their lives or \neven end their lives. These men and women work in some of the highest \npressure and most dangerous environments--shootouts, fires, natural \ndisasters, terror attacks.\n  Think about your own communities back home. When disaster strikes, \nwhen there is an emergency, who shows up first, speeding to the scene \nand ready to help? It is our police officers, it is our firefighters, \nand it is our EMT workers. Our public safety officers know that death \nor serious injury is a real risk in their jobs, but they show up to \nwork anyway, ready to help and willing to sacrifice, if that is what it \ntakes to keep their communities safe.\n  When first responders die as a result of their work, we all have the \nresponsibility to help take care of their surviving family members. In \n1984, more than three decades ago, Congress did the right thing and \ncreated a program called the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to \nhelp these families.\n  Whenever a tragedy struck and a first responder was killed on the job \nor passed away because of their job, these grieving families could take \na little bit of comfort in knowing they would have the financial \nsupport they needed with this program. They knew they would have help \nfrom this program, transitioning to a life without their loved one.\n  In recent years, the families applying to the program have faced \nconfusing and inconsistent requirements. They have faced long delays in \nreceiving compensation. Before, when a loved one died on the job, the \nfamily would get compensation from this program without any serious \ndelay. But now the burden to claim these funds and then retrieve them \nhas been placed on the families--the same families this program is \nsupposed to be helping.\n  As a result, hundreds of families who are already grieving now have \nto dig through public records themselves. They have to endure an \nexhausting paper chase with no guidance. And they have to go far beyond \na reasonable doubt to prove to the Justice Department that their loved \none did, in fact, serve as a first responder and sacrificed his or her \nlife for this job.\n  Last fall, USA Today reported that of the more than 900 cases they \nreviewed, the average wait for a decision by the program about \ncompensation was more than 1 year. For some families, it was 2 years, \nand for some, the wait was 3 years. This even includes our first \nresponders who worked at Ground Zero. Think about the unnecessary \nstress these delays have placed on our families who lost loved ones.\n  We know we must fix this program. We must fix this program. These \nfamilies of our fallen public safety officers are not getting the \ncompensation they deserve, that their loved ones have earned, in the \ntimely manner they need.\n  This bill--Senator Grassley's and mine--is a bipartisan bill that \nfixes this problem. The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement \nAct would make this compensation program more transparent and more \nefficient, and it would make sure it works.\n  The bill would require the program to report publicly the status of \nevery claim so that families can know if and why their compensation is \nbeing delayed. It would give weight to the findings and records of \nFederal agencies, State agencies, and local agencies about the cause of \nthe public safety officer's death so that families don't have to \nreproduce records that already exist. And this bill would reduce the \nwait for our families to receive the compensation they deserve and \ndesperately need.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Grassley for his strong leadership and \nhis amazing advocacy, and I urge all my colleagues here to support this \nbill. Let's fix the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program. Let's \ntake care of these families--the families of our public safety \nofficers--and let's do the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nworking together on this very important issue to get justice for some \nof our police officers and their families who have been burdened by too \nmuch redtape. She and I have worked together on so many things, and I \nappreciate this one as well.\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation designating \nthis week as National Police Week. As part of that tradition, tens of \nthousands of law enforcement officers have gathered in our Nation's \nCapital to honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to the \nservice of this Nation.\n  I rise to join these officers in thanking the men and women who have \ndedicated their lives to protecting our communities. We must never take \ntheir sacrifice for granted, and we need to appreciate that their \nsurviving families have suffered real loss.\n  In recognition of this truth, Congress passed the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits Act in 1976. The goal of the law was to provide \ndeath benefits to survivors of officers who die in the line of duty. \nOver the years, the law has been amended to provide disability and \neducation benefits and to expand the pool of officers who are eligible \nfor these benefits.\n  Looking at the 40-year history of this law, the overall intent of \nCongress is very clear: Families of fallen officers deserve a fair and \ntimely consideration of their application for these benefits, and the \nword ``timely'' is what isn't being carried out right now.\n  If we were in these officers' shoes, we would like to see an answer--\neither yes or no--not years of limbo and lingering uncertainty. \nUnfortunately, that is precisely what too many families have had to \nendure since at least 2003, all because bureaucrats in the Justice \nDepartment failed to do their job and do it on time.\n  Three weeks ago, I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing to examine \nthis problem on the lack of timeliness. What we found was troubling. \nThe Justice Department has a goal of processing these claims within 1 \nyear of filing. However, according to the most recent data, the Justice \nDepartment is failing to meet its own 1-year deadline in 61 percent of \nthe 693 pending death benefit claims. Those are 423 families who have \nbeen waiting for more than 1 year. That rate is unacceptable for a \nprogram designed to support families of fallen officers.\n  Somehow, the delays have gone from bad to worse. The failure rate was \n27 percent for claims that were filed between 2008 and 2013. So it is \nvery difficult to understand how that could happen.\n  For 13 years and counting, since 2003, the delays have persisted \ndespite a 2004\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nAttorney General memorandum, despite a 2007 Judiciary Committee \nhearing, and despite three independent audits recommending corrective \naction. Not surprisingly, there have been periodic improvements in \ntimeliness whenever Congress or watchdogs shine light into these \ndelays. However, these improvements have been very short-lived. For \nexample, in 2007, the Justice Department more than doubled its monthly \nrate of processing claims in the first 2 months following a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. However, in the ensuing 5 years, the inspector \ngeneral found not only significant delays but also a serious lack of \ndocumentation and data.\n  I began looking into this program last January after constituents \ninformed me that families in Iowa waited more than 3 years to get a \ndecision, but the Justice Department's response to my oversight letters \nconfirmed that these delays persist on a nationwide scale. For \ninstance, there are currently 175 pending death and disability claims \nthat were filed on behalf of officers who lost their lives as a result \nof their September 11 response efforts. That is why I have written six \nletters to the Justice Department in the last 1\\1/2\\ years asking for \nstatus updates on all pending claims. Initially, after I sent my first \nletters, the number of pending claims went down at a steady pace. \nHowever, more recently the Justice Department has simply failed to \nrespond to my letters.\n  At last month's Judiciary Committee hearing, a claimant from my State \nof Iowa testified about having waited 3\\1/2\\ years without an answer \nfrom the Justice Department, but just 2 days after that hearing, that \nclaimant got a phone call from the Department saying the claim had been \napproved. What was the Justice Department doing for the past 3\\1/2\\ \nyears on that claim? And what about the 692 other families who are \nwaiting for a decision? Families of fallen officers and advocacy groups \nagree, transparency leads to accountability, and the Justice Department \nshould be held accountable for its handling of these claims. So based \non this 13-year record, I have concluded that the best way to ensure \ntimeliness in these claims is to permanently increase the level of \ntransparency surrounding this program.\n  Today the Senator from New York, just speaking, and I are introducing \na bill that would do just that. It is called the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits Improvement Act. This bill would require the Justice \nDepartment to post on its Web site weekly status updates for all \npending claims. This way the public can evaluate how well the \nDepartment is performing under its goal of processing claims within the \n1-year filing deadline they have. The Justice Department is already \nposting weekly statistics with respect to the September 11th Victims \nCompensation Fund, which is a similar program. So the Department should \nbe able to do the same with respect to pending public safety officers' \nbenefits claims by posting weekly statistics.\n  In addition, our bill would require the Justice Department to report \nto Congress other aggregate statistics regarding these claims at least \ntwice a year, and the bill would make it easier for the Justice \nDepartment to process these claims in other ways; for example, by \nallowing the Department to rely on other Federal regulatory standards \nand to give substantial weight to findings of fact of State, local, and \nother Federal agencies.\n  In short, this is a simple bipartisan bill with narrowly tailored \nprovisions. Each provision is targeted to specific problems that have \nbeen identified over the past 13 years by independent audits, by \ncommittee hearings, by advocacy groups, and, of course, as we would \nexpect, by families of fallen officers who wonder what is going on at \nthe Department of Justice.\n  So I thank Senator Gillibrand for working with me to develop this \ncommonsense legislation. I urge my colleagues to stand with us in \nsupport of these officers and their families and help us get this bill \ndone as our way of saying thank you to these men and women, \nparticularly as we honor them in this particular season we call \nNational Police Week.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2946. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to include \ncertain Federal positions within the definition of law enforcement \nofficer for retirement purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to introduce the Law \nEnforcement Officers' Equity Act, a common sense bill that would fix a \nloophole in Federal law that denies many Federal law enforcement \nofficers Federal benefits. This week, as our Nation pauses to honor the \nsacrifices and services of our men and women in law enforcement, I am \nglad to introduce legislation to accord them with the benefits they so \ndeeply deserve.\n  This legislation has been introduced in past Congresses by my friend \nand colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski. I am grateful to her for \nallowing me to introduce this bill, and I am glad to have her support \nas an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Law enforcement officers have one of the toughest jobs in America. \nTwenty-four hours a day and 365 days a year, they work to keep our \ncommunities safe and uphold the rule of law. During my tenure as mayor \nof Newark, I spent countless hours with police officers patrolling the \nstreets, and I saw firsthand how difficult and dangerous their jobs can \nbe. These brave men and women apprehend violent criminals and arrest \ndrug kingpins, which carries with it immense pressure and stress.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would fix a loophole in our \nFederal law. Due to the level of training required and greater danger \npresent in their profession, Congress determined years ago that \nindividuals in Federal law enforcement should receive higher salaries \nand enhanced retirement benefits compared to other Federal employees. \nUnfortunately, approximately 30,000 Federal law enforcement officers \nare classified in a way that precludes them for receiving the enhanced \nretirement benefits they deserve.\n  As a result of this loophole, certain officers who work for Federal \nagencies--such as the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans \nAffairs, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Mint, National Institute of Health, \nand many more--receive lower pensions as compared to other law \nenforcement officers with similar duties and responsibilities. This \nproblem must be fixed. Correcting this error is not only dictated by \nfairness, but it is a matter of public safety because of the value of \nrecruiting and retaining experienced and highly trained law enforcement \nofficers is immeasurable.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would expand the definition \nof ``law enforcement office'' for retirement purposes to include all \nFederal law enforcement officers. The change would grant law \nenforcement officer status to the follow individuals: employees who are \nauthorized to carry a firearm and whose duties include the \ninvestigation and/or apprehension of suspected criminals; employees of \nthe Internal Revenue Service whose duties are primarily the collection \nof delinquent taxes and securing delinquent returns; employees of the \nU.S Postal Inspection Service; and employees of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs who are Department police offices. These officers face \nthe same risks and challenges as the men and women currenly classified \nproperly under Federal law as law enforcement officers, and they \ndeserve the same benefits.\n  The Law Enforcement Officers' Equity Act would allow incumbent law \nenforcement officers' Federal service after the enactment of the act to \nbe considered service performed as a law enforcement officer for \nretirement purposes.\n  This legislation has the support of numerous law enforcement groups, \nincluding the Fraternal Order of Police, Postal Police Officers \nAssociation, National Association of Police Officers, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers' Association, and the National Treasury Employees \nUnion.\n  According to the Postal Police Officers Association, ``These officers \nface the same risks and challenges as their federal law enforcement \ncolleagues who currently receive [law enforcement officer] retirement \nstatus. This bill will ensure that officers across the country, who put \ntheir lives on the line each and every day to protect us, earn the \nbenefits that they deserve.''\n  And the National Association of Police Organizations has said, ``This \nbill\n\n[[Page S2978]]\n\nwill ensure that officers across the country, who put their lives on \nthe line each and every day to protect us, earn the benefits that they \ndeserve.''\n  Fundamental fairness demands that we close this loophole in Federal \nlaw and give all Federal law enforcement officers the retirement \nbenefits they deserve. I ask my colleagues to support the Law \nEnforcement Officers' Equity Act, and I urge its speedy passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/senate-section/article/S2976-1"}, {"day": "18", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 469--COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1916 \n     EASTER RISING, A SEMINAL MOMENT IN THE JOURNEY OF IRELAND TO \n                              INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Markey) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.
