Mr. President, the last time a broad energy bill was \nsigned into law was back in 2007. It may as well have been a lifetime \nago as far as America's energy situation is concerned. While we were \nonce living in an era of energy scarcity, we are now living in an era \nof higher energy production and lower technology costs. It is change \nthat represents many opportunities but also challenges--aging \ninfrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles, outdated policies, and needless \nredtape. These are the kinds of challenges we will need to address if \nwe want to support America's rise as one of the world's preeminent \nenergy superpowers and if we want to support the accompanying potential \nfor jobs, for growth, and for increased energy independence. That is \nwhy the Senate is considering the Energy Policy Modernization Act. It \nis broad, bipartisan legislation that will modernize our energy \npolicies to keep pace with a changing world. It will help Americans \nproduce more energy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. It \nwill help Americans save energy.\n  This bipartisan bill builds on technological progress in order to \nstrengthen and sustain America's energy advances while protecting our \nenvironment at the same time, all without raising taxes or adding to \nthe deficit. It is the latest reminder of what is possible with \ncooperation in this Senate.\n  A huge majority of the Senate energy committee supported the bill \nwhen it came to a vote. The top Republican on the committee supported \nit and the top Democrat on the committee supported it. They are the \nmanagers of this bill today. They have worked with Members of both \nparties and have lined up amendments already. They are working with \nMembers of both parties to schedule even more. If you have an amendment \nyou would like considered, please work with them. Let's get this \nprocess moving. Let's get this bill passed so we can support more jobs, \nmore growth, and more energy independence for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S297-7", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S297-S298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE BRUMAS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before I leave the floor, let me say \nthis as well. The chair of the energy committee knows how to write good \nlegislation. We have proof of that before us today. But here is \nsomething else: The chair of the energy committee also knows how to \npick good staff. Take Mike Brumas as one example. He served as her \ncommunications director. He served as communications director for the \njunior Senator from Alabama, too, and as chief of staff for the State's \nsenior Senator. Mike also spent time covering Washington back when he \nwas a reporter.\n  Mike Brumas obviously had a lot of experience under his belt by the \ntime he came to work for me. Mike was an important part of my team, he \nworked hard, and he earned positions of trust among respected Members \nof our conference and among the Washington press corps. Mike was there \nboth in the minority and in the majority as we made our way through \nmany challenges, but he never let his good humor or his zest for life \nget lost along the way.\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\n  People will tell you that Mike loves history and political history in \nparticular. It is a shared passion that kept me challenged and often \nentertained. People will tell you a few other things about Mike too. He \nis always smiling. He is always laughing. He always has a story to tell \nand a recipe to share. This aspiring chef and endeavoring fly fisherman \nis happiest when he is with his family--his delightful wife Ann and his \nsons Alex and Will--and Mike is at his best when he is outdoors camping \nor biking or just simply enjoying life beyond these walls.\n  When Mike told me it was his time to retire from the Senate, I was \nsad to see him go, but at the same time I was glad to see him able to \nspend more time around the people and things that make Mike, Mike.\n  Ronald Michael Brumas came to my office as a colleague and leaves as \na friend. I thank him for his many years of dedicated service to me and \nto this body, and I send him best wishes for a retirement that promises \nto be anything but boring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S298-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have joined with the Republican leader \nover the last couple of days saying good things about the bill that is \non the floor. But today my friend the Republican leader stated that \nnothing has happened with energy in this country since 2007. That \nsimply is not right. It is not true. We have done a lot of stuff in the \nSenate under President Obama to do good things about energy.\n  For example, the first major bill under President Obama was the so-\ncalled American Recovery Act, the stimulus bill. In that bill there was \na lot of stuff to change the energy delivery system in this country to \nallow the creation of new power lines which were so badly needed all \nover America.\n  For those of us who represent Nevada, we have a power line that now \ngoes from northern Nevada to southern Nevada, and it would never have \nhappened but for that legislation we passed. And there was an \nannouncement made 2 weeks ago that that line is now going to be taken \neven farther to make it easier to transport power to California--\nrenewable energy power. I spoke to the owner of that line, who owns \nhalf of it with NV Energy, and soon they will be taking it clear to the \nNorthwest.\n  Of course, in the stimulus bill, it was the first time there has been \nmajor legislation allowed for tax credits, tax incentives for doing \nrenewable energy. And the bill we just passed, the omnibus bill, the \ntax extenders--there is tremendous stuff in that bill for renewable \nenergy and other electricity initiatives.\n  So I like this bill that is on the floor. It is a good bill. But it \nsimply is not valid to say that nothing has happened since 2007 because \nthat is a gross understatement.\n  I really hope we can pass the bill that is on the floor. The vast \nmajority of this bill contains the Shaheen-Portman legislation that we \ntried valiantly to get done in the past. It was blocked by Republican \nfilibusters. Sadly, the cosponsor of the bill twice voted against his \nown bill. The Senator from Ohio voted against his own legislation. I \nhope that doesn't happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S298-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S298-S299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the President of the United States deserves \nthe right to choose a team to carry out the work that is being done \nhere, and the leader of that work to be done here is the President. It \nwas the same way with President Bush, President Reagan, and President \nClinton. They deserved a team--a team they chose--to help effectuate \npolicies they saw as necessary for this country. The President of the \nUnited States deserves the right to choose a team to carry out his \nvision here at home and around the world--his vision. I am not alone in \nthat belief. My friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nsaid: ``The President, in my view, has a clear right to put into place \nthe team he believes will serve him best.''\n  Sadly, since President Obama was elected, Republicans have stopped at \nnothing to undermine the President's team--seeking to prevent progress \nby denying him the personnel he wants to carry out his agenda. Despite \nrecord obstruction, President Obama has achieved remarkable progress. I \ntalked about some of that just a minute ago. Imagine what President \nObama could have accomplished if Republicans took their constitutional \nduties seriously.\n  Regrettably, during the Obama Presidency, Republicans have done \neverything within their power to block, obstruct, stonewall, hinder \nqualified public servants from serving. In the first year of Republican \ncontrol, the Senate confirmed the fewest nominations of any first \nsession in memory. This blatant strategy of obstruction is shameful and \ndangerous to our economy and the national security of our country.\n  Headlines around the world remind us each day of the turmoil that \nexists in the global financial market and terrorism that threatens the \nworld. Today we learned of multiple bombings yesterday and last night \nin Nigeria--lots of people killed. We can only wait and see where else \nthat turmoil will arise.\n  Most Americans agree that we need a full complement of appointees to \naddress the challenges we face. Republicans are preventing our \ngovernment from doing its job at home and around the world.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Senate banking \ncommittee has reported out at least one nomination every year for the \npast 50 years, but not last year--last year, not a single nominee. \nCurrently, nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and \nExchange Commission, and other important financial assignments are \nstalled in the banking committee. The committee has been operating \nunder Republican leadership for the past 13 months, and they have yet \nto report a single nomination out of that committee. That is the \ndefinition of historic obstruction.\n  If there is any nominee who deserves to be confirmed immediately, it \nis a man by the name of Adam Szubin, whom the President nominated to \ncombat terrorism financing--think about that--terrorism financing. He \nis desperately needed at the Treasury Department. Jack Lew has called \nme on many occasions talking about how this man needs to fill this \nassignment. He has expressed to me the importance of his job in trying \nto slow ISIS and their financial network and other terrorism activities \naround the country. As Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes, Szubin would lead a team that disrupts terrorist financing \nnetworks, cutting off money for terrorists so they can't finance their \nevil deeds. He has served as a career civil servant under both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents.\n  Despite the importance of his work, Republicans are preventing a vote \nin the banking committee and thus preventing Adam Szubin from having a \nvote here on the Senate floor. He is currently acting--he is certainly \nacting in a role that is not permanent, which is why they call him an \nacting member of the Treasury Department. He lacks the stature that his \ncounterparts have around the world. So he is not able to do all that \nshould be done to disrupt terrorist financial networks throughout the \nworld.\n\n  In a September hearing on his nomination, the chairman of the banking \ncommittee, the senior Senator from Alabama said: ``Mr. Szubin is \neminently qualified for this [position].''\n  Eminently qualified, not reported out of the banking committee, no \nvote here on the Senate floor--why are we holding up this critical \nnomination? We all know why. Powerful rightwing groups have announced \nthat they are scoring votes on Presidential nominations. In fact, \nHeritage Action, which is a front group for the tea party and the Koch \nbrothers, said the Senate should only confirm nominees they deem \nworthwhile--they deem, not Senators but this rightwing cabal. This \ncomes at the expense of the American people and our national security.\n  If the Republican leadership follows this weird plan, scores of \nAmbassadors charged with representing our interests around the world \ncould be prevented from service. They have been prevented from service.\n  We have several credible nominees currently awaiting floor votes. Ms.\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nAzita Raji, who has been nominated to represent America in Sweden, is \nan accomplished businesswoman who has lived and worked in Europe, Latin \nAmerica, and Asia. There has been more than 300 Swedish citizens who \nhave left Sweden to fight with ISIS in either Syria or Iraq, making \nthis nation the second largest country of origin per capita for foreign \nfighters coming from Europe to the Middle East. We need to get this \ndone. It is not right for America to not be able to deal, on a daily \nbasis, with the authority to help Sweden with their issues. The Swedish \nGovernment is on heightened alert for an attack. Yet we don't have a \nSenate-confirmed ambassador to represent us in Stockholm. She was first \nnominated to be Ambassador in October 2014. We are now in 2016. We \ndon't have an ambassador to Sweden.\n  We don't have an ambassador to Norway, and it has been that way for \nmore than 2 years. President Obama nominated a person by the name of \nSamuel Heins, an accomplished lawyer and humanitarian from Minnesota. \nHis nomination is not controversial. It is only controversial, I guess, \nto the Koch brothers, the tea party, and Heritage Action. He should be \nconfirmed without delay, but it has been 2 years.\n  Other State Department nominations have been blocked for partisan \nreasons by the junior Senator from Texas. Tom Shannon has been \nnominated to be Under Secretary of State. We don't have an ambassador \nto Mexico. Tom Shannon has been nominated to the fourth highest ranking \nposition in the State Department. He would like to be serving. He would \nserve as the day-to-day manager of overall regional and bilateral \npolicy issues and oversee State Department bureaus around the world. He \nis a career Foreign Service officer, having served under Presidents of \nboth parties. If he is confirmed, he would be the highest ranking \ncareer diplomat in the State Department.\n  John Kerry called me saying: How can I continue this job I have? I \ndon't have people to do the work. He doesn't even have a lawyer. The \nState Department doesn't have a lawyer. We have tried to confirm Brian \nEgan starting back in September 2014, but he has been held up for \nmonths and months.\n  Do you know what this is about? Clinton's emails--Secretary Clinton's \nemails. If the senior Senator from Iowa is interested in getting \nanswers to his countless letters to the State Department, wouldn't a \nSenate-confirmed legal advisor be of some help?\n  Eric Fanning, the President's nominee to be the next Secretary of the \nArmy, is being blocked by the senior Senator from Kansas, even though \nthe senior Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, said: ``I think \n[Fanning's] a pretty good nominee.'' In spite of that, there is no vote \non his nomination. The Army needs Mr. Fanning's leadership and \nresponsibility for over a $200 billion budget for more than 1 million \nservicemembers. Right now they are making due at the Pentagon, but we \nshould have a Secretary of the Army.\n  Unless Republicans change course, these important vacancies will go \nunfilled for the rest of the Obama administration, and our diplomacy \nand relationships around the world will continue to suffer because of \nwhat is going on here. I do not understand what my Republican \ncolleagues are doing. If Republicans had their way, they would stop \nconfirming officials at just about every key agency.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Senate has \nconfirmed an average of 351 nominations during the first session of the \nCongress. Last year the Senate didn't even get to half of what it \nnormally does. The Republicans should get to work and schedule votes on \nthe President's nominees.\n  Valid concerns about the qualifications of these nominees should be \nbrought forth. We haven't heard any, but denying a vote for partisan \ngain does nothing to strengthen America at home or around the world. \nThe American people deserve better.\n  This Senator says America is less safe because of what is going on \nwith the Republicans in the Senate. We are not as secure as we should \nbe. We have vacancies for Ambassadors all over the world that are not \nbeing filled. People within the State Department, the Treasury \nDepartment whose job is to deal with terrorism are being blocked. For \nthe first time in 50 years we don't have anyone reported out of the \nbanking committee. America is less safe because of what Republicans are \ndoing to our country.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S299-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

This morning we are on \nday 2 of the Energy Policy Modernization Act. Yesterday, we took up \nthis broad, bipartisan energy bill, the first of its kind in more than \n8 years. Taking this up was a good moment for the Senate. It was an \nimportant step. It is the beginning of a series of steps that we will \ntake to modernizing our Nation's energy as well as our mineral \npolicies. I am hopeful we are going to have a good day of debate today.\n  As we begin this morning, I would like to summarize very briefly \nwhere we are in this process and what Members might expect over the \ncourse of the day. As of this morning, we have a total of 89 amendments \nthat have now been filed to the underlying bill. We are already \nstarting to process those amendments. We recognize that some will go by \nvoice vote, some will of course need rollcall votes, and others simply \nwill not be voted at all.\n  Right now we do have six amendments pending before the body. We have \namendment No. 2963 that I have offered, which improves a provision in \nthe underlying bill related to reliability impact statements. We have \namendment No. 2968 from Senator Shaheen to clarify a definition for the \nterm ``smart manufacturing'' that is contained within the underlying \nbill. We have an amendment from Senator Markey, amendment No. 2982, to \nrequire the Government Accountability Office to study the economic \naspects of crude oil exports annually for 3 years. We have an amendment \nfrom Senator Barrasso, amendment No. 3017, to establish a prize for \ntechnologies that can separate carbon dioxide molecules from dilute \nsources such as ambient air.\n  At noon we are scheduled to proceed to a rollcall vote on amendment \nNo. 3021 to promote research into nuclear energy. There is a strong \nlist of Members who are supporting this amendment: Senators Crapo and \nRisch from Idaho, along with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, \nSenator Booker of\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nNew Jersey, Senator Hatch of Utah, and Senators Kirk and Durbin from \nIllinois. There is a good bipartisan mix of Senators from around the \ncountry coming together to promote nuclear research with this \namendment.\n  At 1:45 p.m. we will proceed to amendment No. 2965. This has been \noffered by Senator Schatz, and it will increase the authorized funding \nlevels for ARPA-E in the underlying Energy bill.\n  Senator Cantwell and I are both working with our staffs to reach \nagreement on any additional amendments that can be brought up for votes \ntoday. We will try to keep Members apprised as to what they can expect. \nI think both of us are hopeful that we will see more votes added to the \nlist I have just described. We may have one as early as 11:30 this \nmorning. That has not been worked out yet, but there is an option of \ncourse for more amendments in the afternoon, if Members are willing to \nstick with us on this.\n  As I mentioned yesterday in terms of some housekeeping details, and \nit is worth repeating today, I would urge Members not to wait to file \namendments. Get your amendments in so we can be looking at them and \nassessing where they might fit, in terms of how we handle and process \nthem. I think the earlier you are able to file these amendments the \ngreater the likelihood that you will see a vote on them.\n  Again, as I mentioned yesterday, any amendments that cost money, any \namendment that is going to score, you are going to need to find a \nviable offset in order for us to consider it. Further, if it is a \nmeasure that would result in a blue slip because it involves a tax \nprovision or a tax amendment, know that is something we cannot \nconsider.\n  Before I make some comments about some individuals, I want to make a \nfew more brief remarks about the bill itself, this broad and bipartisan \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act. I mentioned yesterday that we have a \ntotal of five titles within the bill, and we did not just construct \nthem for organizational purposes. They represent some important themes \nin our policies within these areas.\n  The first title is ``Efficiency.'' When you think about the \nimportance of efficiency in the energy sector, it is a critical \ncomponent. We should all always be looking for ways to be saving \nenergy. It is just smart. It is smart from a cost perspective. It is \nsmart from being a good steward perspective. It is just smart all the \nway around. It helps our businesses and our families save money. It \nmakes our resources last longer. It is good for our environment. \nEfficiency is good overall.\n  ``Infrastructure'' is our second title. Typically, when we think \nabout infrastructure, we think about the roads and bridges, but our \nenergy infrastructure is integral to the daily operation of commerce \nthat goes on around us when we are talking about energy infrastructure. \nIt may be the big infrastructure such as the Hoover Dam. It is also the \nelectric wires, pipelines, and it is the whole infrastructure package. \nWe have a responsibility to keep our infrastructure in good shape so \nthat we can reliably and safely transport energy from the place where \nit is produced to the place where it is needed.\n  I joke sometimes, saying it is frustrating because there is not more \neducation or understanding about our energy and our energy resources \nand how they work as much as we would like. I have joked that some \nascribe to this ``immaculate conception'' theory of energy--it just \nhappens. The lights come on, the temperature is what we would like it \nto be, and we do not care how or why it came to us or the fact that we \nmight not have that energy resource right here in our neighborhood. It \nis just here, and as long as we are not inconvenienced because it is \nnot too expensive and it is reliable, we are good with it. We do not \nthink about how it gets to us and the necessity of reliable, safe \ninfrastructure to take that from the source to the customer.\n\n  The fourth title is accountability. Again, like efficiency, it just \nmakes good sense to ensure that, as we are building out our energy \npolicies, there is a level of accountability that comes with it--that \nour Federal agencies work efficiently and effectively as good stewards \nof taxpayer dollars. I think we have plenty of room for improvement \nwhen it comes to accountability right now.\n  I mentioned yesterday that in addition to a pretty robust \naccountability title, we remove some deadwood, some reports and \nrequirements that have built up over the years that get incorporated \ninto our United States Code, and then they just sit there.\n  As they sit there, it is not just that they are benign. The agencies \nstill go ahead, and they have the reports that we here in Congress have \nrequired of them. That costs money. Nobody reads them. We have taken \ncare of that within the accountability title.\n  Then the fifth title is the title that relates to conservation \naspects as it relates to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an issue \nthat I know the Presiding Officer is very interested in and would like \nmaking sure there are reforms there. We want to work to make sure that \nthe reforms are good and sound, also making sure that our national \nparks have the focus on maintenance that they need. We have a \nresponsibility to ensure that we are taking care of our parks and \npublic lands, to not let the addition of more parks come at the cost of \nnot taking care of what we already have.\n  Rather than just kind of doing the 30,000-foot level on each of these \nvarious titles, I want to highlight today a little bit about the third \ntitle of this bill, the title that deals with energy supply.\n  Over the past few years, we have seen several things. We have seen a \nlot of good things that happen when we are producing our own energy \nhere in this country and the benefits that accrue to us when our energy \nis abundant. It is not just access to energy, but it is also what \nallows us in terms of energy economic security, something that leads to \nthe creation of good jobs. As the economy grows here, our security \nincreases. Really, we become far more competitive.\n  So, again, when I talk about energy, strong energy policies, and an \nenergy security focus, keep in mind these things reinforce one another. \nYou have energy security leading to economic security, leading to \nnational security. It moves all the way around. That, again, allows us \nto be more competitive over all other nations.\n  Our bill would help keep our Nation's oil and natural gas production \ngoing strong. We have included a pilot program from Senator Hoeven for \noil and gas permitting. We would expedite the process for liquefied \nnatural gas exports, which could help us raise our domestic production \nlevels. I want to say also that we did not just focus on oil and gas in \nthis bill because we recognize drawing our energy from a variety of \nsources creates reliability and stability. We all know that Alaska is \nan oil-producing State. We focus a lot in our State on oil and being \nable to access it responsibly. We also know that when you are reliant \non one source, there is a vulnerability. So when we talk about an ``all \nof the above'' approach to energy production, we mean it. This kind of \napproach just makes sense. It makes sense because it lessens your \nvulnerability. It increases not only your energy security, but your \neconomic security and your national security as well.\n  So focusing on all aspects of our energy sources is key to what we do \nwithin this bill. We took some good steps to produce more hydropower in \nthis country by helping to reduce the regulatory barriers and extending \nthe licensing period for hydropower projects. This is important to us \nas a nation, especially when we think about resources that already \nexist through hydropower and the additional capacity that we could \npotentially gain from these already exiting hydropower resources. This \nis significant.\n  Geothermal is another area where we have an emissions-free source of \nbaseload energy. Again, so much of what we talk about with renewables \nand part of the big problem that we face is that some renewables are \nintermittent. The wind does not always blow and the sun is not always \nout, so you have to have a reliable baseload. Our reliable baseload for \na century has been coal.\n  We have a reliable baseload with nuclear. When others think about \nthose other areas where we have reliable baseloads, they also ought to \nthink about the potential of geothermal. Our bill includes a number of \nprovisions to help us expand the use and reduce the cost of this \nimportant renewable resource. We are doing some exciting\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nthings up in Alaska, as we are identifying sources to access geothermal \nenergy resources.\n  In another area, in Alaska and in some of the other coastal States, \nwhether it is Maine or down in Oregon, we are seeing some good \nprogress, some interesting progress when it comes to marine \nhydrokinetic energy, which has the potential to draw the power from the \nmovement of the oceans and river currents. I just mentioned reliable \nbaseload. You need to have something that you can rely on.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from the interior part of the country. I \ncome from a State that has almost 34,000 miles of coastline. One of the \nthings that we know in Alaska is how the tides come and go. We can \nprint up tide books because there is reliability as to when the tide is \nin and when the tide is out. So think about the potential for energy \nresources from our oceans, from our river currents. What we do within \nthe bill is help advance marine hydrokinetic energy. We are attempting \nto help move it out of its infancy and focus the DOE on some pretty \ncritical research areas.\n  We also have a great subtitle on minerals. Oftentimes we forget about \nthe strategic importance of critical minerals. Every one of us is \nwalking around nowadays with a smartphone. Every one of us, therefore, \nis reliant on some form of critical mineral. For those who want to \nadvance the energy future in the direction of renewables, well, in \norder for you to have a wind turbine, you are going to need some of \nthese critical minerals from the Earth to allow us to really build out \ntechnologies.\n  Minerals are really the foundation of our modern society. We need \nthem for everything, as I said, from our smartphones to our military \nassets. Yet, despite this importance, we have really failed as \npolicymakers to focus on mineral security. We have not been thinking \nabout it enough. We have been talking a lot about this: Oh, we do not \nwant to be reliant on oil. We do not want to be reliant on OPEC, and we \nwork to address that. In the meantime, we have taken our eye off the \nball when it comes to mineral security. We now import 100 percent of 19 \nseparate mineral commodities and more than 50 percent of some 24 \nadditional commodities. This is happening despite the growing \nimportance of those minerals in our everyday lives and despite what we \nhave here in this country, which is a world-class mineral base. When we \ntalk about energy security and making sure that we are able to produce \nmore here to reduce our vulnerability, energy security also needs to \ninclude that mineral security.\n  We also have provisions to promote our domestic supply of helium. A \nlot of people do not think about helium in the energy space. We promote \nnuclear power, particularly our advanced nuclear power, to help foster \na strong energy workforce. So when we talk about the direction that \nthis energy bill goes, I mentioned yesterday that innovation is the key \nto so much of what we are trying to push out as we modernize our energy \npolicies.\n  As important as innovation is, supply is a case where more really is \nbetter. As a result of this good title that we have contained in the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act, I think our energy and our mineral \nsupplies will increase in the years ahead to the benefit of America.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Mike Brumas\n\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from Hawaii is here on the floor, \nbut I want to take just a few minutes to acknowledge something the \nleader mentioned regarding an individual in his office, someone that \nhas served him well, Mike Brumas. Mike has been working for Leader \nMcConnell now for a number of years and has done a great job in the \ncommunications department.\n  I too am very privileged to have had him leading my communications \ndepartment between 2008 and 2010. Mike is one of those men whom you can \ncall a southern gentleman. He has a little bit of a twang that did not \nquite fit with the Alaska reporters, but it did not matter because he \nwas so knowledgeable on all issues--all issues that we dealt with, \nincluding some of the most parochial and local of Alaskan issues.\n  Mike Brumas embraced his job with an enthusiasm and a professionalism \nthat was genuinely and sincerely appreciated. I know that he and his \nwife Ann are probably going to be spending a lot more time out on their \nbicycles and enjoying their time together. We happen to share timing; \ntheir two sons are just about the same age as the two sons that Vern \nand I have been raising. So we kind of shared parenting experiences as \nour sons grew into men.\n  It has just been a delight to spend the time getting to know Michael \nBrumas and seeing him as an exceptional professional here serving the \nSenate, both for me and for Leader McConnell. So I wish him well and \ngreat adventures in his retirement.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Karen Billups\n\n  Mr. President, as I am speaking about retirement, I must mention a \nwoman who is not with us as we are debating and navigating this Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act. That woman is a friend and an incredible \nprofessional who headed up the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nfor me for the majority of the past several years. After 25 years in \nthe Senate, Karen Billups has said: I am moving on to more excitement, \nmoving on to spend that time with a young son that she has.\n  Karen is an individual with an incredible reputation, incredible \nintegrity, and a graciousness that will be long remembered on this \nfloor and around this body. She first joined the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee back in 1995. Before that, she had served with \ndistinction at the Department of Energy during the first Bush \nadministration. She was in private law practice, and she was also on \nthe staff of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. She has had a \nbreadth of experience on the private side, within the Executive branch, \nin the House and then, of course, in the Senate. After joining the \ncommittee again in 1995, Karen served as counsel and then she came on \nas senior counsel.\n\n  I think it is worth noting that Karen has worked through--or perhaps \nlived through--two Murkowskis because when my father was the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Karen Billups worked for \nhim. And when I came to the Senate and had Karen at the helm working as \ncounsel, I have to tell you it was extraordinarily reassuring. In those \nearly years, she focused on a whole host of different issues that face \nour Nation, from energy to civilian and defense nuclear waste. She was \nalso the troubleshooter. She mentored our younger committee staff and \nensured that Members and senior staff were all in alignment and that \nthe direction was clear. Again, this was with a focus that was firm but \nyet very appreciative of the different dimensions she had to deal with. \nShe is a woman who was able to navigate with a level of finesse. She is \na woman who is able to navigate with finesse.\n  After service in the private sector, Karen came back as deputy chief \ncounsel in 2003, and I was very grateful when she accepted a promotion \nto be my chief counsel in 2009. Then in 2013 she agreed to step up to \nserve as my staff director and had been in that capacity until we \nconcluded the end of 2015.\n  I think it is so important to acknowledge what Karen not only lent to \nthe committee, to me, to my office, but also to the many on the floor \nwho worked with her on energy issues. Karen set a standard for \nexcellence and achievement, and she worked tirelessly--truly \ntirelessly--to improve our policies to upgrade and to improve our \nNation's energy resource, lands, and forestry policies. You might say \nshe was a policy wonk, but you didn't get that impression from her \nbecause she did it with a genuineness and a passion that clearly \nshowed.\n  Karen steered a wide range of legislation into law, everything from \nboundary adjustments, to helping the economies of small western towns, \nto the landmark Energy Policy Act of 2005. Then as we wrapped up last \nyear, she was able to pull together the end-of-year omnibus with the \nenergy pieces that we had attached to that, the Transportation bill \nthat had an energy title that had come over from the House side, and \ntax extenders. She worked in a way that was quiet and amenable but, \nagain, firm and effective. In many ways her work continues today \nthrough this bipartisan Energy bill and the other legislation she \nguided to introduction. What we are seeing\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\ntoday has been done with the assistance--the mastermind, if you will--\nof Karen Billups.\n  As the ranking member and now chairman of the committee, I depended \ndaily on Karen's thoughtful leadership, her patient counsel, and her \nwise judgment. I mean it when I say she was not only a trusted advisor \nbut deeply skilled and motivated by the best traditions of service to \nthe Senate and to the Nation on every issue that came before the \ncommittee. She had an understanding of the operations of this body.\n  I know those who work the floor appreciated Karen's evenhanded \nskills. She helped point the way with a strategic vision for policy and \noversight. I think she is probably one of the best lawyers I have ever \nmet. Again, she was not just a leader for the staff, she was a mentor \nfor them. She was an advocate for them. That is very telling of true \nleadership.\n  Karen's service to the Senate was marked not by length but by \ndistinction and by grace. She has truly earned the tremendous respect \nthat she enjoys here and all throughout our Nation's Capital. Her \nlegacy speaks for itself--a stronger energy policy that benefits every \nAmerican and an Energy and Natural Resources Committee that continues \nto work together to tackle our toughest challenges.\n  For all of these reasons and so many more, Karen truly stands out in \nmy mind not only as a leader but as a real friend. As she embarks on \nthis very well-deserved retirement, she knows that I wish her, her \nfamily, her husband Ray, and her great son Davis all the best as she \ngoes off to her new endeavor. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge \nthe good work of a great lady who has helped shepherd this bill we have \nbefore us.\n  Mr. President, I notice that we have a couple of Members on the floor \nwho I am assuming would like to speak to the Energy bill before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I wish to start by congratulating the \nchair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska, for her leadership on this bill and so many other issues. \nShe is a testament to how the Senate should operate. She is a testament \nto the tradition of bipartisanship that characterizes this body when it \nis behaving properly. I thank her and congratulate her for her \nleadership on this issue and many others.\n  I also thank the ranking member, Senator Cantwell from Washington \nState, for her leadership on this and many other issues. They have \nformed a good and productive partnership.\n  Our energy system is undergoing a fundamental transformation. In the \nlast 8 years, wind power capacity has grown by more than 400 percent, \nand solar capacity has grown by more than 2,500 percent. In 2015, wind \nand solar comprised 61 percent of new generation capacity. Last year in \nthe United States, by far the majority of new generation was clean \nenergy. So what has happened is that the clean energy revolution is no \nlonger aspirational. It is no longer something people put in a bullet \npoint in their campaign brochure or as a talking point in a debate. It \nis actually happening. It is actually real, and it is across the \ncountry. We drive more hybrids and electric vehicles and increasingly \nuse efficient appliances and manufacturing equipment. We have made \nincredible progress in driving down the costs of clean energy, but we \ncannot let this progress stall out. We need to modernize our \ninfrastructure in order to integrate greater amounts of renewable \nenergy and save money for consumers through energy efficiency.\n  This bill is a positive step in transitioning our energy system from \nthe 19th and 20th centuries into the 21st. There are a number of \nprovisions that are worth highlighting.\n  First, the bill proposes $500 million in research and development for \ngrid-scale storage. This will allow us to use even more electricity \nfrom renewable sources. There is no doubt we are going to continue to \nneed baseload power, but the assumptions about the percentage of \nbaseload power that we need in order to have good power quality across \nour grids are changing. For instance, in the State of Hawaii the basic \nassumption was that you couldn't have more than about 15 percent of \npenetration of intermittent renewable energy. Well, we now have parts \nof our grid that are 35 percent, 45 percent, renewable energy. So the \nold assumptions are being thrown out the window, but no doubt we are \ngoing to continue to need to have Federal research and private sector \nresearch into this question of how much intermittent renewable energy a \ngrid can accommodate without sacrificing power quality. This $500 \nmillion investment is going to be a big help toward that.\n  This bill will also continue investments in grid modernization that \nwill help to smooth the integration of distributed renewable \ngeneration. This will make a real difference in improving reliability \nwhile reducing individuals' reliance on fossil fuels.\n  This bill would also permanently reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. This is not just the most successful conservation \nprogram in our Nation's history--and that would be a good enough reason \nto permanently reauthorize it--it is also an economic driver, returning \n$4 in economic value for every $1 invested.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2965\n\n  Last, but certainly not least, this bill increases funding for energy \nresearch and development at the Advanced Research Projects Agency-\nEnergy, which is desperately needed because only the Federal Government \ncan undertake the kind of high-risk, high-reward research that will \nallow us to maintain our economic dominance in this space.\n  But I think we must do more on energy innovation, so I have offered \nan amendment to increase the authorization for ARPA-E above and beyond \nwhat is in this bill. Specifically, the amendment sets forth \nauthorization levels as follows: $325 million for fiscal years 2016 to \n2018 and $375 million per year for fiscal years 2019 through 2020.\n  This is a relatively modest increase of just $113 million over 4 \nyears. It is important to remember that ARPA-E was the brainchild of a \nNational Academies report which recommended to Congress that they \nestablish an ARPA-E within the U.S. Department of Energy, modeled after \na very successful program in the Department of Defense called DARPA. \nThe agency was credited with such innovations as GPS, the stealth \nfighter, and computer networking.\n  In 2007, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law \nthe America COMPETES Act, which officially authorized the creation \nARPA-E. In 2009, Congress appropriated and President Obama allocated \n$400 million to the new agency, which funded ARPA-E's first projects.\n  In the years since, despite bipartisan support, ARPA-E has not \nreceived more than the $280 million in funding. Yet this agency has had \nincredible success with even this modest amount of funding. For \nexample, ARPA-E awardees have developed a 1-megawatt silicon carbide \ntransistor the size of a fingernail and engineered microbes that use \nhydrogen and carbon dioxide to make liquid transportation fuel. They \ninvest in pioneering research that is groundbreaking, transformative, \nand amazing. Think about what they could do with just a little more \nmoney.\n  Innovation in advanced energy technologies can be a significant part \nof the solution to any number of challenges: increasing the reliability \nof our grid, lowering our electricity rates, hardening our energy \ninfrastructure against cyber attacks, and many others. ARPA-E is \nhelping to fund projects at the cutting edge of all of these \nchallenges--and more.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to \nsupport ARPA-E and to vote for this amendment and to support the \nunderlying bill, which is an important step to paving the way to a \nrevolution in the way in which we produce and consume energy in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time during the \nquorum calls be equally charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to praise the ranking member and \nthe chairman of the committee on the great job they have done on this \nlegislation. I have worked for years with Senator Murkowski. She is a \nreal trooper and has done a great job for our country and for her State \nof Alaska. Senator Cantwell of Washington is the same. I am pleased to \nwork with them on this particular legislation, which I support today.\n  I am rising to talk for a minute about an amendment Senator Bennet of \nColorado and I will be offering to the bill at the appropriate time \ncalled the SAVE Act.\n  The SAVE Act is a way to encourage people to finance and include in \nthe purchase of a new home the right types of energy efficiency \nadditions to that home, which will lower the cost of energy to the \nhome, improve the rate of consumption of energy in the home, and make \nit easier for people to afford energy-saving R-factors for insulation, \nThermopane for doors and windows, and other treatments they need to \nreduce costs.\n  I spent 33 years in residential real estate. I don't know much about \nanything, but I know a lot about people buying houses and about housing \nlaws and about financing, and I know this: For the entry-level \nborrower--and this addresses only FHA loans--the most important thing \nto have the right type of energy efficiency is to be able to afford it, \nand the best way to be able to afford it is to be able to finance it. \nIf you don't allow the incorporation of the value of the additional \ncost of the additional R-factor for insulation or Thermopane factor for \nwindows and doors, then people don't end up choosing energy efficiency; \nthey choose less efficient houses which last for 30 or 40 years and \nburn more energy in their lifetime than they would have if we had not \nhad a way to incentivize people to incorporate energy efficiency into \nthe purchase of their new home.\n  So my story is very simple. We are here today to encourage energy \nefficiency, encourage savings on energy, and encourage people to focus \non energy, to be a more energy-independent country. The best way to do \nthat is to make sure we take the mechanisms of purchase--being the FHA \nloan in this case--and incorporate and consider for financial value \npurposes, for the appraisal and for the loan-to-value ratio and for \nqualification purposes, the savings of the R-factor improvements, \nThermopane improvements, and other energy efficiency improvements put \nin.\n  At the appropriate time--sometime today--I will ask the chairman to \nrecognize me to set aside the pending amendment and make this amendment \npending, but until that time, I wanted to come to the floor to let \nMembers know we have an outstanding piece of legislation which scores \nat zero in terms of costs, applies only to FHA loans, encourages energy \nefficiency, and allows people to afford to build it into the financing \nof the purchase of a house. It is a win-win-win. I am proud to work \nwith Senator Bennet on this legislation.\n  I appreciate being recognized by the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the minority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic whip.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to two separate \nissues. First, I wish to speak to the issue of for-profit colleges and \nuniversities.\n  Yesterday another for-profit college was accused by a Federal agency \nof misleading and deceiving students. The Federal Trade Commission \nannounced it filed suit against DeVry University for advertisements \nthat deceived consumers about the likelihood that students would find \njobs and earn money after they graduated from DeVry.\n  DeVry's commercials and advertisements date back to at least 2008--\nabout 9 years that they have been claiming that ``since 1975, 90% of \nDeVry graduates system-wide in the active job market held positions in \ntheir fields of study within 6 months of graduation.'' Starting in \n2013, they also claimed that DeVry graduates ``had 15 percent higher \nincomes one year after graduation on average than graduates of all \nother colleges and universities.''\n  The Department of Education started investigating these claims in \nAugust of last year. After asking DeVry for proof of their statements \nin these ads, the Department announced yesterday that the company was \n``unable to substantiate the truthfulness of those representations, as \nis required by federal law.'' As such, the Department of Education \nordered DeVry to stop making these false claims and required DeVry's \nfuture claims related to employability and income to be verified by an \nindependent monitor. At the same time, it appears the Department will \nallow DeVry to continue to participate in Federal title IV programs--\nreceiving taxpayer dollars and enrolling new students. How much Federal \nfunding does DeVry receive? In 2013 and 2014, DeVry Education Group, \nbrought in more than $1 billion in taxpayer funding through title IV.\n  The company's president, Daniel Hamburger, received $5.7 million in \ntotal compensation in 2014--$5.7 million. If we compare the salary this \npresident took from DeVry University--which receives the lion's share \nof all of its funds from the Federal Government--we will find he is \ncompensated dramatically more than college presidents across the United \nStates. The president of the University of Illinois--a major flagship \ninstitution and research university--makes a base salary in the \nneighborhood of $600,000. By comparison, DeVry's president, Daniel \nHamburger, received $5.7 million in total compensation thanks to the \ntaxpayers and students.\n  Meanwhile, according to a recent study by Brookings, DeVry students \ncumulatively owe more than $8.3 billion in federal student loan debt. \nIt is no wonder considering the average cost of an associate's degree--\na 2-year degree--at DeVry is about $40,000. In 2009, DeVry's 5-year \ncohort default rate on student loans was 43 percent. That means that of \nthe students who left DeVry in the year 2009, 43 percent--almost half \nof them--had defaulted within 5 years of leaving DeVry. I have said it \nbefore of Corinthian--a for-profit school that went out of business--\nand I will say it now of DeVry: Students shouldn't be left holding the \nbag for the misdeeds of these private, profit-making corporations that \nare skimming so much money from the taxpayers.\n  The Department of Education has found that DeVry's claims could not \nbe substantiated as required by Federal law.\n  The Federal Trade Commission is also suing DeVry over claims of \nmisleading students and consumers. Students who were harmed should be \neligible for expedited Federal student loan relief through defense to \nrepayment. But let me remind those who are following this debate: \nFollow the money. Taxpayers across America pay their taxes. The money \ngoes into the Federal Treasury, and then the money goes--through the \nTreasury and through Pell grants and student loans--to students and \ntheir families, to these private, for-profit colleges and universities. \nThe private, for-profit colleges and universities, such as DeVry, \ndeceive and mislead the students about the value of their education and \nwhether they will get a job after they graduate. The students end up \nwasting their time and their money because they end up with a huge \nstudent debt when it is all over. And what happens? They default on \ntheir debt, which means the taxpayers don't see the money going back to \nthe Treasury, which we hope for, or in some cases the schools--like \nCorinthian--fail, and as a result the students are relieved of their \ndebt obligations--as they should be, so the taxpayers again are the \nultimate losers.\n  The for-profit colleges and universities of the United States of \nAmerica are the most heavily subsidized private sector businesses in \nour country--not a defense contractor or a farm operation; for-profit \ncolleges and universities.\n  The DeVry news follows a particularly bad year for this industry. In \n2015 more misconduct and schemes were exposed when it came to for-\nprofit colleges and universities than ever before. Enrollment across \nthe industry is declining, as students and their parents finally \nrealize that many of these schools are just bad news. State and Federal \nregulators are shining a light on the illegal tactics of the for-profit \ncollege and university industry. Stock prices for these private, for-\nprofit corporations are plummeting because investors realize that \nexploiting these students, misleading these students, and swindling \ntaxpayers is not a sustainable business model.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  Years of bad behavior are catching up with for-profit colleges and \nuniversities, and it shows in how for-profit education companies are \nclosing their schools across the country. Even in my home state of \nIllinois, we have seen dramatic changes over the last year. It started \nwith the collapse of Corinthian. This company was inflating its job-\nplacement rates to lure in new students, defrauding the students, their \nfamilies, and taxpayers, and lying to the accrediting agencies and \nFederal Government. When Corinthian collapsed, more than 70,000 \nstudents were left in the lurch, many with more debt than they could \npossibly repay and a Corinthian education that turned out to be \nvirtually worthless.\n  In Illinois, the campuses Corinthian operated as Everest College in \nthe villages and towns of Bedford Park, Burr Ridge, Melrose Park, \nMerrionette Park, and Skokie were then sold to ECMC. ECMC was a new \ncreation. This company that created this new not-for-profit, in name at \nleast, college, incidentally, is a major debt collector for the U.S. \nDepartment of Education and had no previous experience running an \neducational enterprise. What qualified them to start a college, I don't \nknow. Unfortunately, ECMC maintained much of the old Corinthian \nleadership and maintained practices to keep students from suing them \nfor misconduct. After the Illinois Board of Higher Education pushed \nthem on some of these issues, ECMC decided to teach-out its newly \nacquired campuses in Illinois and leave the State, thank goodness.\n  Then there is Westwood. Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan--whom \nI respect very much--sued Westwood College for engaging in deceptive \npractices. Attorney General Madigan's suit focused specifically on \nWestwood's criminal justice program. In order to lure students into the \nprogram, this private, for-profit college, Westwood, convinced the \nstudents they could get jobs with the Chicago Police Department or the \nIllinois State Police if they would just hang on and get a degree from \nWestwood. What happened when the students graduated and took their \ndegrees and diplomas to employers and applied for a job? The employers \nlaughed at them. They didn't recognize a Westwood degree.\n  In November, Attorney General Madigan reached a settlement with \nWestwood. It agreed to forgive $15 million in private student loans for \nIllinois students--private loans, not federal loans. Shortly \nthereafter, Westwood announced it would stop enrolling students and end \noperations at its campuses nationwide, including the four it operates \nin the Chicagoland area. Thank goodness and good riddance to Westwood.\n  Also in 2015, Career Education Corporation, which is another for-\nprofit college, announced it would close its brands Sanford Brown, \nHarrington College of Design, and Le Cordon Bleu, all of which had \ncampuses in Illinois. Thank goodness and good riddance. In Chicago, an \nassociate's degree in culinary art at Le Cordon Bleu would have cost \n$42,000, and students had a one-in-five chance of defaulting on any \nloans they took out for that associate's degree. If the students walked \na few blocks away to Chicago City Colleges' Kennedy King Campus, in \ncomparison, they could have received the same degree not for $42,000 \nbut for $7,000. And the likelihood of defaulting on student loans at \nCity Colleges is not 1 in 5, as it was at Le Cordon Bleu, it is 1 in \n20.\n  Harrington--I have talked about them before. Harrington College of \nDesign exploited Hannah Moore, a young woman from Chicago whom I have \ncome to know. She got her degree at Harrington after transferring from \na community college. She couldn't find a job in her field with her \nHarrington degree. It turned out to be worthless. What did it cost her \nto get the degree, this for-profit college degree that Harrington \nheavily marketed? Hannah paid $125,000. She still carries that debt to \nthis day, and it is growing. She can't pay it off fast enough, and it \nhas ballooned to $150,000. This poor young woman. Her life is \ncompromised because of the exploitation of her ambition to do something \nimportant in life. She had to live in her parents' basement. Her dad \ncame out of retirement to try to help his daughter pay off her students \nloans because, you see, the loans that are taken out to go to any \ninstitution of higher education are not like money borrowed for a car \nor a home; these student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. \nWhat does that mean? You are going to carry them to the grave.\n  Many student loan debts that are in default are being collected in \nthe most unusual places. Grandmothers who helped their granddaughters \nby cosigning their loan for college--when the granddaughter defaults, \nit is the grandmother and in some cases her Social Security payments \nthat are withheld to pay off these student loans. These loans will \nhaunt these students, many of them for a lifetime, particularly if they \nhave gone to these for-profit schools.\n  Finally, even though it is not in Illinois, I want to mention Ashford \nUniversity. On a campus in Clinton, IA, just across the Mississippi \nRiver, Ashford has shown itself to be one of the worst actors in the \nfor-profit college industry.\n  A Bloomberg News story told of James Long, who suffered a brain \ninjury when he was in service to his country in the Army, driving a \nhumvee in Iraq that was attacked. An Ashford recruiter went after James \nLong and got him to sign up to use his military education benefits to \nenroll in classes that this individual, sadly, could not even remember \nbecause of the traumatic brain injury he had suffered.\n  In 2014, Iowa attorney general Tom Miller announced a $7.25 million \nsettlement with Ashford University. Miller accused the school of \nviolating Iowa's Consumer Fraud Act after the Iowa attorney general \nreceived multiple complaints filed by current and former Ashford \nstudents. This included complaints that this for-profit school misled \nstudents to believe that an online Ashford education degree would allow \nstudents to become classroom teachers with no further certification.\n\n  I remember Ashford because our former colleague, Senator Tom Harkin \nof Iowa, held a hearing and talked about how Ashford bought what was a \nsmall Catholic college, took on their accreditation, and started \npeddling the for-profit education that was worthless. Do you know what \nthe faculty of Ashford University consisted of at that time? One \nfaculty member for every 500 students. Do you know what the people who \nwere running this scam operation were paid? Millions--millions of \ndollars of taxpayers' money. The investigation found that Ashford \nrecruiters, in addition, misled prospective students, used high-\npressure sales tactics, and failed to disclose information about the \ncost and likelihood of obtaining a degree.\n  In 2015, Ashford announced it was going to close its Clinton, IA, \ncampus--thank goodness and good riddance. It is for the students who \ncould have been exploited by these companies that I say this: It is \ntime for us to stand up as a Congress and Federal Government and put an \nend to this insidious scam of students, their families, and the \ntaxpayers.\n  Thousands of students in Illinois and all across the Nation have been \nlured into attending these for-profit schools with lies or deception. \nDon't take this Senator's word for it. Take a look at the litany of \nschools that are under investigation by State and local authorities for \nfraud. Many students, such as Hannah, have so much debt that their \nlives and futures are compromised.\n  Over the last year, I have joined several of my Senate colleagues to \npush the Department of Education to provide Federal student loan debt \nrelief to students who have been taken advantage of by the for-profit \ncolleges. We have an obligation here. To think that we are shoveling \n$25 billion into these for-profit schools every single year without \nasking the hard questions about whether taxpayers' dollars and student \ndebt is justified by the results. Shame on us--we can do so much \nbetter. The numbers tell the story. Ten percent, or 1 out of 10, of \ncollege students in this country attend for-profit colleges and \nuniversities, and 20 percent of all the Federal aid to education, or \n$25 billion, goes to these for-profit colleges and universities. In \nspite of it only accounting for 10 percent of college students, these \nfor-profit colleges and universities account for over 40 percent of \nstudent loan defaults. They charge too much, their diplomas are worth \ntoo little, and these students suffer as a result.\n  What is our obligation here? Is this a ``buyer beware'' situation \nwhen it\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\ncomes to the students and their families or is it a situation where \n``Congress beware'' if we aren't more sensitive to the fact that we are \npropping up an industry that is exploiting these students and \ntaxpayers.\n  With the closure of these campuses in Illinois and several of these \ncompanies moving out of the State all together, the educational \nlandscape is a little safer for the thousands of Illinoisans trying to \ndo the right thing--to get an education for themselves and their \nfamilies. There is a sensible alternative in virtually every city and \ntown in America--community colleges, city colleges. They are \naffordable, and in most cases the credits are transferrable to major \nuniversities and students don't incur the kind of debt that can \ncompromise their lives for years and years to come.\n  I have spoken on the floor many times about these for-profit colleges \nand universities. In one respect it is a fairly easy issue and easy \ntopic. They need to be held accountable, as DeVry is being held \naccountable by the Department of Education and the Federal Trade \nCommission for their misconduct.\n  Now the question is this: Will the Congress step up to its \nresponsibility to clean up this situation?\n  Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering a bipartisan \nenergy bill that will help put our country on a pathway to build a 21st \ncentury economy. It contains several important provisions to develop \ndomestic clean energy resources, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues through the amendment process to strengthen it.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from \nAlaska, and Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from the State of \nWashington--the chair and ranking member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee--and applaud them for their effort and thank them \nfor bringing this bipartisan measure to the floor.\n  The Energy Policy Modernization Act is a result of the committee's \nmultiple hearings on over 100 individual bills. If passed, it will be \nthe first major energy bill approved by Congress in 9 years.\n  A lot has changed in 9 years. The United States has dramatically \nincreased natural gas and oil production. Renewable energy production \nhas skyrocketed and the cost of this has decreased. More Americans are \nusing it. We are also finding new and better ways to address our most \npressing energy and climate change challenges.\n  The bill before us takes those new developments into account and \nupdates our policies. The act strengthens energy efficiency measures \nfor Federal buildings and multifamily homes and reauthorizes important \nprograms such as weatherization and energy. In Illinois, that means \ntens of thousands low-income and elderly households will be able to \nreceive critical upgrades that will make their homes more efficient, \nallowing them to spend less money to keep their homes cool and warm. It \nwill also help maintain Illinois' leadership as the top State for LEED-\ncertified buildings as ranked by the U.S. Green Building Council.\n  The bill encourages the development of new energy resources such as \ngeothermal and hydropower and better ways to store carbon dioxide, \nwhich will help us address the challenge of climate change. Most \nimportantly, the bill makes a substantial commitment to supporting \nbasic science research and innovation at universities and the \nDepartment of Energy's laboratories. The Energy Policy Modernization \nAct authorizes 4-percent annual budget increases for the DOE Office of \nScience and the Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n  As cochair of the Senate National Laboratory Caucus, I strongly \nsupport these increases at DOE's Office of Science because I know it \nwill lead to new breakthrough scientific discoveries that will keep \nAmerica competitive.\n  Since their creation in the 1940s, the national labs have really done \nsome amazing things on energy innovation, scientific discovery, and \nnational security. In Illinois, both Argonne and Fermi serve as a \nmeeting place for the world's best researchers. The work conducted at \ntheir labs leads to advances in alternative-fuel vehicles and \nimprovements in energy efficiency. Universities from across the country \nuse the labs to conduct research and train others. That is why earlier \nthis year I introduced a bill, the American Innovation Act, to provide \n5-percent real growth to DOE's Office of Science.\n  I hope to offer an amendment on the floor. A 4-percent annual \nincrease when it comes to the Office of Science in the Department of \nEnergy, for example, is good, but that is not 4 percent over inflation. \nIf inflation is running at 2 percent, it is merely a 2-percent real \nincrease in research. I think we ought to err on the side of investing \nmore into research. I think we should have 5-percent real growth in \ninvestment in the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense medical \nresearch, and the Veterans Administration medical research. Then when \nit comes to this side of the ledger, such as innovations, let's include \nthe Office of Science and many other key agencies.\n  I visited the Department of Energy a few months ago, and I had \nbreakfast with Ernest Moniz, who is the Secretary. I talked to him \nabout biomedical research, and he said: There is something I need to \nshare with you. The Office of Science in the Department of Energy is \ndeveloping the technology for imaging the brain so we can detect early \nindications of Alzheimer's. Currently, unfortunately, the only way to \nreally say that a person is suffering from Alzheimer's with any \nobjective assurance is through an autopsy. If we can--through imaging \ndevices, while a person is still alive and before they have really \nstarted to decline--detect and work on stopping the progress of \nAlzheimer's, it would be an amazing achievement.\n  Once every 67 seconds in America someone is diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's. I challenged my staff when they told me that, and they \nwere right. Almost every single minute a person is diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's.\n  Last year, in Federal funds, we spent in Medicare and Medicaid $200 \nbillion on Alzheimer's patients. Imagine what was spent in the private \nsector, and imagine the kind of sacrifices and the spending that were \nmade by families trying to maintain the care of a family member \nstricken with Alzheimer's.\n  So putting a little extra money into biomedical research, or in this \ncase research at the Office of Science, is money well invested. If we \ncan slow down the progress of Alzheimer's and find a way to delay it--\neven months--it will pay back this investment over and over. God \nwilling, if we find a cure, it will justify every penny we put into \nthis research.\n  I will offer an amendment, and what I am asking is basic. I am asking \nfor authorization for 5-percent real growth that is over inflation. I \nthink that is the least we can do, but I think it will be a significant \ncommitment and substantially more than is currently in the bill.\n  The work at these labs has led to amazing advances, and I think there \nis more ahead of us. In addition to supporting basic science research, \nthe act before us directs the Department of Education to build a \nresearch program to develop the next generation of computers--1,000 \ntimes faster than our current supercomputers. Is it possible? I believe \nit is. I am not an expert in this field, but you have to step back and \nsay that it is amazing when they tell us that the cellphones we carry \naround have more computing power than the early computers that Steve \nJobs and others brought to market.\n  Currently, companies around the world use supercomputers to solve \nproblems and answer important questions. Boeing and Cummins have both \nused DOE supercomputers to design better airplanes and trucks and use \nless energy so that they burn fuel more efficiently. This has led \nChina, South Korea, and Europe to get into the competition. They are in \nthe race, too, for the next generation of supercomputers. I want \nAmerica to win that race. The bill before us, with its investment and \nresearch, can make a difference. The government should invest in these \nlabs and in research to create jobs and competitive businesses. This \nbipartisan energy bill can achieve that and lead this country to a \nbrighter future with greater energy resources that have a lighter \nimpact on the environment and build a stronger economy. Because the \nenergy choices we make now will determine the future of our children \nand\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\ngrandchildren, we ought to be serious about it. We ought to make the \ninvestments for a sustainable planet and a promising, bright future.\n  I hope my colleagues will work together to improve this bill and help \nus create a 21st century energy economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, we just left the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, as the Presiding Officer knows as a member of the Foreign \nRelation Committee, where we passed, with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport, legislation to increase our sanctions against the rogue regime \nin North Korea.\n  About a year ago I had a conversation with Senator Corker, the \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, about the need for \nthe legislation. We both agreed that North Korea poses a serious and \ngrowing threat to its neighbors, to the U.S. homeland, and to global \nsecurity. We agreed we could not continue to ignore the forgotten \nmaniac--the forgotten maniac who is Kim Jong Un.\n  This past August I had an opportunity to visit with South Korea \npersonally to meet with the President of South Korea, Mr. Park, and we \nagreed that the status quo with regard to North Korea was no longer \nsustainable and no longer responsible. That is why this past October I \nintroduced S. 2144, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement \nAct. I thank the sponsors of that bill--Senators Rubio, Risch, Perdue, \nand Isakson--for cosponsoring the legislation and the chairman and his \nstaff for their encouragement and invaluable support to make that bill \na reality today, along with Senators Cardin and Menendez, who worked so \nhard, and the work Senator Menendez has been leading over the past year \nas well. This is a bipartisan product that came out of the committee. \nAs the chairman announced today, we will most likely see floor time in \njust a couple of weeks.\n  On January 6, 2016, our worst fears were realized when North Korea \nconducted its fourth nuclear test. Moreover, North Korea has claimed \nthis test was a hydrogen bomb, which is a vastly more powerful weapon. \nEven if the reports out of North Korea are not true that it is not such \na weapon, it still represents a significant advancement in North \nKorea's nuclear weapons capability. We also know North Korea continues \nto advance its ballistic missile program. News reports recently out of \nboth Japan and in the United States talk about the equipment being \nmoved for a possible additional missile launch.\n  ADM Bill Gortney, the head of U.S. Northern Command based at Peterson \nAir Force Base in Colorado Springs, CO, has publicly stated on several \noccasions that North Korea may have already developed the ability to \nminiaturize a nuclear warhead, to mount it on their own \nintercontinental ballistic missile called the KN-08, and to ``shoot it \nat the homeland.'' Admiral Gortney reiterated those fears to me \nprivately in our conversations numerous times as well, including his \nfeeling--his concern--that the condition of the peninsula is perhaps at \nits most unstable point that it has been since the armistice.\n  North Korea continues to grossly abuse the rights of their own \npeople. There are up to 200,000 men, women, and children in North \nKorea's vast prison systems. In fact, the United Nations Commission of \nInquiry in 2014 found that North Korea's actions constituted a crime \nagainst humanity.\n  We have seen North Korea's cyber capabilities grow into an \nasymmetrical threat that they have utilized against its neighbors, \nSouth Korea and Japan, as well as the United States, as we all recall \nafter the Sony Pictures hack in November of 2014. According to a \nNovember 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, North Korea is emerging as a significant actor in cyber space \nwith both its military and clandestine organizations gaining the \nability to conduct cyber operations.\n  All of these developments represent a failure of U.S. policy of \nstrategic patience toward North Korea. That is why this bill out of \ncommittee, with the strong bipartisan support that it received today, \nrepresents a final change in that failed policy. It allows us to change \ncourse and, in just a couple of weeks, we can put that legislation into \neffect.\n  The House of Representatives, as we know, passed 418-to-2 their own \nversion of a bill sanctioning North Korea just a few weeks ago, and I \nthank the chairman for moving forward on our very strong substitute \namendment today.\n  The Gardner-Menendez substitute before us today represents a slightly \nmodified version of S. 2144. In particular, this legislation mandates--\nnot simply authorizes, it mandates--the President to impose sanctions \nagainst persons who materially contribute to North Korea's nuclear and \nballistic missile development; import luxury goods into North Korea; \nenable its censorship and human rights abuses; engage in money \nlaundering or manufacturing of counterfeit goods and narcotics \ntrafficking; engaging in activities undermining cyber security; have \nsold, supplied or transferred to or from North Korea precious metals or \nraw metals, including aluminum, steel, and coal for the benefit of \nNorth Korea's regime and its illicit activities.\n  These are mandatory sanctions. It is a dramatic new direction from \nthe discretionary sanctions of today. I would note that these mandatory \nsanctions on North Korea's cyber activities and mandatory sanctions on \nthe minerals are unique to the Senate legislation.\n  This bill also codifies Executive Order Nos. 13687 and 13694, \nregarding cyber security as they apply to North Korea, which were \nenacted last year in the wake of the Sony Pictures hack and other cyber \nincidents. This is also a unique feature of the Senate bill, the \nGardner-Menendez substitute amendment.\n  Lastly, the mandatory sanctions on cyber violators will break new \nground for Congress if enacted and signed into law, perhaps providing \nprecedent for future cyber violations around the globe.\n  We need to look for every way to deprive Pyongyang of income to build \nits weapons program, strengthen its cyber capabilities, and continue \nthe abuse of its own people. We must stop this regime's abuse, and we \nmust also send a strong message to China, North Korea's diplomatic \nprotector and largest trading partner, that the United States will use \nevery economic tool at its disposal to stop the forgotten maniac.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when it moves to the \nfloor. I congratulate Senator Corker and Senator Menendez for coming \ntogether with a bipartisan solution today so this body and the House of \nRepresentatives can pass this legislation and put it on the President's \ndesk to be signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Colorado \nfor moving his amendment forward.\n  I am here on a different subject, which is to discuss an amendment \nthat I submitted with Senator Isakson concerning residential energy \nefficiency. The so-called SAVE Act has always been thoroughly \nbipartisan, drawing the support of Senators Isakson, Toomey, Moran, \nPortman, Boxer, and others, and attracted support from groups all \nacross the political spectrum from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce all the \nway to the Sierra Club.\n  Our amendment would allow for a home's energy efficiency to be \nconsidered when a borrower is applying for a loan by making a simple \nchange to home underwriting and appraisal standards. Specifically, when \nyou apply for a mortgage, you can request under this legislation an \nenergy audit, and if you have a loan that is backed by the FHA, the \nenergy efficiency of your home and your energy bills will be taken into \naccount by your mortgage\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nlender. Without this change, even though homeowners spend more on \nenergy costs than taxes or home insurance, the amount you pay each \nmonth for energy is not taken into account.\n  This amendment isn't a mandate. It doesn't require anything. It \nsimply allows mortgage lenders to account for energy costs in the same \nway they account for taxes and insurance. It makes no sense that \ncosmetic improvements like new countertops increase a house's value, \nbut an energy-efficient furnace, which will actually save homeowners \nthousands of dollars, does not.\n  This amendment will create thousands of jobs in manufacturing, \nconstruction, and energy efficiency. It will save homeowners money on \ntheir energy bills, and it will decrease foreclosure risk. It will \nincrease the energy efficiency of our homes. It does all this by giving \nconsumers a choice they don't today have.\n  I have heard from builders all across Colorado who support this \namendment--people like Gene Myers, who is the CEO and founder of Thrive \nHome Builders. He has built more than 1,000 energy-efficient homes in \nthe Denver area, but he understands we will not fully attain the \nbenefits of efficiency in the market until we properly value it.\n  For these reasons, a large and diverse coalition supports this \namendment, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nNational Association of Home Builders, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nand the U.S. Defense Council, among others.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and commonsense \namendment to improve energy efficiency and create American jobs. I \nthank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, for his leadership and his \nsponsorship of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Energy Policy \nModernization Act of 2015--legislation that has been advanced by our \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee chairman, Senator Murkowski, \nalong with the ranking member, Senator Cantwell. As a member of the \ncommittee, I appreciate their leadership on this important issue and \nthis legislation we are now considering on the floor.\n  I think Chairwoman Murkowski is right when she speaks to the need to \nupdate our Nation's energy policy and, in that spirit, I filed several \namendments designed to advance our Nation's energy policy in key areas. \nToday I wish to speak briefly about these three amendments. These \namendments would help provide regulatory certainty for cross-border \ninfrastructure projects, the regulation and recycling of coal ash, and \nreaffirm State primacy for energy development, particularly when it \ncomes to hydraulic fracturing or fracking.\n  First, let me talk about the North American energy infrastructure \namendment. One of the necessary components to leveraging our abundant \nenergy resources and strengthening our energy security involves \nbuilding the infrastructure to take energy from where it is produced to \nwhere it is consumed. Whether it is transporting crude oil or natural \ngas or modernizing and connecting our electric grid, these projects \nrequire long-term planning and investment, as well as a regulatory \nenvironment that promotes certainty and transparency, as well as \nimpartial review.\n  That is why I have submitted an amendment which is identical to the \nNorth American Energy Infrastructure Act--S. 1228--that would modernize \nthe existing Department of Energy Presidential permitting process for \ncross-border infrastructure projects.\n  This amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Donnelly of Indiana--\nit is a bipartisan measure--removes the need for a Presidential permit \nfor the construction, operation or maintenance of a new oil or natural \ngas pipeline or electric transmission facility with Canada or Mexico \nand instead places the process in the proper Federal agencies.\n  While it does not alter the NEPA--again, I will repeat this. While it \ndoes not alter NEPA's--the National Environmental Policy Act--\nenvironmental review process, our amendment sets time limits for \nFederal agencies to make a decision on projects once those necessary \nreviews are completed. This will add greater certainty to the \npermitting process, and that certainty will help attract the long-term \ninvestment necessary to help us build the energy infrastructure we \nneed.\n  These projects are too important to our economy and to our national \nsecurity to be dragged out virtually for years, such as in the case of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline--more than 7 years. We need a process that is \nfact-based, transparent, consistent, and nonpartisan, that will help \nsupport the important energy relationship between the United States and \nour closest friend and ally--Canada.\n  The Energy Department publicly states that it requires approximately \n6 to 18 months to issue a Presidential permit. However, there are \nnumerous examples of pipelines and electric transmission applications \nlanguishing far beyond that timeline. The many inconsistencies \ninvolving these applications speak to the need to update this \npermitting process.\n  So let's start with crude oil pipelines. Take, for example, the \nbureaucratic delays for the Plains All American Pipeline, which secured \na Presidential permit from the U.S. State Department for its crude oil \npipeline in 2007. In February of 2013, the company sought a name change \npermit from the State Department. However, it took until August of \n2015--2\\1/2\\ years--before a name change was approved.\n  The State Department informed the company that its application for a \nname change required a new National Environmental Policy Act--or NEPA--\nreview because a separate pipeline, the Bakken North, based wholly \nwithin the United States, would connect to it. So to change the name, \nthey had to do a NEPA review for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Electric transmission lines. There have also been many delays in \nsiting electric transmission lines between the United States and \nCanada, and in a lot of cases that is for renewable energy. One example \nis the New England Clean Power Link, a 1,000-megawatt project \ndelivering renewable energy spanning 154 miles between Vermont and \nQuebec. The company filed its application for a Presidential permit in \nMay of 2014. Yet its application has been pending for over 20 months \nfor a renewable energy electric transmission line.\n  Another example is the Great Northern Transmission Line, a 220-mile \nproject that would connect Minnesota and Manitoba, bringing \nhydroelectricity and wind power across the border. The project's \nPresidential application was filed in April of 2014. While the review \nis ongoing and we hope an outcome will come soon, this application has \nbeen pending for almost 2 years.\n  The third example is the Champlain Hudson Power Express project, a \n333-mile underground and underwater project. It will bring 1,000 \nmegawatts of hydroelectric power from Quebec to the New York City area. \nThe application for a Presidential permit was initially filed in \nJanuary 2010; yet it took almost 5 years--until October 2014--for the \nPresidential permit to be issued.\n  Inconsistent delays in the Federal review timelines, which last \nlonger than the Energy Department's 6- to 18-month target--the target \nis 6 to 18 months, not 5 to 7 years--inject uncertainty, risk, and \ncosts into all of these vital projects.\n  Commonsense reforms are needed so the project proponents and \nconsumers can benefit. This is exactly what this legislation does. \nSpecifically, this amendment would eliminate the Presidential permit \nrequirement for construction or modification of new oil and natural gas \npipelines, as well as electric transmission facilities, that cross the \nnational boundary of the United States. Instead, it places the process \nin the proper agencies.\n  It would require that the certificate of crossing will be issued by \nthe Secretary of State for oil pipelines, the Energy Department for \nelectric transmission lines, and FERC and the Energy Department for \ncross-border natural gas pipelines, as currently configured.\n  It requires the State Department to issue a certificate of crossing \non a cross-border pipeline permit within 120 days upon completion of a \nNEPA environmental review process. There is the NEPA environmental \nreview process, but then 120 days after that, they have to make a \ndecision and they have to issue a certificate of crossing unless\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nthe agency finds that construction of the cross-border segment is not \nin the public interest of the United States.\n  It would retain the NEPA review of the potential environmental \nimpacts of a new project at a border crossing and leaves unchanged all \nother environmental, land, or wildlife reviews currently applying to \nany other pipeline constructed in the country. In other words, the \nStates would still oversee the NEPA and permitting processes, as they \ndo now.\n  It would provide for an open and transparent rulemaking process to \ndetermine the definition of ``cross-border segment,'' which would be \nused to help determine the scope of the NEPA review process. That is \nbecause requiring a NEPA review for the entire pipeline project \nduplicates the multiple Federal, State, and local agencies' \nregulations, processes, and authorities already in place.\n  There are numerous existing State and Federal laws and regulations \nfor the review and approval of siting, land acquisition, design, and \nconstruction of projects. Those remain unaffected by this amendment. \nFor example--and this is important--State laws and regulations \ngoverning pipeline siting remain unchanged by this amendment. Federal \nlaws and regulations governing design, construction, safety, and \nenvironmental review of the pipelines remain unchanged. State and local \nlaws and regulations regarding land and rights-of-way acquisition for \ninfrastructure projects, such as pipelines, would remain unchanged. \nConstruction and operation of a pipeline in the United States must \ncomply with the safety regulations of the Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration. This is a separate process from the \nNEPA process and is also unchanged by this amendment.\n  The measure would provide appropriate authority and scope to the \nState Department for examination of border-crossing impacts of \nprojects. Other reviews by the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land \nManagement, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers for issues such as environmental, land, and wildlife impacts \nare appropriate and remain unchanged.\n  The amendment would require FERC to approve natural gas cross-border \npipelines consistent with current policy. It also requires the Energy \nDepartment to issue a permit within 30 days of the receipt of the FERC \naction. Again, these are rational timelines, so there is some \nconsistency and dependability in the process.\n  Finally, the amendment also specifies that existing projects do not \nneed further approvals for new or revised Presidential permits for \ncertain modifications. These include alterations such as volume \nexpansion, adjustments to maintain flow, or changes in ownership.\n  This is commonsense legislation that can help us build the vital \nenergy infrastructure we need for this country.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I would ask how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, the next amendment I would like to review \nthat I will be offering is identical to a bill introduced by Senator \nManchin and myself. It is the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals \nRegulation Act of 2016, S. 2446. This legislation, which builds on our \npast efforts to find a bicameral, bipartisan approach to coal ash, \nensures that there is safe disposal of coal ash and provides greater \ncertainty for its recycling. This is a win from the industry standpoint \nof more energy, it is more cost-effective, but it is also an \nenvironmental win in terms of recycling coal ash, as well as making \nsure that when it is disposed of, it is done safely.\n  Coal ash is a byproduct of coal-based electricity generation that has \nbeen safely recycled for buildings, roads, bridges, and other \ninfrastructure for years. In fact, I think it is important to take note \nof the environmental and financial benefits of coal ash recycling. Over \n60 million tons of coal ash were beneficially used in 2014, including \nover 14 million tons in concrete. It has been calculated that taxpayers \nsave $5.2 billion dollars per year thanks to the use of coal ash in \nfederally funded road and bridge construction. Products made with coal \nash are often stronger and more durable, and coal ash reduces the need \nto manufacture cement, which resulted in greenhouse gas emission \nreductions of 13 million tons in 2014.\n  In December of 2014, the EPA put forth new regulations for the \nmanagement of coal ash. The regulations made clear--at least for the \ntime being--that coal ash would continue to be treated and regulated as \na nonhazardous waste consistent with EPA's earlier findings. However, \nthe regulation has a major flaw: It relies solely on citizen lawsuits \nfor enforcement. What this means is that neither the EPA nor the States \ncan directly enforce the rules through a permit program with which \nowners and operators of coal ash disposal facilities must comply. Think \nabout it. That means the regulation does not create the constructive \nregulatory guidance and oversight necessary to ensure the proper \nmanagement of coal ash. Instead, the EPA regulation has created a \nsituation whereby the only enforcement mechanism for the rule is that \nan operator of a coal ash site can be sued for not meeting the EPA's \nnew Federal regulatory standards. Those subject to this regulation \nwhose responsibility it is for keeping the lights on for our \nelectricity consumers are themselves left in the dark about how the EPA \nstandards will be defined in court cases across the Nation. Instead of \ndirect oversight, we will have lawsuits brought by those who want to \nshut down coal production.\n  Imagine building an addition to your house and there being no \nbuilding permit process to go through with your local government. Let's \njust take this as an analogy. You want to build a house, but there is \nno building permit process to go through with the local government. You \ncall the city or the county, and they say: Well, you should just read \nthe rules, and if you violate the rules, know that you can be sued at \nany time by anyone who thinks that maybe you didn't build that addition \naccording to the law. This process would leave you without any sort of \nassurances that you actually built your addition in accordance with the \nlaw. Worse, you would have the threat of litigation hanging over your \nhead. Does that make any sense?\n  Think about it. You build a house, a nice, beautiful house, in \nPhoenix, where it is nice and warm in the winter. You can't get a \nbuilding permit. You build that house according to your interpretation \nof the regulations, but anybody--it might be your neighbor; it might be \nsomebody who comes down from the great State of North Dakota to enjoy \nyour lovely winter--anybody may decide to sue you, and they would be \nable to do it. That is how the regulation of coal ash is set up. Come \non. It makes no sense at all. That is how it has been done, and that is \nwhy we need to fix it.\n  Our amendment will directly address this problem by taking the best \nparts of our EPA rule--the standards for coal ash disposal--and \nincorporating all of them in EPA-approved State permit programs for \nboth recycling and disposal. The States will have direct oversight over \ndisposal sites' design and operation, including inspections, air \ncriteria, run-on and run-off control, closure and postclosure care, and \nfinancial assurance. Meanwhile, we offer State regulators the same \nflexibility for implementing the groundwater monitoring and corrective \naction standards that are currently provided under existing municipal \nsolid waste and hazardous waste regulations, allowing State regulators \nto make tailored, site-specific adjustments.\n  We have been listening to the issues the EPA has brought up about our \nprevious versions of this legislation. In fact, we changed the \nlegislation to include a more traditional EPA application process for \nthe State permit programs. If the EPA finds that a State permit program \nis deficient----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to \nfinish my remarks, with the indulgence of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. If the EPA finds a State permit program deficient, then \nthe EPA can take direct control over the State's permit program in that \nState. If a State doesn't want to have its own permit program, the EPA \nruns the permit program for the State.\n  Mr. President, our amendment is about responsible regulation. It is\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nabout certainty for recyclers and for the American public, who will \nknow that State and Federal regulators are actually working with energy \nproducers to ensure safe disposal of coal ash.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan approach \nby voting for the Hoeven-Manchin amendment.\n  I do have another amendment to speak on, but at this time, due to \ntime constraints, I will defer to the Senator from Massachusetts, and I \nthank him for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     Remembering Christa McAuliffe\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the \nlife of Massachusetts' Christa McAuliffe. She lost her life, along with \nsix other crewmembers, 30 years ago today when the space shuttle \nChallenger exploded. She was an extraordinary teacher and was selected \nout of a pool of 11,000 applicants to lead the ultimate field trip as \nthe first teacher in space. Her legacy lives on in many ways but \nespecially at the Christa McAuliffe Center for Education and Teaching \nExcellence at her alma mater, Framingham State University.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2982\n\n  Mr. President, the omnibus spending bill that was enacted into law in \nDecember lifted the 40-year-old restriction on exporting U.S. oil \noverseas. During that debate, concerns were raised regarding the impact \nthat exporting American oil abroad could have on U.S. consumers and \nrefining fuel prices, independent refineries, and other sectors of the \nU.S. economy, such as shipbuilding.\n  However, the final language that became law did not include any \nrequirement for analyzing and reporting on any potential impacts that \nexports could have on the industry or on U.S. consumers. The Markey \namendment No. 2982 to the Energy bill would create such a review. The \namendment would require the GAO to review and report back annually for \n3 years on the impacts of crude oil exports on U.S. consumers, \nindependent refineries, shipbuilders, and energy production.\n  The language of my amendment is language that is bipartisan. The \nlanguage of my amendment is identical to language included in \nlegislation sponsored by Chairman Murkowski. It is also identical to \nlanguage included in legislation introduced by other Senators.\n  Exporting American crude oil could be a disaster for independent \nrefineries in regions such as the east coast. Upwards of 55 percent of \nour refining capacity on the east coast could potentially close as a \nresult of oil exports.\n  The Energy Department has said that exports could lead to as much as \n$9 billion less investment and 1.6 million barrels less refining \ncapacity in 10 years. It could lead to up to $200 billion less revenue \nfor the U.S. refining sector over the next decade.\n  It could raise prices for consumers, who are currently saving $700 a \nyear at the pump and $500 a year on home heating oil this winter \nbecause of low prices.\n  It could harm U.S. shipbuilders. We have been having a shipbuilding \nrenaissance in this country. We are currently seeing the biggest \nshipbuilding boom in 20 years, and it has been because of our \nincreasing oil production and the Jones Act, which requires shipments \nbetween U.S. ports to be on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed \nships. This means that producing more oil is leading to investment in \nU.S.-built ships to move that oil around the country. Right now, U.S. \nshipbuilders have orders to expand our domestic tanker fleet capable of \ntransporting crude oil by 40 percent. Each oil tanker can represent an \ninvestment of $100 to $200 million. Five years ago there were zero \norders. Now one company alone in Pennsylvania--Aker ASA--has nearly $1 \nbillion in back orders and has tripled employment over the last 3 \nyears.\n  Exports could stop all of this in its tracks, so that GAO report is \nvery important. I also want to compliment Chairman Murkowski and \nRanking Member Cantwell for their excellent work in partnering to \nproduce the legislation which we are considering here on the floor. It \nrepresents bipartisanship in the way it is meant to operate.\n  Toward that goal, I have an amendment that I am going to speak to \nright now, which is one that Senator Cassidy from Louisiana and I have \nintroduced. It is an amendment to improve the way we are going to be \nselling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Our Nation's oil \nstockpile is supposed to be there to protect American consumers and our \nsecurity in the event of an emergency. We should not be using it as a \npiggy bank to pay for other priorities. But if we are going to sell oil \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we should at least make sure that \nwe do so strategically, to get the best deal for taxpayers and American \nconsumers. Last year, Senator Cassidy and I offered a nearly identical \namendment to the Transportation bill, which was adopted on the Senate \nfloor and ultimately became law. That amendment protects taxpayers by \nimproving the way the sales required under the bill--sales of oil from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve--are, in fact, conducted. The Cassidy-\nMarkey fix gives the Secretary of Energy more flexibility to sell oil \nwhen prices are high and directs the Department to stop selling oil \nwhen the revenue targets required by the bill are reached.\n  This fix should allow us to sell fewer overall barrels from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and get a better return on those sales. \nHowever, the roughly $5 million worth of SPRO that was required to be \nsold as part of the Budget Act that passed in November did not include \nthis commonsense fix. The current Cassidy-Markey amendment that is \npending to the Energy bill contains language virtually identical to the \namendment to the Transportation bill that was adopted on the Senate \nfloor. It would apply the same fix to the sales required by the Budget \nAct in order to protect taxpayers.\n  Too often our policy with respect to SPRO has been to buy high and \nsell low. Taxpayers have paid an inflation-adjusted average of roughly \n$75 a barrel for the oil that is in our Nation's stockpile. We should \nensure that we get the best return for our taxpayers in those SPRO \nsales. That is what our amendment would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, did my colleague from Alaska wish to \nintervene for a moment?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Just an inquiry, Mr. President, into how much time the \nSenator is seeking at this moment.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes, 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I also understand that Senator Whitehouse wishes to \nspeak to an amendment that is pending. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I only wish for a moment to speak in \nfavor of the Crapo-Whitehouse amendment. I could do that for a minute \nor for 10 seconds later on. I don't need the time now. We can get to \nthe vote as the chairman wishes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you. I am trying to make sure that we are going \nto commence the vote beginning at noon. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                    Our ``We the People'' Democracy\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important words in the crafting \nof our Constitution are the first three words. Those words are ``We the \nPeople.'' As President Lincoln so eloquently put it, this is the notion \nthat we would create a system of governance that would be governance of \nthe people, by the people, and for the people. I will be rising \nperiodically to address issues that affect American citizens across our \nNation, that are important, that are urgent, and that this body should \nbe addressing.\n  This week I am using my ``We the People'' speech to highlight \nexcerpts from an article written by NASA scientist Piers Sellers. Piers \nSellers was an astronaut. He has been a NASA scientist, and he shared \nthis article from which I am taking portions. He says:\n\n       I'm a climate scientist who has just been told I have Stage \n     4 pancreatic cancer.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       This diagnosis puts me in an interesting position. I've \n     spent much of my professional life thinking about the science \n     of climate change, which is best viewed through a \n     multidecadal lens. At some level I was sure that, even at my \n     present age of 60, I would live to see the most critical part \n     of the problem, and its possible solutions, play out in my \n     lifetime. Now that my personal horizon has been steeply \n     foreshortened, I was forced\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\n     to decide how to spend my remaining time. Was continuing to \n     think about climate change worth the bother?\n\n  He goes on to note that he examined his bucket list and he found only \ntwo things that really mattered: spending time with his family--as he \nput it, ``with the people I know and love''--and then getting back to \nhis office ``as quickly as possible'' to continue the work on climate \nscience and addressing climate change.\n  He notes:\n\n       On the science side, there has been a steady accumulation \n     of evidence from the last 15 years that climate change is \n     real and that its trajectory could lead us to a very \n     uncomfortable, if not dangerous, place. On the policy side, \n     the just-concluded climate conference in Paris set a goal of \n     holding the increase in global average temperature to 2 \n     degrees Celsius . . . above preindustrial levels.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       It's doubtful that we'll hold the line at 2 degrees . . . \n     but we need to give it our best shot. With scenarios that \n     exceed that target, we are talking about enormous changes in \n     global precipitation and temperature patterns, huge impacts \n     on water and food security, and significant sea level rise.\n\n  He continues, saying that ``Pope Francis and a think tank of retired \nmilitary officers have drawn roughly the same conclusion . . . The \nworst impacts will be felt by the world's poorest.''\n  He continues to examine this and notes that while heavy lifting will \nhave to be done by policymakers--and he is speaking to all of us--\nscientists can add a great deal, and scientists at NASA can help by \nkeeping track of the changes in the Earth's system and using their \npowerful computer models to explore which approaches to addressing this \nproblem are practical, trading off near-term impacts against longer \nterm impacts.\n  He observes that engineers and industrialists must come up with new \ntechnologies to address the challenges of clean energy generation, \nstorage, and distribution, and that they must be solved within a few \ndecades.\n  Later in the article, he says:\n\n       History is replete with examples of us humans getting out \n     of tight spots. The winners tend to be realistic, pragmatic, \n     and flexible; the losers are often in denial of the threat.\n\n  He closes by saying this:\n\n       As for me, I have no complaints. I am very grateful for the \n     experiences I have had on this planet. As an astronaut, I \n     space-walked 220 miles above the Earth, floating alongside \n     the International Space Station. I watched hurricanes \n     cartwheel across the ocean, the Amazon snake its way through \n     a sea of brilliant green carpeted forest, and gigantic \n     nighttime thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles \n     along the Ecuador. From this God's-eye-view, I saw how \n     fragile and infinitely precious the Earth is, and I am \n     hopeful for its future.\n\n  ``And so,'' he concludes, ``I am going to work tomorrow.''\n  I simply want to thank Piers for his lifetime of commitment to \nscience, his service as an astronaut, his continuing to work on this \nmajor challenge of addressing the planet, and that he would see--even \nin these days where he is fighting a battle against a forceful, \npowerful disease, he is dedicating his efforts to this challenge.\n  Is that not a call for all of us to see how important it is for us to \ndedicate our efforts to take on this challenge and to recognize, as he \npoints out, that major strategies must be developed in a short period \nof time to avoid catastrophic consequences.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe disposition of the Crapo amendment, the Senate then vote on the \nMarkey amendment with no second-degree amendments in order to the \nMarkey amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, now we are ready to dispose of a couple \nof amendments by voice vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3017\n\n  I call for the regular order with respect to the Barrasso amendment \nNo. 3017.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3017, as Modified\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk for \nBarrasso amendment No. 3017.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on the \nadoption of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which we \nare seeking to add as an amendment to this important Energy bill. This \namendment will do a number of very critical things to help the United \nStates increase and maintain and keep its lead in nuclear energy \ndevelopment globally.\n  It will establish a modeling and simulation program that aids in the \ndevelopment of new reactor technologies, establish a user facility for \na versatile reactor-based fast neutron source, and establish a national \ninnovation center to help share this vital information between the \ngovernment and the private sector.\n  It will allow the NRC to apprise the Department of Energy of \nregulatory challenges early in the development process and would \nrequire a report by the NRC on the licensing of non-light water \nreactors. This bill is a strong signal to the rest of the world that we \nintend to maintain U.S. leadership in nuclear technology.\n  This bill will enable the private sector and national labs to work \ntogether to create even greater achievement in nuclear science than in \nthe last century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the lead Democratic cosponsor of \nSenator Crapo's amendment, I want to commend and salute him for his \nleadership. Senators Durbin and Booker and I have all joined from our \nside. Senator Crapo, Senator Risch, Senator Hatch, and Senator Kirk are \non the Republican side. This is truly a bipartisan amendment. I hope it \nwill get a strong and positive vote.\n  It is very important that America continue its innovation in the area \nof advanced nuclear technologies. They continue to confer immense \npromise. We are seeing the promise of American innovation realized \noverseas, for instance, where the first traveling wave technologies are \nbeing constructed in China, not here.\n  We need to make sure we continue our investment. We need to make sure \nwe are doing good regulation so that innovation can proceed to the \nmarket. We hope this amendment will help move that forward.\n  Once again, Senator Crapo has shown great leadership with this. I am \npleased to support him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today is the 30th anniversary of the \ntremendous loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger and of New Hampshire \nteacher in space Christa McAuliffe of Concord, NH.\n  Today I rise to honor the legacy of the Challenger. On this day 30 \nyears ago, America was saddened by the tragic loss of seven brave \ncrewmembers of the Space Shuttle Challenger : Commander Francis R. \nScobee, Pilot Michael Smith, Mission Specialist Ellison S. Onizuka, \nMission Specialist Ronald E. McNair, Mission Specialist Judith A. \nResnik, Payload Specialist Gregory B. Jarvis, and, of course, our own \nNew Hampshire teacher in space and payload specialist, S. Christa \nMcAuliffe.\n  Each of the members of the Challenger crew conducted themselves with \nsuch bravery, heroism, and a desire to reach beyond and into the stars \nthat it inspired me.\n  As a high school student, I remember where I was that day. We were \nall watching as the Challenger was lifting off into the stars. I was a \nstudent at Nashua High School and Christa McAuliffe inspired all of us. \nShe captured the Nation's imagination as she looked to be the first \nteacher in space.\n  That tragic day touched the lives of every man, woman, and child in \nNew Hampshire. It was one of those days in history when time stopped \nand everyone remembers what they were doing at that moment. I know I \ncertainly do. You see, Christa was a role model, someone who lived \namong us and was able to achieve extraordinary things. She inspired \nyoung people across New Hampshire and the Nation to ``touch the \nfuture.''\n  She was a gifted educator and had such an infectious enthusiasm for \nteaching. She taught social studies at Concord High School and was \nselected from 11,000 applicants to be the first teacher in space.\n  When asked about the mission on national television, she said: ``If \nyou're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. Just get \non.'' It really shows her dedication to teaching, her bravery, and her \ncommitment to inspiring the next generation of leaders, scientists, \ndreamers, and explorers, all of whom have made our Nation great.\n  Today, the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, NH, is \nnamed in her honor. This state-of-the-art facility not only provides a \nlasting tribute to the courage and bravery of Christa McAuliffe and all \nof the members of the Challenger crew, but it also helps educate \nvisitors about the contributions of these extraordinary New Hampshire \ncitizens--not just Christa McAuliffe but other New Hampshire citizens \nwho have braved and explored space. The McAuliffe planetarium is doing \namazing work by showing the next generation of scientists and leaders \nhow exciting it is to study science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. It is a tremendous legacy to Christa McAuliffe and all who \nhave traveled in space and explored the edges of the universe on our \nbehalf so we can learn more about ourselves and new developments.\n  President Ronald Reagan eloquently said that frightful day 30 years \nago:\n\n       The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us by the \n     manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget \n     them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they \n     prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and ``slipped \n     the surly bonds of earth'' to ``touch the face of God.''\n\n  Today we remember and honor the legacy of a great Granite Stater and \ngreat American, Christa McAuliffe, and all of the brave crewmembers of \nthe Space Shuttle Challenger that day because their legacy continues to \nlive on in our children and in our continuous focus on improving in \nscience, technology, mathematics, and our continuous reach for the \nstars.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n      Honoring Nebraska's Soldiers Who Lost Their Lives in Combat\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the great men \nand women of Nebraska who have served and are serving in the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  Our State has a rich and powerful history of answering the call to \nserve. For nearly 150 years, we have witnessed this bravery in each of \nAmerica's wars. Over the past decade, the men and women of Nebraska \nhave risen to defend our precious freedom against Islamic terrorists, \nprimarily in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This year marks the 15th anniversary of the horrific terrorist \nattacks in New York and Washington, DC. These events changed the lives \nof Nebraskans and our Nation forever. Nebraskans stepped up, ready to \nfight. Those serving in uniform, be it Active Duty, the National Guard \nor the Reserves, knew they would likely wind up on the battlefield at \nsome point in the future.\n  Many other Nebraskans enlisted after high school. ROTC units in \nNebraska had no problem filling their ranks, and applications for \nmilitary academy nominations poured in at record numbers. We should all \nbe so thankful to this generation for answering the call and standing \nup to defend freedom across the globe.\n  Today, I begin a new initiative to honor this generation of \nNebraska's heroes on the Senate floor, and I will focus on those who \nlost their lives in combat. All of our fallen Nebraskans have a special \nstory. According to the Nebraska Department of Veterans Affairs, there \nare 77 Nebraskans who lost their lives to combat-related incidents in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Throughout this year and beyond, I intend to \ndevote time on the Senate floor to remember each of these heroes. \nTelling their stories keeps their service and their sacrifice alive in \nour hearts, while reminding us of the principles they fought and died \nfor.\n  Time after time, Nebraska's Gold Star families tell me the same \nthing. They hope and pray that the supreme sacrifices of their loved \nones will always be remembered. It is my hope that these presentations \nwill allow us to pause and reflect on these brave Nebraskans. The \nfreedoms they secured are personified by the courage they embody.\n\n\n                       Specialist Joshua A. Ford\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to begin with SPC Josh Ford from Pender, \nNE. Joshua A. Ford was killed in Iraq on July 31, 2006. His parents, \nrelatives, and high school classmates look back lovingly on the boy who \nquickly grew to be a courageous soldier.\n  As a young teenager, Josh was described as a couch potato who liked \nvideo games, painting, and watching horror movies, but deep inside \nthere grew a strong desire to serve his country in military uniform.\n  He joined the Nebraska Army National Guard between his junior and \nsenior year at Pender High School in\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\n2003. That same year he began basic training at Fort Jackson. He was \njust 17 years old, and it was a tough transition.\n  His dad Lonnie remembers Josh talking about being placed in ``fat \nman's camp'' at Fort Jackson. Josh was overweight by 35 pounds at the \ntime. Lonnie and his wife Linda, along with classmates and friends, \nnoticed how dramatically Josh had changed when he returned from basic \ntraining.\n  A year later, after graduating from Pender High School, Josh attended \nthe Army's heavy vehicle driver school at Fort Leonard Wood. He was \nassigned to the 189th Transportation Company, Detachment No. 1, in \nWayne, NE.\n  A senior sergeant remembers that Josh ``grew up from a kid to a \nsoldier almost overnight.''\n  The 189th had just been recognized as a unit in April of 2003. Two \nyears later, the 189th received orders to deploy to Iraq.\n  Following training at Fort Riley, the unit arrived at Tallil, Iraq, \nin October of 2005. For the next year they traveled over 2.5 million \nmiles throughout the country. Specialist Ford became known as an \nenergetic and reliable battle buddy. He was eager to tackle extra \nmissions.\n  Josh came home on leave in April of 2006. He had a number of things \non his mind. At the top of his list was his girlfriend Michelle, whom \nhe proposed to that spring, and she happily accepted. He also kept \nthings in order, leaving behind an audio will for his friends. \nAccording to Josh's father Lonnie, ``he just wanted everyone to \ncelebrate his life after he was gone.''\n  Josh returned to Iraq with just 6 months to go in the deployment. In \nthe early evening of July 31, 2006, the heat was unbearable but typical \nfor a summer day in Iraq. Specialist Ford and his battle buddy, SPC Ben \nMarksmeier, were part of a 189th convoy that was driving through an \narea they had patrolled many times. Out of nowhere, an IED blast \nobliterated their vehicle. Unit members reached their truck \nimmediately. Specialist Marksmeier was seriously injured, but \nSpecialist Ford died at the scene.\n  Lonnie, Josh's dad, will never forget the day he heard the knock at \nthe door. Three members of the Nebraska Army National Guard had arrived \nat his home in Pender, and he knew before he opened the door why they \nhad come. The next day, Lonnie and his wife Linda traveled over 250 \nmiles to tell Josh's grandmother and his three sisters of his death. \nOne can only imagine the pain, sorrow, and agony they felt every step \nof the way.\n  SPC Josh Ford was buried in Pender, NE, on August 10, 2006. Pictures \nshow the road from the church to the cemetery lined with people as the \nPatriot Guard veteran motorcycle group escorted Josh to his final \nresting place.\n  For his service to his country, SPC Josh Ford earned the Bronze Star, \nthe Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Badge. He was promoted \nposthumously to the rank of sergeant.\n  His father Lonnie later retired from teaching, and he joined the \nPatriot Guard. Today, Lonnie ensures those who served and died are \nnever forgotten. He attends funerals and events with his fellow Patriot \nGuard riders all across Nebraska. Josh's photo and his service \ninformation are proudly displayed on his rider's vest.\n  He recalls Josh saying to him, when he was home on leave in April \nbefore his death:\n\n       Old man, I now understand why you were so tough on me while \n     I was growing up. You only wanted me to become the best \n     person I could possibly be.\n\n  During his limited time on Earth, Josh did just that.\n  Our Nation and all Nebraskans are forever indebted to his service and \nsacrifice. SGT Josh Ford was a hero, and I am honored to tell his story \nlest we forget his life and the freedom he fought to defend.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Remembering the Crewmembers of the Space Shuttle ``Challenger''\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, 30 years ago today millions of Americans \ngathered around their television sets in homes and classrooms all \nacross the country to watch the Space Shuttle Challenger launch toward \nthe stars. Seventy-three seconds later everything changed. We stared at \nour television sets, stunned and brokenhearted.\n  Today, on the 30th anniversary of that terrible tragedy, we remember \nthe heros we lost: Francis Scobee, Michael Smith, Ronald McNair, \nEllison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Gregory Jarvis; and we remember one \nmore hero, the special person that so many little boys and girls tuned \nin that day to see, the very first U.S. civilian in space, Christa \nCorrigan McAuliffe.\n  Christa was born in Boston, MA, and grew up in nearby Framingham. She \nattended Marian High School and attended Framingham State University. \nShe married her high school sweetheart, Steve. They had two children, \nScott and Caroline. She eventually became a high school social studies \nteacher in Concord, NH.\n  In 1984, Ronald Reagan announced that NASA would send its first \nprivate citizen into space, and that person would be a teacher. A few \nmonths later, Christa beat out over 11,000 other applicants to become \nthe first teacher in space. Christa was thrilled. It was like a dream \ncome true. She reportedly told Johnny Carson: ``If you're offered a \nseat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. Just get on.''\n  Mr. President, 30 years ago today Senator Ted Kennedy entered an \nexcerpt of Christa McAuliffe's NASA application into the public record, \nand I would like to reenter it for the Record and read it again today.\n  When asked why she wanted to be the first private citizen in space, \nChrista McAuliffe wrote:\n\n       I remember the excitement in my home when the first \n     satellites were launched. My parents were amazed and I was \n     caught up in their wonder. In school my classes would gather \n     around the TV and try to follow the rocket as it seemed to \n     jump all over the screen. I remember when Alan Shepard made \n     his historic flight--not even an orbit--and I was thrilled. \n     John Kennedy inspired me with his words about placing a man \n     on the moon and I still remember a cloudy, rainy night \n     driving through Pennsylvania and hearing the news that the \n     astronauts had landed safely.\n       As a woman, I have been envious of those men who could \n     participate in the space program and who were encouraged to \n     excel in areas of math and science. I felt that women had \n     indeed been left outside of one of the most exciting careers \n     available. When Sally Ride and other women began to train as \n     astronauts, I could look among my students and see ahead of \n     them an ever-increasing list of opportunities.\n       I cannot join the space program and restart my life as an \n     astronaut, but this opportunity to connect my abilities as an \n     educator with my interests in history and space is a unique \n     opportunity to fulfill my early fantasies. I watched the \n     space age being born and I would like to participate.\n\n  Mr. President, Christa McAuliffe never made it into orbit on January \n28, 1986. She never got the chance to write in her journal about what \nit was like inside the space shuttle, how it feels to float around, and \nall the other sorts of things that people who are not astronauts have \nwondered about. She never got to go back to her classroom to tell her \nchildren about her magnificent journey.\n  But Christa McAuliffe still teaches. Since 1994, the Christa \nMcAuliffe Center at Framingham State University has provided truly \nremarkable, innovative, integrated STEM education resources to 12,000 \nMassachusetts students each year. Christa McAuliffe's story of a little \ngirl from Framingham who became a schoolteacher and got the chance to \ntake the ``ultimate field trip'' into outer space keeps inspiring \nlittle boys and girls in Massachusetts and around the country, telling \nthem all to reach for the stars.\n  Today, we remember Christa McAuliffe and the six others we lost on \nthe Space Shuttle Challenger. We remember that day as our country \nstared at our television sets, stunned and brokenhearted. We honor \ntheir memory by continuing, as Christa McAuliffe said, ``to touch the \nfuture,'' to teach our children and our grandchildren ``where we have \nbeen, where we are going, [and] why.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nStabenow-Peters amendment package that\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nwill provide much needed assistance to Flint, MI. For decades Flint was \nknown as the birthplace of General Motors and for playing a key role in \nthe formation of the United Auto Workers.\n  Now national attention is trained on Flint not for its role in the \ncreation of America's middle class but for the utter abandonment by the \nState government of a city where 40 percent of the population lives \nbelow the poverty line.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, an unelected emergency manager appointed by \nMichigan's Governor changed the city of Flint's water source to the \nFlint River in an attempt to save money while the city prepared to \ntransition to a new regional water authority. The ultimate cost of this \nmisguided, dangerous decision will not be known for decades.\n  After switching away from clean water sourced from the Detroit Water \nAuthority, Flint residents began to receive improperly treated Flint \nRiver water, long known to be contaminated and potentially very \ncorrosive. Water poured from Flint faucets and tasted and smelled \nterrible. It was discolored--brown or yellow in many cases. In fact, \nGeneral Motors stopped using this water source for their Flint engine \noperations because the high chloride levels were corroding parts used \nduring the manufacturing process.\n  The result of the State government decision was--and continues to \nbe--catastrophic. Flint families were exposed to lead and other toxins \nthat will have a lasting effect for generations.\n  The water crisis in Flint is an immense failure on the part of \nMichigan's State government to ensure the health and safety of the \npeople of Flint and to provide the basic human right of clean water for \ndrinking, bathing, and cooking. It is a failure that will cause Flint's \nchildren to suffer from the adverse health effects of lead exposure for \nyears to come--a failure that has created the enormous challenge of \nfixing a water system that has had corrosive water flowing through its \npipes for months.\n  Even after Flint has transitioned back to distributing water from \nDetroit that should be safe, unfortunately the potentially irreversible \ndamage to the waterlines will still require the use of filters. This \nongoing crisis has left the city of 100,000 people drinking bottled \nwater donated from across the Nation.\n  In light of the State government's failure, I am disappointed State \ngovernment still has not sufficiently stepped up to provide the \nnecessary resources to deal with the short and long term effects of \nwater contamination in Flint.\n  While the cause of this crisis and the ultimate responsibility to fix \nit lies with State government, we need to bring resources from all \nlevels of government to bear to address this unprecedented emergency. \nAlong with my Michigan colleagues Senator Stabenow and Representative \nKildee, I have been working tirelessly to leverage all available \nresources for the people of Flint.\n  The effects of lead exposure on children are insidious, causing long-\nterm developmental problems, nervous system damage, and decreased bone \nand muscle growth. There is no cure, but we can mitigate these problems \nwith a commitment to delivering nutrition, education, health care, and \nother wrap-around services that a generation of Flint children now need \nmore than ever.\n  My colleagues and I have requested that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture allow existing programs to provide ready-to-feed infant \nformula that does not need to be mixed with water to all infants in \nFlint. We have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to \nmake Head Start available for every eligible child in the city of \nFlint. We are working to make sure every Flint resident has access to \naffordable health care and are encouraging residents to purchase \ncoverage through the open enrollment at healthcare.gov before the \nJanuary 31 deadline or sign up for Medicaid if they are eligible.\n  I will continue to work with Congress, the administration, and \nleaders on the ground in Flint to secure any Federal support possible \nfor Flint families and small businesses that have been harmed. As part \nof our efforts to support the people of Flint, Senator Stabenow and I \nare offering an amendment that will help begin the process to make \nFlint whole with substantial investments in fixing this problem in both \nthe short and long term. Our amendment will assist the city of Flint in \nfour ways.\n  First, the amendment would include my bill, the Improving \nNotification for Clean and Safe Drinking Water Act, or the INCASE Act, \nwhich would require the EPA to directly notify the public of \ndangerously high lead levels in drinking water if the local and State \ngovernments fail to do so within 15 days. The EPA repeatedly made \nrecommendations to the State government, urging them to take steps to \nimprove the water and protect the people. Unfortunately, the State of \nMichigan failed to take action and failed to properly notify Flint \nresidents of the health risks in the water system for months. The \nprimary responsibility for notifying residents lies with the State \ngovernment, but when you have a situation like Flint where the State \nwas sitting on critical information, there has to be another level of \naccountability.\n  Second, our amendment will authorize EPA to issue direct grants to \nthe State of Michigan and the city of Flint to hire new personnel, \nprovide technical assistance, and, most importantly, replace and repair \nwater service lines--the only long-term solution. These aging service \nlines were certainly a concern before the crisis, but now there is an \nurgent need to repair and to replace them. For nearly 2 years corrosive \nwater flowed through the pipes leaching lead and other toxins. This \nprovision will fund the repairs for the service lines that were \nseverely and potentially permanently damaged as a result.\n  Third, our amendment includes a technical fix that will allow current \nDrinking Water State Revolving Funds to be used for loan forgiveness. \nThis will provide upwards of $20 million in relief to Flint and allow \nthem to direct new funds for investment in water infrastructure and not \ninterest payments. Earlier this year the EPA acknowledged that the \nState did not have the authority to forgive these loans. That is why \nthis amendment includes a temporary technical fix to allow States to \nuse the EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund resources for loan \nforgiveness and debt relief on debt incurred before the current fiscal \nyear.\n  Finally, our amendment will direct the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services to establish a Center Of Excellence on lead exposure in \nFlint, which will bring together local universities, hospitals, medical \nprofessionals, and the State and county public health departments in an \neffort to address the short and long-term health effects of lead \nexposure in the city.\n  Mr. President, it is important to remember that the children of Flint \nhave been impacted the most by this crisis through no fault of their \nown. Whether in Flint or elsewhere in America, we have a responsibility \nto care for our children. We must repair the trust Flint residents have \nlost in the ability of government officials to protect them and to \nprovide the most basic services.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in our effort to help Flint \nrecover from this unnecessary manmade disaster. Standing up for \nchildren is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. I hope we all come \ntogether. This is common ground on which we can stand together and \nstand up for the people and the children of Flint.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a \nbipartisan amendment I have submitted with the senior Senator from \nCalifornia. It would enable Arizona, California, and other drought-\nstricken States to store more water in hydroelectric dams.\n  As everyone knows, water is a controversial issue in the West. \nArizona and California have long been at odds on a number of water-\nrelated issues, particularly the very long-running Supreme Court case \non the Colorado River. However, recognizing the importance of wisely \nmanaging water in the West is something on which we can all agree and \nlook for ways to cooperate.\n  Today I am pleased to submit, along with Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, one of these helpful management provisions to better use \nexisting dams in our drought-stricken States. These dams\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nare critical to water management in the West. We have to store water, \nobviously, in dry times. The Western United States relies on dams to \nproduce clean, renewable hydropower, to deliver drinking water to \ngrowing cities, and to irrigate fields. Because these dams are large \nand expensive and increasingly difficult to have built, it is \nimperative that we make the most of those we have already.\n  In a bill introduced last year, Senator Feinstein included a pilot \nprogram to allow the updating of how flood control operations are \nconducted at many dams. This very helpful provision allows the use of \nmodern forecasting tools and better records of hydrology to reevaluate \nthe flood control operations in order to create additional water \nstorage space. Increased storage space would allow more water to be \nkept behind the dams, allowing more hydropower to be produced exactly \nwhen it is needed. This amendment simply expands on Senator Feinstein's \nproposal broadening the scope to all drought-stricken States--not just \nCalifornia--increasing the number of projects in the pilot program, and \nallowing more types of facilities to opt into this pilot program.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. It will help us make the most of the \ncapacity we have to store water and to produce hydropower. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                S. 2452\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, there are a lot of things that go on here \nin our Nation's capital, Washington, DC, that don't make sense to me. \nOne of those things occurred about 10 days ago when the Obama \nadministration announced it would pay $1.7 billion to Iran in \nsettlement of a financial dispute dating back to the days of the Shah \nof Iran. That $1.7 billion was a payment to Iran for $400 million that \nwas held in escrow after the Shah's demise and fall from power, and the \nremaining $1.3 billion was to pay interest on that $400 million.\n  I think there are a number of reasons that this makes no sense. I \nwill highlight the one that seems to me to be the least controversial \nor at least makes the most sense. We have American citizens who have \nclaims against Iran. There are actual judgments entered by a court of \nlaw which determines that the country of Iran owes money to American \ncitizens. The number that I was told that they owe is nearly $10 \nbillion in judgments.\n  What makes no sense to me is that the Obama administration would \nagree to pay the Iranian Government $1.7 billion without concurrently \nresolving the issues of what Iran should pay U.S. citizens. It makes no \nsense to me that we are not withholding the payment of that $1.7 \nbillion until Iran pays American citizens the judgment amounts owed to \nthem for their country's terrorist attacks.\n  Why would we unilaterally pay Iran money that we may or may not owe \nthem without resolving the issue of money that we know Iran owes to \nU.S. citizens? This makes no sense. We could at least have a broader \nconversation and discussion about this issue, although I don't know \nthat it is necessary to go further with a discussion to reach the \nconclusion that the Obama administration should not be doing this. We \ncould also have a conversation about whether this payment of $1.7 \nbillion is ransom money. Was it paid because Americans were released \nfrom Iranian captivity on the same day? As the largest supporter and \nfunder of terrorism and terrorist activity around the globe, we should \nhave a discussion about whether we should be giving Iran any money at \nall.\n  We know that part of the Iranian agreement related to nuclear weapons \nhas the United States releasing money to Iran, and we know--in fact, \nadministration officials have admitted to it--that we expect that \nmoney, in part, to be used to sponsor additional terrorist acts. Well, \nin addition to the flawed, mistaken agreement with Iran related to \nnuclear capabilities, we are now providing Iran with another $1.7 \nbillion to use as they see fit, presumably with the admitted ability to \nuse that money to further terrorist acts around the globe, including \nagainst U.S. citizens.\n  We could discuss whether this is ransom or whether we should be \ngiving any money to Iran. But on the surface, you don't need to go \nfurther than, in my view, what ought to be easily agreed upon, which is \nthat no money should go to Iran until the claims of American citizens \nare paid by Iran.\n  I am on the Senate floor to highlight to my colleagues that I have \nintroduced legislation exactly to that effect: no money to Iran until \nthe claims are paid to U.S. citizens by Iran. I encourage my colleagues \nto consider this legislation and join me in its sponsorship. It is S. \n2452.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to bring this issue to the \nattention of the Senate--one more instance of something that makes no \nsense to me that could be resolved with a firm statement by the U.S. \nCongress: Mr. President, you can't pay Iran until Iran meets its \nobligations to pay what it owes U.S. citizens.\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unaccompanied Minors Entering the United States\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if this sounds like a case of deja vu, it \nis because we have been here before. I am talking specifically about \nthe flow of unaccompanied minor children coming across our southwestern \nborder, primarily through my State--the State of Texas--which shares a \n1,200-mile common border with Mexico.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, these children are coming not from \nMexico but from Central America. This is a situation that about a year \nor so ago the President and his administration called a humanitarian \ncrisis because we had this flow of unaccompanied children and some with \ntheir mothers, but mostly without, who came flooding across our border, \nand we were just simply struggling to keep up with them to deal with \ntheir safety, their health needs, and their security needs.\n  At that time we had a discussion about what we should do to protect \nthese children to make sure they weren't victimized by human \ntraffickers and other predators who might prey on their vulnerability \nwhen they get to the United States. Indeed, this morning, under the \nleadership of Chairman Portman from Ohio, the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations held a hearing to explore a disturbing \nand tragic problem related to this flow of unaccompanied children \ncoming across our Nation's southern border.\n  After these children are apprehended by the Border Patrol, they are \nplaced in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services to \nensure they receive proper care. Many of these children are recovering \nfrom abuse, exploitation, exhaustion, exposure from this incredible \ntrip they would make from their country in Central America through \nMexico into the United States, many on the back of a train system known \ncolloquially as The Beast. Many of us have seen pictures of this train \nwith people on top of it, not necessarily inside of it, and falling \noff, being injured, people being assaulted. It is a terrible \nexperience.\n  So many of these children come to the United States recovering from \nabuse and exploitation after traveling more than 1,000 miles. This is a \nvery important point: These are not good people who are bringing them \nhere. They are part of a transnational criminal organization--the \ncartels in Mexico, the gangs who help distribute drugs, traffic in \nhuman beings, help facilitate illegal immigration. This has become a \nhuge international business. If you ask almost anybody who has had any \nexperience in this area, it is not like the old days when coyotes, as \nwe call them in Texas and elsewhere, smuggled people across in onesies \nand twosies. These are people who smuggle a lot of people for the money \nthey are able to generate. They, frankly, don't care about the \nindividuals, but they do care about the money, and that is why they are \nin the business of smuggling these children from Central America across \nMexico and into the United States.\n  Here is the immediate problem that Senator Portman's Subcommittee on \nInvestigations revealed: Because the U.S. Government--the Department of \nHealth and Human Services--does not adequately vet the sponsors with \nwhom these children are placed once they come into the United States--\nwe know, for example, they admit these sponsors do not have to be \nAmerican citizens. They don't even have to be family members. \nShockingly, Health and Human Services is releasing many of these \nchildren to sponsors who have been convicted of serious crimes, \nincluding human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and violent offenses.\n  Instead of using commonsense procedures as we see in place, for \nexample, in international adoptions, including extensive background \nchecks, thorough interviews, and multiple home visits to make sure a \nchild is being placed in a safe and secure situation, the placement \nprocess for these migrant children is riddled with loopholes for those \nwho want to exploit it, and unfortunately there are evil people who \nwant to exploit it and take advantage of these innocent children.\n  Some who may not have been following this issue may wonder: Why are \nwe taking these children who are illegally entering the country and \nactually placing them with nonfamily member sponsors who haven't been \nvetted? The problem is that under current law, the Border Patrol cannot \nturn back people who enter the country illegally from noncontiguous \ncountries. We can from Mexico, we can from Canada, but we can't if they \ncome from a Central American country. So that is why they have to \nprocess them and get a placement for them as they issue a summons to \nthem and say: You have a court date in front of an immigration judge in \n3 months or 6 months or a year that is going to determine whether you \nhave a legal basis upon which to stay in the United States.\n  Lo and behold, this should come as a surprise to no one. The vast \nmajority of these people who illegally enter the country in this way \nnever show up for their immigration hearing in front of a judge to \ndetermine whether they have a legal basis to stay. Indeed, because the \nObama administration and ICE--Immigration and Customs Enforcement that \nis responsible for enforcing our immigration laws--because they simply \nhave quit enforcing our laws once people enter the country, unless of \ncourse you have been arrested for some serious crime, this is actually \na way to thread the needle and to beat the system and to succeed in \nillegally staying--immigrating and then staying in the United States.\n  Here again today I wish to focus on once these children are here, and \nI would think every person with a heart would want to say: Well, we \nhave a responsibility to take care of them, at least until we can \nreturn them back home.\n  So I am grateful to the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, for \ndedicating his time and energy into investigating such an important \nissue. I commend him for his leadership in doing so in a bipartisan \nway. I think most of us can agree with the main point that he raised \nthis morning, which is that the administration has a duty to ensure the \nsafety of these children once they are in the country. I would hope all \npeople of good will would agree, whether they have a legal duty or not, \nthey have a moral obligation to make sure these children are safe and \nnot place them, because of negligence or inadvertence or just \nrecklessness, in the hands of people who will exploit them and abuse \nthem.\n  The subcommittee also released an important report in conjunction \nwith this morning's hearing after a months-long investigation. The \nreport confirms that HHS placement policies are--surprise--wholly \ninsufficient and fail to adequately screen sponsors. They know they \nhave a problem. They just don't have the will to do anything about it.\n  This is unacceptable. This is unacceptable that Health and Human \nServices knows its own placement process does not even come close to \nfoster care or international adoption standards. For the safety and \nprotection of these children, the status quo cannot continue.\n  I hope somebody will ask the President of the United States about \nthis, because when we tried to pass a piece of legislation called the \nHUMANE Act to deal explicitly with this issue to raise the screening \nstandards for sponsors here in the United States for these \nunaccompanied children, the administration and the President of the \nUnited States opposed it, and this is what they get. This is what they \nget--certainly not what they deserve. This is something anybody could \nhave predicted and indeed did predict at the time if we did nothing to \naddress it.\n  So what these children need now, as Senator Portman's report \nsuggests, is certainly a more transparent process with robust \noversight. That sounds kind of bureaucratic, but what we need is \nsomebody who can make sure that no child is placed with somebody who is \ngoing to abuse them, exploit them or make their life a living hell \nwhile they are here. We also need to make sure they are given an \nopportunity to appear in front of an immigration judge because maybe \nthey have some legal\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nbasis upon which to claim a right to stay in the United States under \ncurrent law--but maybe not--and maybe the proper recourse is for these \nchildren to be returned to their home country. We have had this \nexperience before, where there is no enforcement of our immigration \nlaws when people know they can penetrate our border and come here and \nsuccessfully stay, even though they don't comply with the law. Our laws \nlose all deterrent value; in other words, where there is deterrence, \npeople don't come in the first place because they realize the \nlikelihood is that they will be unsuccessful. That is an important goal \nof law enforcement. It is not necessarily to deal with every case once \nit is on our doorstep, but actually we want to deter people from \nbreaking the law in the first place. That is why enforcement is so \nimportant.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor and express my appreciation to \nSenator Portman and his subcommittee for highlighting this issue but \neven more importantly to make sure that somehow, some way, somebody in \nthe press, in the media is going to keep writing about this and \nexposing the facts. I hope we can reawaken the conscience of the \nCongress and the U.S. Government and say that this is simply \nunacceptable and we can work together to address it.\n  We must do more to protect these children who are vulnerable to \nexploitation. Back in November I joined the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security and Health \nand Human Services. This was in response to a whistleblower who \nindicated those Departments were releasing unaccompanied children to \ncriminal sponsors, many with ties to sex trafficking and human \nsmuggling enterprises.\n  Unfortunately, recent news reports have just reinforced how broken \nthe system is. Earlier this week, the Washington Post published an \nindepth account of several young Guatemalan children who were smuggled \nto a farm in Ohio to be used as slave labor after authorities released \nthem from human traffickers. So these children from Guatemala went from \nbeing trafficked to being basically indentured servants for slave labor \nin Ohio. Instead of keeping them in protective custody in an HHS \nshelter or placing them in a suitable safe environment, these children \nwere reportedly forced to live in roach-infested trailers and their \nlives were threatened if they attempted to escape.\n\n  This is a gut-wrenching story, but it is only one story. This Senator \ndares to say that the U.S. Government, Health and Human Services, and \nthe Obama administration can't tell us how many other children have \nbeen exposed to such terrible abuse and mistreatment. We are now \nlearning that these stories are not uncommon. Of course, given the \nprocess by which Health and Human Services and the administration place \nthese children--not with American citizens, not with even family \nmembers without vetting them--what else would be expected?\n  The Associated Press recently reported similar stories from across \nthe country, including accounts of teens forced to work around the \nclock just to stay in a safe place to live. One young girl was \nreportedly locked inside her house, basically kept in a prison, and \nthere are reports of some unaccompanied children who had been sexually \nassaulted by their sponsors.\n  With more than 95,000 unaccompanied children crossing our southern \nborder illegally over the last 2 years, these reports likely only \nscratch the surface of the horrors these children are enduring. And it \nis not over. There are more coming every day. Indeed, we have seen that \nthe peaks and valleys of the flow of unaccompanied children across the \nborder are seasonal. As we get out of the winter and into the warmer \nmonths, we will continue to see these children flow across at higher \nlevels than they are now. But there were 95,000 in the past 2 years.\n  This surge of children coming across our border has exposed our \nNation's vulnerability to human smugglers and these transnational \ncriminal organizations. It has shown that inadequate border security \ncan contribute to a humanitarian crisis that endangers the lives of the \nchildren who are turned over by their parents to dangerous predators \nand smuggled into the United States.\n  Let's be clear on this point. Once these children arrive in the \nUnited States, our government has a duty to protect them and ensure \nthey are no longer preyed upon by criminals and traffickers. But then \nwe have a responsibility to make sure that if they can't legally stay \nin the United States because they have no valid claim to asylum or \nrefugee status--our laws need to be enforced until those laws are \nchanged by Congress.\n  The United States could see a new surge of these children pouring \nacross our southern border in the coming months. In fact, I will \npredict here today that we will. We know from historical trends that \nthese types of surges are not likely until the spring or summer months. \nWe shouldn't just stand around here or sit on our hands and ignore this \ngrowing crisis.\n  There is a legislative response that I would recommend to my \ncolleagues. I was proud to sponsor a piece of legislation last Congress \ncalled the Helping Unaccompanied Alien Minors and Alleviating National \nEmergency Act, or the HUMANE Act in short. This legislation would \nrequire all potential sponsors of unaccompanied children to undergo a \nrigorous biometric criminal history check. Let's check to make sure the \ngovernment is not placing these kids with known criminals. There are \nrecords we could easily discover if we just bothered to check those \nrecords and to make sure we don't inadvertently place these children in \nthe hands of sex offenders or people who will merely traffic them to \nsomeone else.\n  Given the clear threat these children face and the anecdotes which I \nhave described here and which are described in horrific fashion in \nSenator Portman's report, it is irresponsible for us not to do \nsomething about this while we can. There is more we can do and should \ndo to ensure that these children are treated safely and securely while \nthey are with us. I believe the provisions of my legislation would be a \ngood start. If anybody has a better idea, I am certainly willing to \nhear and work with them.\n  Before we see another humanitarian crisis of huge proportion of young \nchildren coming across our borders, I hope the Senate will take a look \nat the concerns exposed in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nreport led by Senator Portman.\n  I look forward to reintroducing the HUMANE Act soon as a way to at \nleast in part begin the process of addressing this new humanitarian \ncrisis in the making.\n  Mr. President, I see no one wishing to speak, so I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, this morning I discussed two amendments \nthat I have submitted in regard to the current energy legislation, the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act of 2015.\n  I would like to talk about a third amendment that I submitted as \nwell. The amendment actually follows legislation that I introduced \nearlier entitled the ``empower States amendment.''\n  Essentially what the ``empower States'' legislation does is it \nensures that States retain the right to manage oil and gas production \nin their respective State. It gives them the ability to develop \nhydraulic fracturing rules and to respond first to any violation that \nmight occur, rather than having a Federal one-size-fits-all approach. \nThis is very important, because how we produce oil and gas in States \nsuch as North Dakota is very different than how we might produce oil \nand gas in a State like Louisiana, for example, or some other State. So \nStates have to have the flexibility to respond to their industry to \nprovide regulatory certainty and to empower that investment that will \nhelp us produce more energy and do it with good environmental \nstewardship.\n  This amendment also allows States to regulate oil and gas development \non Bureau of Land Management lands if the State has laws and \nregulations in place to protect both public health and the environment.\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\n  As I said, it takes a States-first approach because individual States \nare the first and best responders to oil and gas issues. They know \ntheir land, their geology, their water resources, and they have a \nprimary stake in protecting their environment and their citizens.\n  States such as North Dakota have been successful in developing oil \nand gas production with good environmental stewardship. Right now our \nState produces about 1.2 million barrels of oil a day, second only to \nthe State of Texas.\n  With that growth in development, our industry has had to work very \nclosely with the State of North Dakota on a whole gamut of issues that \nare vitally important--not only, as I said a minute ago, in terms of \nproducing more energy but doing it with good environmental stewardship. \nSo that is what this legislation is all about.\n  At the same time, this amendment provides a safety net that allows \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, to step in if there is \na danger to health or the environment. Again, it is about making sure \nthat States have the primary role, but it still recognizes the EPA's \nrole as well in terms of protecting the environment and good \nstewardship.\n  States would still be subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act and the \nClean Water Act. These Federal laws have minimum standards for all \nStates, and those minimum standards ensure consistent protection \nbetween and among the States for both the public and the environment.\n  Surface water is protected under the EPA's Clean Water Act surface \nwater quality standards. Drinking water is protected by the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, which allows the EPA to act if a contaminant is \npresent or likely will enter an underground drinking water source.\n  Hydraulic fracturing wastewater is regulated by the EPA's underground \ninjection program, which is designated to the States to implement and \nenforce. That is what we are talking about, again--the State having the \nprimary role in regulation of hydraulic fracturing.\n  The EPA requires a State to have a minimum requirement in terms of \nprotecting underground injection from endangering drinking water \nsources. This concludes inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and \nreporting requirements. None of those requirements would change under \nthis amendment.\n  Instead, this amendment gives the States and tribes more certainty \nabout under what circumstances the EPA may withdraw or amend a State's \nregulation. Again, it is about making sure we have the regulatory \ncertainty out there that actually empowers the very investment that \nhelps us produce more energy and do it with good environmental \nstewardship. It ensures that if the EPA does decide to intervene, it \nmust show that its action is necessary and that the decision takes into \naccount factors such as job loss and energy supplies.\n  It will help States retain the right to regulate hydraulic fracturing \nwithin their borders. That makes sense, as I say, because States are \nthe first and best responders to oil and gas issues and have been \nsuccessful in developing oil and gas production regulations.\n  It would also allow a State to regulate hydraulic fracturing on \nFederal lands, such as BLM lands, as I mentioned earlier. In addition, \nthough, the amendment would prohibit new burdensome Federal rules if a \nState or tribe already has those rules in place.\n  Again, the effort here is to make sure that we are empowering States \nto work with their industry and then, in turn, empowering those \nindustries, through regulatory certainty, to help develop our energy \nfuture in this country and do it with good, consistent, commonsense \nregulation that empowers the kind of investment that we want to see for \njob creation and economic growth.\n  Finally, the amendment allows for judicial review. It allows a State \nor tribe to seek redress for an agency's actions in a Federal court \nlocated within the State or the District of Columbia. Judicial review \nis very important in case there is a dispute in terms of what the EPA \nmay require, what the State may require or what the industry feels is \nfair treatment.\n  In conclusion, the legislation recognizes that States have a long \nrecord of effectively regulating oil and gas development, including \nhydraulic fracturing, with good environmental stewardship. The measure \nworks to ensure that the rules for hydraulic fracturing are certain, \nfair, effective, and environmentally sound. These are qualities we \nexpect in good regulation.\n  As I said at the outset this morning in introducing a number of these \namendments, to build the kind of energy plan for the future that we \nneed we have to reduce the regulatory burden and at the same time \nempower the investment that will help us build the energy \ninfrastructure we need to move energy safely and cost-effectively from \nwhere it is produced to where it is consumed in this country.\n  With that, I look forward to working with both the chairman of our \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, who is bringing this \nlegislation forward, and the ranking member in offering these \namendments, voting on these and other amendments, and trying to get to \nthe best product we can in terms of strengthening the energy plan for \nthis country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Susan Jordan\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come here during a sad time for Hoosiers. \nThe beloved principal of Amy Beverland Elementary School in Lawrence \nTownship, in the Indianapolis area, was seeing her students off after a \nday of school. A bus came around the corner to pick up the kids and \naccidentally lost control. The principal of Amy Beverland Elementary \nSchool, Susan Jordan, saw the bus coming, saw that it was going to hit \nthe students, and put herself in front of them, and saved the lives of \nher young students. Two were injured seriously but will recover, but \nPrincipal Susan Jordan lost her life in doing this. The situation is \nstill under investigation, but all elements and indications point to \nthis as simply a tragic accident.\n  This story is not just one of tragedy, it is also one of heroism. As \nI said before, the bus struck her as Principal Jordan pushed several of \nher students out of harm's way. The principal, who came out of her \noffice at school every day to help the students safely board the buses, \nlost her life in doing so. Those who knew her well--said that was not a \nsurprising act. ``It didn't surprise any of us Susan would sacrifice \nherself,'' said the district administrator for Lawrence Township. Shawn \nSmith, superintendent of the Lawrence Township schools, called \nPrincipal Jordan ``a legend'' and said that ``we lost a great \neducator.''\n  Susan Jordan served as principal of the school for 22 years. She was \nknown for her cheery disposition and welcomed each classroom every \nmorning.\n  The Gospel of John tells us that ``greater love has no one than this: \nto lay down one's life for one's friends.'' The love that Susan Jordan \nhad for her students should be an inspiration to us all.\n  We offer our deepest condolences to Principal Jordan's family and \nfriends, to the students who were injured and their parents, and to all \nparents and students of the school. I know I join with all Hoosiers in \nmourning her loss and celebrating the life and impact of this talented, \ncompassionate educator who paid the ultimate price for the students she \nloved so dearly.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to address something I have been doing on a \nweekly basis called ``Waste of the Week.'' This is No. 31 of my visits \ndown here to the floor to talk about the egregious waste, fraud, and \nabuse in spending by the Federal Government.\n  We hear so often that we just can't cut another penny, we just can't \ncut another dime out of this program because they have been subject to \nfreezes or they have been subject to sequester, and, besides, we don't \nhave the money to pay for it. Well, I have been highlighting small \nsteps--because we haven't been able to achieve the big steps--small \nsteps of ways that we can save taxpayer money and address Federal \nspending. So I have come down\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\nevery week, and put up the board ``Waste of the Week,'' and this week \ndeals with a situation, once again, where we don't need to be in a \nposition to spend taxpayers' dollars on what was already being done.\n  The Amtrak Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration \nparticipate in a joint task force that works to interdict passengers \nwho are trafficking contraband on Amtrak trains. Amtrak information is \navailable to the Drug Enforcement Agency at no cost from the Amtrak \nPolice Department--two agencies that are working together. But despite \nthis agreement, the DEA wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer \ndollars paying just two Amtrak employees to do exactly what this task \nforce was formed to do. So we have a task force of paid employees who \nare there for a specific purpose--providing information to DEA. The DEA \nsays this is important information, but the task force also uses \ninformants. These are people who work for Amtrak on the trains, and \nsome of the information they provide is valuable.\n  According to an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector \ngeneral, the DEA paid two Amtrak employees a total of--are you ready \nfor this? Are you sitting down? Two paid Amtrak employees are getting a \nsalary, they work for Amtrak, The DEA paid them a total of $864,161 for \ninformation they have been providing to Amtrak and then giving to the \nDEA. The information probably was important, but over a period of 20 \nyears, these payments went out to just two employees, this $864,000-\nplus.\n  The IG's investigation concluded that when DEA officials sought \napproval to register these Amtrak employees as informants in the DEA's \nConfidential Source Program, the required documents did not indicate \nthat these informants would be paid.\n  Let me stop for a minute and say that confidential sources are an \nimportant tool for our law enforcement agencies. Officials at the DEA \nactively use confidential informants to obtain information regarding \ndrug trafficking or investigations. Some DEA officials have said they \nconsider the information the confidential sources provide as the \n``bread and butter'' of the agency.\n  My point today is not to question the use of confidential sources but \nto point out that Federal agencies like the DEA don't need to pay for \ninformation they already have access to. This is a waste of taxpayer \ndollars and poor stewardship of limited resources that fall in the \ncategory of ``waste of the week.''\n  Twenty years of the DEA paying for information that they were already \nsupposed to receive at no cost without a second thought indicates a \nserious, systemic spending problem that spans multiple parties and \nPresidents. We must pull the plug on this type of waste. So today I add \nan additional $864,161 to the taxpayer price tag for this already free \ninformation from Amtrak employees. We continue to add more, our gauge \ncontinues to rise, and we now are well over $130 billion of waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  So let no one come down to this floor and say we can't take a penny \naway from this program or come down to the floor and say we don't have \nthe money to pay for things that we ought to do or to return to the \ntaxpayer. I am trying to show that government can be run much more \nefficiently and effectively.\n  I applaud the inspectors general and others who are looking into this \nwaste, but I want to bring to my colleagues' attention the fact that we \nhave a lot of work to do, chipping away at this spending and waste and \nalso looking at long-term, major financial fixes to our ever-careening \nplunge into debt and deficit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \ndisplay for the Senate a model of the space shuttle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be granted \nas much time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Remembering the Crewmembers of the Space Shuttle ``Challenger'', the \n              Space Shuttle ``Columbia'', and ``Apollo 1''\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, 30 years ago today, it was very cold in \nFlorida at the Kennedy Space Center. Both pads had been readied for the \nfirst time--a space shuttle on 39A and 39B--since the Space Shuttle \nColumbia, which was the 24th flight, was so late getting off the \nground--indeed, for the better part of the month, from the first start \nand four scrubs starting December 19 but finally launching after the \nfifth try into a flawless 6-day mission on January 12, to return to \nEarth on January 18. In the meantime, on the other space shuttle launch \npad, Challenger--the 25th flight--is being readied.\n  The night before the day of the launch, which is 30 years ago today, \nit was exceptionally cold in Florida. It got down to 25 degrees. \nIndeed, there were actually icicles hanging on the launch tower. As the \ncrew arrived in the early morning hours--and there were holds all the \nway up until a little bit past 11 o'clock. At this point, the \ntemperature had improved to 36 degrees. The icicles were still there, \nbut it was above freezing. There was considerable consternation \nthroughout the entire apparatus of NASA and its contractors--\nparticularly the top managers, as well as the managers of the company \nthat made the solid rocket boosters--as to whether there should be a \nlaunch, and the go was given.\n  Seventy-three seconds high into the sky above Florida, Challenger \ndisintegrated. To a nation that had come to think that climbing in the \nspace shuttle was like getting in your car and taking a Sunday \nafternoon drive, indeed this was quite a shock because the entire \ntechnological prowess of the country 30 years ago was summed up in this \nmagnificent flying machine that would go to orbit and would come back \nand would take 45,000 pounds of payload to orbit and would come back \nand land like an airplane, albeit without an engine. But that morning, \nit was to be different.\n  The only other astronauts we had lost were in getting ready for the \nApollo program to go to the Moon. On the pad, in just a countdown test \nof the Apollo capsule--and the environment was an oxygen-rich \nenvironment. One of the three astronauts doing the practice countdown \nhappened to kick a part of the spacecraft that had a wire that set an \nignition, and in that oxygen-enriched environment, fire engulfed and \nclaimed the lives of Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chafee.\n  All those years when we did not even know what was going to happen \nwhen we went into space--when we launched John Glenn on that Atlas \nrocket that we knew had a 20-percent chance of failure--we didn't know \nenough about the human body in zero gravity and at those speeds to know \nwhat was going to happen to the human body. In all those years of \nexperimentation and going to the Moon many times--even on the ill-fated \nApollo 13 where we thought we had three dead men in the Apollo capsule \nwhen that explosion occurred en route to the Moon, and yet miraculously \nthis space industry and NASA apparatus came together and figured out \nreal-time how to get them back and get them back safely, a crew headed \nby Jim Lovell. But it was not to be on the morning of January 28, 1986.\n  I have a scale model of 1 to 100 of the space shuttle, and I want to \nexplain what happened that morning. As Challenger launched, it went \nthrough its sequence where they had to throttle back on the main \nengines as they went through part of the atmosphere getting maximum \ndynamic pressure, and then those famous words that came back from the \ncrew that they were acknowledging: Go at throttle up.\n  The three main engines ignited a burning in the tail of the space \nshuttle, fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen contained in the \nexternal fuel tank. They throttled up to 100 percent, and it was \nstraight up and accelerating.\n  Here is what happened at 73 seconds. The solid rocket boosters are \nattached by struts to the external tank, which does not hold their \nfuel. Their fuel is a\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nsolid fuel. It has the consistency of the eraser on this pencil. Those \nignite at T minus zero, each with about 3 million pounds of thrust. You \ndefinitely know you are going somewhere. But the cold weather had dealt \nus a devil's brew that day. These joints where they put together the \nsolid rocket booster are sealed with a rubberized gasket, and those \nrubber O-rings, because of the cold weather, had gotten stiff and \nbrittle to the point at which it just so happened that at a point close \nto the external tank, the hot gases of thrust, instead of coming out \nthe nozzle in the tail of the solid rocket booster, are coming out \nbecause the joint is not sealed because of that rubberized O-ring that \nhas now become stiff and brittle from the cold weather, and the hot \ngases burned into the external tank, and that caused the explosion that \nall of us remember. That was played over and over on our television \nscreens. That was what was such a shock to the American people.\n  Those seven souls--led by Dick Scobee as the mission commander, a \ntest pilot; and by Mike Smith, the pilot in NASA terminology, the \ncopilot, a test pilot; Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher from New \nHampshire; Greg Jarvis, a payload specialist; Judy Resnik, a mission \nspecialist; Ron McNair, a mission specialist; and Ellison Onizuka, a \nmission specialist--those seven souls perished as all of the explosion \nfell miles and miles down to the surface waters of the ocean and \neventually the debris on the floor of the ocean.\n  There is a dramatic presentation at the Kennedy Space Center in the \nAtlantis exhibit showing a part of the Challenger, and I would urge \nanybody who goes to the Kennedy Space Center to go and see that. It is \na very moving exhibit. It is an exhibit about the crew. That exhibit is \nnot only about the Challenger, which was 30 years ago, that exhibit is \nabout the next space shuttle that we lost. That was some 16, 17 years \nlater, and it was on February 1, 2003. It was the Space Shuttle \nColumbia, the one that had launched just previous to the Challenger and \nthe one on which this Senator was privileged to be a part of the crew, \nbut this time it was destroyed for a different reason. It had launched \na couple of weeks earlier and everything was fine, or so we thought, \nbut it was not to be. During the launch, the external fuel tank that \nwas carrying the very cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen--in order \nto keep that cold, it is surrounded with insulation--had part of its \ninsulation break off. It is about the size of an insulated Styrofoam \ntub. It is about this big, and that small piece of insulation broke off \nright here as Columbia was on ascent. As it accelerated and the speeds \nbecame very high, that piece of foam fell with high velocity right at \nthe leading edge of the left wing. That is a carbon-carbon fiber very \nlight in weight but very resistant to heat. Upon reentry, the front \nengines of the wing and the tip of the nose, all carbon-carbon fiber, \nget up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Of course everything was fine at \nthat moment, even though there was a hole in the left leading edge of \nthe wing during Columbia's 8\\1/2\\-minute ascent into orbit.\n\n  When it was time to go home on February 1, this crew of seven was \nabout to meet their fate. As they were doing their deorbit burn, \nfalling through space for half an hour and encountering the upper \nreaches of the atmosphere, the hot gases got in the leading edge of the \nwing--the orbiter had separated and was flying more like an airplane on \ndescent--and heated it up, causing Columbia to burn up upon reentry. As \na result, debris fell for miles and miles high over Texas.\n  Rick Husband, the commander; Willie McCool, the pilot; Mike Anderson, \npayload commander; David Brown, mission specialist; Kalpana Chawla, \nmission specialist; Laurel Clark, mission specialist; and Ilan Ramon, \npayload specialist. As the test pilot and hero of the Israeli Air Force \nthat led the strike on Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant outside of \nBaghdad, Ilan Ramon had been chosen to fly on the space shuttle.\n  I remember when I met with the former President of Israel, Shimon \nPeres, the day before the reentry. He knew of my background, and he \nsaid: I want you to see this telecommunication that I got from Ilan \nRamon. It said: Mr. President, on behalf of the Israeli people, I want \nto thank you for giving me this opportunity. The fact that you and then \nPresident Clinton have enabled me to be able to start in this astronaut \nprogram and fly in this mission is just incredible.\n  President Peres shared how that was so meaningful to him only a few \nhours before Columbia did its deorbit burn and went into the pages of \nhistory.\n  So it is with a heavy heart that I come to the Senate floor on the \n30th anniversary of the Challenger tragedy to pay tribute to the \nChallenger crew and also to the Columbia crew. It is solemn, but what \nthey and the Apollo 1 astronauts sacrificed--and what so many other \nastronauts in training have sacrificed through training mishaps--is not \nforgotten and it is not in vain because we are going to Mars.\n  It is not going to look like this because we learned our lesson. This \nwas a fantastic flying machine, but it was an inherently risky design \nbecause the crew in the orbiter is on the same side as the stack of \nexplosives, which resulted in two terrible tragedies that occurred. The \nnew American rockets that will fly in September of 2017--in less than 2 \nyears--to and from the International Space Station look like they have \ngone back to the old Apollo design, but, in fact, the new rockets have \nupdated crew compartments in the spacecraft that will sit on the top of \nthe rocket so that in the event of an explosion, even on the pad or all \nthe way into orbit, you can save the lives of the crew by detaching the \nexplosive rockets from the spacecraft and getting them safely away from \nthe explosion. It will save the crew either by landing under its own \npower or having parachutes that will let it down gently.\n  The fact is that by our nature we are explorers and adventurers, and \nwe never want to give that up. It is a part of our DNA, it is a part of \nour character, and it is a part of our vision. We used to go westward \nas we developed this country into that new frontier. Now we will \ncontinue to go upward. We are going to Mars in the 2030s, and that is \ngoing to be a great day in that decade.\n  You will see us build on that in 2 years. Americans will have \nlaunches on new spacecrafts which will be on the top of rockets and in \n3 years a full-up test of the largest rocket ever put together by \nmankind on the face of this planet, the space launch system and its \nspacecraft, Orion. It will have its first up test flight in 2018.\n  So in the memory of the Challenger crew, the Columbia crew, and the \nApollo 1 crew, we stand on their shoulders as we continue to explore \nthe heavens. We thank them for their courage, their sacrifice, and \ntheir pioneering spirit. That is what I wanted to share on this 30th \nanniversary of the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Challenger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Brown of Ohio be permitted to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Student Debt Crisis\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because I think \nthat higher education should be a path to prosperity, not a path to \nsuffocating debt; however, today in America we have a student debt \ncrisis that demands action from Washington because it is holding back \nan entire generation and creating an economic drag on the growth of our \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority here in the Senate continues \nto ignore this crisis at a time when we really should be working across \nthe party aisle to put in reforms that make college more affordable for \nstudents and their families who are struggling and in desperate need of \naction. That is why last week Senate Democrats officially launched our \n``In the Red'' campaign in order to confront the student debt crisis \nand address college affordability.\n  Our legislative reform package includes three commonsense initiatives \nthat deserve to be debated and deserve a vote. First, we are calling \nfor action to address the significant loss in value of Pell grants by \nadjusting them for inflation; second, we are pushing to allow borrowers \nto refinance their existing student loans at lower rates; and third, we \nare making 2 years of community college or technical school free for \nstudents who are willing to work for it.\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\n  In his State of the Union Address--not the one he gave a couple of \nweeks ago but the one he gave last January in 2015--President Obama \ncalled on us here in Congress to make a bold investment in our Nation's \nstudents, in our Nation's workforce, and in the future of our economy \nby making 2 years of community college free.\n  In July, I answered that call and introduced legislation, the \nAmerica's College Promise Act, aimed at providing students with a \nstronger and more affordable opportunity to gain the skills they need \nto compete, succeed, and prosper by making an investment in our \nworkforce readiness, our economy, and our future. I am proud that this \nlegislation is a pillar of the Senate Democrats' effort to reduce \nstudent debt in 2016 and to put our country on a path toward debt-free \ncollege. Learning from successes in States such as Tennessee and \nOregon, the America's College Promise Act will create a new partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and States to help them waive resident \ntuition for 2 years of community or technical college programs for \neligible students. This new partnership will provide a Federal match of \n$3 for every $1 invested by the State to waive community college \ntuition and fees for eligible students. With this legislation, a full-\ntime community college student could save an average of around $3,800 \nin tuition per year.\n  As cochair of the Senate's career and technical education caucus, I \nam especially proud that this reform takes a critical step to \nstrengthen workforce readiness at a time when America needs to out \neducate and compete with the rest of the world in a 21st century \nskills-based economy. The idea that the next generation will be able to \ngo further and do better than the last is at the heart of the American \ndream, and the solutions that we are offering today deserve a vote in \nthis Congress.\n  It is my hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \njoin us in confronting the student debt crisis and supporting these \ncommonsense reforms that not only make higher education affordable but \ncan help give more Americans a fair shot at pursuing their dreams.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baldwin, especially for her \nterrific work on higher education. She knows the value of higher \neducation to the residents of Wisconsin, Louisiana, and Ohio.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after my remarks, the next speaker be \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, tomorrow is Earned Income Tax Credit \nAwareness Day--a day, as we approach the tax season, for getting the \nword out about this tax credit that is a lifeline for working families.\n  The EITC provides an incentive to work. It puts thousands of dollars \nback into the pockets of low-wage and moderate-wage workers every year. \nPresident Reagan called it ``the best anti-poverty measure to come out \nof Congress.''\n  The work that Senator Reed and others and I did on the earned-income \ntax credit this year to permanently expand it was called by some \norganizations the most important anti-poverty initiative, except for \nthe Affordable Care Act, in the last 20 years that Congress has done.\n  Last year 27 million American households--950,000 households just in \nmy State alone, in Ohio--claimed the EITC and received an average \nrefund of $2,400. So for somebody making $15,000 or $20,000 or $30,000 \na year, when they file their taxes in February or March, they literally \ncan get a check from the Federal Government, on average--I am not \npromising everybody specific amounts because each situation is \ndifferent--on average, they will get a check for $2,400.\n  One of the best things this body did last year was to permanently \nexpand the earned-income tax credit, but there is still more we need to \ndo. There is one glaring hole in the program we need to fix. Under \ncurrent law--back up a little bit.\n  The earned-income tax credit was aimed primarily at families with \nchildren but not entirely. Under current law, workers without children, \nsomebody making $15,000 a year or somebody making $11 an hour, making \n$22,000, $23,000 a year but having no children--no spouse, no \nchildren--those workers making minimum wage barely receive any earned-\nincome tax credit. Childless workers under 25 don't qualify for these \ncredits at all. That means that a young worker--somebody making $9 or \n$10 an hour without children--can actually be taxed deeper into \npoverty. Why is that? Well, if a worker is making $9 an hour working \nfull time--doing their best, not getting paid much--they are paying the \npayroll tax, the Social Security tax. The taxes they pay actually push \nthem down below the poverty line. Why would we possibly in this \ncountry--we say in this body we value work. We say we care about people \nwho are working hard and playing by the rules and we want them to get \nahead, but then we fail to provide that earned-income tax credit and we \ntax them back below the poverty line. Why would we do that? Part of the \nreason is that last year when we were successful in expanding the \nearned-income tax credit permanently, there was resistance from some \nsort of ultraconservatives in this body--some tea party Republicans--\nthere was resistance to expanding it to these workers who are working \nhard but don't have children. How are they going to plan families or \nplan for the future if they are always struggling paycheck to paycheck \nand get no help?\n  We need to do more to ensure that families who are currently eligible \nknow about the EITC. Right now, even with the discussion--I appreciate \nthe Presiding Officer from Louisiana and his interest in this. I know \npeople in Louisiana, like people in Ohio--not everybody knows about it. \nOne-fifth of families in this country who are eligible, who can claim \nthe earned-income tax credit when they file their taxes, 20 percent of \nthem don't know and don't file for it. That means those 20 percent are \nleaving about $2,000 on the table that they could use to fix their car \nor pay off a payday loan, buy their kids shoes or maybe occasionally go \nout to a restaurant once a month and get a nice dinner.\n  With Federal tax filing season opening last week, we need to make \nsure that every American gets as much of her hard-earned money back \ninto her pocket as possible; that every American gets as much of his \nhard-earned money back in his pocket as possible. We need to get the \nword out about tax credits that working families can claim and the \nservices available to help them get their maximum refund. Filing taxes \nis complicated, and it can be particularly challenging for families \nclaiming the earned-income tax credit, but getting help doesn't need to \nbe expensive. Here is how.\n  One tool that is available is the IRS Free File Program. If you go to \nthe irs.gov Web site or, if you live in Ohio, go to the \nbrown.senate.gov Web site and type in your ZIP Code, the commercial \npartners of the IRS offer free brand-name software to individuals and \nto families with incomes of $62,000 or less.\n  For families claiming the EITC, they can visit what is called the \nVoluntary Income Tax Assistance--the VITA site--the Voluntary Income \nTax Assistance site. Go into brown.senate.gov if you live in Ohio or go \nto irs.gov, type in your ZIP Code, and you can see what VITA sites are \navailable.\n  Someone just told me yesterday they entered their ZIP Code and found \nout that a VITA site--the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance site--was \nwithin walking distance from her home. Ohioans, as I said, can go to my \nWeb site, brown.senate.gov, type in their ZIP Code, and they will find \na map and the nearest site.\n  VITA sites are not only free, they are more reliable. The majority of \nEITC errors result from returns filed by paid tax preparers. All VITA \nvolunteers are trained by an organization partnering with the IRS.\n  So if you make less than $60,000 a year, you can go to one of these \nVITA sites, the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance sites, and you will \nfind out--they will do your taxes with you for free, and they will find \nout if you are eligible for the earned-income tax credit. If you are \neligible for the earned-income tax credit this year and you didn't \nfile, it is possible you can claim your tax credit from calendar year \nor\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\ntax year 2014 also. So you may get a $3,000 credit this year--a check. \nYou may get another $2,000 for last year. It is money you earned. It is \nmoney you earned because you worked hard, you did your best, you maybe \nonly made $25,000 a year, but you are eligible for this tax credit.\n  Millionaires and billionaires and Members of Congress and people who \nare doing pretty well financially in life, most people like that have \nan army of lawyers and accountants and people who do their taxes for \nthem, and they claim every possible tax credit, every possible tax \ndeduction, every possible tax advantage they can get. People who fill \nout their own earned-income tax credit--their own taxes, if they are \nmaking $20,000 or $30,000 a year, don't have that sophistication and \ndon't have the money to hire those lawyers and accountants, so \noftentimes they are not getting every tax credit or every tax deduction \nthey can get. That is why it is so important for people to visit these \nVITA sites and it is why it is so important that people have that \nopportunity.\n  We need to ensure that working families know about the resources \navailable to help them claim their refunds, including the earned-income \ntax credit and the child tax credit--refunds that, I repeat, they have \nearned. We reward work. We give people a little help when they are \nworking hard for low wages. We should raise the minimum wage. We should \ndo some other things. We should push the Department of Labor to move a \nlittle faster on its overtime rule so people who are working more than \n40 hours are getting time and a half that they have earned. As much as \nwages have been stagnant in this country, I want to see people who are \nworking hard be able to get ahead and get every advantage they possibly \ncan.\n  This body took a strong stand in December in support of an expanded \npermanent earned-income tax credit and a permanent child tax credit. I \nhope on EITC Awareness Day we will recommit ourselves to doing the same \nthing this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me commend Senator Brown for his \nvery thoughtful and articulate comments on the earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  Mr. President, I am very glad that the Senate is taking up the issue \nof energy this week. The bill we are debating takes positive steps \nforward to encourage energy efficiency in Federal and commercial \nbuildings, modernize the electric grid, and boost renewable sources of \nenergy.\n  I am particularly pleased that provisions I have worked on, on a \nbipartisan basis with Senators Coons and Collins, to enhance the \nWeatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program are \nincluded. These provisions improve these programs that help low-income \nAmericans reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy \nefficient, and many of these individuals are senior citizens who are \nday-by-day struggling on fixed incomes, trying to pay not just a \nheating bill but the grocery bill and many other bills. I have long \nchampioned these cost-effective programs that are helping families \nacross my State and across the Nation to provide a warm and safe home \nwhile also increasing energy efficiency.\n  Indeed, weatherization to me is one of the most sensible steps. It is \nin some respects the low-hanging fruit. If we can reduce demand, then \nwe can go a long way not only in terms of our energy situation but also \nour environmental situation.\n  We are here today because of the great work of the Chairwoman, \nSenator Murkowski, and the Ranking Member, Senator Cantwell. They have \ndone an extraordinary job. I am not surprised, as they are \nextraordinary Members of this body. I want to personally thank them and \ncommend them for what they have done not just in this effort but in \nmany other efforts. Indeed, I have joined Senator Cantwell as a \ncosponsor of her bill that goes so much further than the current bill \non the Senate floor to modernize our current electrical infrastructure \nand promote greater use of domestic energy and renewable energy. I \nwould like to extend my thanks and commendations to both Senators.\n  One area that I believe needs further focus as we move forward is the \nissue of energy storage. I am glad to be working with my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Heller, on amendments that support more efficient use \nof Federal funding for energy storage research at the Department of \nEnergy and encourage energy storage usage in public utilities.\n  Advances in energy storage, advances in batteries--and sometimes it \nis the same thing--can help improve the reliability, resiliency, and \nflexibility of the grid as well as reduce the potential for future rate \nincreases, saving us all money on our utility bills.\n  Senator Heller and I have submitted two amendments that we hope will \nspur action in this area. One amendment would give the Secretary of \nEnergy the ability to coordinate energy storage research and \ndevelopment projects among the existing programs at DOE to maximize the \namount of funding that goes toward research and minimize administrative \ncosts. We feel it does not have that flexibility at the moment.\n  I also joined Senator Heller in offering another amendment, in which \nhe is indeed the lead sponsor, which amends the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act so industry and State regulators must consider \nenergy storage when making their energy efficiency plans.\n  I also, in addition to these proposals, would like to use this \nopportunity to encourage greater attention to the financial impacts of \nclimate change caused by energy consumption. It is clear not only that \nthe SEC needs to do more when it comes to critically reviewing \ndisclosures being filed by publicly traded companies, but also that the \nSEC's disclosure industry guides for mining companies and oil and gas \ncompanies should be updated to reflect the growing risk of climate \nchange to these companies and, in effect, to their shareholders.\n  That is why I am offering an additional amendment that directs the \nSEC to update these industry guides as well as to consider and \nincorporate appropriate suggestions from the United Nations Environment \nProgramme Finance Initiative's report entitled ``Climate Strategies and \nMetrics: Exploring Options for Institutional Investors,'' which was \npublished in 2015.\n  These disclosures are important to institutional investors such as \nAllianz Global Investors, for example, which is a global diversified \nactive investment manager with $477 billion in assets under management, \nwhich has specifically called for ``achieving better disclosure of the \neffects of carbon costs on the oil and gas companies.'' What we are \ntrying to do is respond to the growing demand of investors and \nshareholders so they can make better judgments about their investments.\n\n  It is also important for us to continue to invest in our energy \ninfrastructure and support cutting-edge technological advancements \nwhile effectively monitoring the effects of our energy consumption on \nour economy and our environment. One way of doing this is once again to \nhave assurances that investors have the knowledge they need to make \nwise decisions about their investments.\n  All told, this is very responsible and appropriate legislation. We \ncan make improvements. I hope the amendments I have proposed, along \nwith Senator Heller, can get favorable consideration as we move \nforward.\n  Once again, let me thank Senators Murkowski and Cantwell for \nextraordinary leadership.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, modernizing our Nation's energy policy is \nvital to protecting our national security. The bill that we are \ndiscussing today advances our Nation's energy independence and provides \nfor new measures to defend our critical infrastructure. Specifically, \ncyber threats challenge the security of our Nation and the integrity of \nour energy infrastructure. This bill will formally introduce the \nfoundational principles of cyber security into our Nation's energy \nsecurity calculus.\n  However, challenging the Department of Energy to enhance the cyber \nsecurity of our Nation's electric grid is not enough if the Department \nof Energy does not have the requisite cyber experts to fulfill the \nmission. The amendment I submitted today, amendment 3119, will address \nthe gap between the Department of Energy's mission to\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\nkeep our Nation's energy infrastructure safe from cyber attacks and the \nDepartment of Energy's ability to actually do it.\n  Currently, the bill provides for a 21st Century Energy Workforce \nAdvisory Board composed of nine members. The purpose of this board is \nto anticipate the needs of the future energy workforce. While the bill \nrequires that the board members be representative of disciplines such \nas labor organizations, education, and minority parties, nowhere does \nthe bill require that a single member of the board have any background \non cyber.\n  My amendment requires the membership of the 21st Century Energy \nWorkforce Advisory Board to include representation from the cyber \nsecurity discipline. This amendment better positions the advisory board \nto integrate cyber security into the energy sector's workforce \ndevelopment strategy for the 21st Century and ultimately provides a \nmechanism to bring cyber security expertise to the energy sector.\n  Hardening the electric grid and the Nation's energy supply chains \nagainst cyber security threats is a critical component to protecting \nour national energy infrastructure. This amendment lays the foundation \nto ensure that the Department of Energy has the right cyber security \nexperts to defend these vital national security assets.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment.\n  Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Ambassador Nominations to Norway and Sweden\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor earlier this \nmonth to talk about the importance of moving forward on the nominations \nof the Ambassadors to two important allies to the United States of \nAmerica, and that is Norway and Sweden. These are countries that have \nbeen our true friends through many wars. They have been our true \nfriends economically--some of the top investors in America--and they \nhave been countries that are good examples of democracy and good \nexamples of countries that believe in human rights. Yet we have not \nbeen able to confirm an ambassador to either country.\n  I do want to, first of all, say that in the case of Sweden, it has \nbeen 462 days since the President nominated Azita Raji to be \nAmbassador, and in the case of Norway, it has been 853 days since that \ncountry has had a U.S. Ambassador. I will get to those details. In this \ncase, the nominee is Sam Heins from the State of Minnesota, where, by \nthe way, we have over 1 million people of Scandinavian descent--1.5 \nmillion people who do not understand why every major nation in Europe \nhas an ambassador but not these two Scandinavian countries.\n  I thank Senator McConnell, the majority leader, and Senator Reid for \ntheir work in trying to advance these nominees to the floor. They have \nnegotiated. Senator Corker and Senator Cardin are both supportive of \nthese nominees.\n  I think it is important to note that this is not a typical story of \ndelay. These nominees went through the committee without any objection. \nThey were not controversial, nor are they controversial today. It is a \nfact that Senator Cruz has some issues that are completely unrelated to \nthese nominees but also completely unrelated to Norway and Sweden. The \nissue is that while Senators do from time to time put temporary holds \non nominees, this has gone on too long, and I am hopeful--in an article \ntoday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune about irked Scandinavians in our \nState, Senator Cruz's staff has said that they are engaged in good-\nfaith discussions with other Senators and have made clear there have \nbeen no issues raised with these particular nominees in this story. I \nthink that is very important, and we hope we are going to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article from the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Jan. 27, 2016]\n\n Minnesotan Scandinavians Irked as Ted Cruz Blocks Ambassador Nominees\n\n                          (By Allison Sherry)\n\n\nNorway has been without an ambassador for more than 800 days and Sweden \n              tops 400 days without a U.S. representative\n\n       Washington.--Presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz is blocking \n     a vote in the U.S. Senate to confirm the Norwegian and \n     Swedish ambassador nominations.\n       The move by the Texas Republican has angered some members \n     of Minnesota's sizable Scandinavian communities, as Norway \n     has been without an ambassador for more than 800 days and \n     Sweden tops 400 days without a U.S. representative.\n       Staffers from Cruz's office didn't say anything negative \n     about the people appointed by President Obama to the posts, \n     including Norway ambassador nominee Sam Heins from Minnesota. \n     Cruz has continued to block the nominees as he has worked to \n     build support for another initiative that is putting him at \n     odds with the White House.\n       Cruz, who is critical of the Chinese government, has \n     lobbied his Senate colleagues to rename a street in \n     Washington, D.C., after a polarizing Chinese dissident--an \n     idea that has been thwarted by fears of crippling diplomatic \n     efforts between the two countries.\n       ``Senator Cruz remains engaged in good-faith discussions \n     with his colleagues regarding the holds he announced because \n     of his serious concerns about the Obama administration's \n     foreign policy,'' said Cruz spokesman Phil Novack.\n       The White House renewed its calls for a swift vote on the \n     ambassador nominees.\n       ``The president has nominated two unquestionably qualified \n     individuals to be the U.S. ambassadors to Sweden and \n     Norway,'' said White House press secretary Eric Schultz. ``We \n     urge the Senate to act.''\n       Minnesotans closely watching the issue are angered by the \n     delay, saying it is souring relations with two staunch U.S. \n     allies.\n       ``There's a crisis in a relationship between our two \n     countries,'' said Bruce Karstadt, president and CEO of the \n     Minneapolis-based American Swedish Institute. ``I don't \n     really quite understand that any statement is being made \n     other than we're ignoring you.''\n       Cruz's office says he remains in negotiations about lifting \n     the procedural blocks on the nominations, citing a July 2015 \n     letter to the Obama administration outlining concerns about \n     the Iran nuclear deal as one of the reasons he is objecting \n     to political appointments.\n       Since that letter, though, two political appointments--\n     state appointees to Barbados and the U.N. Economic Council--\n     have passed the Senate without Cruz's hold.\n       Temporary holds are relatively common and are also used by \n     Democrats to protest administration policy. Earlier this \n     week, for example, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward \n     Markey placed a hold on Obama's nominee to head the Food and \n     Drug Administration unless the administration agrees to \n     reform its process for approving painkiller medications.\n       Cruz's protests delaying votes on the Scandinavian \n     ambassador nominations irks Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy \n     Klobuchar, who points out that Minnesota is home to the \n     second-largest number of Norwegians in the world, outside of \n     Norway. The two nominees passed through the GOP-controlled \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so Klobuchar wants a vote \n     on the Senate floor even if Cruz votes against them.\n       Klobuchar points out the business relationships between the \n     countries and that Norway and Sweden have shouldered much of \n     the burden of the European refugee crisis in recent years. \n     ``It's no way to treat your friends,'' she said. ``The point \n     is all these other European nations have ambassadors. Why \n     would you put a hold on two of our best allies from having \n     ambassadors?''\n       Democratic U.S. Sen. Al Franken said he also would increase \n     pressure for a vote. ``We need to move on ambassador openings \n     for both Norway--where there's a highly qualified Minnesota \n     nominee who has yet to be confirmed--and Sweden,'' Franken \n     said. ``I'm going to continue pressing to get these positions \n     filled.''\n       Norway and Sweden are two of the largest investors in the \n     U.S. economy. Norway is invested in more than 2,100 American \n     companies, which amounts to about $175 billion. It also has \n     about $94 billion in U.S. bonds and $5 billion worth of U.S. \n     real estate. Meanwhile, the U.S. exports $9 billion in goods \n     and services to Sweden, a country that supports about 330,000 \n     American jobs annually, embassy officials said.\n       Leif Trana, a minister counselor at the Norwegian Embassy \n     in Washington, pointed out that his country just committed to \n     52 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin--all of them made at a \n     Lockheed plant in Cruz's home state of Texas.\n       ``Norwegians have long had a great affinity for the United \n     States,'' Trana said. ``After the E.U., this is our place \n     where most Norwegians both travel to [and] study.''\n       The Norwegian post has been a beleaguered one for years.\n       President Obama first nominated businessman George Tsunis, \n     a New York contributor who had raised more than $1 million in \n     campaign cash for him. Tsunis quickly proved unqualified for \n     the job. During an appearance before the Senate Foreign \n     Relations\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n     Committee, Tsunis referred to Norway's prime minister as \n     ``president'' and could not identify potential U.S. trade \n     opportunities with Norway. One member of the Norwegian \n     parliament was so offended by Tsunis that he demanded an \n     apology from Obama.\n       Minnesota's delegation, led by the Democrats, urged Obama \n     to withdraw the nomination. He did, and in May 2015 he \n     nominated Heins, a Minnesota lawyer and human rights \n     advocate. Heins, too, was a major contributor and bundler for \n     the president's election campaigns.\n       For the Sweden post, Obama nominated Azita Raji, an \n     Iranian-born former Wall Street executive. Her nomination has \n     been mostly uncontroversial and passed out of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee last summer.\n       Jon Pederson, board chairman of the Minneapolis-based \n     Norway House, said it's shameful to play politics with the \n     ambassador posts.\n       ``This position is important,'' Pederson said. ``Left \n     unfilled like this is a slap in the face to Norway.''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. There are just a few quotes from people who are not in \npolitics at all.\n\n       ``There's a crisis in a relationship between our two \n     countries,'' said Bruce Karstadt, president and CEO of the \n     Minneapolis-based American Swedish Institute. ``I don't \n     really quite understand that any statement is being made \n     other than we're ignoring you.''\n\n  I will give another example. Leif Trana, a Minister Counselor at the \nNorwegian Embassy in Washington, pointed out that his country just \ncommitted to 52 fighter jets. I believe each one is over $200 million. \nNorway is purchasing these jets from Lockheed Martin, a U.S. company, \nand all of them are going to be made in a Lockheed Martin plant in the \nState of Texas. Imagine how many jobs this provides and that we would \nconsider not sending an ambassador to a country that not only sees us \nas an ally--and is allied, by the way, in our issues we have in our \nconflict with Russia.\n  The Minister Counselor at the Norwegian Embassy goes on to say:\n\n       Norwegians have long had a great affinity for the United \n     States. After the E.U., this is our place where most \n     Norwegians travel to and study.\n\n  This is the last quote I will give you from this article today:\n\n       Jon Pederson, board chairman of the Minneapolis-based \n     Norway House, said it's shameful to play politics with the \n     ambassador posts. ``This position is important,'' Pederson \n     said. ``Left unfilled like this is a slap in the face to \n     Norway.''\n\n  Let's go through what has been going on--853 days in the case of \nNorway. The first nominee who was nominated, as explained in this \narticle, did not go well. There were issues on both sides of the aisle. \nThat person withdrew his name. That is part of the delay, and we will \nacknowledge that, but a big chunk of the recent delay is because there \nhas been a hold--not at the committee level--that went through quickly \nwith Senator Corker and Senator Cardin's guidance--but on the floor. In \nthe case of Sweden, it has been a delay of 462 days for a \nnoncontroversial nominee. At the same time, in the last few months, \nAmbassadors have been confirmed for 38 countries. Two of those were \nactually political appointees. They were not career, as the rumor is; \ntwo were considered political appointees. Barbados, Ecuador, Poland, \nand Thailand all have Ambassadors. There is an ambassador from the \nUnited States in France, of course. There is an ambassador in England, \nof course. There is an ambassador in Italy. There is an ambassador in \nGermany. There is an ambassador in Bulgaria but not in Sweden and \nNorway. We, in fact, have an ambassador in nearly every European nation \nbut not in these two Scandinavian countries.\n  There have been no questions about the qualifications of these two \nnominees. I will put those qualification on the record, but I wanted to \nfocus more on the actual countries, Norway and Sweden. They are \nincredibly important allies and trading partners. They deserve to be \ntreated like other European nations. They deserve to have an ambassador \nfrom the United States of America, and it is time to get this done.\n  Diplomatic relations between the United States, Norway, and Sweden \nare almost 200 years old. For 200 years we have had Ambassadors in \nthese countries. Holding a vote to confirm frontline Ambassadors \nhostage is not in the best interest of our country.\n  Let's start with Norway. Norway was a founding member of the NATO \nalliance, and its military has participated in operations with the \nUnited States in the Balkans and in Afghanistan. Norwegians work \nalongside Americans in standing up to Russia's provocations in Ukraine, \nin countering ISIS and the spread of violent extremism, and in \nstrengthening regional cooperation in the Arctic. Norway has been \nespecially strong on working to check Russian aggression against \nUkraine.\n  Norway has also played an important role in the Syrian refugee \ncrisis. Norway has a proud history of providing support to those \nfleeing conflict. It expects to take in as many as 25,000 refugees this \nyear. It has already provided more than $6 million to Greece to help \nrespond to the influx of refugees seeking a way to enter Europe.\n  All of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance \nof a strong Europe during these trying times. Yet now we have no \nAmbassadors in two of the countries that are on the frontlines of \ncombatting extremism and addressing the refugee crisis.\n  Sweden, like Norway, plays an important role in national security and \non the international stage. Sweden is a strong partner and close friend \nof the United States, helping in our fight against ISIS, promoting \ndemocracy and human rights, and cooperating on global initiatives \nrelated to clean energy and the environment.\n  Sweden is a partner in NATO and is an active global leader, from its \nlong-term investment in Afghanistan, to its role as an international \npeacemaker. Sweden has supported Ukraine against Russian aggression, \nhas made significant contributions in Afghanistan, and has aided in the \nfight against terrorism in Syria, Iraq, Kosovo, and the current fight \nagainst ISIS.\n  Sweden is a member of the counter-ISIL coalition and is on the \nfrontlines of the Syrian refugee crisis. More than 1,200 refugees seek \nasylum in Sweden every day, and Sweden accepts more refugees per capita \nthan any other country in the EU. That is what is happening right now. \nThey are accepting more refugees per capita than any other country in \nthe EU. Yet we don't have an ambassador to that country. We have an \nambassador to Germany. We certainly know they are playing a role in \nthis refugee crisis. We have an ambassador, of course, to Greece. But \nwe don't have an ambassador to this country.\n  The United States has collaborated with Sweden to strengthen human \nrights, democracy, and freedom in countries emerging from oppressive \nand autocratic regimes. Sweden's commitment to promoting human \ndemocracy, human rights, gender equality, and international development \nand sustainability make it a respected leader in international affairs.\n  Now let's look at economic partnerships.\n  I do hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have all \nbeen very supportive of this will talk to Senator Cruz the next time \nthey see him. I plan on asking for unanimous consent to get these \nnominees through repeatedly in the next month. I am hoping Senator Cruz \nwill be here to explain this, and I am hoping we can find some \nagreement on this because, again, this is not a typical case where \nthese nominees have been criticized or questioned, including by his own \noffice. This is a case of simply some other issues that are not related \nto the nominees or to the countries, and these countries should not be \nheld hostage.\n  Norway is an important economic partner. According to the American \nChamber of Commerce, Norway represented the fifth fastest growing \nsource of foreign direct investment in the United States between 2009 \nand 2013. Of course, visiting Senator Hoeven's and Senator Heitkamp's \nState of North Dakota, I have seen the investments in oil and in \ndrilling in North Dakota from the Scandinavian countries because of \ntheir history in that industry.\n  Norway is the 12th largest source of foreign direct investment in the \nUnited States. Think about that. There are over 300 American companies \nwith a presence in Norway, including 3M of Minnesota, Eli Lilly, \nGeneral Electric, IBM, McDonald's, and others. By not having an \nambassador to Norway, we are sending a message to some of the top \ninvestors in our own country. The Ambassadors in these countries, as we \nknow, are our trading partners and help businesses in America do \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nin that country. While there are national security issues, there is \nalso an economic purpose of having an ambassador.\n  In October, Norway reiterated its commitment to invest in American \nbusinesses by purchasing an additional 22 F-35s from Lockheed Martin. \nThat is a total of 52 fighter jets Norway is committing to buy from \nLockheed Martin. The first will arrive in 2018. This is the biggest \ninvestment Norway has ever made in the country's history, and they are \ninvesting in a company in our country, in the State of Texas. These are \nwarplanes that will be built at Lockheed's facility in Fort Worth. I \ncalled attention to this fact. I know it is a cost of almost $200 \nmillion per plane. This country is investing in American jobs--$200 \nmillion per plane--and they are buying 22 more. You can do the math.\n\n  Lockheed Martin and other American companies that do business with \nNorway would like to see an ambassador there to help facilitate \nrelations.\n  Now let's get to Sweden. Sweden, like Norway, is also one of the \nbiggest investors in the United States. Sweden is actually the 11th \nlargest direct investor in the United States, while Norway is 12th. I \nwould think some people might be surprised by that fact that these two \nScandinavian countries are that high on the list when you look in the \nworld, but, in fact, it is true. They are the 11th and 12th investors \nin the United States. Sweden's foreign direct investment in the U.S. \namounts to roughly $56 billion and creates nearly 330,700 U.S. jobs.\n  U.S. companies are the most represented foreign companies in Sweden. \nSwedish-Americans have contributed to the fabric of our great Nation \nand built successful companies such as Walgreens, Greyhound, and \nNordstrom.\n  Economically, Sweden is highly dependent upon exports and is one of \nthe most internationally integrated economies in the world. The United \nStates is Sweden's fourth largest export market, with Swedish exports \nvalued at an estimated $10.2 billion. Now, does this sound like a \ncountry where we just decide we are not going to have an ambassador, \nyet we give ambassadors to all these other nations all across the \nworld? That just doesn't seem right.\n  Sweden is a significant export market for my State of Minnesota, with \n$131.5 million in sales through November of last year. Sweden, like \nNorway, deserves to have an ambassador.\n  Speaking of the Minnesota ties here, the economic and cultural \ninfluence of Norway and Sweden is strongly felt throughout the United \nStates. I will say that Minnesota has a special one. In fact, one of \nthe most notable attractions in Madison, MN, is a giant 25-foot-long \nfiberglass cod named ``Mr. Lou T. Fisk.'' That is a little Scandinavian \njoke here late in the afternoon. That is a lutefisk--``Mr. Lou T. \nFisk.'' Anyone from Norway or Sweden knows that lutefisk is a \ntraditional Norwegian food. Madison, MN, is so proud of its Nordic \nheritage that they once took Lou, the giant fish, on a national tour in \nthe back of a truck. That was many, many years ago, but the fiberglass \ncod--the largest fiberglass cod in the world--is still displayed in our \nState.\n  We have about 100,000 people of Norwegian heritage in Minnesota, \nsecond only to Norway itself. We have 500,000 Swedish Minnesotans. \nThink of how many. That is a good chunk of our population. So we are \nvery proud of our Nordic heritage.\n  That is my State. I think you could go around any State in the United \nStates and there you would find proud Norwegians and Swedes. They may \nnot always be the loudest voices, and maybe that is part of the \nproblem. Maybe they have been too nice. But I can tell you that these \ntwo countries are the 11th and 12th biggest investors in the United \nStates of America. One of them has been willing to buy 52 fighter \nplanes valued at nearly $200 million each from our Nation.\n  They certainly deserve an ambassador. They have been very clear to \nme--the representatives of these companies--that they would like to see \nan ambassador. At some point this looks like a ``dis'' from our \nNation--that we are ``dissing'' them because we allow every other \nNation to have an ambassador.\n  We look forward to working with Senator Cruz. Again, I thank Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Corker for their support. We haven't seen any \nother concerns that people have that have not been taken care of. So I \nam hopeful we can get Sam Heins and Azita Raji immediately confirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I want to follow up on the comments of \nthe Senator from Washington and thank her for her willingness as we \nhave worked through several of these matters throughout the morning, \ninto the afternoon, and now here at the 5 o'clock hour. You do not get \nto a place where you can voice vote six amendments without a level of \ncooperation, and I thank her for that.\n  I thank our Members, but I also want to do a specific shout-out to \nour staffs, who have been working through some of the language, some of \nthe issues, and coming together to provide us with a path forward.\n  I think we are optimistic that given the pace and the trajectory that \nwe are on, we will be able to come in on Monday and hopefully be able \nto alert Members to a longer queue of votes that we will have \nidentified so they can come prepared when we take up votes on Tuesday.\n  We will again be asking Members to spend good, constructive time. If \nyou want to speak to your amendments, we will be in session on Monday \nfor at least a few hours, and that would not be a bad time to come and \nspeak to any of the issues that are of importance to you. We really do \nhope to put in place a more defined schedule for next week so that \ncolleagues know the trajectory that we are on.\n  I think it is the intention of both Senator Cantwell and myself that \nwe move aggressively so that we can complete this very important bill \nby the end of next week.

Mr. President, as I was turning to go into the \ncloakroom, I saw the pages here in the corner. I have had an \nopportunity to visit with several of them an hour or so ago. Tomorrow \nis the last day of the session for these young pages who have come to \nus from all around the country to be with us for a 5-month period. It \nis a long time to be away from your home, your family, your school, \nyour community, to be here in a strange place with other strange \npeople, to be living in a dormitory situation, to have a very \naggressive academic schedule and, by the way, at 16 years old, you are \nworking.\n  You are told what you can wear. You are told you cannot have your \ncell phone. There are a lot of rules. Being a page is not an easy \nthing.

You do it with an enthusiasm that I think helps us. I \nthink it helps remind us that this place is a special place, that it is \na privilege to be serving in the Senate, whether it is as an elected \nMember or whether it is as a page or as those who are doing the \ntranscription of Senators' comments or as staff. The fact that these \nmen and women come here and help with the efficient operation of the \nday-to-day activities needs to be recognized.

Mr. President, Washington received a loud wake-up call\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\nthis week. On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office, or the CBO, \nreleased its biannual ``Budget and Economic Outlook'' report and the \nprojections for the next decade are very sobering. The nonpartisan \nstudy found that over the next decade our country will grow to nearly \n$30 trillion in debt. Folks, that is $30 trillion. This is \nunbelievable. It is unmanageable.\n  A number this large is nearly impossible to comprehend. Maybe that is \nwhy this seems to have gone unnoticed, buried under headlines about \nPresidential politics, Super Bowl 50, Snowzilla, and Apple's latest \nearnings statement. But what we can comprehend is who is responsible \nfor paying off this debt eventually. We are--the American people.\n  With nearly $19 trillion in debt today and over $100 trillion in \nfuture unfunded liabilities, we are well past the tipping point. This \nmeans each American family is responsible today for nearly $1 million \nof this debt. In addition, the Social Security and Medicare trust funds \nare expected to go to zero in roughly 15 short years.\n  According to an AEI analysis of this CBO report, spending on Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and other health care programs will grow at an \naverage annual rate of 5\\1/2\\ percent from 2016 to 2026, pushing \nspending on Social Security and health care alone to upwards of $4.1 \ntrillion in 2026--just 10 short years from now.\n  This is more than we spent last year on the entire Federal \nGovernment. This is not 20 years from now. This is in the immediate \nfuture. We will be spending more on these items than we did last year \non the entire Government.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize that we have a \ncrisis. We all agree. However, their solution is simply to tax the \nworking people of America more. That is exactly what we have been \ndoing. It is not working.\n  In the last 15 years, our Federal Government spending has grown from \n$2.4 trillion in the year 2000 to $3.7 trillion in constant 2015 \ndollars last year. Because of that, over this same period--from 2000 to \n2015--our Federal debt has grown from $6 trillion in 2000 to $19 \ntrillion today. It is unbelievable.\n  However, last year the Federal Government collected $3.2 trillion in \ntaxes. This is the largest amount ever in our history. We have a \nspending problem, not a revenue problem. Furthermore, our country's \ndebt is not interest-free. Taxpayers are already paying immensely for \nWashington's fiscal malfeasance.\n  Last month, interest rates increased one-quarter of a point--only \none-quarter of a point. But this equates to almost $50 billion of new \ninterest expense every single year. Our country must borrow even more \nmoney to pay this additional interest expense. That is a true measure \nof total insolvency. This interest rate increase is widely suspected to \nbe followed by another increase later this year.\n  Imagine if interest rates go up to just their 50-year average of 5\\1/\n2\\ percent, taxpayers would be paying almost $1 trillion in interest. \nThis is more than twice what we spent on our military. It is more than \ntwice what we spend on our discretionary nonmilitary spending. It is \nunmanageable, and we have to deal with it right now.\n  Having been in the business world for over 40 years, there are four \nwords that I used to hear often and we used them frequently: ``We \ncannot afford it.'' I personally have not heard these words once in \nWashington over this past year, my first year in the Senate. We simply \ncannot afford all we are spending today, and CBO says it will only get \nmuch worse.\n\n  Just look at Washington's grand bargain this past year. I voted \nagainst this bad policy because it significantly added to the national \ndebt and eradicated the conservative budget we put in place last year, \nwhich did cut $7 trillion out of the President's budget request of last \nyear.\n  Additionally, President Obama's economic failures and disastrous \nhealth care law have dangerously set our debt up to soar even higher \nafter he leaves office. CBO projects ObamaCare will enroll 40 percent \nless participants than expected in 2016. This will result in the \nFederal Government spending more money to support the failed \nmarketplace exchange so it does not collapse. The Hill reports that \n``spending on the marketplace is expected to rise to $56 billion next \nyear, up from $38 billion this year. Within a decade, that total is \nexpected to double to more than $109 billion.'' Plus, spending on \nhealth care programs has already jumped from $671 billion in 2008 to \nover $1.1 trillion this year. CBO projects that health care spending \nwill nearly double in the next 10 years, reaching $2 trillion in 2026. \nThis is a train wreck, and it is here.\n  Clearly, Washington cannot continue spending like this, and we have \nto make the changes necessary today. We have already reached the point \nwhere our Federal debt has become the greatest threat to our national \nand global security. At this point, we cannot pay for the tools needed \nto defend our country.\n  Last year we spent nearly 3.2 percent of GDP on defense--less than \nthe 30-year average of 4.2 percent of GDP. This is the lowest level in \nover a decade. We have been at war for more than a decade, and in the \nprocess we have totally worn out our military equipment and desperately \nneed to recapitalize and update it. More concerning, we are wearing out \nour people and cannot fully support our women and men on the \nfrontlines.\n  This crisis is here right now. It is real, and it is dangerous and \nthreatens our very way of life. These are economic realities we must \ncome to grips with quickly in order to turn things around and change \nthe direction of our country. We can solve our national debt crisis, \nbut Washington's business-as-usual approach must change and lawmakers \nmust start saying: We cannot afford it.\n  Solving the debt crisis starts with totally reinventing the failed \nbudget process, which has only worked four times in the past 40 years. \nWe have to also reduce the size of our Federal bureaucracy and start \nwith redundant agencies. Washington already has 256 government programs \nrunning on autopilot, costing taxpayers $310 billion a year, and there \nare hundreds of billions of dollars in duplicate programs and more \nopportunities to reduce waste.\n  It goes without saying that we need to get our economy growing again. \nWe can do it by changing our archaic tax laws, by eliminating \nunnecessary regulations stifling our free enterprise system, and by \nfinally unleashing the full potential of our energy resources here in \nAmerica responsibly. We will not solve this debt crisis until we save \nSocial Security and Medicare and address our spiraling health care \ncosts.\n  The solutions to these will take decades, but we have to start now. \nThe CBO report reveals a stark reality: We are simply out of time. This \ndebt crisis can no longer be ignored. It is here now. Washington must \nface up to that stark reality. We simply must start making the tough \ndecisions required to put a plan in place to reduce this outrageous \ndebt. We must do this right now for our future, for our children, and \nfor our children's children.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S327-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S327-S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to talk \na bit about developments that involve our Nation, Iran, and the other \nfive nations that joined us in negotiating the joint agreement. And we \nare encouraged that it will reduce--maybe substantially--the likelihood \nthat Iran will build a nuclear weapon in the near future or even a good \ndeal beyond that.\n  I came to the floor to talk about that subject, but after hearing the \nprevious speaker, I felt compelled to say a few things. I am a \nrecovering Governor. I was the Governor of Delaware for 8 years, and we \nbalanced our budget 8 years in a row, cut taxes. I have been told that \nmore jobs were created during those 8 years than at any other time in \nDelaware history.\n  I chaired the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs. We worked closely with GAO. We actually worked very closely \nwith the Bowles-Simpson folks about 5 or 6 years ago. They came up with \nthree ideas for deficit reduction and to make sure that we do it for \nthe long haul.\n  The Bowles-Simpson Commission was formed at a time when deficit was \n$1.4 trillion. For those who are following it, the deficit is still too \nhigh, but it has\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nbeen reduced by more than two-thirds--I think it may have even been \nclose to three-quarters--and that is good.\n  There are things we need to do for further deficit reduction.\n  No. 1, we need to really consider what we do with our entitlement \nprograms. The Bowles-Simpson Commission suggested that we make some \nchanges and that we make them in ways which do not harm older people \nand which will save these programs for our children and grandchildren. \nI think that is very important, and that is one thing we need to do.\n  No. 2, we need some additional revenues. We actually had four \nbalanced budgets in a row during the last 4 years of the Clinton \nadministration. If you look at revenues as a percentage of GDP in those \n4 years, it was 20 percent. Revenues as a percentage of GDP for the 4 \nyears we had a balanced budget was 20 percent. When you look at \nspending as a percentage of GDP during those 4 years, the last 4 years \nof the Clinton administration, it was 20 percent. During that time we \nhad a balanced budget. In fact, we had a little surplus. But all of \nthat got away from us in the 8 years that followed. After we had a \nchange in administrations, the deficit piled up to $1.4 trillion. Well, \nwe have been ratcheting it down, and now we are recovering from the \nworst recession since the Great Depression. Can we do better than that? \nSure we can do better than that.\n  In terms of deficit reduction, entitlement reform actually saves \nmoney, save these programs for our kids and our grandchildren, and \ndoesn't harm old people and poor people.\n  The third thing we need is tax reform that generates revenues and \nhopefully reduces some rates, especially on the corporate side, where \nwe are out of step with the rest of the world.\n  The fourth thing we need to do is look at everything we do in order \nto find ways to save money. I will always remember a woman who came to \none of my townhall meetings early in my time as a Congressman years \nago, and her message to me, which I have never forgotten, was \n``Congressman Carper, I don't mind paying for additional taxes; I just \ndon't want you to waste my money.'' That is what she said. ``I don't \nmind paying for additional taxes; I just don't want you to waste my \nmoney.'' I think most people in this country feel that way.\n  As it turns out, one of the jobs of GAO--the Government \nAccountability Office--as a watchdog on spending for us is every 2 \nyears they provide to the Congress a high-risk list of ways we are \nwasting money. When Tom Coburn and I led the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, we used that as kind of our shopping \nlist that we used to offer changes in spending and changes in \nrevenues--especially in government collection--that would actually \nfurther reduce the deficit. We have taken action on a bunch of the \nideas from GAO, and we need to find additional steps to take that \nprovide part of the blueprint. Every major agency has inspectors \ngeneral, and many of them regularly give us recommendations on how to \nsave more money. Those reports should not just go up on a shelf \nsomewhere but should be an action plan for us. So there is work for all \nof us to do.\n  The last thing I will say is that health care costs as a percentage \nof GDP in my time as Governor--actually, after I stepped down as \nGovernor in 2001--which was pretty flat during the mid-to-late 1990s, \nstarted to rise again and continued to rise until right around 2010, \n2011. At that time health care costs as a percentage of GDP in this \ncountry had risen to 18 percent.\n  When I ask a friend of mine how he is doing, he says: Compared to \nwhat? Well, how about comparing it to Japan? In Japan health care costs \nas a percentage of GDP are about 8 percent. We were 18 percent and they \nare at 8 percent. They get better results, longer life expectancies, \nand lower rates of infant mortality. They cover everybody.\n  Four or 5 years ago, we had 40 million people going to bed without \nhealth care coverage at all, and we didn't get better results and we \nwere spending 18 percent of GDP. The good news is that since the \nAffordable Care Act--I wrote parts of it, and I am proud of the part I \nworked on. But there are things we need to change, and my hope is that \nsome day we get to a point in time where Democrats and Republicans, \ninstead of just trying to kill and get rid of it, will say that there \nare some good things in this legislation and some good things that will \nbe coming, and one of the good things that is coming is that health \ncare costs as a percentage of GDP are not 18 percent anymore. They are \ncoming down. The impact on deficit reduction is actually quite positive \nbecause of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S328-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S328-S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, those are some things I didn't plan to say \nbut I felt compelled to say as a warmup to what I really wanted to say, \nand that is to talk about the agreement we struck with Iran and some of \nthe things that have been happening since then with us, the United \nStates, and five other nations.\n  Over the past couple of weeks, the Obama administration's decision to \nengage with Iran, along with these other five nations, through \ndiplomacy instead of military action has faced key tests. The results \nare in, and the agreement that we struck--the United States, the Brits, \nthe Germans, the French, the Chinese, the Russians, and the Iranians--\nappears to be working thus far, and, God willing, we may actually be on \nour way to being safe as a result.\n  This test began on the high seas 2 weeks ago when the United States \nand Iran faced a crisis that could have ended tragically. Two U.S. Navy \nvessels carrying a total of 10 crewmembers strayed into Iran's \nterritorial waters. They were detained by Iran, and as many of us know, \nthey appeared on Iranian television. The American vessels were \nsomewhere they should not have been. It was a mistake.\n  As a former naval flight officer who served 5 years in a hot war in \nSoutheast Asia and another 18 years--right up to end of the Cold War--\nas a P3 aircraft mission commander, I know this is a mistake we never \nwant to make. Defense Secretary Ash Carter acknowledged that the error \nhad been made, and the sailors were released unharmed within 24 hours \nof being detained. Flashbacks of past hostage crises and destabilizing \ntensions were on all of our minds as we watched this story unfold. \nHowever, thanks to a more cooperative and productive diplomatic \nrelationship with Iran, the sailors were released within 24 hours.\n  As the week came to a close, we saw additional encouraging \nvalidations that the administration's Iran strategy is beginning to \nbear fruit. Following months of the most intrusive nuclear inspections \nin history, international weapons inspectors concluded that Iran had \nindeed followed through on its pledge in the nuclear deal to dismantle \nthe parts of its nuclear program that were clearly not intended for \npeaceful purposes.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran had \nreduced its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and that the \nremaining uranium was only enriched to levels consistent with peaceful \nenergy uses. The inspectors certified that nearly 15,000 centrifuges \nfor enriching uranium have been dismantled. That leaves Iran with only \nits least sophisticated centrifuges, which can be used solely for \npeaceful purposes. The inspectors revealed that a special reactor for \nproducing the kind of plutonium needed for a nuclear bomb in Iran will \nproduce no more. It has been filled with concrete instead. Finally, the \nnuclear watchdogs certified that the inspections and monitoring systems \nof Iran's nuclear facility and nuclear supply chain have been stood up \nto ensure Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal.\n  All of this happened much faster than most of us would have expected. \nIt certainly happened faster than I expected it would. In fact, some \ncritics of the nuclear deal said that Iran would never live up to the \npromises it had made--never. Yet, despite that skepticism, today we see \nan Iran that has taken irreversible steps to dismantle its nuclear \nweapons program in order to make good on its pledges.\n\n  Amid the nuclear deal's implementation, the United States achieved \nanother diplomatic breakthrough with Iran--one that I and a number of \nmy colleagues had a hand in.\n\n  The Iranians released five individuals--all dual U.S.-Iranian \ncitizens--that they had been detaining in Iran\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nfor some years. Their release was the result of intense diplomatic \nnegotiations. Secretary Kerry and his team of negotiators worked \novertime to secure their freedom. They deserve our appreciation and our \nthanks.\n  I had never forgotten about these Americans, and neither had my \ncolleagues. Whenever we spoke or met with senior Iranian officials in \nrecent years, we consistently called on them to release our unjustly \ndetained citizens. The end result is that these Americans are free to \nrejoin their families in America instead of rotting in an Iranian \nprison.\n  The events and achievements that occurred during these 6 days were a \nremarkable validation that the Obama administration and those of us in \nCongress who voted to support the nuclear deal had made the right \nchoice. But our challenges with Iran have not vanished--not by a long \nshot. Iran continues to support terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. \nIraq props up the Assad regime in Syria. Iran tests and develops \nballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. \nAnother American, former FBI agent Bob Levinson, disappeared 8 years \nago in Iran, and the Iranian government needs to do all it can to help \nreturn him to his family or, if they can't do that--if he is no longer \nalive--at least help find out what happened to this American. Also, of \ncourse, Iran refuses to recognize Israel's right to even exist.\n  Addressing these problems with Iran will not be easy. They will \nrequire the same kind of intense negotiations and pressure that helped \nto bring about an end to Iran's nuclear weapons program and the release \nof the detained Americans. That means our relationship with Iran will \nnot always be composed of carrots. There may very well be times when \nsticks are needed to try to convince that Nation's regime to change its \nbehavior toward us and our allies, including Israel.\n  Perhaps no action better illustrates these dynamics than the United \nStates' recent move to increase sanctions on Iran for its illegal \ntesting of ballistic missiles--something that is a clear violation of \nthe sanctions. At the same time that the U.S. was lifting nuclear \nsanctions on Iran as part of the nuclear deal, the Obama administration \nwas leveling sanctions against 11 entities for their role in supporting \nIran's ballistic missile program.\n  Addressing our challenges with Iran over the long term will also \nrequire this administration, along with future administrations and \nCongress, to adopt a forward-thinking foreign policy that looks beyond \nthe rhetoric of Iran's current regime.\n  I have a chart here that I want to share with everyone tonight. It is \na collage of photographs. I believe these photographs were taken in the \naftermath of the decision to approve the agreement--a decision reached \nby the United States and our five negotiating partners and the \ngovernment of Iran. This is a collage of photographs that indicates the \nmeasure of joy the Iranian people are reacting to this successful \nnegotiation with.\n  I just want to say Iran is little understood by most Americans. They \nhave 78 million people there today. The average age of those people is \nunder the age of 25--a lot like the young people we see in these \nphotographs. For the most part, they are all educated. The lion's share \nof them don't remember the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the taking of \nAmerican hostages at our embassy or the cruel Shah whom we supported \nuntil his ouster. This is a population, reflected in these photographs, \nthat appears more focused on building Iran's troubled economy than \npursuing antagonizing military activities favored by the Supreme Leader \nand by many of the Revolutionary Guard.\n  In the weeks ahead, this new generation of young Iranians will head \nto the polls--sometime in the month of February--to choose the \ncountry's next parliament, as well as an entity called its Council of \nExperts, which I believe is the body that will help to choose the next \nSupreme Leader of Iran. At stake for these Iranians is the choice \nbetween the policies of engagement and economic revival being \nvigorously pursued by President Rouhani, Foreign Minister Zarif, and \ntheir supporters, as opposed to the politics of antagonism and \ndestabilization that are apparently favored by the Supreme Leader and \nmany in the Revolutionary Guard.\n  We have seen photographs this week of President Rouhani meeting not \njust with Pope Francis--the first meeting between the leader of Iran \nand the Pope in close to 20 years--but also of his meetings throughout \nEurope, calling on countries, calling on businesses in order to try to \nsolicit and pave the way for investments not in weaponry, not in aid to \nHezbollah, but investments in roads, highways, and bridges--things that \nwe need, but they need them a whole lot worse. Their roads, their \nhighways and bridges, their airports and trains make ours look like the \n21st century. They need to invest in those things.\n  They have a lot of oil. They have the ability to pump a lot more. I \nthink they pump about 300,000 barrels a day. By the end of this year, \nthey will have the ability to pump as much as 1 million barrels of oil \na day, and they are not going to do that without enormous investments \nin their oil infrastructure. They have a great need to do that. These \nyoung people know that. That is where they would like to spend that \nmoney.\n  We should help make the upcoming parliamentary elections in February \nfor these voters and others an easy choice. We should continue to show \nthe people of Iran that their cooperation and their commitment to peace \nwill be rewarded. How? With economic opportunity and the shedding of \nIran's status as a pariah in the international community.\n  We ought to listen to these people. They are not much older than the \npages who are sitting here in front of us this evening. They are \ninterested in their country changing for the better. They are \ninterested in reform. A number of them have relatives who live over \nhere in our country, and there are a lot of Iranian Americans who live \nhere. For the most part, they are very valued citizens, and people \nwould be proud to call them Americans.\n  We need to listen to these young people who are calling for reform \nand who want to reconnect Iran to the international community. Frankly, \nit would be wise of us to do so for the sake of our security and for \nthe sake of the security of our allies and for stability in the Middle \nEast.\n  Mr. President, I see no one waiting to be recognized at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that I \nam hoping will be part of the Energy bill currently being debated on \nthe floor and being shepherded through the Senate by my colleague from \nthe great State of Alaska, Senator Murkowski.\n  I commend Senator Murkowski, the chair of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, for the bill she has worked on for months--\nincredible hard work. It is great to have her as the chair of the \ncommittee, certainly for Alaska but for the entire country. States such \nas the Presiding Officer's recognize how important American energy is \nfor all our citizens.\n  One of the many positive aspects of the bill we have been debating is \nthat it is focused on cleaning up old regulations, cleaning up outdated \nprograms, getting rid of some of the things we don't need.\n  The amendment that this Senator would like to offer as part of the \nEnergy bill is based on a bill I recently introduced called the RED \nTape Act of 2015. The R-E-D in RED Tape Act stands for Regulations \nEndanger Democracy Act, and this Senator believes that is the case. The \nonslaught of regulations are not only threatening our economy but are \nactually threatening our form of government. That is why I am proposing \na simple one-in, one-out bill that will cap Federal regulations--a \nsimple commonsense approach to\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\nFederal regulations that will begin to address what I think the vast \nmajority of Americans recognize as a monumental problem. What is that \nproblem?\n  Economists around the country and many Members of this body believe \nthat the overregulation of the American economy is why we can't grow \nthis economy. This Senator thinks it is often looked at as a partisan \nissue. It is not a partisan issue. To the contrary, it is a consensus \nissue about the impact of regulations on the American economy.\n  To give a couple of examples, here is how The Economist put it in a \n2012 cover story titled ``Over-Regulated America.'' The redtape is \nright here. This lead article in The Economist said a couple of years \nago that ``America needs a smarter approach to regulations'' that will \n``mitigate a real danger: that regulations may crush the life out of \nAmerica's economy.''\n  There is a real danger that regulations will crush the life out of \nthe American economy. I think that is already happening. Again, this is \nnot a partisan issue. Many Democrats in this body have called for a \nsmarter approach to Federal regulations.\n  Governors, particularly Democratic Governors across the country, have \nalso decried the overregulation of our economy. For example, the two-\nterm Massachusetts Governor, Deval Patrick, made regulatory reform a \nhallmark of his administration's approach to growing their economy, and \nit is not just Democratic Governors. It is actually Democratic \nPresidents. In 2011, Newsweek featured a cover story with President \nClinton's face on the cover that highlighted his 14 ideas to grow the \neconomy and create jobs. In the article, President Clinton lamented the \nlong wait time for permanent approvals for infrastructure projects \nthroughout the country due to overregulation.\n  One of President Clinton's top recommendations to put hardworking \nAmericans back to work was to speed up the regulatory approval process \nand grant States waivers on burdensome Federal environmental rules to \nhasten the time that construction projects can begin and real \nhardworking Americans can work.\n  Even President Obama in his recent State of the Union Address focused \non regulations. The President of the United States said:\n\n       I think there are outdated regulations that need to be \n     changed. There is red tape that needs to be cut.\n\n  President Obama stated this just a few weeks ago. As a matter of \nfact, it was the biggest applause line of the entire evening. Democrats \nand Republicans roared at this. The President recognized what redtape \nis doing to this great economy.\n  So I took the liberty to write the President after his State of the \nUnion Address, commending him for his focus on regulations, and asked \nhim to get his administration to back my RED Tape Act and to follow \nthrough on his promise to reach across the aisle for good ideas to grow \nthe economy. This is one that would strengthen our economy, create jobs \nfor hard-working middle-class Americans, union workers, and pave the \npath for what we haven't seen in over a decade, a private sector that \nis thriving. That is the heart of the American dream.\n  Before I get into details, let me spend a few minutes on the economy \nand why I believe we must pass this amendment. Our debt is approaching \n$20 trillion. The national debt of the United States has increased more \nunder President Obama's two terms than it has under all previous \nadministrations in U.S. history. Of course, one of the reasons is we \nare spending too much, but this Senator believes the biggest reason is \nthat we cannot grow this economy.\n  The U.S. average economic growth rate for almost our entire history \nas a country, from 1790 to 2014, has averaged about 3.7 percent GDP \ngrowth. That is real American growth. For over 200 years there has been \nups and downs, but the average has been about 4 percent GDP growth. \nThis is what has made us great as a nation. The Obama administration's \naverage GDP growth is about 1.5 percent--dramatically less than the \ntraditional levels of American growth that we need. As a matter of \nfact, officially this recovery has been the weakest in over 70 years.\n  While the American people might not have all these specific numbers \nat hand, they know something is wrong. They know they are not finding \nthe good jobs, that they are not getting the raises in the jobs they \nhave. They know their family's budget isn't stretching as far as it \nused to stretch. This should not be the case.\n  We live in the greatest Nation in the world. We have so many \nadvantages over other countries. Our high-tech sector is still the most \ninnovative in the world, an efficient agriculture sector feeds the \nworld, and our universities are the best universities in the world by \nfar. We are in a renaissance in energy production with renewables, oil, \nand gas that have once again made us a superpower in the world, one of \nthe best managed, highly productive fisheries in the world from my \nState in Alaska, and we certainly have the most professional, lethal \nmilitary in the world. We have so many advantages over every other \ncountry in the world. So why aren't we growing our economy? Why can't \nour economy expand at traditional levels of American growth?\n  Look at this chart behind me. This clearly to me and to many others \nis one of the reasons: new regulation on top of old regulation on top \nof old regulation--a steady increase year after year, starting here in \n1976 with no end in sight, an explosion that is going to keep going \nuntil we do something about it. Through these regulations the Federal \nGovernment is looking to regulate every aspect of the American economy, \nand that is one of the main reasons why we can't grow.\n  When it was first published in 1936, the Federal Register, which \ncontained a daily digest of proposed regulations from agencies and \nfinal rules and notices, was about 2,500 pages. By the end of 2014, the \nFederal Register had ballooned to close to 78,000 pages. What we are \nseeing is an explosion of regulations.\n  This chart relates directly to why I believe we can't grow our \neconomy. Remember regulations are taxes. They cost American families, \nAmerican consumers, and American small businesses. There are huge costs \nto this explosion, particularly when they accumulate like this.\n  President Obama's Small Business Administration puts the number of \nthe annual cost of regulation that impacts the U.S. economy at about \n$1.8 trillion per year. That is a number that would make it one of the \nlargest economies in the world. That is about $15,000 per American \nhousehold, about 29 percent of the average American family budget. That \nis what we are doing to our families and our economy.\n  I believe a huge part of the problem of what is keeping our economy \nback and the opportunities for middle-class families is right here in \nthis town. The Federal Government, with agencies and the alphabet soup \nof agencies--the IRS, the BLM, the EPA--are constantly promulgating new \nregulations. What they don't do is they never remove old regulations. \nFrom across the country, whether it is Alaska or Maine, our businesses, \nour citizens, and particularly the most vulnerable, our families, are \nbeing impacted by the explosion of regulations from the Federal \nGovernment right here in Washington, DC.\n  Let me give you a few examples. On the North Slope of Alaska they \ncan't get small portable incinerators that comply with the upcoming EPA \nregulations, so the trash in these amazing communities in my State \npiles up until it is actually taken out by airplane. This is polar bear \ncountry. This is dangerous--trash everywhere. It is certainly harmful \nto the environment because regulations don't allow incinerators.\n\n  Because of the Federal roadless rule in Southeast Alaska, we can't \neven build new alternative energy plants for the citizens of my State \nwho desperately need energy because we pay some of the highest costs of \nany State in the country with regard to energy. Nationally, bridges are \ncrumbling, and we cannot get them built, in large part because of the \noverburdensome Federal regulations.\n  On average, it takes over 5 years to permit a bridge in the United \nStates--not to build a bridge, just to get the Federal Government's \npermission to build a bridge. Right now there are 61,000 bridges in our \ncountry in need of repair, but burdensome regulations delay commonsense \nrepairs. These bridges are being crossed by our\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\ntrucks, carrying the Nation's commerce, our children, schoolbuses, and \nparents trying to get home for dinner. Thousands of communities across \nthe country are simply keeping their fingers crossed, hoping their \ncurrent bridges last another year.\n  Let me provide one more example in terms of what is happening with \nregard to the overregulation of our economy. This involves one of the \nmost important sectors of the U.S. economy--small community banks. Over \n1,300 small community banks have disappeared since 2010, and only 2 new \nbanks in the United States have been chartered in the last 5 years. If \nyou ask any small community banker what is driving this, they will \npoint to this chart. Regulations from Washington, DC, are driving our \nsmall community banks out of existence. Even during the Great \nDepression, we had on average 19 new banks a year. In the last 5 years, \nthe United States has seen two new banks chartered in our country.\n  So what do we do? Well, the good news is that many colleagues in the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle have offered suggestions and \nintroduced bills to stop the redtape, to stop this trajectory of \nFederal regulations from strangling our economy and our future. But we \nneed something that is simple, something that hard-working Americans \nunderstand, and something that is bold to take on this challenge. I \nbelieve the amendment I have offered to the Energy bill, the RED Tape \nAct, is both simple and bold enough to take on this challenge. It is \nonly 5 pages long. Using a simple one-in, one-out method, it caps \nFederal regulations. New regulations that cause a financial or \nadministrative burden on the economy, on hard-working American, on \nmiddle-class families, on union workers would need to be offset by \nrepealing an existing regulation. Simple--you issue a new regulation, \nyou repeal an old regulation. People understand that and it makes \nsense.\n  This is not a radical idea. This is not some kind of poison pill that \nwe want to attach to the Energy bill, because I think that is a good \nbill. It is an idea that is gaining consensus not only throughout the \ncountry but throughout the world. Other countries have actually taken \nup this idea to fix their regulatory problems as well. In Canada, they \nrecently put an administrative fix to their regulations that was one-\nin, one-out. In Great Britain they have done this to the point where it \nis viewed as so successful that they are not talking about one-in, one-\nout anymore, they are talking about maybe one-in, two-out. So I think \nthis is an idea that both parties of the Senate, Members from both \nsides of the aisle, can get behind.\n  Even National Public Radio did a recent story about how well this \none-in, one-out rule is working in Canada. It has freed up hundreds of \nthousands of hours of paperwork for small businesses in particular. \nEven the Canadian Socialists have backed this idea. I certainly hope \nSenator Sanders is listening, and I hope I can get him and other \nMembers of this body to support this amendment.\n  To be clear, I am certainly not against all regulations or permitting \nrequirements. When I served as the commissioner of the Department of \nNatural Resources in Alaska, we worked with our bipartisan legislature \nto overhaul our permitting and regulatory system and to bring what we \nhave seen on the Federal Government side--a huge backlog of permits--to \nget projects moving. We brought that backlog down by over 50 percent \nthrough regulatory and permitting reform, and we did so with the \nabsolute understanding that protecting our environment and keeping our \ncitizens safe was a fundamental precondition to any of our actions. But \nwe can do both. We can bring down this huge burden and still make sure \nwe have a clean environment and a strong, healthy economy.\n  There are simply too many Federal regulations out there, and the \nAmerican people know it. It is time this body stops increasing this \nnumber of regulations and puts a cap on it.\n  Finally, if we do this, we will make sure that all of the comparative \nadvantages we have in this country--so many that we have over so many \nother countries--will enable us to unleash the might of the U.S. \neconomy, create better jobs, and create a brighter future for our \nchildren and their children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the fundamental purposes of this \nbody is to debate some of the biggest issues facing this Nation and to \ndo so in an honorable way. The Senate is for debate but not as an \nabstraction. It is to be addressing and ultimately solving the meatiest \nchallenges the Constitution demands that we tackle. Unfortunately, a \ngreat deal of our debate is weak and embarrassing. Much of it falls off \nthe trivial side of the cliff or the shrill side of the cliff.\n  During my time serving Nebraskans in this place, I hope to be aligned \nwith those who want fighting and debating in this place, but it needs \nto be meaningful fighting. It needs to be honorable, honest debating.\n  To that end, there is a terrific column this week by Pete Wehner in \nCommentary magazine. Partly because the column is about Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, at whose desk I intentionally sit, partly because it is about \nC.S. Lewis, a man whose writings have changed my life, and partly \nbecause it is just darn good exhortation to us, I would like to read a \nportion of this column into the Senate Record today.\n  Wehner begins:\n\n       While reading Gregory Weiner's fascinating book ``American \n     Burke,'' I came across this comment: ``(Daniel Patrick) \n     Moynihan's intellectual curiosity was such that he gravitated \n     toward thinkers with whom he disagreed precisely because he \n     disagreed with them and could consequently learn from them.\n       This observation reminded me of an incident in 1948 \n     involving C.S. Lewis and Elizabeth Anscombe, a Catholic \n     convert who was considered one of the most brilliant moral \n     philosophers of her generation.\n       Lewis was president of the Oxford Socratic Club, an open \n     forum that met every Monday evening and whose purpose was to \n     discuss the intellectual difficulties connected with \n     religion, and with Christianity in particular.\n       ``In any fairly large and talkative community such as a \n     university--\n\n  And, I would add, such as a Senate--\n\n     there is always the danger that those who think alike should \n     gather together into `coteries' where they will henceforth \n     encounter opposition only in the emasculated form of rumor \n     that the outsiders say thus and thus,''. . . .\n       The absent are easily refuted, complacent dogmatism \n     thrives, and differences of opinion are embittered by group \n     hostility. Each group hears not the best, but the worst, that \n     the other groups can say. . . .\n       On February 2, 1948, Anscombe and Lewis debated a portion \n     of Lewis's book ``Miracles,'' with Anscombe reading a paper \n     pointing out ``a fatal flaw in Lewis's argument,''. . . (It \n     was a complicated critique having to do with the conflation \n     of irrational and nonrational factors in belief-formation.) \n     The result of the debate, which Lewis himself felt he lost, \n     was revisions to his book. Anscombe, while not convinced by \n     the changes made by Lewis, did say ``the fact that Lewis \n     rewrote that chapter, and rewrote it so that it now has these \n     qualities, shows his honesty and seriousness.''\n       That's not all. When Lewis was asked to nominate speakers \n     for the 1951 Socratic Club season, Anscombe was his first \n     choice. ``That lady is quite right to refute what she thinks \n     bad theistic arguments, but does this not almost oblige her \n     as a Christian to find good ones in their place: having \n     obliterated me as an Apologist ought she not to succeed me?''\n       There is something impressive in the qualities demonstrated \n     by Moynihan and Lewis: a willingness to learn from others, \n     including those with whom we disagree. There is in this an \n     admirable blend of intellectual humility and self-\n     confidence--the humility to know that at best we possess only \n     a partial understanding of the truth, which can always be \n     enlarged; and the self-confidence that allows for refinement \n     and amendment of our views in light of new arguments, new \n     circumstances, new insights.\n       Beyond that, it's a useful reminder that the quality we \n     ought to strive for isn't certitude but to be a seeker of \n     truth. That is, I think, what separates ideologues from true \n     intellectuals. The former is determined to defend a pre-\n     existing position come what may, interpreting facts to fit a \n     worldview that is already well beyond challenge. The latter \n     seeks genuine enlightenment and is eager to discard false \n     notions they may\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\n     hold--and values rather than resents those who help them on \n     that journey.\n       The purpose of debating, then, isn't so much just to win an \n     argument as it is to deepen our understanding of how things \n     really and truly are. It isn't to out-shout an opponent but, \n     at least now and then, to listen to them, to weight their \n     arguments with care, and even to learn from them. It's worth \n     noting that Lewis warned about simply surrounding ourselves \n     with like-minded people who reinforce our own biases and how \n     debates conducted properly ``helped to civilize one \n     another.''\n       What a quaint notion.\n       In saying all this, I'm not insisting that everyone you \n     disagree with is someone you can learn from, nor that \n     everyone's views contain an equal measure of wisdom. Some \n     people really don't know what they're talking about, some \n     people really do hold pernicious and false views, and some \n     people really do deserve harsh criticisms.\n       My point is simply that because the pull is so strong the \n     other way--most of us use debates as a way to amplify pre-\n     existing views rather than refine them; try to crush \n     opponents rather than engage and understand them; and focus \n     on the weakest rather than the strongest arguments found in \n     opposing views--the Moynihan-Lewis model is a good one to \n     strive for.\n\n  Wehner continues:\n\n       I understand that talking about such things can sound \n     hopelessly high-minded and, for some, signal a mushy lack of \n     conviction. When you're in a political death match with the \n     other side, after all, the idea of learning from it seems \n     either ridiculously naive or slightly treasonous. But of \n     course, this reaction highlights just how much things have \n     gone off track.\n       To be sure, American politics has always been a raucous \n     affair. As Madison put it in Federalist #55, ``Had every \n     Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly \n     would still have been a mob.'' The question is whether one \n     stokes the passions of the mob or appeals to reason.\n       As someone who doesn't do nearly well enough in this \n     regard, I rather admire the Lewis model. He was a better man, \n     and Miracles was a better book, for having recognized he lost \n     his debate with Ms. Anscombe. For Lewis to then promote her \n     despite having been bested by her was doubly impressive, yet \n     in some respects not surprising. After all, Lewis was a man \n     who cared more about striving after truth than in attending \n     to his pride. He cared more about learning from arguments \n     than winning them.\n       So should we.\n\n  Again, this was Pete Wehner, Commentary Magazine, with some \ninstructive words for all of us laboring here in this body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are winding down the day here. We \nhave had a good opportunity for good discussion and debate about the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act. We took votes on three amendments, and \nwe just concluded voice votes on six additional ones on top of the two \nvoice votes that we had. So we are moving through some of the \namendments, and I think that bodes well for us.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we will hopefully have an opportunity to line \nup a series of votes in advance so that when Members come back next \nweek we all know where we will be going and the direction. I wish to \ntake just a few minutes tonight, before we wrap things up, to talk \nabout a section in the bill that I believe is very important--not only \nimportant to the Energy Policy Modernization Act but really very \nimportant to our Nation as a whole.\n  The Presiding Officer and I hail from a State that has been an oil \nproducer for decades now. It is oil that sustains us, fills our \ncoffers, and allows for us to have an economy that is thriving and \nstrong. It is struggling right now as we look at low production \ncombined with low cost, but we also are a State that enjoys great \nresources when it comes to our minerals.\n  We have long talked in this body over the course of years about the \nvulnerability that we have as a nation when we have to rely on others \nfor our energy resources. We talk about energy independence, we talk \nabout energy security, and, I think we recognize that when we can \nproduce more on our own without others, it makes us less vulnerable.\n  Energy security translates to national security. I think we pretty \nmuch got that message around here, and we are doing more within this \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act to make sure that we are less reliant \non others for our energy sources, whether it is what we are doing to \nproduce more fossil fuels or being able to leverage technologies that \nwill allow us to access our renewable resources in a way that is \nstronger and more robust, again to ensure we have greater energy \nsecurity.\n  When we think about energy security, we should not forget mineral \nsecurity--the minerals that also help to make us a great nation, and a \nnation that is less vulnerable when we are able to produce more of our \nown.\n  For several Congresses--this is actually the third consecutive \nCongress--I have introduced legislation on this subject. It is a bill \nthat I have titled the ``American Mineral Security Act.'' What we have \ndone within the energy bill is take much of that legislation and \ninclude it as part of a subtitle on critical minerals. Maybe it is \nbecause I authored it, but I feel pretty strongly that this is a pretty \ngood version. This is a pretty good title that is contained in the \nEPMA, and I think that passage of not only the critical minerals piece \nas part of EPMA is key for our economic security, energy security, and \nour national security. It is just the right thing for us to be doing.\n  We take for granted that our minerals and metals that we have \navailable to us are going to continue to be available. Unfortunately, \nmost of us do not really pay attention to the fact that so many of the \nthings that we rely on for so much of what we need in our everyday \nworld come from minerals. We just do not think about it. We assume that \nstuff just gets here. We do not think about where it comes from. We \nshould not ever take for granted our mineral security. We should not \never take for granted what it is that we need.\n  People talk about rare earth elements, rare earth minerals. When we \nthink ``rare,'' what is ``rare''? What exactly does that mean? Why do \nwe need them? What do we use them in? Rare earth elements make many \naspects of our modern life possible.\n  We talk a lot about how we are going to move to more renewable energy \nsources. You are going to need rare earth elements for wind turbines. \nYou are going to need it for your solar panels. You are going to need \nit for your rechargeable batteries. You are going to need it for your \nhard drives, your smartphones, and the screens on your computer. You \nare going to need it for your digital cameras, for your defense \napplications, for audio amplification. That is just what we put on this \nparticular chart.\n\n  It is important to recognize that so much of what allows us to do the \ngood things that we do--to communicate, to help defend, to help power \nour country--comes to us because we have access to certain minerals.\n  According to the National Research Council, more than 25,000 pounds \nof new minerals are needed per person per year in the United States to \nmake the items that we use for basic human needs, infrastructure, \nenergy, transportation, communication, and defense. You might say: \nWhoa, 25,000 pounds per person per year--I cannot possibly need all \nthat stuff.\n  But, Mr. President, you and I fly back and forth to Alaska. Those \nairplanes we fly on need these minerals. Every one of these young \npeople, as well as us sitting in here, all have a smartphone or some \nway we are communicating, and we all need this. All of the staff who \nare working on their computers need that screen to look at, and we all \nneed this.\n  When you think about it, it is like OK, maybe that number is right. \nBill Gates put it quite memorably last year. He wrote a blog post \nentitled: ``Have You Hugged a Concrete Pillar Today?'' It is really a \nvery interesting read, and it reminds us that you take for granted the \nthings that we need, the things that we use on a daily basis, the \nthings that are under our feet as we are walking here to work.\n  Minerals and metals are really the foundation of our modern society. \nOur access to them enables a range of products and technologies that \ngreatly add to our quality of life. Yet many of the\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\ntrends are going in the wrong direction, which creates vulnerabilities \nfor our country.\n  We have a real problem on our hands right now as a result of this \nreliance on minerals and the fact that so many of our minerals that we \nneed today we must import. You are thinking: 25,000 pounds per person \nper year is a lot; where are we getting it from? How much of it are we \nrelying on other countries, asking their permission to bring it in?\n  It is not just rare earth elements. The reality is that the United \nStates now depends on many, many other nations for a vast array of \nminerals and metals. We have the numbers to back that up. In 1978 the \nU.S. Geological Survey reported that the United States was importing at \nleast 50 percent of our supply of 25 minerals, and 100 percent of 7.\n  We recently got the latest figures from the USGS. Our foreign mineral \ndependence is now far deeper. In 2015, last year, we imported at least \n50 percent of 47 different minerals, including 100 percent of 19 of \nthem. On this list you have the minerals for which we are 100-percent \nreliant on foreign nations, whether it is bauxite, cesium--which we \nhave in Alaska--graphite--which we have in Alaska--indium, iodine, \nmanganese, mica, niobium, quartz, crystal. I am going to stop now \nbecause they get more difficult to pronounce.\n  These are the minerals that we are 100-percent reliant on other \nnations for. What do we use them in? We use them in transistors, \nelectrical components, mirrors, rubber, vacuum tubes, photo cells, \nbicycles, fishing rods, golf iron shafts, baseball bats, defense \napplications, medical equipment, atomic clocks, aluminum, glass, \nenamel, batteries, gaskets, brake lining, fire retardant, magnets. \nAgain, that is just what we can put on the charts.\n  We are 100-percent reliant on other countries for some of the things \nthat are basic everyday products that we do not think about. Again, we \ntake for granted that these things are going to continue to be readily \navailable--that it is always going to be there for us.\n  For example, look at the cell phone. Let us look at the elements that \nit takes to make a smartphone. When you look at what goes into the \nsmartphone, for your screen, indium is part of the screen. Alumina and \nsilica are part of the screen. It is a variety of rare earth. All of \nthese rare earths that we are looking at are 100-percent reliant on \nother nations for what goes into the screen.\n  For the battery for your smartphone, we have lithium, graphite, and \nmanganese. Manganese and graphite are 100-percent reliant on foreign \nsources. We are 50-percent reliant on lithium.\n  You have tantalum, and we are 100-percent reliant on that. There is \ntin, lead, copper, silver. We are 70-percent reliant on tin. It goes to \nshow that the things that we take for granted, the things that we are \nall using all the time to communicate, to send messages home, to do our \nbusiness, we cannot have them unless we get this from somebody else, \nfrom some other country. There are options for us though, just as there \nare options for us with energy sources. We can find ways to help us \nproduce more when it comes to minerals and mineral capacity so that we \nare less reliant.\n  We had a hearing before our energy committee, and we had a witness by \nthe name of Dan McGroarty, who leads the American Resources Policy \nNetwork. He provided some pretty good examples of our Nation's foreign \nmineral dependence. He pointed out that the minerals needed for clean \nenergy technologies often come from abroad, threatening our ability to \nmanufacture those technologies here at home. This is what he wrote in \nhis prepared testimony:\n\n       Graphite is key to [electric vehicle] batteries and energy \n     storage. The U.S. produces zero natural graphite--we are 100 \n     percent import dependent.\n       Indium is needed for flat-screen TVs and solar photovoltaic \n     panels. Most indium is derived from zinc mining--the U.S. is \n     81 percent dependent for the zinc we use, and we produce \n     zero indium.\n       Thin-film solar panels are made of C-I-G-S materials--those \n     letters stand for Copper, Indium, Gallium, and Selenium. We \n     have a 600,000 metric ton copper gap at present--demand \n     exceeding supply. Selenium is recovered from copper \n     processing.\n       Gallium comes from aluminum processing--we are 99% import-\n     dependent--and we are closing American aluminum smelters at a \n     record pace.\n\n  Mr. McGroarty also highlighted the national security implications of \nour foreign mineral dependence, explaining:\n\n       We need rhenium for high-strength alloy in the jet turbines \n     in the F-35 and other fighter aircraft. Rhenium is dependent \n     on copper processing--and we are 83% import-dependent. \n     Congress has directed the Defense Department to purchase \n     electrolytic manganese, used in key super-alloys, for the \n     [defense stockpile]--the U.S. produces zero manganese. We \n     need rare earths in too many applications to list: Wind \n     turbines, lasers for medical and national security \n     applications, smart phones and smart bombs. We produce zero \n     rare earths--and we are once again 100% dependent on China.\n\n  You may recall not too many years ago now when there was a little bit \nof an issue going on between Japan and China. China withheld delivery \nof certain rare earth elements that Japan needed for its manufacturing. \nChina was holding the keys. China is holding the keys with many of \nthese minerals.\n  Our foreign dependence is dangerous enough. You know that full well, \nMr. President. The concentration of our foreign supply presents \nadditional challenges. Our minerals often come from a handful of \ncountries that are less than stable or that might be willing to cut off \nthe supply to us to serve their own purposes or to meet their own \nneeds. They are going to take care of themselves first. If they do not \nhave much supply, they are going to help themselves first.\n  When I look at our foreign mineral dependence and where those \nminerals are coming from, I see reason after reason to be concerned. It \nis not hard to see the prospect of a day of reckoning when this will \nbecome real to all of us, when we simply cannot acquire a mineral or \nwhen the market for a mineral changes so dramatically that entire \nindustries are affected.\n  To put it even more bluntly, our foreign mineral dependence is a \nmounting threat to our economy, to our national security, and to our \ninternational competitiveness. We cannot lose sight of that \ninternational competitiveness. The absence of just one critical mineral \nor metal could disrupt entire technologies, entire industries, and \ncreate a ripple effect throughout our entire economy.\n  I think it is well past time for us to be taking this seriously. We \nhave seen some good signs from the administration. However, the reality \nis that our executive agencies are not as coordinated about this as \nthey really should be. They do not have all of the statutory \nauthorities needed to make the necessary progress on this issue.\n  There is just no substitute for legislation, and that is why I am \nvery pleased that the members of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee accepted my language in our bill to rebuild this mineral \nsupply chain. We did this in committee with almost no substantive \nchanges.\n  When it comes to permitting delays for new mines--you have heard me \nsay this before--our Nation is among the worst in the world. We are \nalmost dead last. We are stumbling right out of the gate, right out of \nthe very start of the supply chain, and then we do not ever seem to be \nable to catch up.\n  Where do you place the blame? The fall begins with us here. When we \ndecide that a mineral is critical, we need to understand what we have. \nWe need to survey our lands. We need to determine the extent of our \nresource base so we know what we can produce right here at home. If we \ndo not know, it makes it pretty difficult to get anybody interested in \nproduction. We should keep working on alternatives, on efficiency, and \nrecycling options. That is not what this is about. We need to keep \ndoing that, especially for those minerals where our Nation does not and \nwill not ever have significant abundance there.\n  We should build out a forecasting capability so that we can gain a \nbetter understanding of mineral-related trends and also an early \nwarning when we see that there might be issues arising. We also need to \nhave a qualified workforce. We need to make sure that we have those \nthat can access this mineral resource, this mineral wealth.\n  The United States right now is down to a handful of mining schools. A \nlarge share of their faculty will be eligible to retire in the near \nfuture. We need some smart, young people who are interested and want to \ngo into these fields.\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\n  Provisions to tackle all of these challenges are contained within the \nbill. They have good support. The Director of the United States \nGeological Survey, the CEOs of the Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers, and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association \nare among some. State witnesses, former military officials, and many \nothers have endorsed this approach. We have a good opportunity to bring \nour mineral policies into the 21st century, and the mineral subtitle in \nthis bipartisan Energy bill offers us that chance.\n\n  I want to note the other members of the energy committee who have \nbeen very helpful in helping to advance this legislation. Senator Risch \nwas very helpful as was Senator Crapo of Idaho and Senator Heller. They \nwere all cosponsors of the original bill with me. There were many other \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle in recent Congresses, and we \nalso thank the Presiding Officer for his support as well.\n  I also wish to acknowledge Secretary Moniz, the Secretary of Energy, \nand his team over there at DOE, and Director Kimball, who is the \nDirector of the U.S. Geological Survey. They helped us a lot when it \ncame to drafting this bill, and I thank them for that.\n  I have consumed more time than I should, but I hope everyone can hear \nthe enthusiasm I have in ensuring that as we modernize our energy \npolicies, we do not take a step forward to help address what we need to \ndo on the energy front and fail to bring along the growing concerns \nthat we have in needing to modernize and understand our mineral \nresources and how we can ensure that there is that level of true energy \nsecurity that helps us with our economic security and certainly our \nnational security.\n  With that, I see that my colleague from Alabama is here, so I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska \nfor her leadership and comments on this bill, and I will have thoughts \non that subject as we go forward. We have had some good things happen \nin energy, and we need to keep having that happen. Energy serves the \nAmerican people. A low cost of energy is a blessing, a high cost of \nenergy is a detriment to working families.\n  I truly believe we need to make clear to the American people that \nthose of us, like the Senator from Alaska who fought to increase \nproduction of energy, have done so not to provide a profit to private \ncompanies but to have created a situation in which the price of energy \nwould decline. We have had a large surge in energy, and sure enough the \nprices have declined. I think that is a good thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S334-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S334-S335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some thoughts tonight, \nbefore we go out, about the trade issue this Nation is facing, and it \nis a highly significant issue. The President is expected to sign the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership on February 4. It is a historic event. It \ncannot become law of the United States of America. It is detrimental to \nthis economy. It is particularly detrimental to people who go to work \nevery day and would like more jobs. They would like higher paying jobs \nand better benefits. It is detrimental to that, and we are going to \nestablish that point. We have a Presidential campaign going on today \nand people need to talk about it. The American people need to know \nwhere their candidates stand on it.\n  Well, let me share a few thoughts tonight and begin this discussion. \nThe President is expected to sign the agreement on February 4. He \nnegotiated this agreement with 11 different countries in the Pacific \nregion. At some point he will implement legislation and then Congress \nwill vote on whether to go forward. The legislation is part of the \nfast-track process, so it will not be filibustered. The bill will come \nup on a simple majority vote. No amendments will be allowed. It will \nsimply be an up-or-down vote.\n  What is happening in the world trade market today? On Monday, January \n25 of this week, Ford announced that they were leaving the Japanese and \nIndonesian markets. Indonesia and Japan are good friends of ours. They \nare good countries, but they are tough trading partners. Why did Ford \nleave Japan? They sell automobiles all over the world. They sell them \nin Europe, Mexico, and South America. Why are they not able to compete \nin Japan?\n  What did Ford say? They said that nontariff barriers have prevented \nthem from selling cars in the market. In 2015, Ford sold less than \n5,000 cars in Japan, representing six-tenths of 1 percent of the \nJapanese automobile market. In fact, only 6 percent of the automobiles \nsold in Japan are manufactured outside of Japan. It is not a question \nof tariffs. That is not the problem in dealing with Japan and importing \ncars into Japan. The Japanese have erected substantial nontariff \nbarriers. In fact, Hyundai, a very fine South Korean automobile company \nin my state, attempted to sell in Japan for some time, and they \nrecently gave up.\n  What is the policy of Japan? The truth is Japan talks about free \ntrade, but like most of our Asian allies and trading competitors, they \nare mercantile. The essence of having a successful mercantile economy \nis to export more and import less. This is the reality we are dealing \nwith. The people who are and have been negotiating our trade agreements \ndon't seem to understand this or don't care. In fact, they basically \nsay: Well, if someone sells a product cheaper here, we don't care. We \nwill buy it. They don't worry if we can't sell products in their \ncountry.\n  A trading agreement is a contract between two nations--we were all \ntaught that in law school--and it should serve the interests of both \nparties. When a contract ceases to advantage both parties, you abandon \nthe contract. It shouldn't be signed or it should end.\n  What else about this agreement? It creates an international \ncommission--a commission of the 11 or 12 countries, including the \nUnited States. The language, by definition of our own administration, \nis that the agreement is a living agreement.\n  The Presiding Officer is a fine lawyer. He has worked at the court of \nappeals. I know a living agreement makes the hair on the back of his \nneck stand up. It makes you nervous. A living agreement is no agreement \nat all. It can just be changed. They acknowledge and repeatedly say in \nthe fast-track documents that nations can meet and change the agreement \nanytime they want. They can update it for changed circumstances, which \nis what activist judges say when they redefine the meaning of the U.S. \nConstitution. They like to say that they are updating it for changed \ncircumstances.\n  Well, Congress is supposed to do that, it seems to me, but anyway \nthis agreement is a living agreement. It contains 5,554 pages. It is \ntwice the length of the Holy Scriptures. It includes section 27, which \nsets up an international commission with nearly unregulated power. In \nfact, our own U.S. Trade Representatives--our own Web site--states that \nthe Commission is formed ``to enable the updating of the agreement as \nappropriate to address trade issues that emerge in the future as well \nas new issues that arise with the expansion of the agreement to include \nnew countries.'' Congress would be launching such an event into the \nfuture. Well, what is our problem?\n  Well, what is one of the major problems that we have today? It is our \nsubstantial trade deficit. One report, which I think is probably \nconservative, says that one-half of 1 percent of the GDP has been lost \nin the United States as a result of our trade deficit. That is probably \nan acceptable economic estimate, and that is significant. When you have \n2 percent GDP, you are losing 25 percent based on the trade deficit. We \nhave to have growth in this country, more GDP, more Americans working, \nmore people with better jobs and better pay, and part of that is \nmanufacturing.\n  The final figures for 2015 are expected to show that the bilateral \ntrade deficit with China is increased to 8 percent to a record of \naround $365 billion. China is not a part of these 12 nations, but it \nhas openly been said that they could be made a part of it in the future \nif countries vote them in.\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute, growing U.S. trade \ndeficits with China through 2013 eliminated 3.2 million jobs. Is that \nan accurate figure? I don't know for sure, but no one\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\ndisputes that trade deficits with China have cost more than 1 million \njobs. When you lose 1 million jobs, people go on welfare, need \nunemployment compensation or retire early. All of these are damaging \nevents to the American economy.\n  The White House claims that this Trans-Pacific Partnership \nAgreement--this trade agreement--is critical to limit China's economic \ninfluence. We are going to hear about that a lot. We are going to hear \nthe national security argument. However, a new study just released this \nmonth by the World Bank shows that China will actually see an increase \nin export potential if the TPP is approved by Congress. It is not going \nto constrict China. The World Bank says it is going to increase China's \nability to export.\n  The report by the World Bank stated that the overall impact on China \nwould be ``really negligible.'' It is not a good argument to state that \nit is somehow going to boost other economies in the United States as it \nrelates to China. China is not going to be hurt by this agreement.\n  The World Bank study further reports that Japan would see an extra \neconomic growth of 2.7 percent by 2030 while the United States could \nexpect only nominal growth of perhaps four-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute states that the TPP \ncould slow the reshoring of American jobs, especially in the automobile \nsector.\n  We have had a nice development in recent years. My State has \nbenefited so tremendously from foreign automobile investments. Instead \nof making automobiles in Korea, Germany, and Japan, they built plants \naround the country, and some were built in my home State of Alabama, \nand make the automobiles there.\n  I don't think there is any doubt that this agreement could reduce job \nreshoring because there is a small tariff on imported automobiles and \nthat would be eliminated so that little advantage in moving a plant to \nthe United States would be lost.\n  Get this. The Fact Checker at the Washington Post gave the \nPresident's claim that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would create \n650,000 jobs four Pinocchios. That is a pretty bad falsehood. They \nought to give it five Pinocchios.\n  Let's talk about reality. I have talked about trade agreements. \nRepublicans favor trade agreements. I favor trade agreements, but they \nhave to be good agreements. You have to be careful. What about this \nKorea trade agreement with our friends in South Korea. They are smart \nnegotiators. Last year our trade deficit with South Korea from January \nto November--we don't have the numbers for December yet--was $26 \nbillion. Maybe the rest of the year will be about $28 to $29 billion. \nThat would be about 15 percent higher than last year's trade deficit \nwith South Korea.\n  President Obama signed the agreement in 2010. When he signed it, \nPresident Obama promised that the South Korea trade deal would increase \nAmerican exports to South Korea by $11 billion a year. All right. I \nwant to be cooperative. We like our allies in South Korea, and I voted \nfor the agreement. But what happened? Over 11 months of last year the \nUnited States exported 1.2 billion more than we did when the deal was \nsigned in 2010--not $10 or $11 billion more, $1.2 billion. The year \nbefore that it was $0.8 billion. We haven't seen a surge of exports to \nSouth Korea. Didn't the negotiators know that? They told us \ndifferently.\n\n  What about South Korea's imports to the United States--their exports \nto the United States; what about them? They have risen not $1 billion \nbut instead $20 billion. Since 2010 our trade deficit with South Korea \nhas risen nearly 260 percent, from $10 billion in 2010 to about $28 \nbillion last year. That is a stunning development.\n  So we are going to have to vote on this. And we have been told and we \nhave beliefs that things are going to be better than that. It is not \nhappening in that way. I urge us to study the facts and figures to be \nrealistic. Trade is a good thing, and I have been a supporter. But it \nis not a religion with me. It is a contract. It is a deal, and deals \nare to serve the interests of the American people. It has not been \ndoing so. Even the Peterson Institute, which supports these trade \nagreements, said there would be 120,000 fewer manufacturing jobs over \nthe next 9 years if this agreement takes place in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I see our leader. He has had a busy week. I appreciate \nthe opportunity to share these remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JOHN CHOWNING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a good friend \nof mine and a friend to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dr. John \nChowning, who served as the vice president for church and external \nrelations and executive assistant to the president at Campbellsville \nUniversity, has recently retired from that post after more than a \nquarter century with that institution. I know he is going to be greatly \nmissed by his colleagues, by the higher education community across the \nState, and by all of us who work on and care about education issues.\n  Dr. Chowning first became involved in fundraising for Campbellsville \nUniversity in 1989. He became a member of the university's board of \ntrustees in 1992. He served on that board for 7 years, including \nservice as board chair. Then he became a full-time employee in 1998. He \ntaught at the school for several years as an adjunct in the political \nscience department and served as chair of the university's diversity \ncommittee, strategic planning, and university council.\n  In his various roles throughout the years, Dr. Chowning has taken the \nlead or been a major influence on several important issues. He \nestablished a dialogue on race to foster racial reconciliation. He led \nGreater Campbellsville United, an organization that strives to create \nopportunity for all residents of the Campbellsville-Taylor County \nregion. He helped found the Campbellsville-Taylor County Economic \nDevelopment Authority and served as its chairman.\n  Working with the Economic Development Authority, he led the way to \ncreate a dislocated worker program in Campbellsville when a factory in \nthe region closed and caused jobs to leave the area. And I am proud of \nthe work he and I did together to help create the university's \nTechnology Training Center, a partnership with local governments and \nCampbellsville University to provide training to the local workforce.\n  The list of people who are congratulating Dr. Chowning on a \nremarkable career of service is long, and I am proud to add my name to \nthat list. I am pleased by the fact that Dr. Chowning will remain on in \na part-time capacity so Campbellsville University and the Commonwealth \ncan continue to reap the benefit of his knowledge, wisdom, and \nexperience. I want to wish him and his family the very best as he \nbegins this new chapter.\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n  A local publication, the Greensburg Record-Herald, recently published \nan article extoling Dr. Chowning's life of accomplishment.

Carter, president of Campbellsville \n     University, with whom Chowning worked for 17 years, said, \n     ``John Chowning is one of the most gifted individuals I have \n     ever met. He is a great thinker, and he is wise in his \n     approach to topics across a broad spectrum.\n       ``John is a very good writer, an accomplished speaker, \n     teacher and preacher. He is detailed and is a well-read \n     public policy analyst on a broad array of topics.\n       ``We will miss him on a day-to-day basis, but we are so \n     fortunate he is serving in a new part-time role for the \n     university.''\n       Chowning is retiring after 26 years of service to \n     Campbellsville University. However, he will continue to work \n     part time as executive assistant to the president for \n     government, community and constituent relations beginning in \n     January 2016.\n       Chowning became involved in fundraising with Campbellsville \n     University in 1989 and became a member of the university's \n     Board of Trustees in 1992.\n       He continued on the board for the next seven years, serving \n     as chair in 1996 and 1997. He became a full-time employee in \n     February 1998.\n       Dr. Joseph L. Owens, who is serving his fifth term as chair \n     of the Campbellsville University Board of Trustees, said, \n     ``Dr. John Chowning is a shining example of selfless service \n     that has made a difference in many lives at Campbellsville \n     University. He is highly motivated, personable and a spirit-\n     filled man of God.\n       ``His love for the Lord is exemplified in his Christ-like \n     character, as well as his concern for excelling in diversity, \n     diplomacy and the development of bridge-building \n     relationships.''\n       Serving as executive vice president for church and external \n     relations and executive assistant to the president has been \n     ``a very humbling and rewarding career path in which God's \n     divine guidance has been evident in the progress CU has \n     seen,'' Chowning said.\n       He taught as an adjunct for several years in Campbellsville \n     University's political science department. He has served as \n     chair of the university's diversity committee, strategic \n     planning and University Council.\n       Chowning founded and has directed the Kentucky Heartland \n     Institute on Public Policy at Campbellsville University which \n     has hosted a wide array of speakers and forums on a host of \n     public policy issues.\n       Chowning has been involved in many endeavors at \n     Campbellsville University including race reconciliation, and \n     establishing Dialogue on Race, a project dear to his heart. \n     He has served as a leader of Greater Campbellsville United, \n     the focus of which is to help create an environment of \n     equality and opportunity for all residents of Campbellsville-\n     Taylor County and the heartland region of Kentucky.\n       Chowning was one of the founding members of Team Taylor \n     County (Campbellsville-Taylor County Economic Development \n     Authority) and served for several years as chair and \n     continues as a member of the board.\n       He received the Governor's Development Leadership Award in \n     1999 and was named Citizen of the Year for Campbellsville-\n     Taylor County two separate years by the Campbellsville-Taylor \n     County Chamber of Commerce.\n       Chowning was founding member of the Center for Rural \n     Development and former chair; founding member of the Southern \n     Kentucky Economic Development Corporation and former chair; \n     and founding member and former board member and secretary of \n     Forward in the Fifth education reform group.\n       With his work with the Economic Development Authority in \n     Campbellsville, he was instrumental in organizing a \n     dislocated worker program at Campbellsville when Fruit of the \n     Loom closed in Campbellsville in 1997-98.\n       With the support of CU presidents Dr. Ken Winters and \n     Carter, Chowning proposed the university's Technology \n     Training Center and coordinated efforts to secure funding for \n     the project by working with U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n       Chowning has left his mark on Campbellsville University \n     with the naming of the Pence-Chowning Art Gallery, the \n     Chowning Art Shop, the Chowning Executive Dining Room and the \n     Chowning Patio.\n       He and his wife, Cathy Pence Chowning, have established an \n     endowed scholarship fund at Campbellsville University that \n     provides annual scholarship awards to qualifying minority \n     students.\n       In his role as a pastor, Chowning is an active member and \n     former secretary of Taylor County Ministerial Association and \n     is a member of the executive boards of Taylor County Baptist \n     Association and Zion District Association of Baptists.\n       He has led his church, Saloma Baptist Church of which he \n     has served as senior pastor since 1994, to become a member of \n     the General Association of Baptists in Kentucky, the state's \n     historic black Baptist state convention--one of two \n     historically Anglo Baptist churches to join the GABKY. He has \n     been active in the life of the GABKY for the past several \n     years.\n       Chowning has a master's of public administration (planning \n     emphasis) from Eastern Kentucky University; a bachelor of \n     arts in political science from Transylvania University, and \n     an associate of arts from Lindsey Wilson College.\n       ``From serving as trustee chair and vice chair and two \n     terms as a board member to the past 18 years in my current \n     role, my association with Campbellsville University has been \n     one of the most rewarding and meaningful affiliations of my \n     career,'' Chowning said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S336-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2015\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I want to inform my colleagues that I \nhave placed a hold on S. 2415, the EB-5 Integrity Act of 2015. I have \nbeen working for years to reform the EB-5 immigrant investor program, \nwhich is run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and have \nintroduced legislation with Senator Leahy to overhaul the program.\n  Our bill, S. 1501, is a comprehensive approach to dealing with the \nfraud, abuse, and national security vulnerabilities. Our bill also \nrestores the program back to its original intent to ensure that rural \nand high unemployment areas have access to this source of capital.\n  S. 2415 is a bill that is modeled almost identically after S. 1501; \nyet it is weaker and leaves behind many provisions that would in fact \nbring integrity back into the program. Late last year, I objected to \nbringing S. 2415 up by unanimous consent and have placed a hold on the \nbill because I hoped we could consider more effective measures to root \nout fraud and abuse and create real jobs and do it in a comprehensive \nmanner that ensures the program is able to work for every part of the \ncountry for years to come.\n  As I stated previously on this floor, the failure to include needed \nreforms last year means the program continues to pose risks to the \nhomeland. I am not so sure reforms are possible anymore. It may be time \nto do away with it completely.\n  Nevertheless, if we pass legislation to extend the EB-5 program \nbeyond this fiscal year, I hope to work with my colleagues to achieve \ntrue reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S337-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING CHRISTA McAULIFFE AND THE ENTIRE ``CHALLENGER'' CREW\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

In that \npainting, six of the crewmembers are depicted holding their helmets in \ntheir arms, but one crewmember, Christa McAuliffe, is holding in her \narms not her helmet but a globe.\n  For Granite Staters and for teachers and educators all across America \nand the world, there is a very special place in our hearts for Christa \nMcAuliffe, a social studies teacher at Concord High School who was \nselected from more than 11,000 applicants to become the first NASA \nteacher in space.\n  During a year of extensive training at NASA before the mission, \nChrista created science lessons that she planned to teach from space \nwhile on board Challenger, broadcasting her lessons and observations to \nstudents all across Earth.\n  As a former teacher, I witnessed the impact that Christa's \nparticipation had on students and teachers. The Challenger was \nintegrated into the classroom curriculum, allowing students to discover \na passion for science. We continue to see the contributions of the \nChallenger's crew in the students who pursue careers in the sciences \nand in the success of recent NASA missions.\n  I am especially pleased to witness Christa McAuliffe's continuing \nimpact in advancing education in the STEM fields--science, technology, \nengineering, and math--and encouraging young people--especially young \nwomen--to pursue careers in STEM fields.\n  A few months after the accident, the families of the Challenger's \ncrew created the first Challenger Center for Space Science Education, a \nnonprofit that engages students and teachers in hands-on education in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Since then, 40 \nChallenger learning centers have opened their doors in the U.S. and \nother countries, and they are expanding opportunities for innovative \nprograms and activities in STEM .\n  We all appreciate that this is a very difficult day for the many \noutstanding professionals at NASA. On that day, they lost seven \nwonderful colleagues. Our heart goes out to the NASA family and the \nfamilies of all seven crewmembers on this day of remembrance.\n  As an astronaut, Christa McAuliffe was on a mission to outer space. \nBut, as a teacher, she was also on a personal mission to educate and \nenlighten. She opened the eyes of young people around the world to the \nwonders of our planet and universe. Today, we remember and honor her \nbravery, her passion for teaching, and her tremendous legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S337-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S337-S338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING OFFICER DOUG BARNEY\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on Sunday, January 17, 2016, this country \nlost an American hero--Officer Doug Barney of the Unified Police \nDepartment in Salt Lake County, Utah, was shot and killed in the line \nof duty. He died honorably, doing what he loved to do: serving and \nprotecting his community.\n  Every day of his 18 years on the force, Officer Barney made his \ncommunity not just safer but better. I know this not from personal \nexperience--I was not one of those fortunate enough to have met Officer \nBarney--but from the community's response to his untimely death.\n  When the tragic news spread across Utah and the Nation, those who \nknew him or knew of him--and it was hard to live in Salt Lake County \nwithout knowing Officer Barney--sprung into action to support his \nfamily and to commemorate his life of service.\n  The most important step was taken first: to surround Officer Barney's \nwife and three teenage children with love, comfort, and assistance. The \noutpouring of support came not just from friends, family, and \nneighbors, but from strangers, too. Nanette Wride and Shante Johnson \ndidn't know Officer Barney, but they were among the first to join his \nwife, Erika, on her long journey of healing. Indeed, Wride and Johnson \ncame as fellow travelers on that journey--they, too, had suffered the \nloss of a husband serving on the front lines of law enforcement--\nknowing all too well the unique challenges facing the Barney family \nduring this trying time.\n  Then there was the candlelight vigil honoring Officer Barney, hosted \nby the Salt Lake Valley Law Enforcement Association and the city of \nHolladay, UT. Despite bitterly cold temperatures, hundreds of friends \nand neighbors huddled to pay their respects to the man who had meant so \nmuch to so many.\n  That same night, another ceremony took place at the Utah State \ncapitol, as firefighters, first responders, and police officers \ngathered to receive the U.S. honor flag at the end of its thousand-mile \njourney from Fort Worth, TX. The flag has flown over battlefields in \nIraq and Afghanistan, as well as Ground Zero in New York City, and now, \nit is escorted by State troopers to communities across America that are \nmourning the loss and honoring the sacrifice of those who have been \nkilled in the line of duty. It stayed with Officer Barney's body until \nhis funeral, which brought together thousands from across the country.\n  This was not the first time Doug Barney galvanized his community. In \n2010, the students, teachers, and administrators of Eisenhower Junior \nHigh School rallied behind Officer Barney who was in the middle of what \nwould become a 12-year battle with cancer. To the students, Officer \nBarney, the school's resource officer, was ``one of the good guys,'' so \nthey organized a dodge-ball tournament--they called it the Battle for \nBarney--that raised over $1,000 to help him pay for his medical \ntreatment.\n  All of this stands as a testament to the profound impact Officer \nBarney had on the people and the community he dedicated his life to \nserve. Standing 6 feet, 5 inches tall, he had the physical attributes \nto be a good police officer, but as someone who genuinely respected and \ncared about everyone he\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\nmet, he had the character to be a good person. And that is how Officer \nBarney will forever be remembered.\n  His death serves as a stark reminder of the dangers our law \nenforcement personnel face every single day. Living with the hazards of \nthe job takes a tremendous amount of courage. And Officer Barney was as \nbrave as they come. Whenever he had to take time off from work for his \ncancer treatments, he was always eager to return. In fact, he had not \nbeen scheduled to work on January 17--that fateful Sunday when he gave \nthe ultimate sacrifice. But with medical bills to pay and a family to \nfeed, he volunteered to work overtime--which is exactly what you would \nexpect from a man like Officer Barney, who chose to enter the police \nforce 18 years ago for just one reason, to help people.\n  Doug Barney was taken from this life tragically early, but he did \nmore good in his 44 years on this Earth than most of us can hope to \naccomplish in a lifetime. May he rest in peace, and may God bless his \nfamily and the community he served. It will never be the same without \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S338-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT RAYMOND E. KELLEY\n\n Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nexceptionally meritorious career of one of this Nation's finest, MSG \nRaymond E. Kelley, on his retirement after 26 years of sacrifice and \nselfless service to the United States of America and the State of West \nVirginia.\n  Master Sergeant Kelley's career began on February 12, 1983, and ended \nupon his retirement on December 28, 2015. He first enlisted in \nParkersburg, WV, as a heavy equipment operator with Company C, 463rd \nEngineer Battalion in the U.S. Army Reserve. In 1985, Master Sergeant \nKelley transferred to the Navy, serving as a Seabee, completing \ndeployments to Somalia and Bahrain through October 1993.\n  After a break in service, Master Sergeant Kelley returned to the Navy \nReserves in 1996 and later joined the West Virginia Army National Guard \nin February 2000 as a staff sergeant and was assigned as a combat \nengineer section leader. In 2003, Master Sergeant Kelley deployed to \nIraq with the Headquarters and Support Company 1092nd Engineer \nBattalion as a construction foreman.\n  Following the deployment, Master Sergeant Kelley was promoted and \nserved as a platoon sergeant for the 119th Engineer Support Company, \nClarksburg, WV, and the 1st Detachment of the 1092nd, Headquarters and \nSupport Company, Point Pleasant, WV.\n  In 2006, Master Sergeant Kelley was assigned to the 193rd Equipment \nSupport Platoon in Moundsville, WV, where he served as the senior \nnoncommissioned officer for the unit and the unit full-time readiness \nnoncommissioned officer.\n  In 2011, Master Sergeant Kelley was transferred to the 1092nd \nEngineer Battalion, Headquarters and Support Company as the assistant \noperations sergeant and was promoted in September 2012 as the battalion \noperations sergeant.\n  His awards and decorations include a Meritorious Service Medal, \nsecond award; Army Commendation Medal, third award; Army Reserve \nComponent Achievement Medal, third award; Army Achievement Medal, third \naward; National Defense Service Medal, second award; Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; \nIraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star; Armed Forces Reserve Medal with \nMobilization Device; Army Service Ribbon; Non-Commissioned Officer \nRibbon, third award; Overseas Service Ribbon; Combat Action Badge; \nJoint Meritorious Unit Award; Army Good Conduct Medal, second award; \nArmy Meritorious Unit Commendation; United States Navy Presidential \nUnit Commendation; Navy Presidential Unit Citation; Navy Achievement \nMedal, third award; United States Navy Overseas Service Ribbon; Navy \nGood Conduct Award, second award; West Virginia Emergency Service \nMedal, third award; WV State Service Ribbon, third award; West Virginia \nAchievement Ribbon; and West Virginia National Guard Minuteman Ribbon, \nthird award.\n  Master Sergeant Kelley made significant contributions to all of the \nunits to which he has been assigned throughout his 26 years of service. \nAs the platoon sergeant for the 193rd Equipment Support Platoon, his \nunit consistently maintained strength in excess of 100 percent and had \nthe highest morale of any unit in the 1092nd Engineer Battalion. As the \nbattalion operations sergeant, Master Sergeant Kelley managed all \ntraining events and training requirements, ensuring subordinate units \nwere prepared for all potential missions.\n  Master Sergeant Kelley resides with his wife, Rhonda, in Parkersburg, \nWV. They have three children: Seth, Hanna, and Chance. Master Sergeant \nKelley is a fellow runner, as well as an avid outdoorsman. I wish him a \nfond farewell and the best of luck in the next phase of his life. He \nhas shown leadership and wisdom throughout his numerous assignments. He \nhas made a difference in the readiness of the West Virginia National \nGuard, in the morale of his units, and most importantly, in the lives \nof thousands of servicemembers. He has been an asset and a treasure; \nhis presence will be missed by many and by the West Virginia National \nGuard as a whole.\n  Master Sergeant Kelley, I am honored to call you a fellow West \nVirginian; but most of all, thankful for your endless dedication that \nhas meant so much, to so many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S338-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S338-S339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JOHN J. DRISCOLL\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndistinguished career of the Honorable John J. Driscoll who retired on \nDecember 31, 2015, as a senior judge from the Westmoreland County Court \nof Common Pleas.\n  His distinctive career as an elected public official spans more than \nthree decades and is marked by excellence, dedication, hard work, and a \ngenuine love for serving others. Improving the lives of others has been \nof paramount importance throughout his career.\n  In 1984, Judge Driscoll served as the Westmoreland County district \nattorney. As a district attorney, Judge Driscoll was one of the first \nin Pennsylvania to have a victim witness coordinator, whose duties \nincluded informing victims of the case status, assisting eligible \nvictims with obtaining funds under the Pennsylvania Victim Compensation \nAssistance Fund, and helping victims to receive restitution from \ndefendants found guilty.\n  A decade later, he was appointed to an open seat on the Westmoreland \nCounty Court of Common Pleas and was elected in 1995 to continue his \nservice. After a brief stint in criminal court, Judge Driscoll returned \nto family court because he believed it was the best way to help \nchildren, not only in custody cases, but also in other cases affecting \njuveniles. His work with juvenile offenders and exchanges with their \nparents played an important role in making lasting changes in their \nlives and reducing crime in the community. Furthermore, Judge Driscoll \nhas been a strong advocate for offender rehabilitation as an effective \nway to reduce recidivism.\n  His commitment to the community has also been a constant throughout \nhis career, including his work as a trustee on the Board of Excela \nHealth, a Paul Harris Fellow from the Greensburg Rotary Club, and as a \npast chair of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's criminal procedural \nrules committee. Judge Driscoll has received many rewards for his \nservice including the Fred Funari Mental Health Association Award of \nDistinction from the Mental Health Association of Westmoreland County.\n  Judge Driscoll has also had a most distinguished career in the Navy \nand received several awards for service to his country. They include \nthe Naval Achievement Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, \nthe Presidential Unit Citation, and the National Defense Service Medal \nfor exceptionally meritorious service as part of U.S. naval support \nactivity in Danang, Republic of Vietnam.\n  Although he officially retired on December 31, 2012, Judge Driscoll \ncontinued to serve the court during the past 3 years. Despite being \npaid for only 10 days of service each month, I understand he generally \narrived to work early and often left well after closing time. I know \nhis colleagues in the\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nWestmoreland County courthouse will miss him.\n  Last, but not least, the gentle guiding force behind John is his \nbeloved wife, Anne, and they cherish their five children and five \ngrandchildren.\n  It is with great pride that I recognize Judge John Driscoll for his \ndistinguished career in public service. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin wishing him the best of luck and a happy and healthy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S339-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I am honored to have the \nopportunity to acknowledge and express gratitude to the Louisiana \nMunicipal Association, LMA, in recognition of their 90th anniversary.\n  Founded in 1926, the Louisiana Conference of Mayors was created with \nthe purpose of providing a forum for mutual consultation and discussion \nof various topics affecting municipal government. The organization also \naided the growth and development of each municipality through education \nabout best practices problem solving. Shortly after the Louisiana \nConference of Mayors was created, the Great Depression swept the \nNation. In 1937, a handful of resilient mayors met to revive the \norganization, giving it new life as the Louisiana Municipal \nAssociation. They may not have foreseen that their tenacity in \novercoming adversity during the Great Depression and taking proactive \nsteps to keep Louisiana municipalities united and strong would form the \nbasis for the core values to which the LMA still adheres today.\n  From its inception, the LMA has focused on helping local elected \nleaders create and maintain efficient and effective municipal \ngovernments. In 1987, the nonprofit, nonpartisan LMA created Risk \nManagement, Inc., RMI, to address the insurance and liability demands \nof member municipalities through its inter-local risk pool. In 1999, \nthe Louisiana Municipal Advisory and Technical Services Bureau, Inc., \nLaMATS, was created with the purpose of providing essential services to \nassist municipalities in their day-to-day operations.\n  In addition to these wholly owned subsidiaries, the LMA has three \npolitical subdivisions--Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority, Unemployment \nCompensation Fund, and Louisiana Community Development Authority; four \nadvisory organizations--Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police, \nLouisiana Rural Water Association, Louisiana Conference of Mayors, and \nLouisiana Municipal Black Caucus Association; and nine affiliate \norganizations--Municipal Employees Retirement System, Louisiana City \nAttorneys Association, Louisiana Association of Municipal Secretaries \nand Assistants, Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association, Louisiana \nAssociation of Tax Administrators, Louisiana Municipal Clerks \nAssociation, Building Officials Association of Louisiana, Louisiana \nAirport Managers and Associates, and Louisiana Fire Chiefs Association.\n  For decades, the LMA has had tremendous success engaging with its \nState and Federal partners. In the Louisiana Legislature, the LMA has \nbeen a strong voice in the efforts to fight blight, promote law \nenforcement, and enhance economic growth. On the Federal level, the LMA \njoined forces with the National League of Cities and other coastal \nState municipal leagues to lead the charge in petitioning Congress to \nenact the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which \nenacted critical reforms to the Biggert Waters Act of 2012. I was proud \nto work with the LMA on the inclusion of the Grimm-Cassidy amendment to \nthis legislation, thereby facilitating affordable homeowner flood \ninsurance in Louisiana and across the country.\n  For 90 years, the LMA has worked to strengthen Louisiana through \nsupport and empowerment of municipal government. The organization has \nlaunched a yearlong celebration of this anniversary by naming 2016 the \n``Year of Education.'' Opening festivities for this theme will commence \nin February under the auspices of the 2016 LMA executive board \nofficers--President Mayor Carroll Breaux of Springhill, First Vice \nPresident Mayor Barney Arceneaux of Gonzales, Second Vice President \nMayor Lawrence Henagan of DeQuincy, Immediate Past President Mayor \nDavid Camardelle of Grand Isle, and District A Vice President Mayor \nJimmy Williams of Sibley. The executive director of LMA is Ronnie \nHarris, former 28-year mayor of Gretna.\n  What started out as a collection of 29 forward-thinking mayors \nseeking to empower their communities has evolved into a praiseworthy \norganization that has earned the esteem and trust of local, State, and \nFederal elected officials, as well as fellow municipal leagues.\n  I would like to congratulate the LMA on its 90th anniversary and wish \nthem many more years of strength and excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S339-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S339-S340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JACK REED, SR.\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the State of Mississippi and the \ncity of Tupelo lost a leader and model citizen with the passing of Jack \nReed, Sr., on January 27. He led a remarkable life and earned an \nenviable reputation as a businessman, community leader, civil rights \nadvocate, and education reformer. His tireless work in these roles was \nfelt throughout Mississippi and set an example for embracing our better \nnature in facing all challenges.\n  It has been a great privilege to have known Jack Reed. He was the \nepitome of a goodhearted man and my friend. I join a grateful State in \nexpressing our appreciation for a life well lived that benefited us \nall.\n  I ask that a January 28, 2016, article titled ``Tupelo Spirit loses a \nstar: Reed remembered as one of Tupelo's best'' from the Daily Journal \nnewspaper be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the Daily Journal, Jan. 28, 2016]\n\n   Tupelo Spirt Loses a Star: Reed Remembered as One of Tupelo's Best\n\n       Tupelo.--Jack Raymond Reed, 91, Tupelo's pre-eminent civic \n     leader, died Wednesday at his residence.\n       Reed was among the last of a Greatest Generation cadre of \n     Tupelo's business and professional leadership who, after \n     World War II, transformed a pleasant county-seat town into a \n     thriving city which became a regional magnet for economic \n     growth, employment, strong public education and a vigorous \n     arts and cultural community.\n       Reed earned a national reputation as an eloquent advocate \n     for racial fairness and reconciliation in Mississippi. He had \n     served as a member of the United Methodist Church's \n     Commission on Religion and Race, through which he became \n     friends with key leaders in the national Civil Rights \n     Movement.\n       ``Of all the people I have known in our state of \n     Mississippi, none has been more inspiring than Jack Reed. He \n     was a leader in every way his whole lifetime,'' said former \n     Mississippi Gov. William Winter. ``He was right and generous \n     and fair in his personal, private and public views. He was an \n     inspiration to me in both political and personal \n     relationships. Jack commanded respect. He did nothing that \n     was detrimental to our state or the principles for which he \n     stood. He was a Christian man, an active member of his \n     beloved Methodist church. He has made a mark in Mississippi \n     that will live forever.''\n       Reed was chairman of R.W. Reed Co., the retail store \n     founded by his father in the early 20th century, and he led \n     Reed Manufacturing, which was a major force among Mississippi \n     garment industry employers in its heyday.\n       Funeral services will be 11 a.m. Saturday at First United \n     Methodist Church. Visitation will be from 4 to 7 p.m. Friday \n     at the church.\n       Reed, born May 19, 1924, in Tupelo, was the son of Robert \n     W. Reed Sr. and Hoyt Raymond Reed, herself a descendant of an \n     early, influential Lee County family.\n       Reed and his brothers, R.W. Reed Jr. and William Reed, were \n     high-profile leaders in the region's business and \n     manufacturing community for more than 50 years.\n       Reed graduated from Tupelo High School with honors, \n     attended Vanderbilt University and graduated with a \n     bachelor's degree with honors in 1947, following an \n     interruption of his college days for service in the South \n     Pacific during World War II in the Signal Intelligence \n     Service, U.S. Army of Occupation.\n       Following the war, Reed earned a master's degree in \n     retailing from New York University and returned to Tupelo, \n     where he joined the businesses founded by his father and his \n     father's brothers.\n       ``Since the 1950s, Jack was considered to be in the upper \n     leadership tier of the Tupelo area and from that platform, he \n     really helped thousands of people by supporting numerous \n     programs and initiatives,'' said Lewis Whitfield, senior vice \n     president of the CREATE Foundation. ``He cared deeply about \n     all people everywhere, and he was of course a tremendous \n     advocate for education. He saw education as not only the key \n     to community and economic development, but as a way for \n     people to improve themselves. Jack was a great man and he \n     left his mark on virtually every good thing in this \n     community.''\n       Reed was a director emeritus of the Daily Journal's \n     corporate board of directors, a position in which he served \n     for a half century.\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\n       Reed had been a close friend, confidant and community \n     builder with the late George McLean, the Daily Journal's \n     executive editor, publisher and the founder of CREATE, the \n     not-for-profit foundation which owns all stock in Journal \n     Inc.\n       ``Jack Reed lived a remarkable life, a life marked by love \n     for his family, love for his community and really a love for \n     all mankind,'' said former Daily Journal publisher Billy \n     Crews, now a development officer at the University of \n     Mississippi. ``He is among the best businessmen I have ever \n     known, in part because his trade was only a portion of his \n     total business interest. His combination of intellect, humor \n     and optimism influenced thousands of others and the very \n     culture of Tupelo and Northeast Mississippi. He was a \n     pioneering leader in education and race relations.''\n       Reed was no stranger to community involvement. He was \n     active in his whole career in the Mississippi Economic \n     Council, of which he served as president in 1964; president \n     of the Mississippi Retail Merchants in 1967; chair of the \n     Tupelo Community Development Foundation in 1968; president of \n     the Yocona Council of the Boy Scouts of America; national \n     president of the Vanderbilt Alumni Association in 1972 and \n     1973; chair of the administrative board of the First United \n     Methodist Church; chair of the Governor's Special Committee \n     of Public Education in 1980 and 1981; chair of the State \n     Board of Education; a member of the board of trustees of \n     Millsaps College; a founding member of the executive \n     committee of Lee United Neighbors; chair of the board of \n     CREATE; founding director of LIFT Inc. and chair of the \n     National Advisory Council on Education Research and \n     Improvement from 1991 through 1994. In addition, he received \n     Tupelo's Outstanding Citizen Award in 1971 and Lifetime \n     Achievement Award in 2000.\n       ``He was a very compassionate man, always willing to help \n     those in troubling situations and people in every kind of \n     life situation,'' said Guy Mitchell III, an attorney and \n     confidant of Reed's. ``He was a giant as far as our city is \n     concerned.''\n       He was married to Frances Purvis Reed, and they were the \n     parents of four children, all of whom returned to Tupelo \n     after college, three of them working for R.W. Reed Co. The \n     fourth owns an investment firm in Tupelo. Jack Reed Jr. \n     served as Tupelo mayor for one term, from 2009-13.\n       Reed was well known statewide and worked with other leaders \n     of many political persuasions for causes held in common.\n       ``He was a strong leader, not only on the local level but \n     on the state level. A very open minded and fair thinking \n     person,'' said Tupelo City Council member Nettie Davis, the \n     longest serving council member and lifelong Tupelo resident. \n     ``He's one that stood out as far as providing unity and good \n     leadership. I think it's going to be a great loss to our \n     city, our area and the state of Mississippi.''\n       Reed chaired Mississippi's first lay State Board of \n     Education from 1982-87, and later was tapped by President \n     George H.W. Bush to head up the National Advisory Committee \n     on Education Research and Improvement.\n       Reed's stance on public education was a dominating portion \n     of his campaign as the Republican nominee for governor in \n     1987. Reed eventually lost that race to Democrat Ray Mabus.\n       Reed, in a 1999 archived interview for the University of \n     Southern Mississippi, described his early years in Tupelo.\n       ``Well, it was different. It was a good time for me,'' Reed \n     said in the interview. ``My father was a merchant here, and \n     my mother was also a native of this area. I had two brothers; \n     we had a nice home. And of course, in this area, if you had \n     anything at all, servants were plentiful in those days. So, \n     we always had a cook, and it was in the Depression. We were \n     aware of the Depression, but my father, fortunately, sold his \n     business at the . . . appropriate time, and just before the \n     Depression hit its bottom. And he bought it back within a \n     year for considerably less than he sold it for, and it gave \n     him enough inventory to keep things going. So, we weathered \n     the Depression better than most.''\n       Reed also was an adolescent when the 1936 tornado--a \n     deadly, devastating storm--struck, and he recalls its impact \n     on the city.\n       ``Our home was literally destroyed by the tornado,'' Reed \n     said. ``People were killed across the street, and next door \n     and behind us, but we survived that. Interestingly, during \n     that time of the tornado, the store was not damaged. So, [my \n     father] opened the store, told his friends to take what they \n     needed, pay him when they could. I don't think he lost any \n     money on the basis of that.''\n       But above all his civic, business and other contributions \n     to Tupelo, Northeast Mississippi and the state, Reed said he \n     always placed family as a top priority.\n       ``The conclusion is family has been the most important \n     thing in my life; remains so; has always been,'' Reed said. \n     ``I'm a privileged person. All four of my children, went \n     away, out of this state to college. All four of them are \n     living here, now. I see my four children and my grandchildren \n     every day unless something exceptional [happens]. We work \n     together. My brothers and I were business partners for 50 \n     years.\n       ``I've been in one church all of my life. All of my \n     children went to Tupelo public schools. I know some people \n     would think that that's pretty provincial, but there's a \n     stability to it that I have found has been very satisfying to \n     me. So, that's the conclusion to my memoir.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S340-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S340-S341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GIL CARMICHAEL\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this weekend, Disney Pictures will \nrelease ``The Finest Hours,'' a cinematic retelling of a 1952 Coast \nGuard rescue mission off the New England coast. I am pleased to use its \nrelease as an opportunity to commend Mr. Gil Carmichael of Meridian, \nMS, an important participant in this mission, for his bravery during \nthat storm and for a lifetime of service to the State of Mississippi \nand the Nation. Mr. Carmichael, an ensign in the U.S. Coast Guard at \nthe time, was awarded the Silver Life-Saving Medal for his heroic \nactions during that rescue mission.\n  A 1952 Coast Guard news release described the rescue:\n\n                For Release at 10: 30 a.m., May 14, 1952\n\n       Twenty-one Coast Guardsmen were decorated today by Edward \n     H. Foley, Under Secretary of the Treasury, and Vice Admiral \n     Merlin O'Neill, Coast Guard Commandant, for the rescue of 70 \n     men in a heavy storm at sea Feb. 18-19.\n       The rescued men were crew members of the tankers SS FORT \n     MERCER and SS PENDLETON which broke in two in 70-knot winds \n     and 60-foot seas off the coast of Cape Cod, Mass.\n       The group ceremony was held in the Treasury before members \n     of Congress and high ranking Coast Guard officers. Members of \n     Congress from the homes of each man decorated, and members of \n     committees which handle Coast Guard legislation, also were \n     invited.\n       Also present were William B. St. John of the National Bulk \n     Carriers, Inc., owner of the PENDELTON, and C.A. Thomas, W.G. \n     Johnson and P.J. Clausen of the Trinidad Corp., owner of the \n     FORT MERCER.\n       Admiral O'Neill described the Cape Cod rescue operations as \n     unique in Coast Guard history. With each tanker broken in two \n     forty miles apart, four hulks with survivors aboard were left \n     adrift in the mountainous seas.\n       He said all types of rescue equipment were used including \n     large Coast Guard cutters, an airplane, an ocean-going tug, \n     motor lifeboats, radar, rubber liferafts, scramble nets, \n     lifelines and exposure suits.\n       \"But most of all,'' said Admiral O'Neill, ``the situation \n     called for raw courage and skill of the highest order--backed \n     by Coast Guard teamwork.''\n       Five of the men received the Treasury's Gold Life-saving \n     Medal for ``extreme and heroic daring.'' Four others received \n     the Treasury's Silver Life-saving Medal for ``heroic \n     action.'' Fifteen were cited for ``courage, initiative and \n     unswerving devotion to duty'' and authorized to wear the \n     Coast Guard Commendation ribbon. Those decorated were:\n\n                        Gold Life-Saving Medal:\n\n       Andrew J. Fitzgerald, Engineman 2nd class; Ervin E. Maske, \n     Seaman; Bernard C. Webber, Boatswain's Mate 1st class; \n     Richard P. Livesey, Seaman; Ensign William R. Kiely, Jr.\n\n                       Silver Life-Saving Medal:\n\n       Paul R. Black, Engineman 2nd class; Ensign Gilbert E. \n     Carmichael; Edward A. Mason, Jr., Apprentice Seaman; Webster \n     G. Terwilliger, Seaman\n\n                    Coast Guard Commendation Ribbon:\n\n       Antonio F. Ballerini, Boatswain's Mate 3rd class \n     provisional; Donald H. Bangs, Boatswain's Mate Chief; Richard \n     J. Ciccone, Seaman; John J. Courtney, Boatswain's Mate 3rd \n     class; John F. Dunn, Engineman 1st class; Philip M. Griebel, \n     Radioman 1st class; Emory H. Haynes, Engineman 1st class; \n     Roland W. Hoffert, Gunner's Mate 3rd class; Eugene W. \n     Korpusik, Seaman Apprentice; Ralph L. Ormsby, Boatswain's \n     Mate Chief; Dennis J. Perry, Seaman; Donald E. Pitts, Seaman; \n     Alfred J. Roy, Boatswain's Mate 1st class; Herman M. \n     Rubinsky, Seaman Apprentice; LCDR John N. Joseph\n\n  A nor'easter is a remarkable event in any era. The 1952 winter storm \nspawned hurricane-force winds and waves as tall as most of the office \nbuildings at the time. The brave members of our Coast Guard raced into \nthis dangerous situation to locate two large tankers that had broken in \ntwo and to rescue 70 men facing nearly certain death.\n  When asked about the rescue, a selfless Mr. Carmichael, who was in \ncharge of a rescue boat that rescued two men from the bow of the SS \nFort Mercer that day, said, ``I learned early in life how I would \nbehave in crisis. I knew when we put the boat over we could be killed \nbut all of us were just thinking about trying to save lives rather than \nof our own safety.''\n  Gil Carmichael took the remarkable experience he gained in the Coast \nGuard and continued on the path of public service, later for statewide \noffice in Mississippi in the 1960s, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate \nin 1972, twice for Governor in 1975 and 1979, and once for Lieutenant \nGovernor in 1983. He also served as a delegate from Mississippi to the \nRepublican National\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\nConvention. In 1973, he was appointed to the National Highway Safety \nAdvisory Committee and became chairman of the advisory committee until \n1976. From 1976 to 1979, he was a Federal commissioner for the National \nTransportation Policy Study Commission. He became Administrator of the \nU.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration in \n1989 and served until 1993. He later served as chairman of the Amtrak \nReform Council.\n  It is a pleasure to acknowledge Mr. Carmichael whose selfless \npersonal qualities reflect a great deal of credit on my State and this \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S341-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL BRUCE BRAMLETTE\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Bruce has tirelessly served on \nnomination boards for 25 years, both as a member and board chairman, \nand has interviewed more than 1,000 young Montana students seeking a \nnomination to one of our Nation's service academies. Throughout his \nyears of conducting interviews, he has had numerous opportunities to \nmeet and interact with incredible students from all over Montana. Bruce \nsaid it was his pleasure to help these students pursue their dreams of \nbecoming an officer in one of our Nation's military branches.\n  In addition to Bruce's tremendous volunteer hours for the nomination \nboards, he proudly served in the Montana Air National Guard for 34 \nyears. He retired in 1994 as the assistant adjutant general for air for \nthe State of Montana. As a National Guard fighter pilot, Bruce \nsuccessfully flew over 2,000 hours in the F106 Dart, F102 Dagger, and \nF89 Scorpion.\n  A graduate of Montana State University, Bruce has also been an active \nmember in his community. He has served on the Highwood School Board for \n9 years, is a lifelong member of the Air Force Association, and is an \nactive member of Representative Ryan Zinke's Veterans Advisory Board. \nBruce and his wife of 43 years, Miriam, have three daughters and nine \ngrandchildren.\n  Bruce recognizes the great value in supporting our next generation of \nleaders--especially those who will be defending and protecting our \ncountry.

Mr. President, I would like to honor Edward B. \nSmith--a man of great character and a dedicated public servant who was \ncalled home on January 25, 2016, at the age of 95.\n  ``Big Ed'' was born in Dagmar, MT, in 1920. He and his wife, Juliet, \nraised four children near the family homestead, where Ed helped manage \nthe family farm and ranch. He was an avid hunter and sportsman and \nearned his nickname ``Big Ed'' while playing in the Big Muddy Baseball \nleague. Ed was an active member of the Sheridan County community, \nserving as a member of the Sheridan County Stockman Association, Wool \nGrowers, and the Sheridan County Fair board, as well as a 4-H leader.\n  Ed's heart for service led him to run for the Montana State \nLegislature in 1966, where he served for 20 years. In 1972, Ed ran as \nMontana's Republican candidate for Governor. He went on to serve on \nMontana's Highway Commission for several years after retiring from the \nState legislature.\n  Big Ed was a commonsense and independent leader and a man of great \nintegrity. He made a lasting impact on Montana and will be truly \nmissed.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High \nSchool students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the \nUnion'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were \nselected from nearly 800 entries.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n        ADAM FLEISCHMAN, SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       The state of the union is strong. Americans are working \n     hard, unemployment is down, the stock market is up, and the \n     recession of 2008 feels like ancient history. Still, we face \n     problems. Climate change is one of those issues, particularly \n     because of the denial by politicians in our government that \n     refuse to do anything, because their re-election campaigns \n     rely on oil and gas companies' contributions.\n       In the 114th congress, 170 members deny that global warming \n     is real. Many representatives receive huge donations, as much \n     as $63 million from big oil and gas companies, and in return, \n     they support deregulation initiatives in Congress to protect \n     the corporations. In other words, they prevent progress and \n     obstruct a move away from non-renewable energy sources. In \n     this way, they are not representing their constituents--\n     they're representing the interests of the very wealthy \n     corporations--and it's undermining the political system we \n     have.\n       In a legislative body that is constantly blinded by the \n     goal of staying in office, rather than passing comprehensive \n     reforms to save our planet, the denial is rampant. Even \n     though 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real, \n     and manmade, these elected officials with no background in \n     science choose to ignore it, and instead put trillions of \n     taxpayer money into a defense budget that is bloated and \n     unnecessary. For climate change to be properly addressed, it \n     starts with Congress. If we invest money into clean energy--\n     solar panels, wind turbines, natural gas--we will slowly be \n     able to move away from non-renewable, dirty sources.\n       We also must take a stand against the corporations \n     profiting off of non-renewable sources, making it clear that \n     their campaign contributions should not be the difference \n     between whether or not we leave a healthier planet for future \n     generations. If we wait long enough, it will be too late to \n     do anything. It's not part of a ``liberal agenda'' that some \n     in Congress like to criticize. It's a common problem that is \n     hurting our common home, and it's up to all of humankind to \n     deal with it. That can't happen if the political charades are \n     continued in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n     ELLERY HARKNESS, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       My fellow Americans, there are many important issues \n     burdening our world today; in order to fix these problems, we \n     need an education system that produces well educated leaders \n     to solve these issues. Our education system as it stands \n     today needs to be modified and socioeconomic factors \n     hindering education need to be addressed.\n       Education should be an equalizer, so that anyone, no matter \n     their circumstances, can realize their potential; this isn't \n     the reality though. The truth is that kids from disadvantaged \n     families have a far lower chance for success. Inequality due \n     to wealth and race are huge problems; the disturbing school \n     to prison pipeline is one outcome of this. Only 1 in 12 \n     children in poverty will graduate from college today and \n     almost half won't graduate from high school. Studies have \n     also found that African American and Hispanic high school \n     graduation rates are 10% lower than the U.S. average. \n     Education can raise people out of poverty, while ignoring \n     these problems only continues to perpetrate a horrific cycle \n     of poverty and create more economic problems.\n       Consider that by 2020, 65% of U.S. jobs will require a \n     postsecondary education, according to Georgetown Public \n     Policy Institute. Yet only 1 of 4 students are ready for \n     college in the 4 core subjects when graduating high school, \n     according to U.S. news. Regrettably, the education system not \n     only isn't preparing students for college, it also forces \n     students to bear an unreasonable financial burden in order to \n     go to college. With free or reduced tuition programs, college \n     education would be more accessible.\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\n       There is no single fix for the educational problems \n     plaguing our country yet it is clear that major reforms need \n     to take place. Potential solutions are policies that provide \n     family support so that students grow up in places that \n     encourage learning. Since teachers are the most important \n     aspect of education, more resources could be put into teacher \n     programs and salaries that incentivize job growth. Congress \n     could also work towards bipartisan policies that ensure \n     schools around the U.S have equal quality and access to \n     resources through more funding. In 2015, 55% of government \n     funding went to the military, while only 6% went to \n     education. An increase in education funding is a justifiable \n     change that could dramatically help broken systems.\n       With a better educated workforce, people will have better \n     jobs and rely on government less, benefiting the U.S. \n     economy. Opportunity gaps in education would also decrease \n     and the U.S. would become more competitive as a result. This \n     is another incentive for making education a priority to those \n     in Washington.\n       Our combined futures are dependent on the youth of today; \n     but our nation's children are only as good as the education \n     they are provided with. As Nelson Mandela said, ``Education \n     is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the \n     world.'' Let's take advantage of it.\n\n\n          MEGAN HUGHES, CANAAN MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       As many Americans know, we are very blessed to have \n     colleges available in our country. College allows a young \n     adult to further his or her knowledge of the world around \n     them so they can be ready to enter the workforce. College \n     tuition used to be affordable, so that everyone could further \n     their education. This is important because more educated \n     people means a stronger growing economy. At the same time, \n     the cost of tuition rises dramatically each year, and \n     families with more than one child find themselves in tough \n     financial situations. Most of the time people use loans, and \n     end up paying back student debt for years. Every American \n     deserves to have a college education, which is why state \n     colleges should be tuition free.\n       Elementary and high school is mandatory for all American \n     citizens. Parents who refuse to send their children to school \n     have to pay large fines or even serve jail time. If early \n     education is this important to Americans, why is college not? \n     Why should the emphasis just be on getting a primary or \n     secondary education? More and more jobs today are requiring \n     higher than just a high school diploma. In an article by Adam \n     Davidson, he says that ``Workers with more education are more \n     productive, which makes companies more profitable and the \n     overall economy grow faster.'' This is true, more educated \n     people means more jobs are being done correctly and \n     efficiently, and as a result boosting the economy.\n       In an article by Steven Goodman he said ``Two-thirds of \n     American undergraduates are in debt. This year, student loan \n     debt will grow to more than a trillion dollars, outpacing \n     credit card debt for the first time.'' This article was \n     written in 2011, meaning only four years ago student debt was \n     already in the trillions. When young adults leave home and \n     enter the work force, they have to deal with adult \n     responsibilities for the first time. On top of that, they \n     usually need to pay off student debt. If college were to be \n     tuition free these people would not have large debts. The \n     money they make could go towards paying bills, and saving \n     money for their future or retirement. It would also help \n     attract those who were never thinking about going to college \n     because of the high costs. All this leads to more people \n     buying and selling goods which is important for a country to \n     prosper.\n       State colleges should be free because the economy will grow \n     faster with more educated people, and young adults will not \n     be paying college debt for half their life. How exactly this \n     would be done is simple, put higher taxes on the wealthy. \n     With the top class distributing their money towards \n     education, everyone can have the opportunity to further their \n     education. People can use their hard working money on other \n     things, like purchasing a house or providing for a child. \n     That is why it is important to have free college tuition \n     because it creates an educated population, less debt, and \n     saving for other necessities.\n\n\n      TORI JARVIS, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       Since the recent crimes committed by the terror group ISIS, \n     hate crimes against Muslims have skyrocketed. Recently, ``an \n     Arab-American man was brutally attacked by two white men . . \n     . (who) also taunted his daughter, who wears a hijab, making \n     references to ISIS . . . The attackers called (them) `r--\n     head' and said, `Go back to your country.' '' Wrote Tom \n     Carter for an article on the World Socialist Website. \n     Obviously, these men attacked the man and his daughter for \n     their race and religion, equating the fact that they were \n     Muslim with terrorism even though there was no sensible \n     reason to. People are so scared of terrorism that they lash \n     out at anything they can associate with it.\n       People in power or who wish to be in power are using this \n     fear to convince them that Muslims are the ones to be feared. \n     The most recent--and most dangerous--example is Donald Trump, \n     who wants to ban Muslims from coming into the country. This \n     move has not only heightened the fear of ISIS, but made \n     people believe the Muslims currently in our country are \n     associated with terrorism, creating more violence. Encouraged \n     by Presidential candidates like Donald Trump, some Americans \n     blame the entire religion of Islam, and anyone who follows \n     it, for all of our country's problems. They believe that \n     because these terrorists are following a distorted version of \n     the Qu'ran and the religion of Islam, that anyone else who \n     worships the peaceful religion is a terrorist as well. \n     Unfortunately, people don't realize that Muslims are not \n     terrorists. Muslim athlete Muhammad Ali once said; \n     ``Terrorists are not following Islam. Killing people and \n     blowing up people and dropping bombs in places and all this \n     is not the way to spread the word of Islam. So people realize \n     now that all Muslims are not terrorists.'' Muslims are too \n     often oppressed, even violently attacked by Americans who \n     blame them for terrorism. Muslims in America today are now \n     experiencing racism the way black people used to, and are \n     violently and verbally abused by white people who are looking \n     for someone to blame.\n       Jermaine Jackson, one of Michael Jackson's siblings, has \n     pointed out ``Muslims have become the new Negroes in America. \n     They are being mistreated at airports, by the Immigration--\n     everywhere. Islam is a religion of peace. They are wrong.'' \n     People who wear hijabs seem to have a target placed on them. \n     Muslims are ``randomly selected'' for full body searches at \n     airports, forced to prove they're in this country legally, \n     and attacked by people who have different religious opinions. \n     The violence against Muslims must end, whether it physical or \n     mental. As the civil war in the Middle East is creating \n     unlivable conditions for its inhabitants, they're counting on \n     us to take them in and keep them safe.\n       America is trying to divide and conquer--focusing on \n     conquering Muslims as a whole rather than just ISIS. Rather \n     than attacking the Muslims in our country, we should be \n     focusing on the actual members of ISIS, and not people who \n     have no association with the organization.\n\n\n    ALEXIS MANCHESTER, GREEN MOUNTAIN TECHNOLOGY AND CAREER CENTER \n                               (FINALIST)\n\n       Today in America, people are going to prison wasting \n     countless economic resources and potentially ruining the \n     lives of people all because of the recreational use of \n     marijuana.\n       While people often say marijuana is a gateway drug, I \n     strongly disagree. There are more people that drink a glass \n     of milk per day and become addicted to more serious drugs, \n     than those who use marijuana. It is not uncommon to hear \n     echoes of this sentiment in other contexts as well, \n     particularly, the media and Presidential candidates. In fact, \n     Senator Sanders himself suggests that marijuana should be \n     legalized: ``I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes \n     because I am seeing in this country too many lives being \n     destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal \n     justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and \n     yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young \n     people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think \n     through this war on drugs which has done an enormous amount \n     of damage.'' I strongly agree with this statement because \n     there is not one reported death from an overdose of \n     marijuana. In fact, 88,000 people have died from alcohol use. \n     I personally have never heard of somebody murdering someone \n     because they were under the influence of marijuana. Alcohol \n     on the other hand, has been proven to impact our culture \n     negatively.\n       Facts don't lie. 58% of Americans think marijuana should be \n     legalized, including me. Around 40% of Americans admit to \n     already using marijuana. If marijuana was legalized, we could \n     tax it and allow citizens who choose to use it to benefit our \n     communities in more effective ways than keeping it illegal. \n     Marijuana is a safer drug than others and there is a very low \n     risk of abuse. Marijuana can be safe and useful for instance. \n     Legalizing marijuana will bring the nation's largest cash \n     crop under the rule of law, creating jobs, and economic \n     opportunities in the formal economy instead of the illicit \n     market. Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Colorado haven't had \n     any major issues with their legalization. Washington State \n     raked in more than $70 million in taxes its first year of \n     legal regulated marijuana sales. In Colorado the total of \n     marijuana tax and license cash funds is the total of \n     $11,290,012 annually. Alaska stands to make between $5.1 \n     million and $19.2 million in tax revenue from commercial \n     marijuana in 2016, according to the preliminary estimate by \n     the Alaska Department of Revenue. Oregon's first week of \n     recreational use of marijuana sales top $11 million dollars. \n     Clearly, the taxes incurred would positively benefit our \n     state and country should we choose to jump on board.\n       In closing, I hope you can appreciate my ideas, although I \n     am just one voice. America is a progressive kind of people \n     and we must do what we can to continue to demonstrate the \n     values that make us great. Thank you for your time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S343-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S343-S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Bill \nCassidy and I are honored to have the opportunity to acknowledge and \nexpress gratitude to the Louisiana Municipal\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nAssociation, LMA, in recognition of their 90th anniversary.\n  Founded in 1926, the Louisiana Conference of Mayors was created with \nthe purpose of providing a forum for mutual consultation and discussion \nof various topics affecting municipal government. The organization also \naided the growth and development of each municipality through education \nabout best practices and problem solving. Shortly after the Louisiana \nConference of Mayors was created, the Great Depression swept the \nNation. In 1937, a handful of resilient mayors met to revive the \norganization, giving it new life as the Louisiana Municipal \nAssociation. They may not have foreseen that their tenacity in \novercoming adversity during the Great Depression and taking proactive \nsteps to keep Louisiana municipalities united and strong would form the \nbasis for the core values to which the LMA still adheres today.\n  From its inception, the LMA has focused on helping local elected \nleaders create and maintain efficient and effective municipal \ngovernments. In 1987, the nonprofit, nonpartisan LMA created Risk \nManagement, Inc., RMI, to address the insurance and liability demands \nof member municipalities through its inter-local risk pool. In 1999, \nthe Louisiana Municipal Advisory and Technical Services Bureau, Inc., \nLaMATS, was created with the purpose of providing essential services to \nassist municipalities in their day-to-day operations.\n  In addition to these wholly owned subsidiaries, the LMA has three \npolitical subdivisions--Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority, Unemployment \nCompensation Fund, and Louisiana Community Development Authority; four \nadvisory organizations--Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police, \nLouisiana Rural Water Association, Louisiana Conference of Mayors, and \nLouisiana Municipal Black Caucus Association; and nine affiliate \norganizations--Municipal Employees Retirement System, Louisiana City \nAttorneys Association, Louisiana Association of Municipal Secretaries \nand Assistants, Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association, Louisiana \nAssociation of Tax Administrators, Louisiana Municipal Clerks \nAssociation, Building Officials Association of Louisiana, Louisiana \nAirport Managers and Associates, and Louisiana Fire Chiefs Association.\n  To fulfill its mission of educating its membership and providing a \nforum for discussion about common issues, solutions, and problem \nsolving, the LMA holds an annual convention, a midwinter conference, 10 \ndistrict meetings, a municipal day during the State's legislative \nsession, and 15 or more webinars.\n  For decades, the LMA has had tremendous legislative success on both \nState and Federal levels. In the Louisiana Legislature, the LMA has \nbeen a strong voice for Louisiana municipalities in efforts to fight \nblight, promote law enforcement, maintain funding, and enhance economic \ngrowth. On the Federal level, the LMA joined forces with the National \nLeague of Cities and other coastal State municipal leagues to lead the \ncharge in lobbying Congress to enact the Homeowners Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act of 2014, which enacted critical reforms to the \nBiggert Waters Act of 2012, thereby facilitating affordable homeowner \nflood insurance in Louisiana and across the country.\n  For 90 years, the LMA has worked to strengthen the backbone of \nLouisiana through support and empowerment of municipal government. The \norganization has launched a yearlong celebration of this anniversary by \nnaming 2016 the Year of Education. Opening festivities for this theme \nwill commence at the midwinter conference in February under the \nauspices of the 2016 LMA Executive Board officers--President Mayor \nCarroll Breaux of Springhill, First Vice President Mayor Barney \nArceneaux of Gonzales, Second Vice President Mayor Lawrence Henagan of \nDeQuincy, Immediate Past President Mayor David Camardelle of Grand \nIsle, and District A Vice President Mayor Jimmy Williams of Sibley. The \nexecutive director is Ronnie Harris, former 28-year mayor of Gretna.\n  What started out as a collection of 29 forward-thinking mayors \nseeking to empower their communities has evolved into a praiseworthy \norganization that has earned the esteem and trust of local, State, and \nFederal elected officials, as well as fellow municipal leagues.\n  We would like to congratulate the LMA on its 90th anniversary and \nwish them many more years of strength and excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S344-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S344-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/28/senate-section/article/S344-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S344-S345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-4228.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Puerto Rico Emergency \n     Financial Stability Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 6002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Commonwealth Government is confronted with a dire \n     fiscal emergency and liquidity crisis that imminently \n     threatens the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, \n     affecting the provision of essential public services \n     including public safety, health care, and education that are \n     needed both to sustain the welfare of the people and the \n     economic ability of the Commonwealth to address any future \n     resolution of debts and legal obligations.\n       (2) A temporary stay on litigation with respect to debt \n     holders for the Commonwealth is essential to provide \n     breathing space to the Commonwealth, creditors, and the \n     Congress to determine an orderly process for the Commonwealth \n     to address any future resolution of legal obligations and to \n     provide the Commonwealth a path to sustainable growth; and \n     thereby, protect the lives of more than 3,500,000 citizens of \n     the United States living in the Commonwealth.\n       (3) The Commonwealth is in a state of fiscal emergency \n     brought on by, among other things, a combination of \n     accumulated operating deficits, cash shortages, management \n     inefficiencies, and excessive borrowing.\n       (4) The Commonwealth Government's debt is unusually \n     complex, with 18 different but inter-related issuers.\n       (A) There is an even larger number of creditor groups, each \n     of which may have divergent interests.\n       (B) The debt's unusual complexity will substantially \n     complicate any potential consensual restructuring in the \n     absence of Federal legislation to facilitate the \n     negotiations.\n       (5) This legislation, which includes a stay on litigation \n     by debt holders, can protect essential government services \n     and help the Commonwealth address its liabilities in an \n     orderly fashion, benefitting all stakeholders.\n       (A) A temporary stay on litigation is essential to \n     facilitate an orderly process for stabilizing, evaluating, \n     and comprehensively resolving the Commonwealth's fiscal \n     crisis.\n       (B) Avoiding a disorderly race to the courthouse will \n     benefit creditors as well as other stakeholders.\n       (C) Furthermore, the stay is only temporary.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) provide a limited period of time to permit Congress to \n     enact comprehensive relief for the Commonwealth, providing it \n     the necessary tools to address its economic and fiscal \n     crisis; and\n       (2) provide the Commonwealth Government with a tool it \n     needs to address an immediate and imminent crisis that is \n     unprecedented in the history of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 6003. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect as though enacted on December \n     18, 2015.\n\n     SEC. 6004. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this title or the application thereof \n     to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder \n     of this title, or the application of that provision to \n     persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is \n     held invalid, is not affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 6005. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Bond.--The term ``Bond'' means a bond, loan, line of \n     credit, note, or other borrowing title, in physical or \n     dematerialized form, of which--\n       (A) the issuer, borrower, or guarantor is the Commonwealth \n     Government; and\n       (B) the date of issuance or incurrence of debt precedes the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Commonwealth.--The term ``Commonwealth'' means the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n       (3) Commonwealth government.--The term ``Commonwealth \n     Government'' means the government of the Commonwealth, \n     including all its political subdivisions, public agencies, \n     instrumentalities, and public corporations.\n       (4) Court.--The term ``court'' means the United States \n     District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\n       (5) Other terms.--Any other term that is used in section \n     6006 and is defined in title 11, United States Code, has the \n     meaning given that term under title 11, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 6006. AUTOMATIC STAY.\n\n       (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the \n     enactment of this title operates with respect to any claim, \n     debt, or cause of action related to a Bond as a stay, \n     applicable to all entities (as such term is defined in \n     section 101 of title 11, United States Code), of--\n       (1) the commencement or continuation, including the \n     issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, \n     administrative, or other action or proceeding against the \n     Commonwealth Government or to recover a claim against the \n     Commonwealth Government;\n       (2) the enforcement, against the Commonwealth Government or \n     against property of the Commonwealth Government, of a \n     judgment;\n       (3) any act to obtain possession of property of the \n     Commonwealth Government or of property from the Commonwealth \n     Government or to exercise control over property of the \n     Commonwealth Government;\n       (4) any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against \n     property of the Commonwealth Government;\n       (5) any act to create, perfect, or enforce against property \n     of the Commonwealth Government any lien to the extent that \n     such lien secures a claim;\n       (6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against \n     the Commonwealth Government; and\n       (7) the setoff of any debt owing to the Commonwealth \n     Government against any claim against the Commonwealth \n     Government.\n       (b) The enactment of this title does not operate as a stay \n     under subsection (a) of this section of the continuation of, \n     including the issuance or employment of process, a judicial, \n     administrative, or other action or proceeding against the \n     Commonwealth Government that was commenced on or before the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Except as provided in subsection (d), (e), or (f), a \n     stay of an act under subsection (a) shall cease to have \n     effect as of April 1, 2016.\n       (d) On motion of a party in interest and after notice and a \n     hearing, the court may grant relief from a stay under \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of \n     a security interest in property of such party in interest; or\n       (2) with respect to a stay of an act against property under \n     subsection (a), if--\n       (A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property; \n     and\n       (B) such property is not necessary for the Commonwealth to \n     provide essential services;\n       (e) Thirty days after a request under subsection (d) of \n     this section for relief from the stay of any act against \n     property of the Commonwealth Government under subsection (a) \n     of this section, such stay is terminated with respect to the \n     party in interest making such request, unless the court, \n     after notice and a hearing, orders such stay continued in \n     effect pending the conclusion of, or as a result of, a final \n     hearing and determination under subsection (d) of this \n     section.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 351, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Mr. President, this week is an opportunity to highlight \nthe importance of parental choice in education, and the success that \nchildren find when they are able to choose an educational pathway that \nsuits their individual needs. Be it through public, charter, private, \nor home schools, as well as other forms of educational services that \nmay be tailored to the educational needs of our kids, we should \ncontinue our work to provide students with a viable and proven route to \na better education.\n  In particular, I want to recognize my home State of South Carolina \nfor our continuous work in expanding school choice initiatives. Since \n2013, when South Carolina's general assembly enacted the Educational \nCredit for Exceptional Needs Children, which helps children with \ndisabilities gain an education personalized to their own unique needs, \nSouth Carolina has been on the forefront of the school choice movement. \nThat is clearly on display this week, as South Carolina's National \nSchool Choice Rally will feature its largest rates of participation \nyet, with over 3,000 parents, advocates, and students lending their \nvoice and support to school choice.\n  On the Federal level, I have submitted legislation to free up access \nto educational resources for America's least fortunate students. I have \nsponsored legislation that would make IDEA funds portable and create a \nschool choice pilot program for military families, as well as \nbipartisan legislation with Senators Feinstein, Johnson, and Booker to \nreauthorize and improve the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, the \nNation's only federally supported school choice program.\n  I believe we must continue this work to promote parental choice. \nReforms to our educational system should empower parents and students, \nnot bureaucrats, to choose the educational option that best meets their \nunique needs. Because when parents have better choices, their kids have \na better chance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
