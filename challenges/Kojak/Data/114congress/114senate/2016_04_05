Mr. President, we will soon begin consideration of \nbipartisan legislation that can support American jobs, improve airline \nsafety, and help passengers--all without raising taxes or fees on \ntravelers. The FAA Reauthorization Act before us is the result of a \ncollaborative committee process. It shows what is possible with a \nSenate that is back to work and back to regular order. In this case, \nthe Commerce Committee held a series of seven hearings to guide and \ninform its deliberations throughout this process. Republicans on the \nCommerce Committee had their say, Democrats on the Commerce Committee \noffered their input, and at the end of the day, Members of both parties \nwere able to agree on bipartisan legislation that passed committee on a \nvoice vote.\n  We know the bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act will promote American \nmanufacturing, preserve rural access in States such as Kentucky, and \nadvance new consumer protections for the flying public. We also know it \nwill help improve safety and security both in the skies and in our \nairports. Here are a few ways this bipartisan bill can help: by \nallowing us to better prepare for the outbreak of communicable diseases \nlike Ebola, by improving the quality of FAA's safety workforce, by \nencouraging the FAA to harmonize international safety standards, by \nbringing the government and stakeholders together in the development of \nsafety standards for unmanned aerial vehicles, and by taking aim at \nhuman trafficking.\n  This legislation is the product of a lot of hard work and reaching \nacross the aisle. At this time I wish to recognize Senator Thune for \nleading the effort. He knows what is possible in a Senate that is back \nto work for the American people. He worked hard with the top Democrat \non his committee, Senator Nelson, to get us to this point today. But \nthese two Senators certainly didn't do it all by themselves. Senator \nAyotte was one of the key players in this bipartisan effort. As chair \nof the Subcommittee on Aviation, Senator Ayotte held numerous briefings \nand hearings on the issue with her colleague Senator Cantwell.\n  While many in this Chamber are focusing on the issue now, the bill \nbefore us is the product of many months of work by members of the \nCommerce Committee and their staff. Let's continue to work together in \na similar spirit. While the Commerce Committee has produced a product \nthat merits this Chamber's consideration, I am sure they would \nacknowledge that they don't have a monopoly on good ideas. I hope we \ncan have an efficient amendment process where Members bring their best \nideas to the floor. Let's pass another significant piece of legislation \nfor the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1645-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1645-S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a few years ago President Obama gave a \nspeech in Miami where he said the following about immigration: ``I know \n[that] some . . . wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the \nlaw by myself. But that's not how democracy\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nworks.'' That was the President in Miami a couple of years ago. He is \nright--that isn't how it works. Apparently that wasn't enough to stop \nhim from pursuing the kind of partisan overreach he once described as \n``ignoring the law'' and ``unwise and unfair.'' It didn't keep him from \ndoing that anyway. Maybe he didn't anticipate that a Federal district \ncourt would issue a preliminary injunction to prevent him from moving \nforward. Maybe he didn't expect that a Federal appeals court would \nuphold that ruling.\n  But now the Supreme Court will hear arguments in this case later this \nmonth on core constitutional principles like the separation of powers \nand the duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. That \nis why I led a group of 43 Republican Senators yesterday in filing an \namicus brief in support of the challenge to this overreach--a challenge \nbrought by a majority of America's Governors and attorneys general from \nacross our country. As we highlighted in the brief, the \nadministration's Executive action ``stands in stark contravention to \nFederal law and to the constitutional principle of the separation of \npowers.'' It is also an ``explicit effort to circumvent the legislative \nprocess.''\n  So, look, whether Republicans or Democrats, this kind of partisan \noverreach should worry all of us no matter who is in the White House \nbecause not only is the President's blatant refusal to follow the law \nan extraordinary power grab, it is a direct challenge to Congress's \nconstitutional authority and a direct attack on our constitutional \norder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1646-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year I noted that the next \nCommander in Chief will assume office confronting a complex and varied \narray of threats. I observed that after 7 years of the Obama \nadministration delaying action in the War on Terror, the next \nadministration would need to return to the fight and restore our role \nin the world. Among many other things, that means we must return to \ncapturing, interrogating, and targeting the enemy in a way that allows \nus to defeat terrorist networks because let's remember that during his \nfirst week in office, the President issued a series of Executive orders \nthat collectively undermined the capability of our intelligence \ncommunity and military to combat terrorism.\n  Yesterday the Defense Department confirmed that two of Al Qaeda's \nformer explosives experts were transferred from the secure detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay to Senegal. Both detainees had long records \nof supporting Al Qaeda. According to records that have been made \npublic, one of those detainees, a former associate of Osama bin Laden, \nis likely to reengage in hostilities. The other detainee was previously \nassessed as likely to return to the fight. This comes at a time when Al \nQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has exploited the war in Yemen to secure \na safe haven and the al-Nusra Front within Syria is exploiting the \ncivil war there to carry on Al Qaeda's mission. This is precisely the \nwrong time to send experienced, hardened fighters back into the \nconflict.\n  We must use the remaining months of the Obama administration as a \nyear of transition to better posture our military to meet the threats \nwe face, not make it more challenging for the next President, \nregardless of political party. Actually, there have been encouraging \nchanges within the administration recently, such as programs presented \nin the budget request by the Secretary of Defense to address Chinese \nand Russian aggression, a public recognition by the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of the threat posed by ISIL in Libya, more focus on the \nneed to rebuild a nuclear triad, General Campbell's statement that a \nlarger force must be left in Afghanistan, and the deployment of the \nexpeditionary targeting force to Iraq. This is the wrong time for the \nadministration to release terrorists who are likely to return to the \nfight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1646-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to follow up on a couple of \nstatements that were made by my friend the Republican leader. Senator \nMcConnell mentioned immigration. In the last Congress we worked very \nhard together in a bipartisan fashion to form a good, comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill. We passed it, but due to the power of the tea \npartiers--or, as Speaker Boehner referred to them, ``the crazies''--\nthey didn't have a vote in the House. If they had voted on that \nlegislation, it would have passed. Democrats would have voted for it, \nand there were enough Republicans who would have voted for it. That \nwould have been a big vote out of there, but it didn't happen, so the \nPresident had to do something on immigration, and he laid the \ngroundwork. He spoke at the State of the Union Address and basically \nsaid: Since you are not passing any legislation, I will have to use my \nExecutive power in order to get things done. He then proceeded to \nprioritize what he wanted to do. He issued the order that was so \nimportant to boys and girls, called a deferred action, which allowed \nDREAMers to stay in the country, and that was the right thing to do. He \nalso prioritized deportations by going after criminals, not families, \nand enforcing the law. He has done a very good job.\n  I think it is also very important to note that the administrative \nactions the President has taken are nothing unique. We can go back to \nthe days of Theodore Roosevelt, a good Republican President who did a \nlot of stuff administratively.\n  On his remarks about getting involved in the fight again--I am \nparaphrasing what he said--that we have to get back to the \ninterrogation we did before, we know that torture was quickly \neliminated. That effort was led by a lot of people, not the least of \nwhom was someone who has been tortured, a Member of the U.S. Senate, \nJohn McCain. He has spoken out very admirably, and as only he can, \nabout how bad torture is. And the facts indicate that torture doesn't \nget any new information anyway; there are other ways to get that \ninformation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1646-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1646-S1648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Iowa, who is \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, came to the floor yesterday \nafternoon in an attempt to divert attention away from that committee \nand his failure to do his job. He is not doing his job as chairman of \nthat committee. He hoped to do that by focusing on me for objecting to \na bill that would expand the subpoena powers of certain government \nappointees called inspectors general, but his efforts failed. People \nweren't looking at me; they were looking at the work not done by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I objected to that bill because that legislation was really a \nlegislative overreach, just as my friend the senior Senator from Iowa \ncontinues his overreach by turning the Senate Judiciary Committee into, \nfor example, a Benghazi committee--a narrowly partisan committee \nmasquerading as an independent party. It is the same theory that had \nSecretary Clinton spending 11 or 12 hours before the committee during \nthe course of 1 day. That hearing was a flop because of her \nassertiveness, her direct answering of questions, and her physical and \nemotional strength, standing and sitting during that time.\n  My friend's tenure as Judiciary Committee chair has been reduced to \none stunt after another. One of his stunts included demanding maternity \nleave records of one of Secretary Clinton's staffers. Another political \nstunt was blocking the confirmation of State Department Legal Adviser \nBrian Egan,\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\nand yet another political stunt was blocking the promotions list of \ncareer Foreign Service officers. And his latest political stunt is \npreventing the Senate from doing its constitutional duty in considering \nPresident Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. So even \nthough the senior Senator from Iowa hopes to divert attention away from \nthis disappointment, that is his Republican Judiciary Committee, the \npeople aren't easily fooled.\n\n  The people of Iowa and the rest of the country certainly aren't \nbuying Senator Grassley's political charades. This morning the Des \nMoines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, published another \nscathing editorial regarding Senator Grassley's unprecedented \nobstruction of the Supreme Court nominee. The editorial highlights the \nfact that because of the Supreme Court vacancy, the highest Court in \nthe land is now stuck in a rut of 4-to-4 decisions--a stalemate. This \nis what the Des Moines Register editorial said, and I quote:\n\n       Americans might need to get used to deadlocks, thanks to \n     Senator Chuck Grassley. The head of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee seems just fine with stalemate.\n\n  Now the senior Senator from Iowa may be content with gridlock in the \nSupreme Court, but the American people simply aren't. They are not \ncontent with the way the chairman continues to use one of the most \nprestigious, independent, and powerful committees to carry out \npolitical warfare. So maybe he should spend less time complaining about \nme and more time simply doing his job.\n  Every day, more and more Senators are meeting with President Obama's \nSupreme Court nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland, as well they \nshould. According to the senior Senator from Utah, ``fulfilling that \nrole [of advice and consent] requires us to evaluate a nominee's \nqualifications for the particular position for which she has been \nnominated.'' We know that was when they were looking at Sotomayor and \nKagan, who are on the Court. That is why every Senator, using the same \nlogic as my friend from Utah--Republican, Democratic--should meet with \nJudge Garland.\n  This week he has a full slate of meetings scheduled with Senate \nDemocrats. By the end of the week, every Democratic member of the \nJudiciary Committee will have met with President Obama's nominee. To \ndate, 16 Republicans have either met with Judge Garland or indicated \nthey are willing to do so in the future. Some even have meetings \nscheduled: Senators Ayotte, Boozman, Cassidy, Cochran, Collins, Flake, \nGrassley, Inhofe, Johnson, Kirk, Lankford, Murkowski, Portman, Risch, \nRounds, and Toomey. These are all Republican Senators who have said \npublically that they are going to meet with him. I think that is a step \nin the right direction, and I think it really speaks volumes.\n  Take for example Senator Inhofe and Senator Lankford. I am sure they \nhave in their mind the outstanding work that Garland did when he was \nU.S. assistant attorney. He led the charge. No one questions his \nterrific, outstanding prosecution of that man who killed who knows how \nmany people in Oklahoma with that bomb, for which, of course, \neventually, he was given the death penalty.\n  This is a good man. Judge Garland is a good man. In every court he \ngoes to, Democrats and Republicans speak highly of him--Chief Justice \nRoberts, among others. So I was disappointed last week when some \nRepublican Senators, such as Murkowski and Moran, abandoned their \nprevious support for agreeing to consider Judge Garland's nomination. \nSenator Moran's backtracking is especially alarming because it appears \nto be the result of a multimillion dollar campaign urging the Senator \nto reverse his support for a hearing for Judge Garland. As has been \nreported by the Topeka Capital-Journal, Senator Moran's about-face came \nin response to a backlash from the Koch brothers. I quote directly from \nthe article:\n\n       On March 21, Moran told a small crowd in Cimarron, ``I have \n     my job to do,'' and ``I think the process ought to go \n     forward.'' Though he made it clear that Garland likely \n     wouldn't be worthy of his vote, the comments indicated \n     hearings should be held for the judge.\n\n  But they went on to say more.\n\n       Within a few days, Moran's comments sparked backlash from \n     conservative groups. The Judicial Crisis Network announced it \n     was putting the finishing touches on an advertising campaign \n     bashing Moran, and the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund said \n     it was considering backing a primary challenger.\n       U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a fellow Kansas \n     Republican, publicly called on Moran to reconsider, a rare \n     criticism of Moran from a fellow member of the Kansas \n     congressional delegation. The criticisms eventually reached \n     bizarre heights when the Traditional Values Coalition \n     compared Moran to Judas Iscariot.\n       [The] chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network said \n     Friday she was pleased to see Moran changed his mind.\n\n  Well, I guess you could say he changed his mind. Moran was meeting \nwith Garland and holding confirmation hearings until the Judicial \nCrisis Network and the tea party and the Koch brothers threatened him. \nIt will surprise no one to learn that the Koch brothers and their dark \nmoney helped fund these radical organizations more than anybody else in \nthe world. The Kochs are notorious for bullying anyone who stands in \ntheir way.\n  There is, without any question, oligarchs in the land, the first ones \nI have known in America. They are the Koch brothers. If they are \nsuccessful in the splurging of their vast wealth and accomplishing what \nthey set out doing in this campaign, I feel very, very bad for our \ncountry. They will be talking about us the way they talk about Russia--\nthe oligarchy that is there. We are going to have one and the same.\n  Now, we must not forget how the Koch brothers' minions tried to \nintimidate investigative journalist Jane Mayer because she dared to \nexpose the Kochs' attempt to buy our democracy. Her book, called ``Dark \nMoney,'' is on the New York Times bestseller list, and all over the \ncountry people are buying that book. Why? Because it is an insight into \ntwo brothers who are trying to buy America. Charles and David Koch used \ntheir fortune and their tremendous clout to force Senator Moran to back \ndown from his position. Publically, I can't imagine how one of us, a \nSenator, could be forced to do that in the manner that he was. All of \nthis is because the junior Senator from Kansas dared to meet with the \nSupreme Court nominee. He dared to suggest that Garland deserved a \nhearing. He dared to do his job.\n  So is this now what the Republican Party has become--a party dictated \nby menace and intimidation? All you have to do is look at what is going \non with the Republican Presidential nomination. That answers the \nquestion itself.\n  Some 30 years ago, though, Senator Grassley said the Judiciary \nCommittee ``has the obligation to build a record and to conduct the \nmost in-depth inquiry that we can'' on Supreme Court nominees. Now the \nRepublican leader, Charles Grassley, have twisted the arms of the \nRepublican Judiciary Committee members, compelling them to sign a \nloyalty pledge and forcing them to refuse to consider the President's \nSupreme Court nominee. Regrettably, Senator Moran is just the latest \nRepublican Senator who has allowed himself to be pushed around, to be \nintimidated by money.\n  Instead of caving to the Republican leader and the Koch brothers, it \nis time for the Republican Senators to take a stand and do their job. I \nhope the remaining Republican Senators who said they will meet with him \nwill go ahead and do so and will stand firm. I hope they will meet with \nJudge Garland and take the next step in the process--to hold \nconfirmation hearings. As it was reported by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, the average wait for the Supreme Court \nnominees, from nomination to hearing, has been 42 days. According to \nthat timeline, Chairman Grassley and his committee should begin \nconfirmation hearings for Judge Garland April 27.\n  Last week, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter \nto the Republican leader and Chairman Grassley calling on them to abide \nby this traditional timeline and hold a hearing by the 27th. I am very \nproud of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee for doing this. That \nis what the American people want. They want Republicans to stop \ncounting on the most extreme forces within their party and just do \ntheir job. That is all we are asking--as simple as that.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce what the Senate is scheduled \nto do the rest of the day.\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1648-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Article II, section 2 of \nthe U.S. Constitution states clearly that the President shall--shall--\nnominate a person to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. It goes \non to say that the responsibility of the Senate is to provide advice \nand consent to Supreme Court nominations. It is very clear. The men who \nwrote the Constitution understood the importance of filling a vacancy \non the U.S. Supreme Court, and they understood it to be so important \nthat they mandated that the President send the nominee forward to fill \nthat vacancy.\n  You can read that Constitution from start to finish and never find \nthe rationale being used by Senator McConnell, the majority leader of \nthe Senate, to stop that nomination from being considered in the \nSenate. There is no argument made in the Constitution--nor has there \never been an argument made--that because the President is in the last \nyear of his 4-year term, he no longer has a constitutional \nresponsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. In fact, never--\nunderline never--has the Senate refused a hearing to a nominee who has \nbeen sent forward by a President of the United States to fill this \nimportant vacancy. It speaks volumes that Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, has decided--has taken it on himself--to stop the \nSenate from considering the President's nominee.\n  It is an embarrassing position to take for many of his colleagues. \nLook at what they are going through. Republican Senators who went home \nover this Easter break--many of them--went to town meetings where \npeople asked this very basic question: Senator, why is it that you \nwon't do your job? Why won't you even give a hearing to this man who \nwas sent by the President for consideration by the Senate to fill this \nimportant vacancy?\n  It is a hard question to answer if you take the position of Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, because the answer is that, \nbasically, he is arguing that this President has no authority--no \nauthority to fill this vacancy. Senator McConnell argues that we should \nhold this vacancy open for the rest of this calendar year into next \nyear so that a new President--whoever that might be--would have the \npower to fill this vacancy. He argues that the American people will \nspeak through this next election as to a new President and that person \nshould have the authority.\n  Well, what we discovered over the course of the last several weeks is \nthis isn't about giving the American people a voice in choosing to fill \nthat vacancy; it is about giving two individuals, the Koch brothers, \nthe decision to fill that vacancy. These brothers have decided it is in \ntheir best interests--their political interests, their economic \ninterests, whatever it may be--to keep this spot vacant on the U.S. \nSupreme Court in the hopes that a Republican Presidential candidate \nwill win the election and fill the Court vacancy with the blessing of \nthe Koch brothers. So Republican Senators are going back to their home \ndistricts and States, basically facing the electorate in their home \nStates, and finding it impossible to justify avoiding any consideration \nof this nominee.\n\n  It got more difficult this morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record in its entirety. The Washington Post has reported \nthat U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for \nhis Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him \nbest--his former law clerks. It goes on to say that 68 former law \nclerks for this judge have written to Members of Congress recommending \nhim based on their personal experience of working professionally with \nhim.\n  Let me read this passage from their letter:\n\n       There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the \n     loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland. Our \n     enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a \n     reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us \n     long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side \n     during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, \n     having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. \n     He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He \n     is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he \n     has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we \n     have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty.\n\n  This article one might expect from his clerks saying what a good \nperson he is, but they have gone out of their way to suggest to the \nSenate that a person of this quality and this integrity should be \ntreated fairly--fairly.\n  I listened to some of the comments that are being made on the \nRepublican side about this man, and it is a long way from fairness. \nWhat they are saying to him is we don't care about where you came from. \nWe don't care about your education. We don't care about your \nprofessional qualifications. We don't care about your career on the \nbench. We care that you have been nominated by President Barack Obama, \nand as far as Senator McConnell is concerned, enough said.\n  If Barack Obama nominates this man, Senator McConnell has made it \nclear he will deny to him something that has never ever been denied to \na Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United States of America: \na fair hearing.\n  That is why it is painful for a lot of Republican Senators to go back \nand face audiences. The partisans in the audience come in, in a \npredictable state, with Republicans saying: Hold the line. Don't let \nObama act like a President of the United States. We want him to go \naway. Democrats come in and ask: Can't you at least give this man a \nhearing? I would say to my Republican colleagues: Listen to the people \nwho view themselves as Independents in this country, folks who don't \ncarry a party label. They are saying overwhelmingly that Merrick \nGarland is entitled to a hearing before the U.S. Senate. He is an \nextraordinarily well-qualified man. There is no credible justification \nto refuse to give him a hearing.\n  Merrick Garland was born in Chicago. His father ran a small business. \nHis mother volunteered in the Rogers Park neighborhood. He was the \ngrandson of immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in the Pale of Settlement \nin Russia. They came to America in the early 1900s. Judge Garland grew \nup in Lincolnwood, IL. He graduated at the top of his class at Niles \nWest High School in Skokie. He earned an undergraduate and law degree \nfrom Harvard. He was a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the Second \nCircuit and to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan.\n  He had a distinguished career at the Justice Department. They sent \nMerrick Garland down after the Oklahoma City tragedy, when there was a \nterrible incident--a domestic terrorist bombing--that killed and maimed \nso many people. The prosecution of that accused terrorist was the \nhighest priority for the Department of Justice. They had to get it \nright, not just for the cause of justice but for the victims and their \nfamilies. They had to get it right on this prosecution. So they sent \ntheir very best prosecutor, Merrick\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nGarland. He was given that responsibility and took it very seriously. \nHe used to carry around with him the names of those who died in that \nOklahoma City terrorist incident as a reminder of the solemn \nresponsibility which he carried in this undertaking. That is the kind \nof person he is.\n  He successfully prosecuted those who were engaged in the terrorism \nthat caused that terrible event. The Department of Justice thought that \nhighly of him, and his performance in Oklahoma City was so stellar that \nhe achieved his goal--a fair and effective prosecution.\n  The Senate considered Merrick Garland for the second highest court of \nthe land, the D.C. Circuit Court in 1997. He received a majority vote \non both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. The total final \nvote was 76 to 23. Thirty-two Senate Republicans voted to confirm Judge \nGarland. He has been on that court--the D.C. Circuit--for 19 years and \nhe has been the chief judge for the last 3 years.\n  Throughout his lengthy judicial career, Chief Judge Garland has been \npraised for his intelligence, knowledge of the law, adherence to \nprecedent, and his ability to forge a consensus. Listen to what Chief \nJustice John Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court said during his own \nconfirmation hearing: ``Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know \nyou're in a difficult area.''\n  I have my differences with Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, but I will be the first to say his presentation to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee was one I will never forget. He sat there for 2 \ndays, without a note in front of him, and answered every question \neffectively and eloquently. I left there with the distinct impression \nhe was one of the brightest individuals who had ever been nominated to \nthe Supreme Court.\n  So this man, Chief Justice Roberts, whether we agree with his \npolitics or his decisions, should be listened to when he says of \nMerrick Garland, President Obama's nominee, that if you disagreed with \nJudge Garland, you know you are in a difficult area. That is high \npraise from Chief Justice John Roberts. It is high praise for a man who \nhas been denied a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the \nfirst time in the history of the Senate.\n  I commend Judge Garland for his many decades of public service and \ncongratulate him and his wife Lynn and their daughters for the great \nhonor they have been given to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nI offer as well a word of apology to them for the way they are being \ntreated by the U.S. Senate. This is not right.\n\n  I hope that in the quiet and the solitude of their own Republican \ncaucus lunch, they will close the door and turn to one another and say: \nThis is not fair. It is not right. We owe this man a hearing. I am not \nsaying he should be rubberstamped. I am not saying the Senate \nRepublican majority should approve this man, although I think it is \ndifficult not to. I am saying he should be given a hearing. He deserves \nthat respect from the U.S. Senate.\n  It would be terrible and beneath the dignity of the Senate \nRepublicans to close the doors of the Senate to such an accomplished \nAmerican and deny him a fair hearing and a vote. The President has met \nhis responsibility. The Senate should do no less.\n  I know Merrick Garland is in for a rough ride. The senior Senator \nfrom Texas said as much a few weeks ago. He said President Obama's \nSupreme Court nominee would ``bear some resemblance to a pinata.''\n  Do we know what that means? Remember, if you will, that Mexican \ncustom of filling a paper mache animal with candy, then blindfolding a \nchild and giving him a stick or a bat to try to swing wildly and beat \non that pinata until it is broken open and the candy hits the floor. \nThat was the analogy used by the senior Senator from Texas as to how \nMerrick Garland should expect to be treated if his nomination comes \nbefore the Senate. It is a sad commentary, but it may reflect the \nreality of the bitter political environment we live in. It is troubling \nto hear our nomination process in the Senate characterized this way.\n  There is a way to avoid pinata politics. Let's give Merrick Garland a \nfair hearing.\n  Right now, conservative groups and some Senate Republicans are taking \ntheir swings blindly at Merrick Garland. They are flailing around, \nhoping to find some argument to justify the mistreatment which they are \noffering. For example, there is a rightwing advocacy group calling \nitself the Judicial Crisis Network, whatever that is, that recently \nannounced a multi-State ad campaign against Judge Garland. How about \nthat. They will not give him a hearing. They will not even let him sit \ndown in a chair under oath and face questions and give answers, but \nthey have started a multi-State ad campaign against him. The campaign \nsaid that with Garland on the bench, the Second Amendment would be \n``gutted'' because ``in two separate cases, Garland has demonstrated \nhis strong hostility to gun owner rights.'' Several Senate Republicans \nhave echoed this attack. They have heard this so-called Judicial Crisis \nNetwork ad and they have decided to amplify it.\n  However, there is no argument that can be made seriously or fairly \nfor the proposition that Judge Garland opposes the Second Amendment in \nhis rulings.\n  There are two cases mentioned by this rightwing organization on the \nsubject. They date back many years to 2000 and 2007. The first was a \ncase involving the auditing of background check records. When that case \nwas appealed to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department of President \nGeorge W. Bush, led by conservative Attorney General John Ashcroft, \nagreed with Judge Garland's position. There was no controversy as far \nas they were concerned. So a Republican President and a Republican \nAttorney General agreed with the ruling of Judge Garland.\n  In the other case in which Judge Garland is accused of having \noverstepped the bounds on the Second Amendment, he never even addressed \nany substantive Second Amendment issue.\n  If the Judicial Crisis Network was so outraged by these decisions in \nthe year 2000 and the year 2007, why didn't they bring it up in 2010 \nwhen Merrick Garland was in the running to fill a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court? In that year, Carrie Severino, the head of that \norganization--the Judicial Crisis Network--told the Washington Post:\n\n       Of those the President could nominate, we can do a lot \n     worse than Merrick Garland. He's the best scenario we could \n     hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city \n     down a notch for the summer.\n\n  I just quoted the person who was in charge of the Judicial Crisis \nNetwork when Merrick Garland was under consideration for the Supreme \nCourt six years ago. Now that same network has decided to spend \nmillions of dollars to stop this nominee.\n  If Judge Garland's views on the Second Amendment were so \nobjectionable, why has he been praised by Charles Cooper, the gun \nlobby's top outside attorney? On March 28 of this year, Cooper told the \nWashington Post about his ``high opinion'' of Garland as a judge.\n  So here is the reality. Rightwing advocacy groups like the Judicial \nCrisis Network are swinging wildly at Judge Garland. They \nmischaracterize his record and they attack his judgment in an effort to \ndiscredit him. If the Senate holds a public hearing for Garland, he \nwould at least have his day to state his position clearly on the Second \nAmendment, but they are so afraid of what he is going to say, the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate has denied Merrick Garland an \nopportunity for a hearing at this point in time.\n  At a hearing, the American people could judge for themselves. How \nabout that for a novel idea; that we would put Merrick Garland under \noath, sit him at a table, ask whatever questions we consider to be \nimportant for his nomination, and then let the American people decide. \nThe Republicans will have nothing to do with that. Senator McConnell \nhas said from the start he is never going to allow that to occur.\n  The Senate is doing Judge Garland and our Nation a grave disservice \nif we don't move forward with a public hearing on this nomination, as \nwe have with every other Supreme Court nominee that has been sent by a \nPresident.\n  Just for the record, go back to 1987, when a vacancy occurred on the \nSupreme Court, and in 1988, the last year of Ronald Reagan's Republican \nPresidency, he sent a nominee to the U.S. Senate to be considered. \nAnthony Kennedy was a Reagan nominee, and the Democratic-controlled \nU.S. Senate not only gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing,\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nthey gave him a unanimous vote, sending him to the Supreme Court. \nDespite the fact that Ronald Reagan was a ``lameduck''--the last year \nof his Presidency--the Senate at that time respected the Office of the \nPresidency and respected the Constitution enough to give Anthony \nKennedy his day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his day before \nthe U.S. Senate. If it was fair enough for a Republican President in a \nDemocratic Senate, why isn't the same standard to be used when it comes \nto President Obama's nominee being sent to the Senate on this day? It \ncannot be explained away.\n\n  What does this vacancy on the Supreme Court mean? There are only \neight members of a nine-member Court. Already the Supreme Court has \ndeadlocked twice on 4-to-4 tie votes since Justice Scalia's passing. \nAlmost 50 cases still need to be decided in this term. Major legal \nquestions may go unresolved because the Senate is not doing its job and \nnot filling this vacancy.\n  Judge Garland does not deserve to be used as a pinata--a word used by \na Senate Republican describing what he would face in the Senate. Let's \ngive him an opportunity to rebut any attacks made against him. Let him \nexplain himself on the record in full view of the American public. Let \nthe American people decide if the ads and attacks against him are valid \nor baseless.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues: Do not follow the lead of rightwing \nadvocacy groups and attack Judge Garland's character or record when you \nrefuse to give the man a chance to respond at a public hearing. That is \nfundamentally unfair.\n  This is a real moment of truth for the Senate. No Supreme Court \nnominee has ever been denied a hearing before, and Merrick Garland \nshould not be the first. The message of the American people to the \nSenate Republican majority is very simple, three words: Do your job. Do \nyour job under the Constitution. Have a hearing. Be fair to this man. \nDon't dream up excuses. Don't argue with this President who won by 5 \nmillion votes over Mitt Romney. Don't disrespect the Office of the \nPresidency or the Constitution, which in its clarity establishes our \nresponsibility to give a hearing to this nominee. My Republican \ncolleagues need to do their job and to schedule a hearing for Merrick \nGarland without delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Garland's Ex-Clerks: Confirm Our Old Boss\n\n                           (By Mike DeBonis)\n\n       U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost \n     for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who \n     know him best: his former law clerks.\n       Sixty-eight former Garland clerks signed a letter delivered \n     Monday to Senate leaders of both parties, urging them to \n     confirm his nomination. The signers comprise all but three of \n     the ex-clerks Garland has employed since he joined the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in \n     1997. And the three holdouts have a good reason: They are \n     clerks for Supreme Court justices.\n       The three-page tribute is both professional and personal.\n       ``There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the \n     loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland,'' the \n     ex-clerks write. ``Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his \n     character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and \n     encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood \n     by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite \n     literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his \n     former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families \n     into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and \n     guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark \n     times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and \n     uncertainty.''\n       Clerkships on the D.C. Circuit are among the nation's most \n     prestigious, second only to the Supreme Court itself. The \n     signers have gone on to high-level positions in federal and \n     state government, private practices and academia. Several \n     have spent time in the office of the White House counsel; one \n     of those lawyers, Danielle Gray, served as Cabinet secretary \n     to President Obama.\n       The letter paints a familiar portrait of Garland as a \n     careful judge, a hard-working public servant and a devoted \n     family man. But it also offers a couple of glimpses behind \n     the curtain.\n       In one notable passage, the clerks write that Garland \n     ``taught us the value of diversity, in all its forms.''\n       ``We observed how Chief Judge Garland forged meaningful \n     connections with others from a wide array of backgrounds and \n     ideological perspectives--from the law clerks he hires to the \n     personal and professional relationships he maintains. He \n     finds camaraderie with his fellow judges without regard to \n     who nominated them to the bench. Chief Judge Garland deeply \n     believes that our system of justice works best when those who \n     see things differently are able to work together, in a \n     collegial manner, to arrive at a just result. And when he \n     must disagree with his colleagues, he always does so \n     respectfully.''\n       And they describe how his private response to the Sept 11, \n     2001, attacks had a profound impression on the four clerks \n     who were working for him at the time: ``From his chambers, we \n     watched with horror the news about the attacks on the World \n     Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the days after, we remember \n     the explicit importance Chief Judge Garland placed on coming \n     to the office everyday and continuing to prepare for upcoming \n     cases. In the aftermath of that terrible tragedy, he believed \n     it was more important than ever for the American people to \n     see that their system of government was functioning without \n     interruption--that the rule of law endured!''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to join in the remarks just \nmade by the senior Senator from Illinois that we have an obligation to \ndo our job and to provide a hearing and a vote for the President's \nnominee--not as a matter of discretion or convenience but as a \nmandatory obligation we have as Members of this body. It is an \nobligation that comes from the Constitution, which says that we shall \nexercise this duty of advising and consenting.\n  For all the reasons my colleague has expressed so eloquently, the \nAmerican people feel that it is our job, and they are right. Nothing so \nepitomizes the feeling of the American people that Washington is \nfailing to work, that this body is failing to do its job, that the \nCongress and the Federal Government are failing the American people, \nthan the failure to deal with this nominee. The refusal to even meet \nwith him mocks the American system of justice. For all who care about \nthe quality of our judicial nominee, this intransigence is both an \ninsult and an injury, and it will do lasting damage to the Court if it \ndrags this third branch of government into the mire of partisan \nbickering.\n  The judicial branch depends, for the enforceability of its decisions, \non the trust and credibility of the American people that it is above \npolitics and that decisions made by the judicial branch are on the \nmerits without regard to the special interests and the money that so \ninfects this branch, and they are entitled to our support for the \ncredibility and trust of the judicial branch, and nothing epitomizes \nthe need for that credibility and trust more than the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. It is the highest Court in the land, and it is the most \npowerful. It is an anomaly in a democratic government because it is \nunelected, appointed for life, at the top of the judicial pyramid, \nexercising vast powers, with only the trust and credibility of the \nAmerican people as its means of enforcement. It has no army or police \nof its own. Its decisions and enforceability depend for their effect on \nit being above politics. The controversy and the intransigence and \nrefusal to even consider this nominee is a great threat to that \ninstitution.\n\n\n  Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act\n\n  Mr. President, on the issue of getting the job done, I want to go to \na separate topic very much on our minds at this time of year, very \ndistinct and different, but I want to join it in these remarks because \nit is timely as we begin the next phase of our bipartisan efforts to \ncombat Lyme and tick-borne diseases.\n  We will be building support this week for a bill that has been \nintroduced by Senator Ayotte and me, with the strong involvement and \nleadership of Senator Gillibrand, S. 1503, the Lyme and Tick-Borne \nDisease Prevention, Education, and Research Act, with 13 cosponsors. It \nis a bipartisan bill that is critically important to public health.\n  Today we will be welcoming a number of my friends and constituents \nfrom Connecticut and around the country who are experts to provide \nbriefings\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nto our staffs in sessions that have been organized by Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Gillibrand, and me. We are very pleased to welcome some of the \nleaders of this effort: John Aucott, who is an assistant professor of \nmedicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Dr. Brian Fallon, a \ngood friend and leading expert in this area and a professor at the \nColumbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; Ally Hilfiger, who has \nbeen a survivor and strong supporter and advocate; Rebecca Tibball, a \nfourth grade teacher from my home State of Connecticut who has been \nbattling Lyme disease since August of 2014; and David Roth, also a \nleader and a longstanding patient advocate from New York who in his day \njob is a managing director at the private sector group Blackstone. \nThese individuals are here to call attention to and build support for \ncuring a disease that is literally exploding exponentially in this \ncountry and now constitutes an epidemic that literally impinges and \ncripples the lives of millions of Americans.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that more \nthan 36,000 Americans suffered from Lyme disease in 2013. It says that \nthe number who actually contracted this disease is probably 10 times \nhigher because it is undetected and undiagnosed in so many people and \nit is underreported even when it is discovered in individuals. Most of \nthe cases of Lyme disease occur in a limited number of States. Ninety-\neight percent of them occur in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, \nPennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. I name those States \nbecause the Senators in those States ought to be behind this bill, \nevery single one of them. But those cases are only the ones reported. \nIn many States there is no systematic reporting of Lyme disease, so the \nfull extent, breadth, and depth of this epidemic is truly unknown.\n  We know in this body how to respond and recognize a public health \nthreat. It was done for Ebola. It is done for influenza. It hopefully \nwill be done for Zika. What is needed is the same kind of bipartisan \nawareness and support for legislation to help people who suffer from \nLyme and other tick-borne diseases.\n  Sometimes this Senator is asked: Why has the Congress failed to \nrecognize and respond to this severe public health threat?\n  There is no good explanation except for the underreporting and the \nunawareness, and that is no excuse. In the meantime, the cases of Lyme \ndisease are exploding in number, and the severity impacts our economy \nas well as the quality of life for Americans. It affects people's \nability to perform their jobs, children's ability to go to school, and \nfamilies' ability to function normally. The disease, if undetected and \nuntreated, can cause the most severe kinds of pain and disability.\n  Lyme disease is named after a town in my State. I have always felt it \nwas tremendously unfair for the beautiful and wonderful town of Lyme to \nhave its name bear the burden of this disease, but regardless of the \nname, the burden is on the entire country--not simply on Connecticut \nand not simply on the Northeast or any part of the country or \nprofession--to take action. That action must include provisions in this \nbill to strengthen Lyme disease surveillance and reporting, an \neducation program, establishing epidemiological research objectives for \ntick-borne diseases, and the preparation of a regular report to \nCongress on the progress of efforts to combat these devastating tick-\nborne diseases. The effects are devastating, pernicious, and insidious, \ncreeping into every aspect of a victim's life.\n  Our bill has earned the support of 13 Senators from both parties, \nincluding five members of the HELP Committee. When it comes to fighting \nLyme disease, there is no partisanship. The ticks that carry this \ndisease don't know a red State from a blue one. They don't make any \ndiscrimination between the boundaries of different States. The \ndevastating diseases that can spring from these ticks are common to our \nentire country and therefore demand a national response and a Federal \nprogram that we have outlined in this bill.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Ayotte and Senator Gillibrand in this \neffort. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to send your staffs \nto the briefing we have today.\n  I thank others from Connecticut--such as Alexandra Cohen--who are \ngoing to be coming today, and I look forward to continuing this fight, \nwhich has to be one of a nationwide commitment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to address last month's tragic \nterror attacks in Brussels and Istanbul by ISIS. It is critical for the \nSenate to consider these significant events as we get back to work on \nbills enhancing security and setting policies for air transportation.\n  In Brussels, 35 innocent people, including four Americans, lost their \nlives in barbaric attacks by ISIS at a subway station and airport \nterminal. In Istanbul, an ISIS suicide bombing killed four on Central \nStreet and left dozens more injured. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthose injured, the families of the victims, and the citizens of Belgium \nand Turkey.\n  In the past 2 years, ISIS has orchestrated 29 attacks on Western \ntargets around the world, killing more than 650 innocent people. A \ndecade ago, the group of violent jihadists behind ISIS fit a fairly \nconventional definition of a terrorist group. Operating in Iraq, they \nendeavored to kill Americans, Iraqis, and others working to build a \nfree and democratic nation.\n  Today, however, calling ISIS a mere terrorist group may not fully \nconvey the seriousness of the problem. ISIS, or the so-called Islamic \nState, has taken control of a significant amount of territory in Iraq \nand Syria. Within this territory, ISIS has established a self-\nproclaimed capital city and effective sovereignty over other populated \nurban centers. It collects taxes, operates and profits from oil well \noperations, controls banking, and rules over substantial agricultural \nacreage.\n  These operations help fund and sustain not only ISIS armed fighters \nbut also the group's attempt to build actual institutions that spread \nits message of hate. Unfortunately, ISIS has enjoyed considerable \nsuccess communicating and spreading its distorted vision of a grand \nIslamic caliphate claiming authority over all Muslims.\n  Branches of ISIS, trying to replicate what has happened in Syria and \nIraq, have taken root elsewhere and carried out operations in \ndestabilized areas, including Libya, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and \nYemen.\n  A recent report estimated that as many as 31,000 ISIS adherents have \ntraveled from 86 countries to join the organization in Iraq and Syria. \nMore than 5,000 of these recruits have come from Western Europe and 150 \nfrom the United States. In addition to those Americans who have \nactually traveled abroad, researchers at George Washington University \nestimated in December that there are 900 active investigations of ISIS \nsympathizers here in the United States. Let me repeat that--900 \ninvestigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. This \ndoesn't included those who have been radicalized without noticeable \nwarning, such as a couple in San Bernardino who weren't known to \nauthorities before they killed 14 in a shooting attack last December.\n  Over the past few years, ISIS's reach has expanded dramatically, and \nclaims that our current policies have contained the organizations and \nits dangerous message are both false and reckless. We have had some \nsuccesses in targeting senior ISIS officials, but as we saw in \nBrussels, in San Bernardino, and elsewhere, those efforts have not \nlessened the threat posed by a terrorist state that is successfully \npropagating its ideology all over the world.\n  So what can we do to protect against the threat posed by ISIS? Here \nare a few things:\n  First, we need a President who is committed to forming a robust \ncoalition to destroy ISIS abroad. Real American leadership against ISIS \nmust be manifested in sustained engagement against the enemy. We need \nan administration intent on eliminating the group's sources of income \nand its control of territory which facilitates an illusion of \nlegitimacy for its followers. Incremental progress is not enough. \nIndeed, the Washington Post reported last week that some terrorism \nexperts believe pressure on the group's finances\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\ncould make ISIS more dangerous and unpredictable until it is defeated.\n  Second, we need to control our borders. We need to know who is coming \nin and out of our country and why. This includes screening travelers \nfor ties to ISIS and to its sympathizers. One of the greatest threats \nfacing Europe is citizens who leave their homes to fight for ISIS and \nthen return to recruit or conduct operations in their communities. We \nalso face this threat from European ISIS fighters, the return of \nAmerican citizens who have fought for ISIS, and agents of ISIS posing \nas war refugees. Although we have passed bipartisan legislation to \ntighten some screening requirements, we need the administration to \nenforce the law rather than attempt to undermine and work around it.\n  Third, as a final line of defense, we need to better secure the \nhomeland. We must make sure the intelligence community, law \nenforcement, and Homeland Security officials have the tools they need \nto deter attacks and to stop plots before they are launched. This \nincludes the need for constant reassessment of our vulnerabilities so \nwe stay ahead of threats.\n  Tomorrow I will chair a hearing at the Commerce Committee with \nTransportation Security Administration Administrator Peter Neffenger, \nwho happened to be in Brussels during the March 22 attacks. While we \nmainly see and know the Transportation Security Administration or TSA \nas the agency behind airport screening of passengers and baggage, the \norganization actually has a much broader charge. TSA is the designated \nFederal agency for all transportation security matters. As we know from \nindependent covert testing that exposed TSA failures a year ago, TSA \nstill has work to do to improve screening at airports, but TSA also \nneeds to focus on securing transportation by train, bus, pipelines, and \nthrough our ports.\n  The diversity of the targets ISIS selected in its most recent \nattacks--a subway station, an unsecured airport terminal, and a busy \nstreet, underscores the challenge of protecting our citizens from an \nenemy seeking the path of least resistance to maximize its carnage. To \nstay ahead of this danger, security officials at TSA and other agencies \nneed to be looking at potential threats before ISIS does.\n  Congress has a role in helping security officials stay ahead of ISIS. \nAided by congressional oversight and congressional watchdogs, the \nCommerce Committee has already approved bipartisan legislation that \nSenator Bill Nelson and I have offered to address airport security \nvulnerabilities. Our bill is cosponsored by the Homeland Security \nCommittee's chair and ranking member, Senator Johnson and Senator \nCarper. Among other provisions, our legislation improves the vetting \nprocess for airport workers seeking or holding a security credential \nthat grants access to restricted sections of an airport.\n  Over the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers \nhave been caught in the act helping criminal organizations. On March \n18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine \nafter she was confronted by airport security officials in California. \nIn Florida, on March 26, an airline gate agent was arrested with a \nbackpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an \nassociate. According to press reports, the agent told authorities the \nmoney was connected to illegal activity, but he knew few other details. \nSome of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were \npreviously known to authorities as criminals--but not terrorists.\n\n  As we work to address concerns about an insider threat scenario, \nwhere an aviation worker helps terrorists, criminals who have broken \nlaws for their own financial gain and those with histories of violence \nare a good place to start. Ensuring that airport workers with security \ncredentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that \nISIS in October killed 224 on a Russian flight leaving Egypt. Many \nexperts believe this attack had help from an aviation employee.\n  In S. 2361, the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act, \nSenator Nelson and I propose not only tightening vetting procedures for \nworkers who need a security credential, but we also expand the list of \ncriminal convictions that disqualifies an applicant from holding one. \nAt present, even applicants convicted for embezzlement, racketeering, \nperjury, robbery, sabotage, immigration law violations, and assault \nwith a deadly weapon can still obtain an airport security badge \ngranting access to restricted areas. Our bill closes this loophole \nwhile updating airport security rules, expanding random inspections of \nairport workers, and requiring the review of airport perimeter \nsecurity.\n  The Commerce Committee has also approved another TSA-related bill, \nH.R. 2843, the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act. This bill would expand \nparticipation in the TSA precheck application program by developing \nprivate sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more \nindividuals. As a result, more passengers would be vetted before they \neven arrived at the airport and received expedited screening. This \nwould get passengers through security checkpoints more quickly to \nensure they don't pose the kind of easy target that ISIS suicide \nbombers found at the Brussels Airport.\n  Historically, this body has passed aviation security enhancements \nseparate from a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. \nWhile I still prefer this separate approach and believe the Senate \nshould pass our consensus security legislation without delay, I will \npursue every option to enact these improvements and will vigorously \noppose any effort to water down any security efforts that passed the \nCommerce Committee.\n  As we look at ISIS and consider necessary steps to stop attacks, \nlet's remember our recent history of fighting terrorism. In the 1990s, \nour Nation not only fell behind on intelligence and airport security, \nbut we did not act with force against Al Qaeda's enclaves in \nAfghanistan. This was true even after we recognized a significant \nthreat following attacks on our embassies in East Africa and on the USS \nCole in Yemen.\n  Only after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon did our \nNation pursue a strong military response and adopt significant reforms \nto enhance our Homeland Security. Like Al Qaeda, ISIS is now a \nsignificant danger. While we are doing more to push our Homeland \nSecurity and intelligence agencies to meet current and future threats, \nwe are unwise to allow this enemy time and multiple chances to inflict \nmass casualties.\n  As a legislative body, we have already passed legislation closing a \nborder security vulnerability in our Visa Waiver Program and have an \nopportunity in the bill that Senator Nelson and I have offered to guard \nagainst an insider threat at airports. As lawmakers, we are going in \nthe right direction. However, our responsibility to the people we \nrepresent does not end there. Until this administration or its \nsuccessor changes the facts on the ground, we also have an obligation \nto speak about the continued threat of ISIS, especially when the \nadministration downplays the need for a more aggressive response. We \nhave an obligation to continue discussing the genocide of Christians \nand other religious groups in areas under ISIS control, and we have an \nobligation to scrutinize Executive actions and conduct rigorous \noversight of administration initiatives that pose risks to our \nhomeland. If we can't do this, we have learned very little.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on winning the 2016 NCAA Men's \n                    College Basketball Championship\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the \nfloor to send congratulations on my own behalf and also on behalf of \nthe people of Pennsylvania to the Villanova Wildcats for a great win \nlast night in the NCAA final.\n  It was a remarkable game for a lot of reasons. My wife and I watched \nevery minute of it, as I know so many did. It was a remarkable game \neven before the last-second shot, but even more so after the shot made \nby Kris Jenkins.\n  We are grateful, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, to commend \nand salute Villanova University and, of course, the team itself.\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\n  In particular, I commend the players, not only Kris Jenkins but the \nentire team. At the same time, we commend the work done by Jay Wright. \nHe is a great coach. He was awarded the Naismith Award as Coach of the \nYear this year, but we also commend him for leading Villanova this year \nand for the way he conducted himself, even in the aftermath of a win.\n  We learn a lot about people in victory and defeat, whether that is in \nthe athletic contest or even in politics or life itself. I thought Jay \nWright showed a lot of class in the way he conducted himself after \nwinning, which is sometimes not the case in sports today.\n\n  I want to commend them as well for their great teamwork that \nobviously has to play out not just on the court in one game but over \nthe length of a season--the practice and the hard work and the working \ntogether and the way they built each other up. There are so many \ninstances where this team really was a team in reality, not just in \nterms of people talking about them as a team.\n  I am not sure they could have shot better. I am told--and I hope I \nhave this right--they had a 58-percent shooting field goal percentage \nthroughout the tournament. That is a remarkable achievement. Again, \nthat doesn't just happen; it happens because of hard work and because \nof a great coach.\n  I want to commend and salute the team and congratulate them on \nwinning a very difficult tournament. This is a tournament that had a \nlot of upsets and a lot of twists and turns before the team came out \nNo. 1. That is a great achievement.\n  Finally, I commend and salute the university and Father Peter \nDonahue, the president. We know him as Father Peter. I want to thank \nhim. He sent me a Villanova hat, which I wore during the semifinal game \nor part of the game. I made sure I wore it at least for a few minutes \nduring the final game. I was grateful he sent me that reminder of team \nspirit.\n  In addition to Father Peter in the larger Villanova community, we \nwant to salute the students, who were so loyal, and the fans, who may \nnot have been students but who were either graduates of Villanova or \njust supporters. And of course the alumni made it possible for the team \nto have the kind of support they have had over many years.\n\n\n       Opioid Epidemic and Children's Exposure to Lead Poisoning\n\n  Mr. President, in my recent travels across Pennsylvania, two issues \narose that I know the Presiding Officer and others may have heard about \nin the time they were away from Washington, and I know there are many \nothers, but I will just mention two that the people of our State are \nthinking a lot about and are worried about and expect us to take action \nconcerning.\n  No. 1 is the opioid epidemic across the country, which has caused the \nkind of death and devastation that none of us can even begin to \nimagine. In Pennsylvania alone, more than 2,700 people died in 2014 as \na result of some kind of drug overdose. So this is a major challenge.\n  We made tremendous progress when we passed our bipartisan bill here, \nthe so-called CARA bill. That was a good move and an important step for \nthe Senate. I hope we can follow up on that with the $600 million in \nfunding that local law enforcement and treatment experts and others \nhave asked us for. We need to finish the job in terms of making sure \nthe Senate is taking the right steps on this challenge.\n  The second issue--which I will mention just briefly because we don't \nhave time today to develop it further--is lead poisoning in children. \nWe know what happened in Flint, the horror and the tragedy of Flint, \nbut in a State such as mine, the biggest challenge we have is not \nnecessarily lead from water or in the water systems that would \nadversely affect children. In our case, because we have a lot of old \nhomes, it is lead paint and the exposure to lead paint and the high \nlead levels that put children in a precarious situation in the short \nrun but even long term because some of these impacts, if the levels are \nvery high, can be irreversible.\n  We have to make sure we are doing more to protect our children not \nonly in Pennsylvania but across the country in terms of making sure \nthat fewer and fewer children are exposed to high lead levels. I know \nwe will talk more about that.\n  Those are two major challenges that I know confront Pennsylvania and \nalso confront our country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy and Working Together in the Senate\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as you know, we have been back home in our \nStates for the last couple of weeks or traveling, listening to our \nconstituents. It was great to be back home and to spend some time \ntalking to the people who I work for about the challenges facing our \ncountry and what we have been doing in the U.S. Senate to try to \naddress those challenges. While it is always true that people wish \nthere would be more consensus building and more solutions offered, I \nwould say that, by and large, people feel we had a pretty productive \n2015 and are hoping we can continue that sort of productivity here in \nthe Senate in 2016, even though this is a Presidential election year.\n  Yesterday was a good example of that productivity. We passed a \ntrademark enforcement piece of legislation basically without--it was \nunanimous, to the best of my knowledge. All the Senators here in the \nChamber voted for it without going through the official procedural \nhoops that are required in order to process legislation here in the \nSenate.\n  Previously we passed legislation--recently the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act--to deal with the crisis involving opioid or \nprescription drug painkillers that are being abused around the country, \nand people are unfortunately falling into that trap, and then the cheap \nheroin that sometimes is used as a substitute if people can't find the \nopioid prescription drugs.\n  So Congress actually has been doing the people's business here. Of \ncourse, we are in the type of profession where people will sometimes \nsay: Well, we think you are doing a great job. And others will say: \nWell, we don't think you are doing quite so great a job. But that is \nthe nature of the beast. Either way, it is always good to be back home.\n  As I was talking to my constituents back home, I was glad to hear one \nthing. No matter what part of the State I was traveling in, there was \nappreciation for the decision we made to give the voters a voice on who \nmakes the next lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Texans want \nto have a say in who replaces Justice Scalia on our Nation's highest \nCourt, and I believe their voice should be heard.\n  We are already engaged in the Presidential primaries process. Today \nis the Wisconsin primary. It will not be that long before we have a new \nPresident who will make that appointment. I simply believe it is \nimportant--particularly in something that could extend for the next 25 \nor 30 years and really affect the balance of power on the Supreme \nCourt--that this be left to the voters.\n  We all know we did not end up in this position overnight. In fact, \nthere is a lot of history. I remember that back when I came to the \nSenate, I was frustrated by the fact that there was so much politics at \nplay in the judicial confirmation process. Having served as a State \ncourt judge for 13 years, I had some pretty strong views about that. \nBut the problem is, there has been a lot that has transpired in the \ninterim. Everything from the Biden rule to the Reid statement in 2005 \nwas really a threat saying that if President George W. Bush were to \nappoint a judge to the Supreme Court, it was within the authority of \nthe U.S. Senate not to hold a vote on that appointment. That was in \n2005. That was the Democratic leader. And then in 2007 when George W. \nBush was still President, 18 months before he left office, Senator \nSchumer, the next Democratic leader, said there should be a presumption \nagainst confirmation. This is something that is nearly unprecedented. \nThen we know that in the interim there has been this development of \nfilibusters or the requirement of 60 votes in order to get judges \nconfirmed brought to us by our\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\nDemocratic friends, as well as something we didn't think would ever \nhappen but, in fact, did happen under Democratic leadership: the so-\ncalled nuclear option--in other words, breaking the Senate rules in \norder to confirm judges mainly to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--what \nsome call the second most powerful court in the Nation--in order to \npack that court with judges who are more likely to affirm President \nObama's constitutional overreach.\n  So, as I said, much to my chagrin and I bet to a lot of people's \nchagrin, we have seen the playbook torn up by our Democratic colleagues \nand rewritten. The question is, Are we going to be operating under a \ndifferent set of rules than they would if the roles were reversed? \nFrankly, my constituents back home think the rules ought to be the same \nno matter who happens to be in the majority and who happens to be in \nthe White House.\n  Even more significantly, the Supreme Court is the final authority for \nmany of the most pressing issues that face our country. The Court often \nacts as a constitutional counterweight to the passions of both \nthe legislative and executive branches. We have seen the Supreme Court \noperate time and time again as a check on the Obama administration's \nlawless actions. We saw this in the recess-appointment case. We have \nseen it in a number of different cases where the Court has said to the \nObama administration: You have simply overextended your reach beyond \nlegitimate boundaries.\n\n  I am thankful for that important counterbalance in our government and \nthe give-and-take that the Founding Fathers intended for us to have \nwith three coequal branches of government. But, as I said, the next \nSupreme Court Justice could well change the ideological direction of \nthe Court for a generation.\n  Rightly or wrongly, the Supreme Court has the final word on issues as \nvaried as the scope of the President's power, the ability of the States \nto make their own decisions about self-government, and questions of \npersonal liberty and the like. The Court can and has made all the \ndifference in the world, and one Justice can affect that for a long \ntime.\n  We recall Justice Scalia as somebody who believed that the words of \nthe Constitution mattered greatly, and he served on the Court for 30 \nyears. Justice Scalia was what was sometimes called an originalist. In \nother words, he believed the Court had an obligation to apply the \nConstitution and the law as written, not based on some substituted \nvalue judgment for what perhaps the unelected, lifetime-tenured judges \nwould have preferred in terms of policy. That is not their role. They \ndon't stand for election. It is our role as the policymakers in the \npolitical branches who do stand for election--and thus give the \nAmerican people a chance to voice their pleasure or displeasure, as the \ncase may be, with the direction that we perhaps take the country when \nit comes to policy. But that is not a role the Supreme Court should \nplay.\n  We need to approach filling this seat with great care. The \nadministration and their liberal allies are now trying to basically \nthrow everything but the kitchen sink at stopping the American people \nfrom getting a voice in this matter. In other words, they are trying to \nforce Congress's hand or the Senate's hand to confirm the Presidential \nnominee at this time. They are spending millions of dollars on TV \nadvertising. They have hired consultants, and they found some \nsympathetic allies in the media to criticize us.\n  I don't begrudge anybody who has a different point of view than I do \nabout this, but I simply cannot in good conscience vote to confirm \nanother Obama nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in the waning days of \nthis President's term in office. I happen to believe we should not \nprocess this nomination. We should exercise the power we have under the \nConstitution to grant or withhold consent, and in this case to withhold \nconsent.\n  But here we are, several weeks after the President announced his \nnominee, and nothing has really changed. All the money and the \nconsultants in the world are not going to change the fact that the \nAmerican people are going to have their say. We don't know exactly how \nthat will turn out, but that is because this is based not on the \npersonality of the nominee but on the principle that the American \npeople should have their voice heard.\n  As I said, the President has the authority to nominate anybody he \nchooses, but that doesn't change our responsibility or our authority \nunder that same Constitution. We remain committed to the idea that this \nvacancy should be filled by the next President.\n  I want to be clear that the American people do deserve a voice here, \nand we will make sure they are heard. In the meantime, as I started out \nsaying, there are a lot of things we can do working together. Just \nbecause we disagree about this one item doesn't mean we have to \ndisagree about everything or that Congress needs to lapse into \ndysfunction.\n  We currently have a bill pending before us involving the Federal \nAviation Administration and the very important topic of safe and secure \nair travel. We can disagree about how to proceed with the President's \nnominee to the Supreme Court and still work together to pass other good \nconsensus legislation. So I hope all of us, our colleagues across the \naisle and on this side of the aisle, will continue to work together to \ndo things I think would help the country a lot, things such as criminal \njustice reform--a bill that has been voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, that enjoys broad bipartisan support, and that the President \nof the United States has said he supports.\n  There is also other important legislation that I am very concerned \nabout and interested in involving the intersection of mental illness \nwith our criminal justice system and the fact that our jails have \nbecome the de facto warehouses for people with mental illness who are \ngoing untreated and obviously the homeless who are living on our \nstreets, many of whom are suffering from mental illness.\n  I hope we can continue to work together on these other consensus \nmatters even though we disagree about this one very important matter. I \nam confident that we can and we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, during the recess last week, I had the \nopportunity to meet with Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, President Obama's nominee \nto fill the existing vacancy of an Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. During our meeting, we discussed the role of the Supreme \nCourt and protecting the civil rights of Americans. We discussed a \nnumber of national security challenges, including those relating to the \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We discussed the Citizens United \ncase and campaign finance law. We talked about the respect for each \nbranch of government and our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances. We spoke about the important role of precedent in our \njudicial decisions and the need to build consensus on decisions. We \ndiscussed the value of promoting pro bono work in the legal profession \nand the need to address the growing access-to-justice gap. I was \npleased to hear that as an attorney at the Justice Department, Chief \nJustice Garland worked to clarify ethics rules to allow government \nlawyers to engage in additional pro bono work.\n  What I was doing is what I hope every Member in the Senate will do, \nand that is finding out more about Judge Garland, his judicial \nphilosophy, the way he has conducted his life, his respect for the \nConstitution and the precedents of the judicial branch of government, \nlooking at current issues and seeing how Judge Garland views those \ncurrent issues. That is all part of a confirmation process.\n  The President, under the Constitution, has done his job; that is, he \nhas made the nomination of who he believes should fill Justice Scalia's \nvacancy. It is now up to the Senate to do\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\nour job, and our job starts with Members of the Senate meeting with \nJudge Garland to be able to see one-on-one, without cameras glaring, \nhow Judge Garland responds to our individual issues. We obviously have \nhis record, his background, his public service, what he has done as a \nlawyer, what he has done as a prosecutor, and what he has done as a \njudge on the circuit court. We also should have a confirmation hearing \nin the Judiciary Committee, which will give us more information.\n  Under the Constitution, the responsibility of the President is to \nmake the nomination. It is now up to the Senate to do our job, and our \njob is to consider that nominee, for each Senator to learn as much as \nthey possibly can--this is a critically important position, obviously, \nthe Supreme Court of the United States--and for the institution to hold \nhearings and to vote. Each Senator will have to make his or her own \njudgment on whether we should vote for or against confirmation, but we \nhave a responsibility to consider that nomination and a responsibility \nto vote.\n  I must say that I was very impressed by the nominee during the course \nof our meeting. He has impeccable qualifications as a prosecutor, \njudge, and now chief judge of what many call the second highest court \nin the land. The Senate confirmed Judge Garland on a bipartisan basis \nfor his current judgeship, which he has held for nearly two decades. \nChief Judge Garland strikes me as a thoughtful and deliberate person \nwho has dedicated his life to public service. And I am proud to say \nthat the nominee is a Marylander and lives in Bethesda in Montgomery \nCounty, MD.\n  Chief Judge Garland is the nominee for the Supreme Court and should \nbe dealt with in this term of Congress. It is not a matter for the next \nPresident and the next Congress; it is a matter for this President and \nthis Congress. There are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest \nthat we don't have the time and the President doesn't have the \nauthority to appoint a nominee is outrageous, and it is an affront to \nthe Constitution.\n  This nomination is not about popularity or politics; it is about \nfinding the next Justice who will advance the rule of law in this \ncountry, who will recognize the responsibility of the Supreme Court to \nbe the final arbiter on constitutional issues, and having a person who \ncan bring about greater consensus among his colleagues. As more of my \ncolleagues meet Judge Garland, they will see that this is one of his \nmany strengths. We need to go through the process and give Chief Judge \nGarland a chance.\n  I think it is hard to understand how you are excused from doing your \njob for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing or vote. I don't \nthink the American people understand that. Quite frankly, I don't \nunderstand that. I don't understand why we are not going through the \nregular order. Regular order would be for us individually to meet with \nJudge Garland and for the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing and to \nschedule a timely vote on the floor of the Senate. I think more and \nmore Senators will come to that conclusion. The President did his job, \nand it is now time for the Senate to do its job.\n\n  The American people want to see nine Justices on the Supreme Court \nwhen it convenes its new term in October. We have a new term beginning \nin October of this year. We expect to see nine Justices on the Court to \nmake decisions. You don't resolve issues on a 4-to-4 vote. We hopefully \nwill have greater consensus. We shouldn't have a divided Court. We \nshould be able to get more collegiality on the Supreme Court, but we \nalso should be able to make a decision. The Supreme Court needs to be \nable to make a decision. With eight Justices, in too many cases they \nare not going to be able to make a decision.\n  Article II, section 2, of the Constitution states that the President \n``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, \nshall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.'' The President has no \nalternative under the Constitution but to make a nomination when there \nis a vacancy. There is a vacancy on the Supreme Court due to Justice \nScalia's untimely death. The President did his job. The Constitution \nsays very clearly that we--the Senate--have to advise and consent. That \nis our requirement. That is not optional; we have that as a \nrequirement. Never have we denied an opportunity to consider a Supreme \nCourt nominee. It is now up to us to consider that nominee, and we \nshould consider that nominee by doing our job--interviewing Judge \nGarland, scheduling a committee hearing, and voting on that nominee.\n  The American people twice elected President Obama to a 4-year term in \noffice. Their voice has been heard very clearly. Elections have \nconsequences, and President Obama has carried out the constitutional \nresponsibilities and duties of his office by nominating Judge Garland \nas the successor to Justice Scalia. The President is simply doing the \njob the American people elected him to do. The President doesn't stop \nworking simply because it is an election year. He has more than 9 \nmonths left in office, as do Senators who will face the voters in \nNovember. Congress should not stop working, either, in this election \nyear.\n  Of course, every Senator has the right to make his or her own \njudgment on whether they will vote for or against confirmation. \nSenators were elected for 6-year terms by the citizens of their States \nand have the right and obligation to vote as they see fit. President \nObama was elected by the people of the United States for two \n4-year terms and has the right and obligation to nominate judges.\n  History has shown that when the roles were reversed and Democrats \nheld the majority in the Senate, Supreme Court and judicial nominees \nfor Republican Presidents were given hearings and up-or-down votes \nregardless of when the vacancies occurred. While I might have picked \ndifferent judges, as a Senator, I voted to confirm the vast majority of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations in his final year in office. I \nwill continue to carry out my constitutional responsibilities that I \nundertook when I became a Senator and swore to support the \nConstitution.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that a democratically controlled Senate \nconfirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court during the last year of \nPresident Ronald Reagan's final term in 1988. Senators also confirmed \nJustice Murphy in 1940, Justice Cardozo in 1932, and Justice Brandeis \nin 1916. The precedent of the Senate indicates that we need to take up \nthis nominee.\n  What the Republicans are effectively trying to do is temporarily \nshrink the Supreme Court from nine to eight Justices and shorten the \nterm of the President from 4 years to 3 years. Why? Because the \nPresident is of a different party than the Senate. This is disgraceful \nand indefensible.\n  Let me quote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by \nPresident Ronald Reagan in 1981 as the first female Justice of the \nSupreme Court. When asked about the vacancy on the Court created by the \ndeath of Justice Scalia, Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody \nthere now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I agree with \nJustice O'Connor. Let's do our job and fulfill the Senate's \nconstitutional responsibilities and vote up or down on Judge Garland's \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for my 132nd ``Time to Wake \nUp'' speech. We are now back from recess, and while we were away, one \nlittle thing and three really big things happened. The little thing has \nto do with the so-called war on coal which we have heard so much \nnonsense about in this Chamber. There was this article, which I am \nshowing on this chart, saying: ``Natural gas has been waging a war on \ncoal for more than a decade, and this is the year it plants the flag.''\n  Natural gas has been waging a war on coal. Not Obama. Not liberals. \nNatural gas.\n  The article predicts a resulting ``wave'' of coal plant retirements. \nWho wrote this? Some green, lefty publication? Actually, it was the \nWall Street Journal news department.\n  So as coal companies go bankrupt left and right, there is the coal \nstory. Natural gas has been waging war on coal for more than a decade. \nSpinning this against the President has been easy politics, but false, \nand that false political strategy has left coal country with what? \nNothing. A carbon fee could produce revenues that could power wealth \ninto coal country, but, no, what they got instead was someone to \nblame--someone to blame wrongly. Great job.\n  Now to the three big things that happened during our recess. First, a \ngroup of very distinguished scientists, led by legendary climate \nscientist Dr. James Hansen, warned us that this climate change thing is \nlikely to be a lot worse than we thought. Their sweeping synthesis, \nwhich underwent an involved and public peer-review process, suggests \nthe possibility of greater sea level rise in this century than \nforecast. It suggests, worse, even epic storms, and it posits ``losing \nfunctionality of all coastal cities.'' How about that for a phrase? \nThey go on to conclude, obviously, that ``the economic and social cost \nof losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically \nincalculable.''\n  That was one.\n  Second is the Great Barrier Reef, a wonder of the world, hit by the \nworst coral bleaching ever measured. For those of my colleagues who \ndon't know, uplanders who may not understand what coral bleaching is, \nit is like cardiac arrest for coral. You are not necessarily dead yet, \nbut there is a very good chance you will be, and for sure you are in \nserious trouble and you will need time to recover. That is what is \nhappening in the Great Barrier Reef.\n  The third thing is a new study out of UMass and Penn State which \nfound that the expected loss of Antarctic ice ``nearly doubles'' prior \nestimates of sea level rise.\n  I am from an ocean State. I am from Rhode Island, the Ocean State. \nThis is consequential. How consequential? Here is what one of the \nauthors of the study said: ``You're remapping the way the planet looks \nfrom space with those numbers, not just subtle changes about which \nneighborhoods are going to be susceptible to storm surge,'' but \nremapping the way the planet looks from space. Of course, \nCO2 levels continue to exceed 400 parts per million against \na human history where they were always between 170 and 300 until the \nindustrial era drove it up.\n  So that is not great news, but here is what is sickening about it. We \ndon't seem to care here. It has all been in the news. Senators read the \nnews. It is not like we are being deprived of information. We just as \nan institution do not care. That is a defect. That makes us a defective \ninstitution, not to be able to receive and process information like \nthis. This is institutional failure, and we don't even care about that \nbecause one might say: You know, I don't really care myself about all \nof this damage, but as a Member of this body, I get that the U.S. \nSenate ought to care institutionally. It is like secondary caring. I \nwill do my duty. Even if I personally don't care about oceans or reefs \nor coasts or storms, I am in. I am in, even though it is not my thing, \nbecause I know it is important. But we don't even do that. So we really \ndon't care.\n  Why? Why would we be so blind? We are not all terrible people. Some \nof us actually spend time outdoors and profess to care about nature. So \nwhy does the Senate, as a body collectively, not give a hoot? It is a \ndeadly combination of politics and money. That is what investigation \nand history will show, and the investigations are underway. The history \nwill not be pretty.\n  We are surrounded by money. Senators exist in a world of money the \nway fish exist in a world of water. We are so accustomed to it, we \nbarely even notice it. Hundreds of millions of dollars every year in \nlobbying money surround us. Hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign \nmoney every election have to be raised. Hundreds of millions in PAC \nmoney pours in and exerts its influence, and we don't even know how \nmuch dark money there is flowing around through loopholes the size of \nthe Holland Tunnel. Just one--one--dark money group is spending $750 \nmillion in the 2016 elections. It is a disgrace, but it has an effect.\n  The interests that spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying us \nwant things. The interests who give hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncampaign money want things. The PACs and the super PACs pointing $750 \nmillion in political artillery at us, they want things. Some want \nideological things, but most want money. More exactly, they want things \nwe can do that can be turned into money: licenses, tax breaks, trade \nadvantages, regulations, relief from regulations. You name it, they \nwant it because they can turn it into money.\n  All of that has a desensitizing effect on our values here. If \nsomething can't be monetized, we get trained not to care about it. \nValues that aren't monetized in the marketplace start to seem weird. \nWho cares about a reef? What is that weird Senator doing talking about \na reef? What a silly thing to talk about in our serious world.\n  Now, someone's favorable fat cat tax rate, that is important. Jerking \naround a perfectly qualified Supreme Court nominee, that is definitely \nimportant, but the greatest crisis facing the natural world as we know \nit, no. And we go along. We go along with that warped value system. It \nis a lie. It is a moral lie so big it envelopes us, and we acclimate to \nit. All that money around us slowly anesthetizes our moral and natural \nsenses, and that is how this place becomes Mammon Hall.\n  It is actually even worse than that. It is not just that if you can't \ncash it in, it doesn't matter around here. It is that big, greedy \nspecial interests come here to plunder, and we let them. We let them, \nand we even help them because we become dependent on their money.\n  Well, I have a proposition. Years ago, one of the Koch brothers, \nAmerica's biggest polluters, ran for Vice President as a Libertarian \nParty candidate. When he ran, he learned something. He learned the \nperverse math of third parties in a two-party system. The perverse math \nof third parties in a two-party system is that you only hurt the ones \nyou love. You hurt the party you are closest to by your third party \ntaking votes away from the party closest to your politics. Well, the \nKochs may be a lot of things, but they aren't stupid, and I think they \nlearned. They learned that a creepy far-right third party that could be \nput in tow to big polluters was not the right method to achieve their \npurposes.\n  There was a smarter method. Invade the Republican Party, that Grand \nOld Party of Theodore Roosevelt, capture it, turn it into the far-right \nparty of their dreams. That was the smart play. Money and secrecy could \nmake it happen, and they are pretty close to having done it. The \nRepublican Party in Congress is as dependent on fossil fuel and \npolluter money now as a deep sea diver is on his air hose. Cut the \nairhose or pinch the flow, and we have a diver in real distress. When \nyou control a deep sea diver's airhose, he becomes a pretty obedient \ndiver. It is a form of the Golden Rule: He who wields the gold makes \nthe rules.\n  The political press, by the way, does little to help. It is a game to \nthem. Who will say something appalling we can chatter about on the talk \nshows? Who is up? Who is down? Who said what about whom? It is akin to \na soccer team of 7-year-olds. Most everybody runs to the ball or \nwhatever the shiny object of the moment is, and in the midst of them \nare outfits that masquerade as the political press, but they are really \npolluter PR fronts in disguise. They, too, are in tow to the fossil \nfuel industry. Money and secrecy have their way.\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\n  So here we are in the Senate, in the face of this news that came to \nus over the recess, ineffective, defective, idly paying no attention to \nwhat is really important as we chase political trifles around, making a \nmockery of our great American democratic experiment.\n  Well, folks, people are going to notice. This climate mess we have \ncreated is only going in one direction. When everybody has noticed, \nwhen it is way past denying, elected officials who refused to even look \nat the problem are going to look pretty foolish, and they are going to \nhave to explain.\n  Well, you see, I thought there was this big hoax.\n  Really.\n  Yes, I thought NASA's scientists and NOAA's scientists were all in on \nit, along with the U.S. Navy and every National Lab we fund.\n  Hum. That is a big hoax.\n  Oh, did I forget to mention my home State university must have been \nin on the hoax too? They were all studying climate change effects \nactually happening in my home State, but I knew better.\n  Great.\n  And every major legitimate American scientific society and most of my \nhome State corporate leaders--I figured they were all wrong.\n  Oh, OK, and where did you get that idea?\n  Oh, from a bunch of guys with financial ties to the polluters.\n  Come on--seriously? Didn't you think that was a pretty obvious \nconflict of interest?\n  Wow, is that something I should have thought of? But listen. Now I \nwant you to reelect me because I am such a good, prudent, and \nresponsible decisionmaker.\n  Folks, good luck with that. If you think the Republican Party is in \ntrouble now, wait until the day of reckoning comes on climate change. \nExplain the money. Explain the money. You don't think people are going \nto figure out how it works? Explain the talk show science you believe \ninstead of the peer-reviewed stuff. Explain the quality of your due \ndiligence into the science. Good luck with that.\n  Explain why you thought NASA, which is driving a rover around on the \nsurface of Mars that they flew there and safely landed--that is \nprobably the greatest scientific and mechanical achievement of our \ntime. They did that, but you say they were part of a hoax on climate \nchange. Really?\n  By the way, I think people here actually owe NASA an apology for \nsaying such nonsense about them, but that is for another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago was the sixth \nanniversary of President Obama's unpopular health care law. Every year \nat this time, that birthday is not one people actually want to \ncelebrate. When we take a look at the reasons Americans aren't \ncelebrating ObamaCare's sixth birthday, it is pretty obvious. Let's \nread them: unsecured data through the Web site, fewer provider choices, \nover $1 trillion in new taxes on American families, 2 million jobs' \nworth of hours lost, and skyrocketing premiums and deductibles. It is \nno surprise that the health care law continues to be very unpopular.\n  Americans know that under the health care law they have less freedom \nto keep their doctor, to keep the insurance that was right for them and \ntheir families, because the President says he gets to decide what \nsomebody needs for themselves and their families--not the families \ngetting to decide for themselves.\n  We know that--again, it came out during the break--people's personal \ndata is not secure at healthcare.gov, as they thought it was. We know \ninsurance companies are continuing to give patients fewer choices by \nlimiting the networks of doctors that people can see. The health care \nlaw has added over $1 trillion in new taxes onto hardworking American \nfamilies. Premiums and deductibles are up, and according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, ObamaCare is cutting the hours Americans \ncan work by about 2 million jobs over the next decade. So it seems that \nevery day there is more news coming out on how the health care law is \nunaffordable, unpopular, and unworkable.\n  Last week there was a new study that explains one of the reasons why \nthe President's health care law is collapsing. There was a study that \ncame out from Blue Cross Blue Shield. It compared people buying new \nhealth insurance coverage in the ObamaCare exchanges to people who \nalready had health insurance through their jobs. The study found that \nthe new ObamaCare customers went to the doctor 26 percent more often \nthan other people did, that they were admitted to the hospital almost \ntwice as often, that ObamaCare customers have higher costs, and that \nthe average medical spending is about $1,200 a year higher for people \non ObamaCare than people who get their insurance through work. So why \nis it that hospital admissions are up so much for people who are on \nObamaCare, and why is it that doctors' visits are up 26 percent? \nBecause the new ObamaCare enrollees are sicker and costlier. So \ninsurance companies of course have to raise their premiums. People are \nsicker who are signing up. They go to the doctor more. The insurance \ncompany turns around, and it raises premiums on everyone else. That is \nwhy so many people are opposed to the health care law--because the \nimpact it has had on them personally.\n  When insurance companies have to raise their rates on ObamaCare \nplans, a lot of money is paid by taxpayers because it is the taxpayers \nwho are paying for the subsidies for all the folks who have signed up \nfor ObamaCare. What we know is that taxpayers are subsidizing the \npremiums of 83 percent of the people who buy ObamaCare insurance. When \nthe premiums go up, taxes have to be made up to pay for it.\n  Well, when companies can't get enough extra money, they just stop \noffering policies. Under ObamaCare that may happen. Then more people \nwill lose their insurance coverage. Maybe some companies will just go \nout of business. We are familiar with that process because we have seen \nit. We have seen that under the ObamaCare health care law, a majority \nof the ObamaCare health insurance co-ops have actually gone bankrupt. \nThe health care law created 23 co-ops, and 12 have already gone out of \nbusiness.\n  Premiums were already out of control, and it is getting worse. The \naverage premium for what is called the benchmark silver plan in the \nObamaCare exchange is more than 7 percent higher this year than last \nyear. For people who can only afford the cheaper bronze plan, premiums \nare up 13 percent compared to last year. Over the next couple of \nmonths, insurance companies are going to start setting their rates for \n2017. They are going to take into account what has happened in the \nprevious year. So this new study by Blue Cross Blue Shield is just \nlaying the groundwork for even more price increases to come next year. \nI think this is one of the things that explains why so many people \ndislike ObamaCare.\n  A new poll came out that found that 47 percent of Americans have an \nunfavorable view of the health care law. The Kaiser Family Foundation \nreport shows Americans' opinion of ObamaCare is tilting negative--47 \npercent marked it unpopular in March of 2016. A year ago this poll said \nthat 42 percent of the people had an unfavorable view. There we were a \nyear ago. Here we are now. The number keeps climbing. Now only 41 \npercent of the people have a favorable view of the health care law. It \nwasn't supposed to be this way.\n  Mr. President, 6 years ago Democrats in Washington were very \nconfident that the law would be extremely popular today. As a matter of \nfact, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York went on ``Meet the Press'' back \nin 2010 and said: ``It is going to become more popular.'' He said: ``I \npredict that by November those who voted for the health care law will \nfind it an asset.''\n  Well, we all remember what happened in the 2010 elections. We know \nthat Democrats who voted for the health care law did not find it an \nasset. Democrats lost six seats in the Senate that year, and they lost \ncontrol of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi was out as \nSpeaker of the House, and the Republicans took the majority.\n  Then in 2013, Senator Harry Reid was making this same prediction \nabout how popular the health care law was going to be. He told the \nnewspaper The\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nHill in Washington that ObamaCare would be ``a net positive'' for \nDemocrats in 2014. Senator Reid forced the health care law through \nCongress when he was the majority leader, and I think that is a big \npart of why he is now the minority leader. He lost the majority in the \nSenate. Why? I think in big part because of the health care law and the \nfact that it ignored the needs of the American people.\n  The longer people have to live with this offensive and expensive law, \nthe less popular it gets.\n  It was never popular to begin with, but today, even more than before, \nthe opinion is, as this poster says, ``tilting negative.''\n  The same poll also found something I found amazing. I have practiced \nmedicine for 25 years, and I have been involved here in the Senate for \na number of years. I have never seen anything like this. This new poll \nfound that 28 percent of Americans say that this health care law has \ndirectly hurt them and their families.\n  The President says: Defend and be proud of this law.\n  How can you defend and be proud of something that 28 percent of the \nAmerican public tells you has hurt them and their family personally? \nOnly 18 percent in the poll said the law had directly helped them. It \nis incredible and it is disturbing. ObamaCare is hurting far more \npeople than it is helping.\n  Costs are going up much faster than Democrats promised, as are copays \nand deductibles. It is no wonder the law is unpopular. We know the \nhealth care law makes it more expensive for taxpayers--but how much \nmore expensive?\n  The Congressional Budget Office came out with a report last week. It \nsaid that over the next 10 years the health care law is going to cost \n$136 billion more than they thought it would cost just a year ago. When \nthey compared what they thought it was going to cost a year ago and \nwhat they think it is going to cost now, it is $136 billion more. That \nis despite there being fewer people in the insurance exchanges than \nthey expected. They predicted there would be 21 million people buying \nObamaCare health insurance this year. In fact, they say it is going to \nbe no more than 12 million.\n  People are doing everything they can to avoid these insurance \npolicies--especially young, healthy people. So why is it going to cost \nan extra $136 billion? One of the reasons is higher premiums, sicker \npatients, and because the law has dumped so many more people into \nMedicaid. About 23 percent of the people in the country under the age \nof 65 are now on Medicaid. That is what the Congressional Budget Office \nsays--one out of every four.\n  Is that a success--putting all these additional people on Medicaid? \nThe President says it is.\n  As a doctor who has practiced medicine and taken care of patients for \nover 25 years, putting additional people on Medicaid is not a success. \nIt is not what people wanted, and it is not what President Obama \npromised. Americans deserve better. They deserve better than to be \nshoved into this second-tier health care system. Plus, in terms of \ngovernment health care programs and wasting money, a recent study found \nthat for every dollar spent on Medicaid, people only get about 20 to 40 \ncents on every dollar spent. How is that for an inefficient government \nsystem? Almost every day we get more information on the damage the \nhealth care law is doing to Americans across the country.\n  Republicans have offered solutions that would actually keep the \npromises the Democrats made for ObamaCare, such as letting people keep \ntheir doctors and keep their insurance, giving more people options for \nhow they can reduce their costs of medical care. Americans have now \nbeen forced to try this ObamaCare experiment--what the Democrats \nwanted--and forced to do it for the last 6 years. ObamaCare isn't \ngetting any better. It is just getting older, and it is still making \nthings worse for American families. That is why it is so unpopular.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today marks my 38th edition of ``Waste of \nthe Week.'' With our Nation $19 trillion in debt, I am going to \ncontinue coming to the Senate floor every week the Senate is in session \nto highlight verified and documented examples of waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  I turn to reports from nonpartisan organizations such as the \nGovernment Accountability Office which indicate that, thankfully, \nsomebody is looking into how we run this government, coming up with \nexamples of how we can run it better. They let the American people know \nthat we are not wisely and carefully spending their taxpayer dollars, \nand, hopefully, we can take remedial action.\n  Last year, I detailed an investigation by the nonpartisan Government \nAccountability Office, the GAO, which discovered that fraudulent \napplications are being accepted by healthcare.gov. That is the \ngovernment's health care Web site for choosing ObamaCare plans on the \nFederal exchange.\n  Just last month, I discussed a new report from the GAO that outlined \nhow healthcare.gov allowed people to sign up for and receive ObamaCare \nbenefits without proper verification. They did a test. They made up \nsome names, they filled out the application, they sent it in to \nhealthcare.gov, and 11 out of the 12 test applications came back \napproved, with no verification whatsoever. Subsidies started going out \nto these people. Even after they were notified at the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, it took months to correct. Some people \ncollected these subsidies; these fraudulent subsidies went somewhere. \nThese were just made-up names. When we look at 11 out of 12, we have to \nsay something is wrong with the system. And if we extrapolated that \nout, there could be a stunning number of fraudulent applications \ncertified and subsidies sent to people that don't exist.\n  Today I want to discuss even more ObamaCare problems. This one totals \nup to $1.16 billion worth of problems.\n  We all know that the Affordable Care Act--which I call the \nUnaffordable Care Act, based on its operations so far--directed States \nto either develop their own State-based exchange to operate ObamaCare \nor to use the Federal exchange accessible at healthcare.gov. States had \na choice about the action to take. But in order to try to get States to \nset up their own exchanges, the Obama Administration awarded billions \nof dollars in Federal grants to States if they agreed to plan and \ndevelop a State exchange.\n  In 6 of the 14 States that chose to develop their own exchanges and \nreceive these Federal grants--Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, \nNew Mexico, and Nevada--the end results were disastrous. In fact, the \nGAO found that these State exchanges were given the green light without \nthe systems ever being fully tested. For example, Maryland's exchange \nWeb site had more than 600 unresolved defects, and Massachusetts had \nover 1100 unresolved defects.\n  And yet the exchanges were given the go-ahead by the Obama \nAdministration even though these unresolved defects were not realized \nand not addressed.\n  In Oregon, a State exchange was set up by political operatives. \nMonths after the enrollment period began, the online Oregon exchange \ncouldn't enroll a single person, and applicants had to fax in their \nhandwritten materials. Talk about a dysfunctional rollout. On this \nSenate floor we have talked about how, in the rush to prove that \nObamaCare was what this country needed and that the government could \nefficiently and effectively run a health care system and in a rush to \nprove and get the thing up and going according to what the promises \nwere, all kinds of mistakes were made.\n  Oregon's abysmal failure cost taxpayers $305 million plus an \nadditional $41 million that had to be spent to bring Oregon onto the \nFederal exchange. In other words, they failed to set up their State \nexchange and cost taxpayers $305 million. Then they had to spend \nanother $41 million to transfer the system over to the Federal \nexchange. All totaled, the Federal government gave these six States \n$1.16 billion, and today none of these six States\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\nare independently operating their own individual exchanges.\n  This was a long time in the making. The nonpartisan GAO and the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services raised concerns about these \nState exchanges more than a year before they were scheduled to launch. \nIn other words, the warning went out, saying: You are not getting your \nact together. This was a year before the process started. We went \nthrough that whole year and they still didn't have their act together, \nand it ended up costing taxpayers $1.16 billion.\n  It is no secret that the Obama Administration was in a rush to get \nthis system up and going, and in the process, who knows how much money \nhas been wasted? Who knows the trauma that people have gone through \ntrying to sign up for these exchanges?\n  I think we all remember the classic debacle that occurred in the \nwhole software system and in the whole exchange system. People were \ncalling in, they couldn't get anybody to answer the phone, and they \ncouldn't get their applications fulfilled. All those promises, you \nknow: Your premiums will not go up a penny. Count on that, the \nPresident said, period. Done deal. Take it to the bank. If you want \nyour doctor, you can keep your doctor. Take it to the bank. I guarantee \nyou that is what is going to happen. Costs will not go up.\n  We have all seen deductibles shoot up. We have all seen premiums \nincrease. People weren't able to keep the doctor they wanted. On and on \nit goes, and on and on it continues, and it is at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayer. Well, maybe it is not surprising. I am here every \nweek, and I probably could come up here every day and maybe every hour \nand detail some waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.\n  So today we are going to add more money to our growing list of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, taking us to $158,777,908,417. It just keeps adding \nup, and our colleagues have not taken the necessary action to try to \ntie the deal to these problems.\n  Maybe government has become so overwhelmingly bureaucratic and \ndysfunctional that we are not able to run this country anymore in an \nefficient and effective manner. The problem is that we are asking \npeople to go to work every day to put in a hard-earned number of hours \nearning pay and sending money to Washington, DC, only to find that it \nis wasted over and over and over. It is a relentless plunge into ever \nmore debt because we don't have the money to pay for what we spend. \nThen we have to issue bonds in order to collect money, in order to pay \nfor that. All of this falls to the taxpayer, and most of it is going to \nfall to future generations. They are going to have a limit on their \nability to have the opportunity to make a viable living for themselves \nand for their children, and we wonder why the American people have lost \nfaith in Washington's ability to carefully spend their hard-earned \ndollars.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to J. Thomas McGrady\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my wife Diana and I wish we could have been \nwith Tom McGrady to mark the retirement of a good friend and a great \nlegal warrior, Pinellas-Pasco Chief Judge J. Thomas McGrady. I am proud \nof Tom and his commitment to the law. Over the years he has compiled a \ntremendous record of success. Simply put, he has made a difference.\n  It is probably unusual for a Senator from Wyoming to speak so highly \nof a retiring judge from Florida. Over the years, I have had a chance \nto come to know Tom. I feel honored to call him my friend, and, as \noften has been said, his departure from the bench will leave some large \nshoes to fill.\n  Looking back, the script for Tom's life would have made a great \nmovie. For starters, he was born on Christmas Eve. He turned out to be \nhis parents' favorite Christmas gift. As he grew up and began to \nexplore the world around him and develop his talents and abilities, his \neducational pursuits led him to another highlight of his life--high \nschool--where he met and went on to marry his high school sweetheart, \nMary Choquette.\n  His interest in the law must have started around then because after \ngraduating from the University of Florida with his bachelor's degree, \nhe then got his juris doctorate degree there, and then joined a law \nfirm and started practicing civil litigation. Before long he opened his \nown law firm.\n  He practiced law for 25 years. He was so good that Governor Bush \nappointed him county judge. He was then appointed a circuit judge, \nagain by Governor Bush. Whenever Tom ran for reelection, he won--\nwithout opposition. People admired him and greatly appreciated his \nefforts on the bench so much that no one ran against him.\n  Perhaps the best indication of his ability as a judge and the \naffection of those with whom he served was his unanimous election by 68 \nof his judge colleagues to chief judge 3 times.\n  During Tom's service as chief judge, he discovered that with his \nelection came a number of problems--Tom probably called them \nchallenges--that came packaged together with his new duties. He had to \ndeal with cuts to the court budget. He had to deal with a mortgage \nforeclosure crisis. He had to deal with a number of other issues. He \nwas also working with a system that relied on old and outdated \ntechnologies, to name just a few of the matters that required his \nattention as chief judge.\n  Probably the biggest problem was the shortage of funds to run the \ncourts. Things were so bad that it looked as if drastic measures would \nhave to be taken to keep the courts up and running. He came up with an \noption to obtain a loan from the Governor and the legislature. Without \nit, there would have been severe cuts, furloughs, and much more. He \nreceived a great reception when he shared the details of the problem \nwith those who would be most affected--the judges and their staff. They \nappreciated his blunt assessment of how bad things were, as Tom put it, \n``not because of what I had to say, but because I would even come and \ntell them.''\n  Tom is a straight shooter, and he knew that the best antidote for the \nimpact of bad news was not to sugar coat it but to tell ``the truth, \nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' It also helped that Tom \nhad established a reputation over the years for being a gentle man and \na gentleman, and his honesty, sincerity, good humor, and concern for \nhis colleagues and staffers earned him a lot of good will.\n  Now that Tom has decided to retire and sit back, he will have more \ntime to share with his family and friends. I know they will enjoy being \nwith him and having more time to share with him, especially his \ngrandchildren, who will love having ``Papa'' around a little more \noften.\n  In the end, that is what it is all about--time. Time for faith, \nfamily, and friends. Time is the most valuable and precious asset we \nhave, and how we choose to spend it and the quality of those activities \nthat consume most of our time say a lot about the quality of our lives.\n  I once heard about a guy who traveled around the world doing research \non what people were thinking as they grew older. There were a lot of \ninteresting thoughts they shared, but one of the most frequent comments \nwas about spending more time with family. No one said: I wish I had \nspent more time at work.\n  So, as the old film title says so well, Tom has already had a \nwonderful life, with so much more to come. He has made the most of \nevery moment and every day. Mary, his sweetheart from his high school \ndays, is still by his side, retired from her days as a schoolteacher. \nNow they will spend time enjoying all that life has to offer. Tom and \nMary both truly earned it.\n  Congratulations, Tom McGrady. You have been a great judge, and you \nmade a difference in more lives than you will ever know. We can all \nlearn a lot from you and the way you have lived your life. God bless \nyou and Mary.\n\n\n                    Remembering Joseph Medicine Crow\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to share the news with the Senate that Joseph \nMedicine Crow, a Crow war chief and American hero, has passed away. If \nyou look in today's Washington Post you will\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nsee something unusual--somebody from the West passing away and getting \na major mention in the paper. Joe Medicine Crow did that, and he earned \nit in his 102 years. I know it meant a lot to the students of Western \nand American history to see the attention he has received, as numerous \npublications have written about him and his life and his countless \ncontributions to the Crow people and to our Nation.\n  If you have a chance to read the tributes to Joe Medicine Crow--and I \nhope you do--you will fully understand what an amazing individual he \nwas. A historian for his people and an important part of American life, \nhe accomplished more in his life than I could ever describe in these \nremarks.\n  As I read the articles that were so well researched, they reminded me \nof meeting and getting to know him when he was on the board of All \nAmerican Indian Days. That was a gathering that would draw tribal \nmembers from all over the United States to Sheridan, WY. They would \ncome to share their history, their culture, their traditions, their \nsports, their dances, and their arts and crafts. I know that gathering \nmeant a lot to him because one of his top priorities in his life was to \nensure that the legacy of the Crow and all tribes would never be \nforgotten and that their way of life would be passed down from \ngeneration to generation.\n  In an effort to bring us all together as one and overcome the racial \ndivides that separate us, a man named F.H. Sinclair--a columnist for \nthe Sheridan Press who was known by his nickname of ``Neckyoke \nJones''--came up with the idea of gathering all the tribes together in \nSheridan, WY, to demonstrate these talents and abilities. I grew up \nthere, and I was fascinated by the event. As you can imagine, it took a \nsubstantial amount of money to organize and plan the event each year, \nbut it paid big dividends for those who were able to attend and all \nthose who heard about it. It was a source of great pride for us all to \nhave this time when we would come together and celebrate the culture of \nthe tribes and the individuals who were so near to us. It provided the \nkind of exposure and interaction that is so necessary to bring people \ntogether and overcome prejudice and bias. I could see the difference \nthe gathering made and the impact it had on those who attended.\n  Events like that and the opportunity they provide help us to get to \nknow people who come from different cultures and backgrounds and help \nus to understand and appreciate each other. They remove the boundaries \nthat are created by fear and a lack of understanding. They foster and \nincrease the feeling of community that makes our cities and towns \nbetter places to live.\n  I remember how Joe served on that board and helped with the Miss \nIndian American Pageant that was part of All American Indian Days. It \nwas a competition of young women who were chosen by their tribes based \non their knowledge of their tribal culture, their history, and their \ntraditional dress. My mother, Dorothy Enzi, worked with Joe Medicine \nCrow and Suzie Yellowtail on the particulars that needed to be worked \nout to put on the pageant. My mother would then chaperone the winner to \nevents during the year.\n  Joe Medicine Crow had a great affection for Wyoming and a love of our \nland that was never surpassed. In addition to the Crow, Joe Medicine \nCrow was well known to the Wyoming Arapahos and Shoshones. In so many \nways, Joe Medicine Crow was an ambassador for his tribe and his way of \nlife. He was an inspiration to us all.\n  Joe Medicine Crow referred to his life as living in two worlds. In \none, he worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for 32 years. Then he \nreturned and fit right back into the other and the culture that \nsurrounded him. It didn't bother him that his life was divided into two \nworlds. In fact, he said he enjoyed them both.\n  The tributes to him and the way he lived his life have already \nstarted coming in from those who knew him, his family, and his friends. \nHe was a military hero, having served in the Army in World War II. He \nwas not only a student of history, he was a historian who helped to \npreserve the stories and the culture of the Crow. He also had a great \nrespect for all the traditions of his people.\n  I will always find a sense of pride and inspiration in the words he \nused to describe Wyoming. He said that although sage can be found in so \nmany places in the West, the most sacred sage had to be collected on \nthe tribal lands in Wyoming.\n  Joe Medicine Crow was given 102 years of life, and he made the most \nof every day. He has a record of which we can be very proud. That is \nwhy I hope you will seek out the stories about him that made him such \nan important part of our history.\n  In 2009 President Barack Obama presented him with the highest honor \nawarded to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I know it \nmust have meant a great deal to him to be so recognized--not for \nhimself but for what he knew it would mean to current and future \ngenerations.\n  Now he has passed on from this life and left behind more \naccomplishments and achievements than we could possibly imagine. His \nlife was like that--102 years of making a difference every day, a \ndifference that will always be remembered and never be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on Winning the 2016 NCAA Men's \n                    College Basketball Championship\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I intend to address an amendment to the \nFAA authorization bill that Senator Casey and I are offering. But \nbefore I do that, I wish to take a quick moment to celebrate an amazing \nbasketball game last night and an amazing victory for an amazing team, \nthe Villanova Wildcats. It just made everyone in Pennsylvania so proud. \nThey have had a fantastic season, a fantastic tournament, and last \nnight I think we witnessed one of the greatest college basketball games \never.\n  I know that is saying an awful lot. There have been a lot of college \nbasketball games, but the game was unbelievable. We had two fantastic \nteams, extremely well matched, extremely talented, very well coached on \nboth teams, and they just played phenomenally. I don't know how many \ntimes the lead changed. I don't think it ever got more than 10 points \naway from either team. It was just so much fun to watch, all the way \nthrough.\n  I think Jay Wright has proven once again what a magnificent coach he \nis. The kids who played demonstrated just amazing teamwork and talent, \nand all of the attributes we want to see in college athletics we saw on \ndisplay last night.\n  I can't say enough about the University of North Carolina. What a \ngreat team they are. They played with so much heart and they played so \nwell. I think we are going to watch the end of that game--the final 5 \nseconds of that game--for a long time to come.\n  I will say when Marcus Paige took that shot, it looked to me like he \nwas 20 feet behind the three-point line. He had almost been knocked \nover. He was airborne in a very odd and awkward position because he had \njust dodged another player. He got the shot off, and somehow it \ndropped. They tied the game, and there were 4.7 seconds left. At that \npoint, I thought: Well, I am in for a late night because this is going \nto be the first of overtimes since it is tied with only 4.7 seconds \nleft, but that was not the way it ended, as we know. The Wildcats had a \nplan and they executed it brilliantly with a great play to move the \nball up the court quickly, to get it to Kris Jenkins, who put up a long \nthree-point shot, and released it just before the buzzer went off. The \nbuzzer went off while the ball was sailing through the air, sunk the \nbasket, and won the game with no time left. It was the most dramatic \nand exciting finish to a basketball game that I can recall.\n  I want to take this moment to congratulate the Villanova Wildcats on \nan outstanding season, tournament, and game last night. Congratulations \nto our new national champions.\n  Mr. President, now let me turn my attention to the amendment I \nalluded to; that is, an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill. \nSenator Casey and I are going to offer as an amendment the legislation \nwe have introduced as a freestanding bill, and that is the Saracini \nAviation Safety Act of 2016. I thank Senator Casey for the very good \nwork he has done on this issue for some time.\n  Let me give a little bit of background on the amendment, which is \nbased on\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nthe legislation that is named after Victor Saracini. Victor Saracini \nwas a Bucks County, PA, native. He was a Navy pilot. After he left the \nNavy, he became a commercial airline pilot. He was a captain. He was \nthe captain of United Flight 175 which, as my colleagues will recall, \nwas one of the planes that was captured by terrorists on 9/11. The fact \nis, Captain Saracini was murdered by the terrorists when they stormed \nthe cockpit, took control of the plane, killed Victor Saracini, and \nthen flew the plane into the World Trade Center.\n  Victor Saracini left behind his wife Ellen, who is with us today in \nthe Senate. She has been a very forceful and effective advocate for \ngreater safety on board our commercial planes. Victor also left behind \ntwo daughters, Kirsten and Brielle.\n  The amendment does something very simple. It requires a secondary \nbarrier to the cockpit on commercial aircraft. That is all. That will \nprevent unauthorized individuals from getting into the cockpit. It is \nas simple as that. It is a simple, lightweight, inexpensive technology, \nreadily available. It is actually made from a wire mesh, and it \nprovides a barrier between the passenger cabin and the cockpit door. It \nwould only be engaged when the cockpit door is open.\n  So why is this necessary? It is necessary because it is still \nentirely possible for terrorists to hijack commercial aircraft.\n  Back in 2001, after 9/11, Congress took a step to make commercial \naircraft cockpits more secure. They mandated the installation of \nreinforced doors, and these reinforced doors are much stronger than the \ndoors that used to exist. It is very difficult--almost impossible--to \nbreach those doors when they are closed, but the threat remains because \non every long flight and on many short flights the doors are open. At \nsome point during the course of the flight, pilots often get up and \nthey get out of the cockpit. They have to go to the restroom or they go \nto get some food or a flight attendant goes in to check on the pilots \nor to bring them something they want. That moment when that door is \nopened, that door is no longer a barrier. Therein lies the danger. \nThere is the moment of opportunity for terrorists.\n  The FAA fully acknowledges the serious nature of this risk. In April \nof 2015, an FAA advisory said the following:\n\n       On long flights, as a matter of necessity, crewmembers must \n     open the flight deck door to access lavatory facilities, to \n     transfer meals to flightcrew members, or to switch crew \n     positions for crew rest purposes. The opening and closing of \n     the flight deck door (referred to as ``door transition''), \n     reduces the protective anti-intrusion/anti-penetration \n     benefits of the reinforced door. . . . During this door \n     transition, the flight deck is vulnerable.\n\n  Of course, it is not only the FAA that was able to figure this out. \nThe terrorists understand this as well.\n  The 9/11 Commission report said this:\n\n       Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them--\n\n  And the ``them'' in this case refers to the terrorists he was \ninstructing.\n\n       Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them to watch the cabin doors at \n     takeoff and landing to observe whether the captain went to \n     the lavatory during the flight and to note whether the flight \n     attendants brought food into the cockpit.\n\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 \n     minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically were \n     opened for the first time.\n       Furthermore--\n\n  States the 9/11 Commission report--\n\n     they had no firm contingency plans--\n\n  ``They'' being the terrorists--\n\n     in case the cockpit door was locked. They were confident the \n     cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking \n     them down a viable idea.\n\n  Since then, we have made the doors even more durable. It would be \neven more difficult to actually break down the door or otherwise open a \nclosed door. The problem is when the door is open.\n  This is not just a theoretical risk. Since 9/11, there have been at \nleast 51 attempts at cockpit breaches worldwide. Five attempts have \nbeen successful. One successful attempt occurred in 2006 on Turkish \nAirlines Flight 1476. Terrorists were successful in entering the \ncockpit after a flight attendant opened the door to ask the pilots if \nthey needed anything.\n  So it seems to me unacceptable, when we have a readily available \nsolution, to continue to take this risk. It is just common sense to \ninstall secondary barriers on commercial planes. These are inexpensive, \nseveral thousand dollars to install. They are lightweight and easy to \nuse and very compact when they are not engaged. The only people who \nwould be inconvenienced by these secondary barriers would be \nterrorists. Had the secondary barriers, these kinds of barriers, been \ninstalled on 9/11, it would have made the job very difficult for the \nterrorists to ever get into the cockpit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think this is a \nsensible amendment. The substance of this has been approved in the \nHouse. We ought to pass it on the Senate floor and pass this FAA \nreauthorization underlying bill. If we do that, in time, our skies will \nbe that much safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa\n\n\n                 Proper Role of a Supreme Court Justice\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a significant number of Americans \nbelieve the Supreme Court is highly politicized. Its approval rating \nhas fallen over the years, not surprisingly. Its approval rating has \ndropped most drastically in recent years following the President's \nappointment of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan.\n  There are four Justices who vote in a liberal way in effectively \nevery case the public follows. There are two Justices who stick to the \nconstitutional text and who vote in a consistently conservative way. \nOne Justice votes mostly, but not always, in a conservative way, and \none Justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with \nthe liberals.\n  All of the liberals were appointed by Democrats, the conservatives \nand swing Justices were appointed by a Republican President, but in a \nspeech shortly before Justice Scalia's death, Chief Justice Roberts \nmaintained that the public wrongly thinks Justices view themselves as \nRepublicans or as Democrats. Of course, it is irrelevant to the public \nhow the Justices view themselves. What is troubling is that a large \nsegment of the population views the Justices as political.\n  It is appropriate and instructive, then, to ask why the public takes \nthis view and whether that view is warranted. I believe the public's \nperception is at least sometimes very warranted.\n\n  The Chief Justice ruled out that this perception has anything to do \nwith what the Justices themselves have done. Instead, he attributes it \nto the Senate confirmation process. As he sees it, Senators \n``frequently ask us questions they know it would be inappropriate for \nus to answer. Thankfully, we don't answer the questions.''\n  The Chief Justice also stated:\n\n       When you have a sharply divided political divisive hearing \n     process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it \n     will be viewed in those terms. You know, if the Democrats and \n     Republicans have been fighting so fiercely about whether \n     you're going to be confirmed, it's natural for some members \n     of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a \n     particular way as a result of that process.\n\n  On the one hand, the Chief Justice identified precisely why it would \nbe bad for the Court and the nominee to move forward in the middle of a \nhotly contested Presidential election campaign.\n  As you have heard this Senator say, it would be all politics and no \nConstitution. Of course, that was the thrust of another Senator a few \nyears back--Chairman Biden's argument in 1992. But in another respect, \nthe Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process \ndoesn't make the Justices appear political. The confirmation process \nhas gotten political precisely because the Court itself has drifted \nfrom the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on \npolicy preferences. In short, the Justices themselves have gotten \npolitical, and because the Justices' decisions are often political and \ntransgress their constitutional role, the process becomes more \npolitical.\n  In fact, many of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that \nthe Chief Justice is part of this problem. They believe that a number \nof his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. \nCertainly, there are academics who agree.\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\n  In a recent New York Times article, academics appealed to the Chief \nJustice's political side. These academics asked him to intervene in the \ncurrent Supreme Court vacancy, suggesting that it could be a so-called \nJohn Marshall moment for Chief Justice Roberts. That is a political \ntemptation that the Chief Justice should resist.\n  I can't think of anything any current Justice could do to further \ndamage respect for the Court at this moment than to interject \nthemselves into what Chairman Biden called the political ``cauldron'' \nof an election year Supreme Court vacancy.\n  In a recent speech, the Chief Justice said: ``We're interpreting the \nlaw, not imposing our views.''\n  He further stated: ``If people don't like the explanation, or don't \nthink it holds together, you know, then they're justified, I think, in \nviewing us as having transgressed the limits of our role.''\n  Again, with all due respect to the Chief Justice, tens of millions of \nAmericans believe, correctly, that the Supreme Court has transgressed \nthe limits of its role. Tens of millions of Americans believe, \ncorrectly, that too many of the Justices are imposing their views and \nnot interpreting the law.\n  That is the major reason why we should have a debate about the proper \nrole of a Supreme Court Justice. We need to debate whether our current \nJustices are adhering to their constitutional role.\n  As the Chief Justice remarked, although many of the Supreme Court's \ndecisions are unanimous or nearly so, the Justices tend to disagree on \nwhat the Chief Justice called, in his words, the ``hot button issues.'' \nWe all know what kinds of cases he has in mind when he talks about \n``hot button issues''--freedom of religion, abortion, affirmative \naction, gun control, free speech, and the death penalty. One can \nprobably name a lot of others. The Chief Justice was very revealing \nwhen he acknowledged that the lesser known cases are often unanimous, \nand the hot button cases are frequently 5 to 4.\n  But why is that?\n  The law is no more or less likely to be clear in a hot button case \nthan another case. For those Justices committed to the rule of law, it \nshouldn't be any harder to keep personal preferences out of a \npolitically charged case than any other case.\n  In some cases, the Justices are all willing to follow the law, but in \nothers where they are deeply invested in the policy implications of the \nruling, those cases tend to turn out 5 to 4. The explanation of these \n5-to-4 rulings must be that in hot button cases some of the Justices \nare deciding based on their political preferences and not--as they \nshould be--on the law. But if hot button cases are being decided by \npoliticians in robes, then the Supreme Court has no more of a right \nthan the voters to be the final word.\n  The Chief Justice regrets that the American people believe the Court \nis no different from the political branches of government. But again, \nand with respect, I think he is concerned with the wrong problem. He \nwould be well-served to address the reality--not the perception--that \ntoo often there is little difference between the actions of the Court \nand the actions of the political branches. So, Physician, heal thyself. \nIn case after 5-to-4 case, the Justices who the Democrats appointed \nvote for liberal policy results.\n  This can't be a coincidence. Democratic Presidents know what they \nwant when they nominate Justices--Justices who will reach politically \nliberal results regardless of what the law requires. This, of course, \nis what our current President means when he says that he wants Justices \nto look to their ``heart'' to decide the really hard cases. That is an \nunambiguous invitation for Justices to decide the hot button cases \nbased on personal policy preferences. That, of course, isn't the law, \nand it is not the appropriate role for the Court. It is no wonder, \nthen, that the public believes the Court is political.\n  What Democratic Presidents want in this regard is what they get--even \nbefore Justice Scalia's death. Leading scholars found this Supreme \nCourt to be the most liberal since the 1960s. Justices appointed by \nRepublicans are generally committed to following the law. There are \nJustices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the \nJustices appointed even by Republicans often don't vote in a way that \nadvances conservative policy.\n  Contrary to what the Chief Justice suggested, a major reason the \nconfirmation process has become more divisive is that some of the \nJustices are voting too often based on politics and not on law. If they \nare going to be political actors after they are confirmed, then the \nconfirmation process necessarily is going to reflect that dynamic.\n  For instance, just last week, after one of my Democratic colleagues \nmet with Judge Garland, the Senator said after discussing issues like \nreproductive rights: ``I actually feel quite confident that he is \ndeserving of my support.''\n  Obviously, I don't know what they discussed during that meeting or \nwhat Judge Garland said about reproductive rights, and, to be clear, I \nam not suggesting anything inappropriate was discussed. My point is \nthis: If Justices stuck to the constitutional text and didn't base \ndecisions on their own policy preferences or what the President asked, \nbased on what is in their heart or on empathy for a particular \nlitigant, then Senators wouldn't deem it necessary to understand \nwhether the nominee supports reproductive rights or not. With this in \nmind, is it any wonder that the public believes the Court is political?\n  If we want the confirmation process to be less divisive, if we want \nthe public to have more confidence that the Justices haven't exceeded \ntheir constitutional role, then the Justices themselves need to \ndemonstrate that in politically sensitive cases their decisions are \nbased on the Constitution and the law and not on political preferences \nor what comes from the heart or because of some empathy.\n  So here is where we are about the public perception of the Court \nbeing political. When the Justices return to their appropriate role of \ndeciding cases based on the facts and the law, public perception of the \nCourt will take care of itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The total \n     overall estimated value is $386 million.\n       Australia is one of our most important allies in the \n     Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political and \n     economic power contributes significantly to ensuring peace \n     and economic stability in the region. This proposed sale will \n     contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the \n     United States by helping to improve the security of a major \n     contributor to political stability, security, and economic \n     development in the Pacific region and globally.\n       The sale of SDB I supports and complements the on-going \n     sale of the F-35 to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). \n     This capability will strengthen combined operations and \n     increase interoperability between the U.S. Air Force and the \n     RAAF. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this \n     equipment into its armed forces.\n       The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the \n     basic military balance in the region.\n       The principal contractor for production is Boeing in St. \n     Louis, Missouri. The principal contractor for integration is \n     unknown and will be determined during contract negotiations. \n     There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection \n     with this potential sale.\n       Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the \n     assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor \n     representatives to Australia.\n       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness \n     as a result of this proposed sale.\n\n\n                         Transmittal No. 16-23\n\n     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to \n         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n       1. Sensitive and/or classified (up to SECRET) elements of \n     the proposed acquisition include hardware, accessories, \n     components, and associated software: GBU-39/B Small Diameter \n     Bomb Increment I (SDB I). Additional sensitive areas include \n     operating manuals and maintenance technical orders containing \n     performance information, operating and test procedures, and \n     other information related to the support operations and \n     repair. The hardware, software, and data identified are \n     classified to protect vulnerabilities, design and performance \n     parameters, and other similar critical information.\n       2. The GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment T (SDB I) is \n     a 250-pound class weapon designed as a small, all-weather, \n     autonomous, conventional, air-to-ground, precision glide \n     weapon able to strike fixed and stationary re-locatable \n     targets from standoff range. The SDB I weapon system consists \n     of the weapons, the BRU-61/A (4-place pneumatic carriage \n     system), shipping and handling containers for a single weapon \n     and the BRU-61/A either empty or loaded, and a weapon \n     planning module. It has integrated diamond-back type wings \n     that deploy after releases, which increases the glide time \n     and therefore maximum range. The SDB I Anti-Jam Global \n     Positioning System aided Inertial Navigation System (AJGPS/\n     INS) provides guidance to the coordinates of a stationary \n     target. The payload/warhead is a very effective multipurpose \n     penetrating and blast fragmentation warhead coupled with a \n     cockpit selectable electronic fuze. Its size and accuracy \n     allow for an effective munition with less collateral damage. \n     A proximity sensor provides height of burst capability.\n       3. A determination has been made that the recipient country \n     can provide substantially the same degree of protection for \n     the sensitive technology associated with this system as the \n     U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the \n     U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined \n     in the Policy Justification.\n       4. All defense articles and services listed in this \n     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to \n     the Government of Australia.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Defense Security\n\n\n                                           Cooperation Agency,\n\n                                                    Arlington, VA.\n     Hon.

Purchaser: Government of Japan.\n       ii. Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 15-62; Date: 19 \n     November 2015; Military Department: Air Force.\n       iii. Description: On 19 November 2015, Congress was \n     notified by Congressional certification transmittal number \n     15-62, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the \n     Arms Export Control Act of three (3) RQ-4 Block 30 (I) Global \n     Hawk Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), each with Enhanced \n     Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS), eight (8) Kearfott Inertial \n     Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) units \n     (2 per aircraft with 2 spares), and eight (8) LN-251 INS/GPS \n     units (2 per aircraft with 2 spares). Also included with this \n     request are operational-level sensor and aircraft test \n     equipment, ground support equipment, operational flight test \n     support, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, \n     personnel training, publications and technical data, U.S. \n     Government and contractor technical and logistics support \n     services, and other related elements of logistics support. \n     The total value of this sale is $1.2 billion. Major Defense \n     Equipment (MDE) constitutes $689 million of this sale.\n       This transmittal reports the inclusion of two Ground \n     Control Elements (GCE). The GCEs were not enumerated as MDE \n     in the original notification of the Global Hawk RPA system. \n     Inclusion of this equipment as MDE will increase the MDE cost \n     by $31 million, resulting in a revised MDE cost of $720 \n     million. The total case value will remain $1.2 billion.\n       iv. Significance: This notification is being provided as \n     the GCEs were not enumerated as MDE in the original \n     notification. Their inclusion does not necessarily represent \n     an increase in capability over what was notified, but \n     properly identifies the equipment required for Global Hawk \n     operations. This equipment provides the Japan Air Self-\n     Defense Force (JASDF) a ground control station from which to \n     fly and execute Global Hawk surveillance missions. Overall, \n     these systems meet the requirements of providing the JASDF \n     with the ability to conduct high-altitude surveillance and \n     reconnaissance without exposing JASDF personnel to the \n     dangers inherent to high-altitude ISR operations.\n       v. Justification: This proposed sale will contribute to the \n     foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the \n     United States by meeting the security and defense needs of an \n     ally and partner nation. Japan continues to be an important \n     force for peace, political stability, and economic progress \n     in East Asia and the Western Pacific. The proposed sale of \n     the RQ-4 will significantly enhance Japan's intelligence, \n     surveillance, and\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\n     reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and help ensure that Japan \n     is able to continue to monitor and deter regional threats. \n     The JASDF will have no difficulty absorbing these systems \n     into its armed forces.\n       vi.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the 100th \nanniversary of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, JROTC. On \nJune 3, 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act, establishing \nthe JROTC. This program teaches students the values of our Armed Forces \nthrough training and classroom instruction with military personnel.\n  This influential program encourages leadership, fortitude, and \npersonal responsibility. The JROTC has experienced a long history of \nsuccess, and millions of high school students have completed the \nprogram since its inception. Not only do these students learn military \nhistory and customs, but participants gain a deeper understanding of \ncivic engagement, community service, and the importance of character \nbuilding.\n  Out of the many high school students who participate in JROTC each \nyear, 30 to 50 percent go on to serve in the U.S. military later in \nlife. The program also connects high school students with universities \nthat offer the Reserve Officer Training Corps program and helps many \nstudents who may have not otherwise earned a college degree.\n  I would also like to recognize the 35 schools in Colorado that offer \nthe JROTC program. In Colorado, there are 2 Marine Corps JROTC units, 8 \nAir Force JROTC units, 4 Navy units, and 21 Army units. I am proud of \nthe accomplishments of the JROTC students, and I know they have a \nbright future ahead of them.\n  Please join me in honoring Adams City High School, Northridge High \nSchool, Aurora Central High School, Westminster High School, Harrison \nHigh School, William Mitchell High School, Air Academy High School, \nSkyview Academy, Glenwood Springs High School, Doherty High School, \nMontrose High School, Mesa Ridge High School, Widefield High School, \nPueblo County High School, Pueblo East High School, North High School, \nAbraham Lincoln High School, Denver South High School, Manual High \nSchool, Loveland High School, Thomas Jefferson High School, Pueblo West \nHigh School, Centennial High School, Central High School, Pueblo South \nHigh School, Delta High School, Central High School--Pueblo, Montebello \nSenior High School, West High School, George Washington High School, \nJohn F.

He was an Assiniboine chief, decorated war \nhero, WWII combat veteran, and code talker. In 1940 he entered the U.S. \nArmy at the young age of 17. He was a member of the 163rd Infantry \nBattalion. Chief Horn received training in communication and \nencryption. He then volunteered to be a code talker using his native \nAssiniboine Tribe language to disguise U.S. military communications \nagainst the Japanese.\n  He volunteered for the Merrill's Marauders, a deep penetration unit \ncommanded by MG Frank Merrill. They spent 5 months of field operations \nin Burma and western China and completed an 800-mile journey across the \nHimalaya Mountains in order to cut Japanese communications and supply \nlines. Chief Horn survived the journey with chest, back, and jaw \nwounds. He was honorably discharged, having received the Purple Heart \nand the Bronze Star.\n  After returning to the Fort Belknap Indian reservation he served as \nchairman and council member of the Fort Belknap Community Council. He \nwas awarded an honorary doctorate in humanitarian services from MSU \nNorthern in 2013. Then in 2014 he had the honor of being named the \nhonorary chief of the Fort Belknap Assiniboine Tribe, a title that had \nnot been awarded since the 1890s.\n  I extend my condolences to his family and to the entire Fort Belknap \nIndian community.

Madam President, in honor of the National Parks \nService's 100th birthday year, I want to recognize Arkansas Post \nNational Memorial and Park. Arkansas Post was established as a trading \npost by Henri De Tonti in 1686 and was the first permanent European \nsettlement in the lower Mississippi River valley. While the exact \nlocation moved several times, the area remained a vital trade center \nfor much of the 17th and 18th centuries. The land was eventually ceded \nto Spain, who controlled the post for over 40 years. While under \nSpanish control, Arkansas Post was home to the Battle of Arkansas Post, \na Revolutionary War battle between Spanish and British forces fought on \nApril 17, 1783. Also known as the Colbert Raid, this battle was the \nonly Revolutionary War battle to take place in what is today the State \nof Arkansas. Arkansas Post was\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nbriefly ceded back to the French before it was sold to the U.S. \nGovernment during the Louisiana Purchase.\n  Today Arkansas Post National Memorial and Park is located in Arkansas \nCounty, AR. It was designated a National Memorial and National Historic \nLandmark in 1960 and was listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces in 1966.

Madam President, today I wish to honor the life of \nmy friend Hilliard Fletcher of Tuscaloosa, AL, who passed away on March \n13, 2016. He will be remembered as a skilled businessman, a devoted \npublic servant, and a man who deeply cared about the city of \nTuscaloosa.\n  A native of Mobile, Hilliard graduated from the University of Alabama \nin 1957. He went on to serve our country as an officer in the U.S. \nMarine Corps and served for 14 years in the Reserves, retiring with the \nrank of major.\n  Hilliard was the president of Duckworth-Morris Insurance Company and \nalso served with distinction four terms as finance and waterworks \ncommissioner on the Tuscaloosa City Commission. During those 16 years, \nhe played an instrumental role in the creation of the mayor-council \nmodel of municipal government that we know today. He was also \ninfluential in the efforts that led to Congress passing the Lake \nTuscaloosa Protection Act, which prevented the Federal Government from \ninstalling a hydroelectric powerplant on Lake Tuscaloosa's dam in 1970.\n  In addition to his many years of service to the city of Tuscaloosa, \nHilliard was a true leader in his community--serving on numerous boards \nand working with various charitable and business organizations. He \nserved on the board of directors of First Alabama Bank, was the \npresident of the United Way of West Alabama, and was president and \ndirector of the Exchange Club of Tuscaloosa. He also served as a board \nmember and officer of the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama, was a \nmember of the board of directors and membership chairman of the YMCA of \nTuscaloosa, and was the Chairman of the Heart Fund Drive. Hilliard was \non the DCH Foundation Board, was director of the Alabama League of \nMunicipalities, and was a deacon of First Presbyterian Church of \nTuscaloosa.\n  Hilliard's many accomplishments, as well as his contributions to the \ncity of Tuscaloosa and West Alabama, will not be soon forgotten. \nTuscaloosa named the city's wastewater treatment plant after him in \n1998. The Community Foundation of West Alabama named him a ``Pillar of \nWest Alabama'' in 2010 for his dedicated efforts and service to the \narea.\n  The city of Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama were fortunate to \nhave a leader and a great man like Hilliard Fletcher, and he will be \nsorely missed. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Betty; his \ndaughter, Beth Lubin; and his sons, Douglas and Curtis, as they \ncelebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn this great \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1665-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MANSOUR KARIM\n\n Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I recognize Mansour Karim of \nPierre, SD. Mr. Karim's life story is inspiring, and his contributions \nto his community and the State of South Dakota are worthy of \ncommendation.\n  Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, to a poor family, Mr. Karim dreamed \nof moving to the United States to pursue his higher education. That \ndream became a reality in November of 1950, when Mr. Karim arrived at \nthe Port of New York and New Jersey with a limited English vocabulary \nand only $27 in his pocket. He had originally planned to attend the \nUniversity of Michigan, but was worried that the growing Iranian \nimmigrant population there would keep him from being immersed in the \nculture of the United States. He decided to study at Huron College in \nHuron, SD.\n  Mr. Karim's journey to South Dakota was challenged by the barriers of \nan unfamiliar nation, but he had his faith and was often helped by \nstrangers along the way. He studied at Huron College for a year before \ntransferring to South Dakota State College, now known as South Dakota \nState University, from which he graduated in 1955 with a degree in \ncivil engineering. He would later receive his master's degree in \nengineering from the same school. Mr. Karim served 35 years with the \nSouth Dakota Department of Transportation in South Dakota's capital \ncity of Pierre. Though a dedicated civil servant, he found his passion \ndoing something he never could have done in his home country of Iran.\n  He invested in rental properties, starting modestly. Eventually, \nthrough hard work, wise investment, and trusted relationships, he \nachieved great success in providing affordable, quality rentals for \nresidents in the Pierre area. Mr. Karim did not do this alone. His \nwife, Ruth, provided support to the enterprise as the two of them \nraised their seven children.\n  Ruth Karim cofounded South Dakota Right to Life and served as its \nexecutive director for 19 years. Prior to Ruth passing away in 2013, \nMr. Karim worked with the Saint Mary's Foundation in Pierre to set up \nthe Ruth Karim Endowment that would help nursing students who value \nprotecting the sanctity of life and fund their education at Ruth's alma \nmater, the University of South Dakota.\n  When looking back on his life, Mr. Karim is quick to recognize those \nwho helped him move to South Dakota. He also remembers how, as a young \nchild, he gave a beggar a penny, though he wished he had been able to \ngive more. That giving nature has continued throughout his life, with \nMr. Karim having given more than $2 million to charities throughout \nSouth Dakota, with a focus on education and children's needs. He \ncreated the Mansour and Ruth Karim Scholarship Endowment in 2004 at \nSouth Dakota State University. Due to these charitable contributions \nMr. Karim has been the recipient of many awards, including being named \nPierre's Outstanding Philanthropist of the Year in 2011.\n  I, like the residents of Pierre and others across South Dakota, have \nhad the pleasure of knowing Mr. Karim. His passion for the United \nStates and the freedoms it affords and his genuine care for his \ncommunity is contagious. In conversations, Mr. Karim will often say \nthat his experience could only be possible in the United States. His \nstory is another real-life example of the American dream as reality and \nwhat makes our Nation great, to succeed and to give back, so that \nothers may succeed.\n  It is for these reasons that I would like to extend my sincere \ngratitude to Mr. Karim for his generous philanthropic work and thank \nhim for making South Dakota his home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1665-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SHUKRI JAMA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, with the recent celebration of \nInternational Women's Day, it is fitting that we recognize hard-working \nwomen all around our country and in our local communities. There are \ninspiring women running small businesses all over our great State, from \nright out of the swamps of south Louisiana to the big cities. This week \nI would like to recognize Bart's Office Moving Company, Inc., of New \nOrleans, LA, as small business of the week for their commitment to \nsupporting the local economy and serving as a shining example for women \nentrepreneurs across the State.\n  In 1978, with the dream of owning and running their own successful \nbusiness, Bart and Kathleen Thibodeaux opened Bart's Office Furniture \nRepairs in New Orleans, LA. Quickly establishing a reputation for \nreliability and dependability with a can-do attitude, the Thibodeaux's \nbusiness flourished, just as the couple began having children and \nbuilding their family. When Bart suddenly developed a chronic illness, \nhindering him from working, Kathleen took the reins of the day-to-day \noperations of running the business, keeping up the principles and \nquality for which the company has become so well known.\n  Today, Kathleen's and Bart's daughters--Ashley, Courtney, Kasie, and \nAlexie--have joined the family business and expanded the furniture \nrepair shop to include a full-service office moving and office \nfurniture installation company.\n  Congratulations again to the Thibodeaux family and Bart's Office \nMoving for being selected small business of the week. We look forward \nto your continued growth and success under the leadership of the \nThibodeaux women entrepreneurs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1666-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING DELTA INTERIORS AND GIFTS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, in recent weeks our State has \nfaced disastrous storms and flooding, but with true Louisiana strength, \nfamilies and communities are already banding together for the recovery. \nIn that spirit, I would like to recognize Delta Interiors and Gifts as \nsmall business of the week whose community has rallied together to \nrespond to and recover from the recent storms.\n  In 1976, John and Martha Peters founded Delta Interiors and Gifts in \ntheir hometown of Homer in northwest Louisiana with the goal of \nproviding quality interior design services and unique gifts to clients \nin their community. Offering additional services in custom drapery and \ndesign in their factory in Homer, they produce draperies, hospital \ncurtains, blinds, and other items for hotels and hospitals nationwide, \nfrom Massachusetts to Washington to California to Florida. One of their \nmost well-known projects was providing the interior designs for the \nhistoric Waldorf Astoria hotel in New Orleans.\n  Today, the company boasts a statewide and nationwide clientele, \nlargely due to their commitment to personally measuring, producing, and \ninstalling each order that many large corporations sometimes cannot \nprovide. The company has earned a reputation among large hotel brands, \nenabling Delta Interiors to grow and employ more and more local workers \nin their manufacturing factory.\n  In the aftermath of a strong upper level storm system that brought \ndangerous thunderstorms and flooding across Louisiana this month, the \nPeters found themselves in a seemingly impossible situation: their \nlife's business was literally underwater. The Homer community came \ntogether to help the Peters recover all undamaged products and remove \nwhat had been destroyed by the rising water. With friends, family, and \nneighbors coming to their aid, the Peters have been inspired to pick up \nthe pieces and rebuild their small business.\n  In the next several months, countless businesses like Delta Interiors \nwill put the pieces of their businesses back together again with the \nhelp of family, friends, and neighbors. As the Peters family and their \nteam at Delta Interiors rebuild after these disastrous storms, I am \nhonored to name Delta Interiors as small business of the week, and I \nwish them a quick recovery and many more years of growth and \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1666-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1666-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/05/senate-section/article/S1666-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1666-S1673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-4752.
