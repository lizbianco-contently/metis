Mr. President, next week the Senate will turn to \nbroad, bipartisan energy legislation. The Energy Policy Modernization \nAct will help bring our energy policies in line with the demands of \ntoday and the opportunities of tomorrow. It will help Americans produce \nmore energy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. It will help \nAmericans save energy. That is what the Energy Policy Modernization Act \nwill do. Here is what the Energy Policy Modernization Act won't do: It \nwon't raise taxes. It won't add a dime to the deficit.\n  The broad Energy bill is a result of a truly bipartisan process, and \nit shows, which is why it was supported in committee by a vote of 18 to \n4.\n  I look forward to debating the bipartisan Energy bill starting next \nweek, but we won't have to wait until then to consider bipartisan \nlegislation. We will consider a different bipartisan measure today. \nS.J. Res. 22 passed in November with the support of several Democratic \ncolleagues, and it would have overturned the Obama administration's \nwaters of the United States regulation.\n  Here is what our Democratic colleagues have had to say about WOTUS: A \nDemocratic Senator from West Virginia has used phrases such as \n``completely unreasonable'' and ``dangerously overreaching'' when \ndiscussing the issue. A Democratic Senator from North Dakota said that \n``there is not one single regulation in the entire country that has \ncaused more concern'' in her State. A Democratic Senator from Indiana \nsaid it was ``incredibly important'' that the rule be rewritten. That \nis just what the Democrats are saying.\n  The administration has tried to spin WOTUS as some kind of clean \nwater measure, but a bipartisan majority of Congress understands it is \nreally a Federal power grab clumsily masquerading as one. WOTUS would \ngrant Federal bureaucrats dominion over nearly every piece of land that \ntouches a pothole, ditch, or puddle. It would force the Americans who \nlive there to ask Federal bureaucrats for permission to do just about \nanything with their very own property. That is why Congress sent \nbipartisan legislation to the President to overturn it. His decision to \nveto that bipartisan measure made a few things quite clear: No. 1, he \napparently stands with Washington bureaucrats on this issue, not the \nAmerican people. No. 2, he apparently thinks America's clean water rule \nshould be based on Washington politics, not a scientific and truly \ncollaborative process.\n  It was good to see Democratic colleagues stand with the American \npeople when we first passed this bill. I ask the rest of the Democratic \ncaucus to join with us now to do the right thing. Vote with us to \noverride a veto that is about Federal power grabs and Washington \npolitics, not clean water and the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S141-8", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S141-S142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S.J.

Mr. President, we are 3 weeks into the new year, and \nalready we are back to wasting the Senate's time to launch partisan \nattacks. Today my Republican colleagues have chosen to once again \nattack clean water protections that millions of Americans depend on.\n  On Tuesday President Obama vetoed the Republican attempt to roll back \nthe clean water rule--a rule that basically restores important \nsafeguards to shield our water sources from pollution and \ncontamination. There are special interest groups who have tried to \nraise money based on this. Some of the groups who have tried to raise \nmoney on this with fallacious information are farm groups. They have \ngone out and said that this is terrible for agriculture. Agriculture is \nexempted, so anyone saying this is horrible for agriculture is simply \nwrong. Under the specific language of the legislation, agriculture is \nexempted.\n  The clean water rule resolves years of confusion and provides \nregulatory certainty for businesses, farmers, local governments, and \ncommunities. It creates no new permitting requirements and maintains \nall previous exemptions and exclusions.\n  Despite President Obama's veto, Republicans remain determined to \nundermine the environment. Safe water is critical to the health of our \ncommunities. One need go no further than Flint, MI, to find out that \nthat is, in fact, the case. And it is important to our economy. At this \nvery moment, as I have indicated, 100,000 people live in Flint, MI. All \nof those families--thousands of families--have been forced to worry \nabout their children's health because of lead contamination in their \ndrinking water. Their little brains are adversely affected by lead in \nthe water. We have known that for a long time, but in an effort to save \na buck, the Governor and others in Michigan decided they would try \nsomething else and in the process have really drastically damaged the \nlives of little boys and girls in Flint, MI.\n  Our country is the wealthiest country in the world. No American \nshould have to worry about whether they are drinking safe water in \nAmerica. It is unconscionable to think that we would waste valuable \ntime in the Senate attacking a rule dealing with clean water designed \nto keep our Nation's water safe. And while we are doing this--wasting \ntime here in the Senate today--Flint, MI, is in a state of emergency.\n  Republicans are so wedded to idealogical purity, they have lost touch \nwith reality. They have somehow failed to recognize that clean water is \na basic priority for all Americans. The reality is that the Federal \nfunding and reasonable protections are necessary to ensure public \nhealth and safety.\n  The Governor of the State of Michigan is an anti-government person. \nThat is his mark. He especially wants Washington to stay out of \nMichigan's government. But what is the first thing he does when he \nfinds out he and his whole government have messed up the State of \nMichigan? He calls Washington for help. He, along with many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, disparage the Federal \nGovernment every chance they get, but when a crisis strikes, whom do \nthey call upon to help? The Federal Government.\n  Rolling back clean water protections is the wrong thing to do, and \nRepublicans should refocus their energy on solutions to keep America \nhealthy and safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S142-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S142-S143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNIVERSARY OF CITIZENS UNITED DECISION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a flood of dark money has engulfed the \nAmerican political system and perverted our democracy. The voices of \nordinary citizens are being drowned out by billionaires seeking to rig \nthe system in their favor.\n  Americans should know that Democrats are fighting to restore their \nvoice, which is being overshadowed by the billions of dollars being \nspent to push the Republican Presidential nominees, and on every level \nof the government, this dark money is there drowning out the voices of \naverage Americans. Over here, we stand united in our commitment to \nadvance the interest of the middle-class and working families. It is \nimportant to remember how we got to this point.\n  Yesterday I saw that the junior Senator from Florida and the former \nGovernor of Florida have spent about $150 million so far running for \nPresident. One of them is at 10 percent in the national polls and the \nother is at 6 percent. But they have the money to slosh around and \nspend.\n  We got here because 6 years ago today, the Supreme Court of our great \ncountry erased a century of sound government regulations that protect \nthe fairness and integrity of elections. It was determined during the \nRepublican reign of Teddy Roosevelt that there was too much corporate \nmoney in American politics, and so under his leadership, it was \neliminated. But the Supreme Court changed that in a very narrow \ndecision of 5 to 4.\n  The disastrous Citizens United ruling opened the floodgates for these \nshadowy billionaires to influence our elections. Most of the spending \nis done in secret by special interest shell groups who refuse to \ndisclose their donors to the American people. These billionaire donors \nstop at nothing to buy a government that favors them and their special \ninterests.\n  There are two brothers who I believe are determined to buy America, \nand we will find out come election time. Maybe they have been able to \ndo that. Charles and David Koch are shrewd business people. Their \nwealth is nearly unmatched anyplace in the world. They have amassed a \nfortune from inherited wealth that they have magnified that has come \nfrom oil, chemicals, and a lot of different places. They originally \ninherited this from their dad and built it into a multinational \ncorporation. No one really knows their net worth, but some say it is \n$100 billion, $150 billion. No one really knows. They have become two \nof the wealthiest men in the entire world.\n  They seek more wealth, but that is not all they seek. A new book by \nJane Myer--a dignified and renowned author and journalist--she reports \nin her book that immediately after the election of President Obama, the \nKoch brothers wanted to double down on what they had done before. They \nhad been working on this for a while. They didn't like this man, Barack \nObama, being President of the United States, so they gathered like-\nminded billionaires--it is in her book--and plotted to spend however \nmuch money it would take to get rid of him for a new term and basically \nundermine our democracy. You can't make up a story like this. These are \nthe facts.\n  Capitalizing on the Citizens United decision, the Koch brothers have \npoured over $1 billion into our political system to create a country \nthat protects the wealthiest one-half of 1 percent. The America they \nenvision is drastically different from the vision most Americans have \nfor our country.\n  I have a list of some of the things they have advocated for decades. \nIt used to be just the fringe, but now we have people running for \nPresident who agree with him. They want to abolish Social Security, \neliminate minimum wage laws, dismantle Medicare as we know it, \ndismantle our public education system, dismantle protections for clean \nair and water, create tax breaks for themselves, and they have done a \npretty good job of that. They are prepared to use their enormous wealth \nto accomplish these goals. They really put their money where their \nmouth is. They spend it because they have it to spend. They have \npledged to spend about $1 billion this cycle, not counting all the \nmoney they have spent in years past.\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\n  They have been involved in years past to make sure the John Birch \nSociety had a place in our society--the libertarians. They were \nlibertarians for a while.\n  The Supreme Court has paved the way for greedy robber barons--robber \nbarons like the Koch brothers--to create a government that works for \nthe richest of the rich.\n  Democracy demands that every American has an equal opportunity to \nhave his or her voice heard. It should not be dependent upon how much \nmoney one has.\n  I am sorry to say our Supreme Court has determined that your voice is \ngoing to be much louder if you have a lot of money. A democratic system \nshould give every American a fair shot, but every time we have tried to \nmake an effort to fix our broken finance system, the Republicans have \nsaid no.\n  We had a DISCLOSE Act. We brought it before this body. It would have \npassed the House at that time. There were 59 Democrats. We needed one \nRepublican--one Republican--to make it more apparent so that the \nAmerican people could see where this money was coming from. Not one \nRepublican would join with us.\n  Now, I came to the House of Representatives with the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona. I admire him. He is an American hero, despite what Donald \nTrump says. He proved himself in battle and in the prison system set up \nin Vietnam. I admire John McCain. I can remember him working with Russ \nFeingold, the Senator from Wisconsin, and they passed the McCain-\nFeingold legislation. It became the law of this country. It was a \nreally good, strong step forward. Citizens United wiped that out.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, had an opportunity to \nhelp this bad financial system the Supreme Court has put forward, and \nhe didn't step forward. He decided to take a pass on it. I am very \ndisappointed. I have never forgotten what he didn't do or what he could \nhave done with one vote. We only needed one vote. We had 59, and we \nonly needed 1 more.\n  Rather than secret political spending, we should have immediate \ndisclosure--some disclosure. Rather than corporations buying influence, \nwe should restore laws that limit the power of special interests. \nRather than empowering the wealthy, we should encourage small \ncontributions.\n  We must make clear once and for all that the United States of America \nis not for sale.\n  We criticized and complained about the Soviet Union and how it was. \nWe were so happy when the Soviet Union fell and Russia became a \n``democracy.'' Now people say that Russia is an oligarchy. What is an \noligarchy? An oligarchy is a country run by a person who is controlled \nby wealth--the wealth of individuals and families. That is what we have \nin Russia, and that is what we are going to have in America if this is \nallowed to continue.\n  The Koch brothers and a few other billionaires will be in concert \nwith--we see this line of characters running for President on the \nRepublican ticket--it will be with them. It will be an oligarchy first \nclass. It will match what is going on in Russia today.\n  We must make clear that the United States is not for sale. The \nCitizens United decision that we celebrate in a very adverse way today \non its anniversary is bad for the country, and I hope the Supreme Court \nunderstands how bad it is for the country. It is one of the worst \ndecisions in the history of the Supreme Court, if not the worst.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S143-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We are here today to vote in about half an hour on overriding the \nPresident's veto, a congressional action that would not have allowed \nthe country to move forward with the so-called waters of the United \nStates rule.\n  The waters of the United States sounds like a lot until you look at \nthe map beside me. This is a map of the State of Missouri and of what \nwould be covered under EPA jurisdiction, if this rule is allowed to go \ninto effect.\n  This is a map from the Missouri Farm Bureau that nobody has taken \nissue with, and the red part of our State would be covered by Federal \nGovernment authority. So 99.7 percent of the State would suddenly be \nunder the jurisdiction of the EPA on all things related to water: water \nrunning off the parking lot, water running off your driveway, water \nrunning off your roof, water falling into your yard, water falling into \na vacant lot if someone wants to build a house on that vacant lot--all \nof those things in 99.7 percent of the State. I think that three-tenths \nof 1 percent may be some unusual seepage area where the water runs away \nin a way that the EPA hasn't yet figured out how to assert jurisdiction \nover.\n  The law passed in the early 1970s, the Clean Water Act, said that the \nEPA would have jurisdiction over navigable waters. So, if you believe \nthe EPA and believe this rule and believe in the President's veto, \nnavigable waters would apparently be every drop of water in 99.7 \npercent of Missouri.\n  If the President and the administration and the EPA want to change \nthe law where it no longer says ``navigable waters,'' but where it says \nvirtually all the water, there is a way to do that: Introduce a bill, \ncome to the Congress, and the Congress votes on that bill. If the House \nand Senate approve it--I know this sounds like it is a pretty \npedestrian discussion. But apparently the President and EPA don't \nunderstand that it is the way to change the law. It is not just that \nsomebody decides that all of the water in Missouri--or to be accurate, \n99.7 percent of the water in our State, of the geography of our\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\nState on any water issue--suddenly becomes the jurisdiction of the EPA.\n  I will assure you that if the EPA gets this jurisdiction, there is no \nway that they can do what they say the Environmental Protection Agency \nshould do. That is the case in Missouri.\n  I am joined by my colleagues from North Dakota and Wyoming to talk \nabout this. Certainly, we have been on the floor repeatedly to talk \nabout this. We also talked about remedies. A great remedy would be that \nany regulation that has significant economic impact should be voted on \nby the Congress. It is a bill we have all co-sponsored called the REINS \nAct. Now the analogy here is pretty good--to put the reins on \ngovernment. But what would really happen in the REINS Act is that \nanybody who would vote for a rule like this would have to go home and \nexplain it. Frankly, I think anybody who doesn't override the \nPresident's veto had better be prepared to go home and explain it.\n  Senator Barrasso and Senator Hoeven have been vigorous in this fight. \nAs to Senator Hoeven, I know this is something that matters where he \nlives and where we live, but it is also a great indication of what \nhappens when the government somehow believes that no matter what the \nConstitution says or what the law says, the all-knowing Federal \nGovernment should be in charge of everything everywhere--in this case, \nvirtually all the water in the country.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, that is absolutely right. I join my \ndistinguished colleague from the State of Missouri, as well as my \ncolleague from the State of Wyoming and our colleague from the State of \nIowa.\n  This is an incredibly important issue. It is probably the No. 1 \nregulatory relief that all business sectors need. Starting with our \nfarmers and ranchers, this is a huge issue. This crosses all sectors \nbecause this is a big-time overreach by the EPA, and it really affects \nall property owners. You are talking about private property rights that \nare at stake here.\n  There is a fundamental principle at stake in terms of how our \ngovernment works, as well. The EPA has taken through its own regulatory \nfiat additional authority that it does not legally possess. It has done \nso under a legal theory that it has advanced called ``significant \nnexus.'' Essentially, it has gone beyond the jurisdiction it has, which \nis regulation with regard to navigable bodies of water, such as the \nMissouri River, for example, to, in essence, say it can now regulate \nall water wherever it finds it anywhere.\n  Now think about that. If part of the executive branch or a regulatory \nagency can unilaterally say, ``You know what, we are not just going to \noperate under our legislative authority; we are just going to take \nadditional authorities that we don't legally have in order to do what \nwe think is our job,'' then we have a fundamental problem because that \ndefies the underlying concepts of the checks and balances of our \ngovernment, where the legislative, judicial, and executive all offset \neach other in order to protect private property rights. That is \nabsolutely what is at stake here.\n  Essentially, the EPA has set a rule where they can regulate water \nanywhere in any capacity. So if a farmer, after a rain storm, goes out \nand wants to move water in a ditch, or even an individual private \nproperty owner wants to do that, do they have to apply to the EPA for a \npermit? How do they know? To whom do they go? Are they going to get \nconsistent rulings? Why in the world should they be subject to an \nagency without legislative authority, just deciding that they are going \nto have jurisdiction or authority in cases where they don't have it? It \nis a very important principle in terms of protecting private property \nrights as well as the fundamental fact that it has a devastating impact \non farmers, ranchers, and every sector of our society.\n  I would turn back to my colleague from Missouri and ask him to touch \non, maybe for just a minute, what we can do about it. We are on the \nfloor today to have a vote, and I think we need to point out how \nimportant it is that our colleagues join us in making sure that we \noverride this Presidential veto.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I appreciate that. This is a bill that has \nbeen on the President's desk. It passed the Senate, which means that 60 \nSenators were supportive of this rule not being able to go forward in \nits current status. The President vetoed the bill. This would be a time \nfor the Congress to stand up. If you didn't have any other interest in \nthis fight, it is the time for the Congress to stand up and say: If you \nare going to change the law, the only way to change the law is for the \nCongress to change the law. The President appears to be willing to \ndiscover all sorts of ways that can't be found in the Constitution to \nchange the law. But even if you were on the other side of this issue, \neven if you want to come to the floor of the Senate and vigorously \nargue that the EPA needs the jurisdiction of all the water in the \ncountry, as a Member of the Senate, the Senate should do that, the \nHouse should do that, and the Constitution should work.\n  Senator Barrasso, it is clearly not working here.\n  ``Navigable waters'' has been used in Federal law since about 1846, \nand until the last couple of years when the EPA asserted differently, \neverybody always thought they knew what that meant. If you could move \nsomething on it, navigate it, then the Constitution says the Federal \nGovernment has the obligation for interstate commerce. So debating how \nmuch of the Missouri River, as Senator Hoeven brought up, is navigable \nis a constitutional debate to have because it is a commerce issue.\n  I say to Senator Barrasso, suggesting that all the water in the \ncountry is navigable doesn't make sense. The Senator has been one of \nthe leaders in trying to point out for months and years now that this \nrule will be ruinous to economic activity.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I want to agree and second everything \nthat my colleague from Missouri, Senator Blunt, had to say--that 99.7 \npercent of his State is underwater according to the EPA.\n  We had a hearing, and I looked at a map of Wyoming that the EPA \npresented. It looked like the entire State of Wyoming was underwater, \naccording to the EPA. This is an incredible overreach on the part of \nthis administration, this EPA.\n  It is so interesting, because the President of the United States \nsaid: Well, if you have better ideas, bring them. If you have better \nideas, bring them. Well, we did. A number of us cosponsored bipartisan \nlegislation--a number of Democrats supported it, as well--to allow for \nCongress to establish the principles of what a new EPA rule would look \nlike. It didn't say to get rid of the whole thing. It said there are \nways to make it better; let the people on the ground make those \ndecisions.\n  Who are the best stewards of the land? Here we are. The Presiding \nOfficer, the former Governor of South Dakota, knows that the people of \nhis State have a much better love of the land of South Dakota, just as \nthe former Governor of North Dakota, who is on the floor, knows that \nthe people on the ground in North Dakota have a much greater love of \nthe land and respect for the land and desire to protect the land and \nthe water and to keep the water clean, just as we do in Wyoming and in \nMissouri. That is what this is about.\n  It is about letting people who have the best interests and who are \nthe best stewards of the land make those decisions--not, again, a \nFederal grab. It is absolutely absurd, and it shows a President of the \nUnited States who is acting in a way that I believe is lawless to the \npoint that the courts have now weighed in.\n  The courts have begun to weigh in on the concerns with this rule that \nwe are going to vote on today. We hope we override the veto of the \nPresident, because the courts have said: Hey, we need to take a pause. \nJudge Erickson of the District of North Dakota on August 27 issued an \ninjunction that blocked the waters of the United States rule in 13 \nStates because he said the rulemaking record was ``inexplicable, \narbitrary, devoid of a reasoned process''--devoid of a reasoned \nprocess. Yet the President is saying: Oh, no, they have got it all \nright. The President is wrong. The United States Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals put a nationwide stay on the rule in October. The court stated \nin granting the stay that ``the sheer breadth of the ripple effects \ncaused by the rule's definitional changes counsels strongly in favor of \nmaintaining the status quo for the time being.''\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n  Yet the President of the United States ignores it all. Congress needs \nto have a say. The courts are having a say. The President needs to \nrealize that his actions have huge impacts--negative impacts--on the \neconomies of our States, our communities, and certainly of the entire \ncountry. So it is a privilege to be here to join my colleagues from \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, Missouri, and soon my colleague from Iowa \nwho will weigh in, supporting the effort to override the President of \nthe United States on this specific piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we are urging our colleagues to do just \nexactly that--vote to override and reassert the constitutional \nauthority of the Congress. To finish up our part of our discussion this \nmorning is somebody who also understands the importance of the land, \nwhat it means to love and appreciate the land, how you can do that \ncloser to the land than farther away, the Senator from Iowa, Mrs. \nErnst.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues--the \nSenators from Missouri, North Dakota, and Wyoming--for their colloquy. \nThis is a big deal, not just for those of us from these States but for \nall Americans. We have a choice today. We do have a choice. We can \nstand with our farmers, our ranchers, our small businessmen, our \nmanufacturers, our homebuilders, or we can stand with an overreaching \nFederal agency that is committed to expanding its reach to over 97 \npercent of our lands in Iowa and, as my colleague from Missouri stated, \n99.7 percent of the land in Missouri.\n  I know what I am going to do. I am going to stand with my \nconstituents. I am going to stand with Iowans who have told me time and \nagain that their voices were not heard in this process and that their \nlivelihoods are being threatened.\n  Instead of listening to those who will be most impacted by this rule, \nthe EPA thought it would be better to use taxpayer dollars to illegally \nsolicit comments in an effort to falsely justify their power grab.\n  A little over a week ago, President Obama, in his State of the Union \nAddress, pledged a willingness to work with Congress on cutting \nredtape. This bipartisan legislation presented a great opportunity to \ndo just that, but instead he sided with unelected bureaucrats and an \nunchecked Federal agency. So apparently he must have already forgotten \nwhat he had said.\n  I would also like to remind everyone that in November, 11 of my \nDemocratic colleagues voted to uphold President Obama's rule at the \nbehest of liberal special interests. Then immediately they ran for \ncover by sending a letter warning the EPA that they may oppose the rule \nin the future if it is not fixed. Only in Washington could someone \nreserve the right to do their job at a later time. Here we are 3 months \nlater, and this rule is not fixed. Well, I say to those colleagues: \nToday is that later time. Join me in helping to fix this rule today.\n  In closing, we all want clean water. That is not disputable. I have \ncontinuously emphasized that the water we drink needs to be clean and \nsafe. However, this rule is not about clean water; it is a regulatory \npower grab that harms our farmers, ranchers, small businesses, \nmanufacturers, and homebuilders. Stand up for them today, not for a \nFederal agency gone wrong.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote to scrap this ill-conceived \nwaters of the United States expansion.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, by vetoing Senator Ernst's Congressional \nReview Act resolution, President Obama is ignoring the pleas of States, \nlocal governments, farmers, small businesses, and property owners all \nover this country. He is ignoring the conclusion of legal counsel for \nthe Corps of Engineers that the rule is ``inconsistent with the Supreme \nCourt's decisions in Rapanos and SWANCC.''\n  He is ignoring determinations by two Federal courts that EPA's \n``waters of the United States'' rule is likely illegal and therefore \nshould not go into effect until the 32 States that have sued to stop \nthis rule have their day in court. Finally, he is ignoring a legal \ndecision issued by the Government Accountability Office that, in \ndeveloping this rule, EPA broke the law.\n  According to GAO's December 14 decision, EPA's attempts to defend and \npromote their rule were not legitimate. In fact, GAO found that EPA's \nactions constituted illegal covert propaganda and grassroots lobbying. \nEPA conducted covert propaganda when they drafted a message of support \nfor the WOTUS rule and then convinced 980 people to send that message \nto their social media network. GAO estimates that this message reached \nabout 1.8 million people who had no idea that they were receiving a \nmessage that was written by EPA. In fact, the public was encouraged to \nsend the EPA-written message back to EPA--the ultimate echo chamber. \nThis is covert propaganda taken to a new extreme.\n  EPA engaged in grassroots lobbying activity when they posted messages \non their official government website that directed the public to visit \nthe websites of environmental activist groups who were soliciting \nopposition to congressional efforts to send this WOTUS rule back to the \ndrawing board. In fact, EPA linked their government website to ``action \nalerts'' issued by these activist groups.\n  Because EPA's covert propaganda and lobbying efforts are illegal, \nthey also violated the Anti-Deficiency Act. This act prohibits the \nunauthorized use of taxpayer dollars.\n  EPA issued a statement disagreeing with GAO, but their opinion is \nirrelevant. We live in a world of law. Federal agencies don't get to \ndecide what laws they chose to obey. EPA does not get to decide what \nconstitutes a violation of the ban on propaganda and lobbying. EPA does \nnot get to decide what constitutes a violation of the Anti-Deficiency \nAct. GAO does, and GAO has issued its legal decision.\n  If EPA continues with this illegal activity, they will do so knowing \nand in willful violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, and a knowing and \nwillful violation is a crime.\n  By vetoing S.J. Res. 22, President Obama is aligning himself with an \nillegal rule and is encouraging illegal agency activities and the \nunauthorized use of taxpayer dollars. This has to stop. No Member of \nthis body should associate himself or herself with these activities.\n  Please join me in voting to override this veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \noppose the joint resolution that we will be voting on shortly, to \nsupport the Clean Water Act, and to support the clean water rule.\n  I was listening to my colleagues. First, let me say that the basis of \nthe regulation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency is based \nupon the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act was passed by Congress \nbecause Congress recognized that it had a responsibility to the \nAmerican people for clean water. For public health reasons, for \neconomic reasons, for reasons of generations, we needed to make sure we \nhave clean water supplies for drinking, recreation, public health, and \nour environment. So the authority to issue this clean water rule comes \nfrom an act of Congress.\n  Administrations have been enforcing the Clean Water Act for many \nyears. It was fairly well understood--the waters of the United States--\nuntil there were a couple of Supreme Court cases. The Rapanos case was \nin 2006. It required further clarification; otherwise, decisions were \nmade on a case-by-case basis, giving great uncertainty as to what is \ncovered and what is not covered. That was a decade ago. Congress could \nhave acted during that decade, but Congress chose not to act. We could \nhave clarified the law and therefore given EPA specific instructions, \nbut instead the uncertainty has remained.\n  I have often listened to my colleagues talk about how one of the most \ndemanding problems we have is that we create uncertainty--a short-term \nextension of tax provisions, a short-term CR--that we don't give \npredictability, and that is one of the things we need to do. For \nfarmers and ranchers and developers and the American people to be able \nto take full advantage of the opportunities of this country, they need \nto know the ground rules.\n  That is exactly what this clean water rule does. It sets the \nparameters of what is going to be regulated and what\n\n[[Page S146]]\n\nis not. It uses the prior application--before the Supreme Court cases--\nas its guideline. It does not pave new ground. It is basically what the \nstakeholders and the public thought was the law before the Supreme \nCourt cases, which added to the uncertainty.\n  If you listen to some of my colleagues, you would think they just \npulled this regulation out of thin air. They had over 400 meetings with \nstakeholders--a 2-year process. Millions of comments were reviewed \nbefore the final regulation was issued. So this went through a very \ndeliberative process.\n  First and foremost, it offers certainty on the application of the law \nand uses the prior application as the main way of determining what is \ncovered, and it rejects the case-by-case uncertainty that is under \nexisting law.\n  The rule protects public health, our environment, and our economy. \nLet me talk a little bit about that. One out of every three Americans \nwould be getting drinking water that would not be covered if we don't \nget the Clean Water Act in full application--67 percent of Marylanders.\n  There are millions of acres of wetlands that are at risk of not being \nregulated. Wetlands are critically important for flood protection in \nmany of our States, to recharge groundwater supplies--important to many \nof our States--to filter pollution. That is very important. It is \nimportant in Maryland. The Chesapeake Bay and the Chesapeake Bay's \nenvironmental future very much depend upon the quality of the upstream \nwaters and wetlands. It is at risk if we don't move forward with the \nfull application of the Clean Water Act.\n  It is certainly important for wildlife habitat. I hear all of my \nfriends talk about how important it is to preserve our wildlife. Well, \nthat is very much engaged in what we are talking about. It also deals \nwith our economy. Some of my colleagues have talked about that. \nCertainly I can talk about the wildlife recreation benefits in my State \nof Maryland--a $1.3 billion-a-year industry in Maryland and over $500 \nmillion in fishing alone. Well, let me tell you something. If you have \npolluted waters, you are going to lose your wildlife recreational \nindustry. It is critically important for recreation. I think my \ncolleagues understand that.\n  My colleagues talk about agriculture. Agriculture, of course, needs \nclean water. We would be the first to acknowledge that clean water is \nvery important to agriculture. As it relates to the agricultural \ncommunity, there are so many special exceptions in the clean water \nrule.\n  Let's at least be straight as to what is covered and what is not \ncovered. Many of the examples that have been given on the floor of the \nSenate are not covered bodies of water under the clean water rule that \nis being proposed.\n  The bottom line is that this rule is not only good for our \nenvironment, it is not only good to make sure people have safe drinking \nwater, it is not only good to make sure that we have clean streams, \nthat wetlands are protected, and that water bodies that flow into \nnavigable waters are protected so we have clean water for the purposes \nof our environment, but it is also important for our economy because of \nthe direct impact it would have, and it is important to many industries \nthat depend upon clean water supplies. Many of them are very much \ndependent upon clean water supplies in order to produce the products in \nagriculture that are critically important.\n  For the sake of our environment, for the sake of our economy, I urge \nmy colleagues to reject this resolution.\n  Let me add one last point. We are all proud Members of the Senate. We \nare all proud Members of this Congress. I would hope one of the \nlegacies we want to leave when this term is over is that we have added \nto the proud record of those who served before us in protecting our \nwaters and in protecting our air because that has been the legacy of \nthe Congresses before us--the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the \nChesapeake Bay Program, the Great Lakes. Congress was responsible for \nmany of these programs.\n  On the Chesapeake Bay, but for the actions of Congress, that program \nwould not be what it is today. The funds would not be there. We \ninitiated it. It was not even in the administration's budget. We did \nthat because we recognized that the Chesapeake Bay is a national \ntreasure, the largest estuary in our hemisphere. We understood that, so \nwe acted.\n  So what is going to be the legacy of this Congress? Is this going to \nbe a Congress that moves in the backward direction in protecting our \nclean water? I hope that is not the legacy of this Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to be on the right side of clean water, to be on \nthe right side of what Americans expect us to do and to protect the \nwater supply of our Nation and to vote against this joint resolution.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WADE DECISION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, thank you to my colleagues who are \njoining me here today and so many other efforts to stand up for women. \nThe 43rd anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic ruling in Roe v. \nWade is tomorrow. This is an important time to remember how much this \ndecision has meant for women's equality, opportunity, and health, why \nit is so important we continue defending the hard-won gains that women \nhave made, and why we need to keep pushing for continued progress.\n  For anyone who supports a woman's constitutionally protected right to \nmake her own health care choices, this has been a tough and trying \nCongress. To be honest, at the beginning of 2015, I gave my Republican \ncolleagues the benefit of the doubt. I hoped that in the majority, they \nmight focus more on governing and less on trying to get in between a \nwoman and her rights. Unfortunately, that didn't last long.\n  Since this Congress began, more than 80 bills have been introduced in \nCongress that would undermine a woman's constitutionally protected \nright to make her own choices about her own body. The House and Senate \nhave voted a total of 20 times on legislation to roll back women's \nhealth and rights.\n  That is not all. Republicans have pushed budget proposals that would \ndismantle the Affordable Care Act. After a summer of using deceptive, \nhighly edited videos to discredit Planned Parenthood and try to take \naway health care services that one in five women rely on over their \nlifetimes, the House has doubled down by launching a special \ninvestigative committee to keep up the political attacks. Of course \nsimilar efforts to undermine women's constitutionally protected health \ncare rights are underway across the country.\n  Nowhere is that clearer than in Texas, where an extreme anti-abortion \nlaw could force 75 percent of the clinics statewide to close. If that \nlaw stands, 900,000 women of child-bearing age will have to drive as \nfar as 300 miles round trip to get the health care they need.\n  To be clear, a right means nothing without the ability to exercise \nthat right. Laws like HB2 in Texas and many others like it across the \ncountry, driven by extreme conservative efforts to undermine women's \naccess to care, are without question getting in between women and their \nrights, especially the rights of women who can't afford to take off \nwork and drive hundreds of miles just to get health care.\n  Later this year, the Supreme Court will decide whether to uphold \nTexas's extreme anti-abortion law. In doing so, they will decide \nwhether women can act on the rights they are afforded in the \nConstitution. This law puts women's lives at risk. It is the biggest \nthreat to women's constitutional rights in over a decade. That is why I \nam working with many of my Democratic colleagues to call on the Supreme \nCourt to uphold Roe v. Wade and protect a woman's right to make her own \nhealth care decisions.\n  Today, as we head into a year that is absolutely critical for women, \nI have a message for those who want to turn back the clock. Those \nefforts to undermine women's health care are nothing new. Women have \nbeen fighting them for generations, and we are going to keep fighting \nback today. We are not going to go back to the days when because women \nhad less control over their own bodies, they had less equality and less \nopportunity.\n  As we defend the progress we have made, we will keep pushing for \nmore, from continuing to expand access so that where a woman lives \ndoesn't determine what health care she can get to expanding access to \naffordable birth control and family planning, to fighting back against \ndomestic violence and sexual assault, which disproportionately impacts \nwomen.\n  We are going to keep pushing for progress because we believe strongly \nthat the next generation of women--our daughters and our \ngranddaughters--should have stronger rights and more opportunity, not \nless.\n  My colleagues and I in the Senate are going to keep working hard \nevery day to bring women's voices to the Senate floor and show that \nwhen women are stronger, our country is stronger. Let's keep up the \nfight.\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Roe v. Wade became law of the land \n43 years ago, taking women out of the back alleys and promising them \nthe fundamental right to make their own choices about their health care \nand their futures.\n  As we mark this milestone, the GOP and their extreme allies are doing \neverything in their power to take away that promise. Since 2010, States \nhave passed 288 new laws that are designed to place barrier upon \nbarrier between women and their critical health care. These laws have \npiled on outrageous requirements for clinics, providers and the women \nthey serve--making it harder for women to get the care they need.\n  Texas's extreme law, HB2, is no different. The Supreme Court recently \nagreed to hear Whole Women's Health v. Cole, a case challenging HB2, \nwhich is designed to close health clinics that provide safe, legal \nabortions. Its proponents claim to be protecting women. In what \nuniverse is it ``protecting'' women by making it harder for them to \naccess critical health care?\n  The answer, of course, is it's not.\n  This law targets women's health care providers with intentionally \nburdensome requirements such as mandating that physicians gain \nadmitting privileges at hospitals within a 30-mile radius of where they \npractice--a provision that has already forced more than half the \nclinics in Texas to close.\n  And let's be clear: that is their goal--to shut down clinics and deny \nrights. If HB2 is upheld, it would reduce the number of providers from \n40 to 10. Ten clinics for the second largest State in the country. This \nwould force women to travel for hours or even to another State for \ncare.\n  That is exactly what happened to Austin resident Marni, who was \nforced to fly to Seattle when her procedure was cancelled the night \nbefore it was scheduled because the clinic was forced to immediately \ndiscontinue providing these services after HB2 took effect. Muni said \nher first reaction was ``to feel like my rights were being taken away \nfrom me, to feel very disappointed that elected officials had the \nability to make decisions about my and my fiance's life.''\n  In some cases, forcing women to delay or cancel procedures could \nendanger their health and lives.\n  Vikki is a diabetic who discovered months into her pregnancy that the \nfetus she was carrying suffered from several major anomalies and had no \nchance of survival. Because of Vikki's diabetes, her doctor determined \nthat induced labor and Caesarian section were both riskier procedures \nfor Vikki than an abortion. Fortunately, Vikki lived in a State where \nshe was able to have the procedure she needed to protect her life and \nensure she could have children in the future.\n  But GOP-led state legislatures are doing everything they can to pass \nlaws designed to deny care to women like Vikki. There are currently \nlaws across the country to: Ban abortions; Restrict the use of the \nabortion pill; Ban the use of telemedicine--which allows doctors to \ntreat patients who live far away or in rural areas and prescribe \nabortion medication; Require women to wait a certain time between their \nfirst doctor's visit and their procedure; and Require women go through \nmandatory counseling and even require an ultrasound in which medical \npersonnel describe the image of the fetus to the patient.\n  This crusade is also about denying access to family planning. Yes, in \nthe\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\nyear 2016, Republicans and their extreme allies are still on a crusade \nagainst contraception, which the Supreme Court deemed legal 50 years \nago.\n  This is despite the fact that we know contraceptives are the best way \nto decrease unintended pregnancies and abortions.\n  This is despite the fact that 99 percent of American women who have \never been sexually active have used at least one contraceptive method--\nand not just to plan their families. Fifty-eight percent of women who \ntake birth control do so at least in part to treat painful and \ndifficult medical conditions. Of those, 1.5 million women take it \nsolely as a medication to treat those conditions.\n  They are women like Sandra from Los Angeles, who suffers from \npolycystic ovary syndrome and has used birth control since the age of \n18 to treat her condition, which could otherwise render her infertile \nand put her at higher risk for complications like heart disease, \ndiabetes, and cancer. For women like Sandra, access to birth control is \nessential.\n  In fact, contraception has had such a dramatic impact on women and \nfamilies in this country that the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention declared it one of the greatest public health achievements \nof the 20th century. A 2012 study also found that access to affordable \nbirth control led to a decline in teen births and reduced the rate of \nabortions by one-half, which is a goal we all should share.\n  So while many of us fight to expand access to affordable birth \ncontrol, the GOP is trying to make contraception more expensive and \nharder to get.\n  Ironically, so many of those who want to overturn Roe and deny access \nto contraceptives are the same people who say they want limited \ngovernment. There is nothing limited about inserting the government \nbetween a woman, her family and their most personal health care \ndecisions.\n  This is the opposite of limited government--and it is wrong and \ndangerous. Leaving women with no other option for health care may force \nthem to take matters into their own hands--and in Texas, it is already \nhappening. A recent study by the University of Texas found that as many \nas 210,000 women tried to end their own pregnancies since HB2 took \neffect in 2013.\n  We cannot go back to the days of back alley abortions.\n  We cannot undermine the promise Roe made to women 43 years ago.\n  In the 21st century, we cannot deny women access to family planning \nand other reproductive care.\n  But that is exactly what the GOP and their right-wing allies are \ntrying to do.\n  These shameful attacks are trying to take away the real, legal health \ncare that millions of women depend on. This is a fight that has been \npicked before. We have won it before, and we will win it again.\n  We will fight this assault on women's health.\n  We will fight to make sure that women across America can continue to \nget the services they need--and deserve.\n  And, we will make sure the promise of Roe v. Wade is protected for \nthe next generation of women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise to mark the anniversary of Roe v. \nWade. Forty-three years ago, within the lifetime of most of us here, \nthe Supreme Court's decision effectively reversed draconian State laws \nprohibiting abortion and gave women power over their own health care \ndecisions.\n  Before Roe v. Wade, nearly 5,000 American women died every year \nseeking abortion care that was legally not available to them. That \nnumber dramatically dropped after the decision because women were able \nto get abortion care from trained medical professionals legally, out in \nthe open. The Court found that a woman's right to access abortion care \nis a fundamental constitutional right. While as with many \nconstitutional rights, not totally unfettered, this decision enabled \nwomen to gain control over their own bodies and in turn their futures.\n  If the government interfered in other patient-doctor decisions the \nway that State and local governments have interfered with women's \nreproductive rights, there would be a national uproar. Why is it \ndifferent when we talk about a woman's body as opposed to a man's? Can \nyou imagine if States passed laws restricting fundamental decisions \nabout a man's medical care? Why is it that women have to defend deeply \npersonal decisions over our own bodies in court and in legislatures?\n  I recognize that there are deeply held beliefs by good people on both \nsides of this issue, which is why the right to choose should be left to \nthe individual woman and her doctor. Yet ever since the Roe v. Wade \ndecision, State and Federal lawmakers have attempted to chip away at a \nwoman's right to make her own health care decisions.\n  Hundreds of laws have been passed by States to place limitations and \nroadblocks to a woman's right to choose. Restrictions such as mandatory \ndelays, unduly burdensome regulations, and unscientific 20-week bans \nare all attempts to undermine Roe v. Wade.\n  In Congress we continue to see unprecedented attacks on women's \nreproductive health--destructive policy riders in spending bills, \nattacks on providers, and efforts to reduce women's access to health \ncare services--all in the name of prohibiting abortions.\n  These attempts are not based on facts or science. They do not advance \nany public policy goals in the interest of women, which is why many of \nus characterize these efforts as part of a deeply anti-women agenda. \nMoreover, these restrictions disproportionately impact women of color \nand low-income women. Apparently, it is not enough to remove funding \nfrom reproductive services. The anti-women agenda includes reducing \nfunding from maternal health programs and services for infants and \nchildren.\n  The lawmakers writing these restrictions are not the ones who will \nhave to live with their negative consequences. It is the women across \nthe country who will have to live with these consequences.\n  Of course, the legal battles continue. For example, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt will be hearing arguments later this year on a Texas law that \nseverely restricts the ability of a woman to access safe reproductive \nhealth care. My colleague from Washington touched on the problems and \nchallenges that this Texas law imposes. This law, which \ndisproportionately impacts low-income women, has already severely \naffected the ability of women in Texas to get the reproductive care \nthey need. The rhetoric around this case, as well as the rhetoric \nemployed by abortion foes, has become increasingly dangerous, leading \nto attacks on providers, clinics, and women seeking care.\n  I hope we can all agree to not return to the pre-Roe v. Wade \nlandscape, where women endangered their lives seeking reproductive care \nand thousands died doing so. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nensuring that women can continue to control their own destinies for the \nnext 43 years and beyond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, tomorrow marks the 43rd anniversary of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade recognizing a woman's \nconstitutional right to liberty and personal autonomy in her decision \nof whether to have an abortion or not. This landmark case not only \nrecognizes those rights, but it is also responsible for saving \ncountless women across the country from the devastating and deadly \noutcomes of back-alley abortions. I want to speak to that because I \nhave some personal knowledge here.\n  I was a young State's attorney in Vermont before Roe v. Wade, and I \nwill never forget getting a call in the middle of the night from the \npolice and going with them to the emergency room of the local hospital. \nThe young woman who was there had nearly died from an unsafe, illegal \nabortion because she could not legally receive that care from a doctor. \nI want to speak of that tragic history today because I feel the current \neffort in many States to roll back Roe v. Wade by denying women access \nto doctors could drag women back to those dark and dangerous times.\n\n[[Page S149]]\n\n  In the years leading up to the Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade, \nI was the State's attorney in Chittenden County, VT. Abortion was \nillegal in my State of Vermont. Despite the State ban, many women \ndesperately needed and sought this medical care, and some doctors \nrisked their freedom and livelihood by providing women with abortions \nat local hospitals. These were safe abortions in medical facilities \nthat saved women's lives and protected their health. Knowing this, I \nmade it clear to the doctors in my county that I would not prosecute \nany of them for providing this medical attention to women in a medical \nfacility. I did, however, prosecute to the full extent of the law \nothers who preyed upon women's fear and desperation by extorting them \nfor unsafe, back-alley abortions.\n  There are 100 Senators in this body. I am the only U.S. Senator who \nhas ever prosecuted somebody in an abortion case. I vividly remember \nthat horrific case. It was the spring of 1968, and I was called to the \nhospital to see this young woman, as I mentioned. She had nearly died \nfrom hemorrhaging caused by the botched abortion. I prosecuted the man \nwho had arranged for the unsafe and illegal abortion that nearly killed \nher.\n  After that case and after witnessing firsthand the tragic impact that \nthe lack of safe and legal abortion care had on women and families in \nmy State, I talked to the local doctors about challenging Vermont's \nabortion law. A year later, a group of women and doctors brought a \nclass action case to overturn the law. The case was styled as a suit \nagainst me as a State prosecutor, but this was a test case against the \nlaw, and I publicly welcomed the case. Even when the office of the \nState attorney general told me that it lacked resources to devote to \nany defense in this case, I decided to file briefs of my own, but the \ncase was unable to proceed because none of the plaintiffs were seeking \nabortions at the time. The particular nature of the constitutional \nclaim to abortion, which by its nature is a time-limited claim, made it \nextremely difficult to bring actionable cases before the courts. But \nlater that same year, we got another chance.\n  The case in which I represented the State and did the briefs was \nBeecham v. Leahy, and it quickly made its way to the Vermont supreme \ncourt. At that time, our State's high court was composed entirely of \nRepublicans, but these conservative justices understood what we had \nbeen arguing all along--that a statute whose stated purpose was to \nprotect women's health, yet denied women access to doctors for their \nmedical care, was sheer and dangerous hypocrisy. The court's opinion \nrightly questioned: Where is that concern for the health of a pregnant \nwoman when she is denied the advice and assistance of her doctors? The \ncourt's ruling in Beecham v. Leahy, that protecting women's health for \nrequired access to safe and legal abortions, ensured that the women of \nVermont would no longer be subjected to the horrors of back-alley \nabortions. It was a victory for women's health in Vermont. Even though \nthe attorney general moved for reargument, I told the court as the \nState's attorney that I had no objection to the ruling and concurred \nwith it.\n  A year later the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade held what is now \nthe law of the land. Women have a constitutional right to their \nautonomy and bodily integrity that protects their decision to have an \nabortion and to make that decision with their doctors.\n  I recount this history not just to mark another year of women's \nrights and safety under both Roe v. Wade and Beecham v. Leahy, but also \nto connect the history to the attack today on women's access to safe \nand legal abortions that are threatening to take us back to those \ntimes. States looking to roll back women's rights have returned to \npenalizing doctors to deter them from providing women with safe health \ncare. What I find most appalling is that States that are passing these \nlaws claiming they somehow protect women's health. Yet these laws have \nnothing to do with women's health, and they have everything to do with \nshutting down women's access to safe and legal abortion. When you deny \nwomen access to doctors for medical services, you deny them their \nconstitutional rights. You also deny them their safety and, in some \ncases, their lives. This is a fact that legislators passing these laws \neither callously ignore or willfully choose not to hear.\n\n  I still remember that case as though it was yesterday. I still \nremember that young woman, and I still remember the history of the \nperson who was performing those illegal abortions. That is why I joined \nan amicus brief with 37 other Senators and 124 Members of the House in \nthe Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt case currently before the \nSupreme Court. Our brief urges the Court to overturn a State law that \nrequires doctors who provide abortions to meet onerous restrictions \nthat apply to no other medical procedures and are completely unrelated \nto protecting women's health.\n  The Texas law at issue would have the effect of shuttering 75 percent \nof all women's health clinics that provide abortion services in the \nState if the full law were implemented, as well as possibly shuttering \nall the other services they provide. Already, parts of the law in \neffect have had a devastating impact on women's health. As a University \nof Texas study of women showed, after the law went into effect, an \nestimated 100,000 to 240,000 women have tried to end their pregnancies \non their own without seeking medical attention. The study found that \nwomen, with nowhere to turn, resorted to herbs, illicit drugs, and even \nself-harm.\n  That this law was passed under the pretense of women's health is a \ntravesty, and it should be struck down. The Supreme Court Justices \ncannot ignore the impact upholding this State law will have on hundreds \nof thousands of women in Texas and across the Nation.\n  When I see these efforts to prevent women's access to safe and legal \nmedical services, I think about all the young women in Vermont who have \ngrown up knowing only that the U.S. Constitution and the Vermont \nConstitution protects their liberty and also recognizes that they are \ncapable of deciding for themselves matters that control their lives and \ntheir destiny. I hope they and the generations after them never \nexperience otherwise from the Supreme Court.\n  I will speak further on this subject another time, but when I think \nabout what that young woman in Vermont turned to, I am glad our case to \nuphold our Constitution's right to privacy, Beecham v. Leahy, is on the \nbooks. I applaud the very conservative, very Republican Supreme Court \nJustices who wrote it in a nearly unanimous opinion.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I join my fellow Georgians in congratulating Zippy \non this honor and look forward to working with him in this new role.\n  Zippy, as he is affectionately known--and that is his real name--\nfirst became a member of the Farm Bureau in 1977. He is a third-\ngeneration dairy farmer and currently maintains a beef cow herd and \npoultry production operation. To the Duvalls, farming is a business, a \nlifestyle, and a proud family tradition. As a dairyman, Zippy is \naccustomed to hard work, and he will be a tireless champion for the \nagricultural industry. He understands the importance of a safe and \nabundant food supply for consumers across the Nation and globe.\n  Zippy traveled over 55,000 miles and visited 29 States to meet with \nAmericans and discuss his vision for the future of American \nagriculture. He heard from farmers and ranchers across our country--\njust as we have in the Senate--that something has to be done to defend \ncitizens against a runaway government. From taking action against the \nEPA's power grab of our Nation's water, to promoting a climate of \nabundant trade and supporting a safety\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\nnet--not a guarantee on farm prices--to pursuing policies that enhance \nthe availability and affordability of all energy resources, I am glad \nto know Zippy Duvall will be leading in these and many other areas.\n  Agriculture is a strategic industry not only for Georgia but also for \nour Nation. I join our country's farmers and ranchers in the pursuit of \na strong, safe, and abundant industry. Our kids and our grandkids \ndepend on this. I am very confident that with leaders like Zippy, we \ncan actually do this.\n  Congratulations to Zippy, his wife Bonnie, and the entire Duvall \nfamily as they begin this exciting chapter together. This election is a \ngreat victory not only for Georgia but also for all of agriculture. I \nlook forward to working with Zippy and the members of the American Farm \nBureau Federation to promote a strong, safe, and abundant future for \nour agricultural industry in the United States.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to thank and congratulate my \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee colleagues on the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act. This legislation will now join the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee's sportsmen's package that was approved \nlast fall. I hope this legislation can now swiftly advance to the \nSenate floor for consideration and approval.\n  As a member of the EPW Committee and vice chair of the Congressional \nSportsmen's Caucus, I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my \ncolleagues on legislation to promote our country's hunting, fishing, \nand conservation heritage. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act includes a \nbroad array of bipartisan measures that enhance opportunities for \nhunters, anglers, and outdoor recreation enthusiasts by preserving our \nNation's rich outdoor heritage.\n  This bill also expands and enhances hunting and fishing opportunities \non Federal lands by establishing a more open policy for recreational \nactivities to gain access on public lands. The bill also provides \nStates with more flexibility to build and maintain public shooting \nranges, allowing greater opportunities for more Americans to engage in \nrecreational and competitive shooting activities.\n  It prevents groups from restricting ammunition choices, which would \nunnecessarily drive up costs, hurt participation in shooting sports, \nand consequently decrease important conservation funding. I am \nespecially encouraged by the fact that this bill includes a bipartisan \namendment which is identical to the Sensible Environmental Protection \nAct that I promoted with Senators Carper and Crapo. It targets the \nduplicative permitting of pesticides under FIFRA and the Clean Water \nAct.\n  This duplicative process has created unnecessary burdens on resources \nfor pesticide users such as private homeowners, businesses, golf \ncourses, local water, and natural resource authorities, and of course \nthe sportsmen's community.\n  All across the country sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts utilize \npesticides for critical habitat management by suppressing harmful pests \nand vector-borne diseases, which threaten outdoor activities of all \nkinds. Eliminating harmful and invasive pests is crucial to vegetation \nand ecosystem management.\n  This legislation clarifies that the NPDES permits should not be \nrequired for the application of pesticides that are already approved by \nthe EPA authorized for sale, distribution or use under FIFRA. These \nproducts benefit outdoor recreation enthusiasts by protecting and \nmaintaining natural habitats.\n  Another priority that I championed increases transparency for the \nJudgment Fund. This provision will help our efforts to track taxpayer-\nfunded litigation that impacts public lands policies. As my colleagues \nmay know, the Judgment Fund is administered by the Treasury Department \nand is used to pay certain court judgments and settlements against the \nFederal Government. Essentially, this fund is an unlimited amount of \ntaxpayer dollars which is set aside for Federal Government liability.\n  The Judgment Fund is not subject to the annual appropriations \nprocess, and even more remarkably, the Treasury Department has no \nreporting requirements so these funds are paid out with very little \noversight or scrutiny. This is no small matter, as the Judgment Fund \ndisburses billions of dollars in payments every year. Since the \nTreasury Department is not bound by reporting requirements, few public \ndetails exist about where the funds are going and why.\n  The Public Lands Council has denounced the lack of oversight of the \nJudgment Fund, stating that ``certain groups continuously sue the \nFederal Government and Treasury simply writes a check to foot the bill \nwithout providing Members of Congress and American taxpayers basic \ninformation about the payment.'' This kind of litigation can have a \nmajor impact on sportsmen and others who enjoy multiple uses of Federal \nlands. A GAO report regarding cases filed against the EPA showed a \ndisturbing pattern where groups and big law firms are suing under the \nsame statutes to push a political agenda through the courts. The \nlegislation I introduced with Senator Gardner, known as the Judgment \nFund Transparency Act, has been included as a provision in ENR's \nSportmen's Act. It will bring these cases to light. Simply put, more \ntransparency leads to greater accountability.\n  Members of Congress have worked hard on the Bipartisan Sportmen's Act \nfor the last 6 years. It is time for the Senate to take action. We have \nthe opportunity to provide the sportsmen's community with the certainty \nthat they need to allow important conservation work to thrive without \nfear of destructive Federal redtape.\n  I am proud to be the vice chair of the Sportsmen's Caucus, and I look \nforward to continuing our work to advance these important legislative \nmeasures.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WADE DECISION\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I come to the floor on two issues of \ngreat importance to our Nation, both involving the rights and \nopportunities of individuals to live in the greatest, strongest Nation \nin the history of the world, with the tremendous opportunity to fulfill \ntheir dreams and their rights--rights to enhance themselves and rights \nof privacy.\n  Tomorrow we will celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the Supreme Court \ndecision Roe v. Wade. As I recall well from my days as a law clerk to \nJustice Blackmun in the term following Roe v. Wade, that was a bitterly \ncontroversial decision, but it was one that we thought at the time \nwould assure every woman of her constitutional right to make her own \ndecision about whether and when to have a child, based on the \nfundamental right of privacy that decision enshrined and expressed and \nprotected.\n  Unfortunately, those great hopes have been dashed. Over the last four \ndecades, this constitutional right to reproductive care has been under \nattack throughout this country. Rather than advancing the health and \nwell-being of women, legislators in a lot of States, and even in the \nFederal Government, have put themselves squarely between women and \ntheir health care providers, denying that fundamental right of choice \nthat Roe v. Wade guaranteed.\n  That practical reality means that Roe v. Wade has been far less \neffective\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\nthan it could and should have been, because those opponents have \nadvocated and implemented dangerous laws that undermine and violate a \nwoman's right to privacy and diminish her access to constitutionally \nguaranteed reproductive health care services. These restrictions fall \ndisproportionately on minorities and many who live in rural or \nmedically underserved areas. I have great respect for my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, but we are jeopardizing the health care \nnecessary for millions and millions of women and their right to privacy \nin this great country.\n  I have introduced a measure that would help prevent these violations \nof rights at the State level. The Women's Health Protection Act would \ninvalidate not only extreme laws such as the Texas law that is now \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court but dozens of other restrictive \nlegislative steps that States have implemented and introduced to block \nwomen from accessing safe and legal health care.\n  I am happy to celebrate this anniversary of Roe v. Wade, but I think \nit is a moment to rededicate ourselves to the continuing task, more \nurgent and difficult than ever, to enable every woman to have the right \nof privacy, the right to make decisions about her own body, about \nwhether and when to have children, and that fundamental right can help \nmake abortion safe, legal, and rare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S151-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S151-S152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEBT-FREE COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I wish to speak now about what \nshould be a right for young people and all people in this country, \nwhich is the goal of debt-free college.\n  Over the last months, I have held roundtables around the State of \nConnecticut--all around our State--with young people at the college as \nwell as high school level who are in danger of losing the American \ndream--their dreams, their choices about where they want to go to \nschool, because college for them has become unaffordable. For many who \nhave already been to school, the debt is crushing--in fact, financially \ncrippling. It is approaching $1.3 trillion, which affects not only \nthose students who have graduated and who may be seeking to go to \ncollege but also our entire economy. Someone graduating from college \nwith $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 or $100,000 of debt and then from \ngraduate school or law school or business school with that same kind of \nfinancial burden can't save for retirement, can't start a family, can't \nbuy a home, can't begin a business that may employ people.\n  College affordability is essential to creating jobs and advancing and \nfueling economic growth. It is an engine of economic growth. It \nenhances the talents and the gifts that young people bring to the \neconomy. It provides the skills that are needed now on the assembly \nline and in business. I encounter businesses across Connecticut--and I \nam sure it is true across the country--that tell me: We have jobs, we \ncan't fill them, and we can't find young people with the right skills. \nThat is why our community colleges play such an important role in our \neducational system.\n  The agenda that we have announced today as a caucus will meet this \nneed in a number of important ways. It will make 2 years of community \ncollege tuition-free. It will enable students to refinance their debt \nwhen interest rates are lower, as they can now with a loan for a car or \na loan for a home, but not for a Federal loan. It will assure that \npeople are enabled a more affordable education by holding colleges \naccountable and make them responsible for the levels of debt their \nstudents incur, because they should be held accountable when those \ndebts default.\n  It will take those measures and others that are part of a \ncomprehensive agenda that will advance the affordability of college and \nmake debt less burdensome, but it will also expand the availability of \nPell grants and take other measures that will make debt less necessary, \nbecause the goal should be debt-free college.\n  Our ultimate aspiration is debt-free college. We are beginning with \ncommunity colleges that are tuition free, but the ultimate goal ought \nto be debt-free college. That will require expanding Pell grants and \nother scholarship aids and financial assistance programs that now are \navailable but simply unacceptably in too small amounts.\n  I have two measures that I have offered on my own to be taken as part \nof this total program although they are not part of the act. One would \nrecognize students for the public service they perform. If they become \nfirefighters or police officers or work at the YMCA or in local \ngovernment, their community service ought to be recognized by reducing \nthe debt they owe, not just at the end of 10 years as happens now but \nyear by year, pro rata; not just if they stay in the same job but if \nthey move from one job to another or even have to move homes, go across \nState lines, expanding the availability of public service recognition \nand credit to reduce college debt. It is much in the spirit of the GI \nBill. I hope we will move forward to expand the availability of debt \nrecognition and reduction for public service.\n  I also hope that when our needier students receive assistance for \nroom and board when they go to college, they will not be taxed on that \nassistance. That happens now. Why should they be taxed on the room and \nboard they need and that assistance to go to college? That is wrong. \nAnd scandalously and outrageously, it is wrong that the U.S. Government \nmakes money off the backs of our students. We should be investing in \none of the greatest assets in a democracy--people who want to raise \ntheir skills and talents and education so they can better serve not \njust in the public sector but in the business world, so they can help \ncreate jobs themselves and become the entrepreneurs and the job \ncreators. They can't do it if they are burdened with tens of \nthousands--some hundreds of thousands--in debt. The present levels of \ndebt are a disservice to our Nation. They inhibit freedom, they \nundercut opportunity, and they destroy dreams.\n  Some of the most moving moments of my roundtables with young people \nare to hear them describe how they could not attend their dream school. \nThey called their first choice their dream school and the reason it was \ntheir dream school is because they could pursue engineering or nursing \nor marketing or other kinds of vitally important skills at that place \nin the best way possible. That was their dream school not because the \nweather was good or because their friends were there but because the \nskill levels and the education offered was exactly the right fit for \ntheir aspirations. Some cried as they described the unbridgeable gap \nbetween what they could afford and what the school charged. With what \nthey could afford--even with financial aid, even with help from their \nfamilies, and even with debt--they still faced an unbridgeable gap. And \nthose dreams dashed, deferred, destroyed for those students are a \nnational tragedy. For them, it will shape their futures, although I \nhave great confidence that their drive and perseverance will enable \nthem to achieve great things. But for our Nation, it means a deferring \nand diminishing of our economy and our national quality of life.\n  We are the strongest, greatest Nation in the history of the world \nbecause we provide more opportunity and more freedom than any other \ncountry. We are stronger because of our diversity and because we create \nand we reward the dreamers who have the strength and the ability to set \nhigh standards, to aspire to be the best, and to want an education that \nenables them to achieve those goals.\n  The current levels of college debt are inconsistent with who we are \nas a Nation. That is why I am proud today to join my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle and to say to our friends across the way: Join us. \nLet's make it bipartisan. If you have a plan, if you have ideas, if you \nthink there are other ways to accomplish things, let's work together, \nbecause those students, their families, our Nation, the businesses that \nare creating jobs and want these young people to fill them so we can \ndrive the economy forward all depend on us working together, reaching \nacross the aisle and making sure that we enable every person, every \nstudent who wants to go to college to fulfill that dream without the \nfinancially crushing burden of current levels of debt.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have a problem--money. Six years ago \ntoday, the U.S. Supreme Court made the problem worse, a lot worse. \nThanks to the Supreme Court, our system of elections is riddled with \ncorruption. Money floods our political system--money that lets a \nhandful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress and may decide who \nsits in the White House.\n  As Congress has become more beholden to billionaires and less worried \nabout the American people, look at what has happened in Washington. \nArmies of lawyers and lobbyists flood the hallways of Congress and \nregulatory agencies, urging just a little tilt for every law and every \nrule--a sentence here, an exception there, and always tilted in favor \nof the rich and powerful. Corporate executives and government officials \nspin through the revolving door, making sure the interests of powerful \ncorporations are always carefully protected. Powerful Wall Street \nbusinesses pay barely disguised bribes, offering millions of dollars to \ntrusted employees to go to Washington for a few years to make policies \nthat will benefit exactly those same Wall Street businesses. \nCorporations and trade groups fund study after study that just so \nhappen to support the special rule or the exception that the industry \nis looking for.\n  Washington works great for a handful of wealthy individuals and \npowerful corporations that manipulate the system to benefit themselves. \nIt works great for the lobbyists and the lawyers who slither around \nWashington day in and day out, handsomely paid to troll for special \ndeals for those who pay them. But for everyone else, Washington is not \nworking so well, and if we don't change that, this rigged political \ngame will break our country.\n  Change is needed in many areas, but we can start with how we fund \nelections. In 2012, about 3.7 million Americans gave modest donations--\nunder $200--to President Obama and Mitt Romney. Those donations added \nup to $313 million. In the same election, 32 people gave monster \ndonations to super PACs. Thirty-two people spent slightly more on the \n2012 elections than the 3.7 million people who sent modest dollar \ndonations to their preferred Presidential candidates. When 32 people \ncan outspend 3.7 million citizens, it is pretty obvious that democracy \nis in real danger.\n  We are headed into another Presidential election, and I speak out \ntoday because I am genuinely alarmed for our democracy. I am genuinely \nalarmed because 6 years ago today the U.S. Supreme Court said that the \nprivileged few are entitled under the Constitution to spend billions of \ndollars to swing elections and buy off legislators. Six years ago today \nthe U.S. Supreme Court overturned a century of established law and in \ndoing so unleashed a flood of secret corporate money into our political \nsystem.\n  The Supreme Court created a big problem, but that does not mean that \nanyone with any integrity must just roll over and play dead. No, it is \ntime to fight back. Sure, the Supreme Court has a lot of power, and, \nyes, they have used it to do a huge amount of damage. But even under \nthe Supreme Court ruling there is room to fight back against the \ncomplete capture of our government by the rich and powerful.\n  Let's start right here with three examples of what this Congress \ncould do right now today--what this Congress could do if we had the \npolitical courage to stand up to the superwealthy few and a handful of \ncorporations.\n  No. 1, pass Senator Durbin's Fair Elections Now Act. This legislation \nwould create public funding for congressional elections. Imagine the \ncontributions of small donors so working families would have a louder \nvoice and could begin to compete with the rich and powerful. This is a \nbipartisan solution--well, at least bipartisan outside Washington. \nAccording to a recent poll, Democrats and Republicans both agreed \nstrongly with the idea of citizen-funded elections; 72 percent of \nDemocrats and 62 percent of Republicans said yes.\n  No. 2, pass the DISCLOSE Act, Senator Whitehouse's bill to force \nsuper PACs out of the shadows and make them tell where the money comes \nfrom. According to that same poll, 91 percent of Democrats and 91 \npercent of Republicans agree that super PACs and other special \ninterests should have to disclose the source of their funding.\n  No. 3, pass the Shareholder Protection Act, Senator Menendez's bill \nto force companies to tell their shareholders how much money they are \ngiving to politicians and which politicians they are giving it to. This \nis the shareholders' money, and they have a right to know how it is \nspent. If they don't like how the money is being spent, they can put \nsomebody else in charge.\n  Those are three things Congress could do right now, but there is even \nmore.\n  No. 4, the President could finalize an Executive order requiring \ngovernment contractors to disclose their political spending. Why should \ncompanies that do business with the government be allowed to give money \nin secret to benefit elected officials? Seventy-eight percent of \nDemocrats and 66 percent of Republicans want to see this done.\n  No. 5, the SEC has the authority right now to begin to put together \nrules that would require opinion corporations to disclose the money \nthey spent in elections. Despite Republican efforts to try to block \nthis rule through a rider in the recent government funding bill, legal \nexperts agree that the agency still has all the authority it needs to \nprepare a disclosure rule.\n  The public demands action. The SEC has received more than a million \ncomments from the people across this country urging the agency to issue \nthis rule--88 percent of Democrats and 88 percent of Republicans. That \nis right, 88 percent of both sides support public disclosure of \npolitical spending.\n  Three former SEC Commissioners, one Republican, two Democrats, wrote \na public letter to Chair Mary Jo White urging her to adopt this rule. \nIt is time for the agency to stop making excuses and start doing its \njob.\n  No. 6, the FEC has the authority right now to require ads run by \nsuper PACs include disclosure of the main people or corporations that \npaid for them. If they want to run the country, then the billionaires \nshouldn't be allowed to hide in the shadows. Make them step out in the \nopen where the American people can see who is calling the shots.\n  There is one more step we can take, a full-blown constitutional \namendment, such as the one pushed forward by my colleague Senator Udall \nto restore authority to Congress and to the States.\n  I have to say, I am reluctant to take on a constitutional amendment, \nbut we need to defend our great democracy against those who would see \nit perverted into one more rigged game where the rich and the powerful \nalways win, and that means taking every step possible, including \namending the Constitution.\n  These are six ideas that would help bring an end to a corrupt \npolitical system; six ideas that Congress, the administration, the SEC, \nand the FCC could put together right now.\n  A seventh idea is a constitutional amendment that we could begin \nworking on today. This Congress doesn't lack for workable ideas for how \nto root out the influence of money in politics. This Congress just \nlacks a spine to do it.\n  Six years ago the U.S. Supreme Court turned loose a flood of hidden \nmoney that is about to drown our democracy. We can blame the Supreme \nCourt--heck, we should blame the Supreme Court, but that is no excuse \nfor doing nothing.\n  A new Presidential election is upon us. The first votes will be cast \nin Iowa in just 11 days. Anyone who shrugs and claims that change is \njust too hard has crawled into bed with the billionaires who want to \nrun this country like some private club. All of us were sent here to do \nour best to make government work--to make it work not just for those at \nthe top but to make government work for all people, and it is time we \nstart acting like it.\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S153-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE CO-OPS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, earlier today I attended two hearings. \nOne was held by the Senate Finance Committee on Consumer Operated and \nOriented Plans, or CO-OPs, created by the Affordable Care Act. The \nother was held by the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where \nSecretary McDonald, a son of Ohio, detailed his plan to modernize the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  Both of these hearings are a strong reminder of the importance of \ngovernment in supporting public health and access to health care and \nservices. We know the Veterans' Administration, with all its problems \ntoday, has provided extraordinary health care for millions of veterans \nall across our country for decades. It doesn't mean we sit back and \ndon't make very important improvements that are necessary at the VA.\n  When we learned that shocking wait times at the VA were delaying \nveterans from getting the care they have earned, we took action and \npassed a new law to invest in better care and provide more health care \nchoices to veterans, but we can't simply act in times of crisis and \nthen turn our backs on those who served in our Nation's military. It is \nour responsibility to make sure VA facilities in Ohio, Connecticut, the \nPresiding Officer's State of Iowa, and all over--it is important that \nthese facilities across the country have what they need to provide \nstate-of-the-art medical care for our veterans.\n  I have been struck by my time on the Veterans' Affairs Committee--I \nam the only Ohio Senator to ever sit on that committee for a full term. \nI am struck by how there are a whole lot of Members of Congress who are \nalways happy to appropriate billions of dollars to send our men and \nwomen to war, but then when it comes time to take care of them when \nthey come home, these same Members of Congress are not nearly as \ngenerous as let's say they were in sending them off to combat. That \nneeds to change.\n  The same is true for health insurance CO-OPs or CO-OPs that face \nchallenges. Twelve of these programs have failed. We can't sit back and \nlet the remaining 11 CO-OPs meet the same fate. That is why I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to make sure CMS understands the \nimportance and that they have the support and solvency they need to \nsucceed.\n  When it comes to providing quality health care, the Ohio CO-OP is a \nsuccess story worth telling. InHealth Mutual in Ohio covers \napproximately 25,000 people, 25,000 lives. It has enrolled individuals \nin each of Ohio's 88 counties. InHealth is doing some wonderful work, \nand it has taken it upon itself to be a major player in the community \nand in enhancing public health in Ohio.\n  One issue InHealth has chosen to highlight is health equity. InHealth \nis working to eliminate health disparities and is focusing on reducing \nbarriers to care through its InHealth Cares Program.\n  To that end, InHealth started a faith-based initiative called Project \nREACH to address health disparities. Three years ago at a Martin Luther \nKing celebration, a Martin Luther King breakfast in Cleveland, a \nminister told us something we perhaps already knew, but he said it so \npoignantly. He said: Your life expectancy is connected to your ZIP \nCode. Think about that. If you are born in Appalachia in Southeast Ohio \nor if you are born in East Cleveland versus if you are born in the more \naffluent suburbs of Shaker Heights or Bexley or Upper Arlington, your \nlife expectancy can literally be a difference of 20 years. Imagine \nthere are places in Cuyahoga County--one only 8 or 9 miles apart from \nthe other--where a baby born has a life expectancy of literally 24 \nyears less than a baby born in the more affluent suburb.\n  But one of the things these CO-OPs can do is--by involving trusted \nmembers of the faith community and focusing on issues such as infant \nmortality, asthma, and diabetes, InHealth is successfully utilizing key \ncommunity players to strategically improve access to care in minority \ncommunities across Ohio, but despite InHealth's current success, they \ncontinue to experience significant challenges.\n  Earlier today, the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services testified in front of our committee about the \nchallenges facing CO-OPs. At the hearing, many of my colleagues \nexpressed significant concerns about the closure of the 12 CO-OPs that \nhave pulled out of the market as well as the viability of the others \nthat remain. I share those concerns, and I urge the Acting \nAdministrator of CMS, Andy Slavitt, to work with Congress and the \nremaining CO-OPs, such as InHealth, to ensure their future viability. I \ncommend him on his performance at this morning's hearing. I hope the \ncommittee will take the appropriate steps to confirm him so he is no \nlonger an Acting Administrator but has the real job.\n  Congress and CMS must work together to find creative ways to ensure \nthese CO-OPs that are negatively affected by the lower than expected \nrisk corridor payments can find alternative ways to ensure financial \nstability.\n  We should work together to improve the current risk adjustment \ncalculation, which is currently designed to favor the larger, more \nestablished health insurance carriers over new and significantly \nsmaller health insurance plans, such as the CO-OPS, and improve \nprovider cost transparency in the market. They must work together to \nsupport the alternative ways for CO-OP small businesses like InHealth \nto raise capital.\n  CO-OPs like InHealth in Ohio are putting customer service before \nprofits in making a positive difference in patients' health and their \npocketbooks. CO-OPs boost competition, they drive down prices for \ncustomers, and because they are locally run and operated by their own \nmembers, CO-OPs are invested in providing the best possible care for \nthe communities they serve. CO-OPs like InHealth are working. We need \nto make sure they have the support they need to continue providing \nquality, affordable local insurance to thousands of people in my State \nof Ohio and across the country.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, on the floor, and with CMS on these important issues so the \nexisting CO-OPs--like InHealth--can continue to pursue innovative \napproaches to affordable comprehensive health insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, let me thank my friend from Ohio for his \nvery constructive remarks on the success of CO-OPs. We have a CO-OP in \nConnecticut that has been providing very good quality care at very \nreasonable rates. It is part of what helps make our marketplace \nfunction, and I will look forward to working with him as we try to \nsustain the success of CO-OPs across the country moving forward as an \nelement of the Affordable Care Act which, as I have said many times on \nthis floor, is working.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S153-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S153-S154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORIZATION FOR MILITARY FORCE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, today I have come to the floor to speak \nvery briefly about a resolution that the majority leader introduced, I \nbelieve, yesterday. This is an authorization for military force that \napparently purports to give the President legal authority to conduct \nmilitary operations against ISIS. Before we break for the weekend, I \nthought it was important to come to the floor to explain very briefly \nto my colleagues what this resolution really is.\n  This resolution is a total rewrite of the war powers clause of the \nU.S. Constitution. Let's be clear about that. It is essentially a \ndeclaration of international martial law, a sweeping transfer of \nmilitary power to the President that will allow him or her to send U.S. \ntroops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with \nabsolutely no limitations.\n  Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution vests in Congress \nthe responsibility to declare war. Many of us on both sides of the \naisle have been arguing for over a year that the President--right now--\nhas exceeded his constitutional authority in continuing\n\n[[Page S154]]\n\nmilitary operations against ISIS without specific authorization from \nCongress. I have been amongst those who have been calling on this body \nto debate authorization of military force. So in that sense I am \npleased the introduction of this resolution may allow us to have a \ndebate on the Senate floor about the right way to authorize war against \nour sworn enemy, ISIS, a terrorist organization that deserves to be \ndegraded, defeated, and wiped off the map of this Earth.\n  While the ink is still wet on this resolution--so I will not endeavor \nto go into any detailed analysis of it--it is safe to say that this \nresolution is the wrong way to authorize war against ISIS. The language \nof this resolution is dangerous and it is unprecedented.\n  The American people want Congress to authorize war against ISIS, but \nthey also want us to make sure we don't send hundreds of thousands of \nU.S. soldiers back into the Middle East to fight a war that has to be \nwon first and foremost with regional partners, and they certainly don't \nwant Congress to hand over the power to the President to send our \ntroops into any country, anywhere in the world, for almost any reason.\n  That is what this resolution would do. It doesn't give the power to \nthe President to deploy U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. It gives the \npower to the President--without consulting Congress--to deploy U.S. \nforces in any one of the 60-plus countries where ISIS has a single \nsympathizer. Even worse, the language doesn't even require ISIS to be \npresent in a country for the President to invade. All that is necessary \nfor the President to be able to argue--with a straight face--is that \nthe threat of ISIS was present.\n  As we have seen in the United States, the threat of ISIS is present \nin virtually every corner in the world. Thus, this resolution would \ngive the President total absolute carte blanche to send our young \nsoldiers to any corner of the world without consulting Congress.\n  Now, we wouldn't have to worry about a President abusing this \nauthority granted to him if an example of this abuse wasn't in our \nimmediate rearview mirror. This Congress gave President Bush sweeping \nauthority in two resolutions to fight terrorism in the wake of \nSeptember 11, and he manipulated and abused that authority to send \nmillions of American troops into Iraq to fight a war under concocted, \nfalse pretenses. He got an open-ended authorization from Congress, and \nhe ran with it. Now, what did we get for this colossal \nmisrepresentation? Over 4,000 Americans dead, scores more than that \ncrippled, and a region in chaos, in large part because of our \ndisastrous invasion and occupation.\n  On the campaign trail today, several of the candidates for President \ntalked with such irresponsible bravado about throwing around America's \nmilitary might. The likely Republican nominee, as we sit here today, \nshows a blissful ignorance about U.S. military law and basic foreign \npolicy that is truly frightening.\n  So given recent history and given the current rhetoric on the \nPresidential campaign trail today, why would we give the President such \nopen-ended, sweeping authority ever again? And why would we even \ncontemplate a resolution like this one that makes the 9/11 and Iraq war \nresolutions seem like exercises in thoughtful restraint? Why would we \nmake the mistake of the Iraq war resolution again, especially when \nthere is an alternative?\n  I know that we will likely have time to debate the question of how to \nproperly authorize war against ISIS later. But in December of 2014, the \nForeign Relations Committee did vote out an AUMF that gave the \nPresident all the power he needed to fight ISIS, while making sure that \nhe had to come back to Congress if he wanted to dramatically expand the \ncurrent conflict to other countries or to put hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican troops into a new war in the Middle East. It is the only AUMF \nthat has received a favorable vote by the Senate, and it is a template \nfor how we can authorize a war that isn't totally and completely open-\nended.\n  Several have argued for us to take up a debate on the AUMF because we \nbelieve that over the last 15 years, over the course of the War on \nTerror, Congress has basically abdicated its responsibility to be the \nvoice of the people on the conduct of foreign policy. Many of us think \nthat a smart AUMF would get Congress back in the game when it comes to \nour constitutional responsibility to decide when and where our brave \ntroops are sent into battle. But this resolution, as currently written, \nwould do exactly the opposite. It would permanently hand over war-\nmaking power to the President, and Congress would never get it back. It \nwould allow this President and the next President to send our troops \nalmost anywhere in the world for virtually any justifiable reason, with \nno ability for the people's branch of the Federal Government--this \nCongress--to step in and to have our say.\n  I do look forward to this debate if it does come to the floor. I \nthink it is an immensely important debate. Frankly, I will be glad to \nhave it. The American public wants us to declare war on ISIS, but they \nwant us to do it in a way that doesn't repeat the deadly, costly \nmistakes of the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe 800-pound gorilla in the room that people don't want to talk about, \nand that is our broken mental health treatment system in this country.\n  Years ago, we made the mistake of institutionalizing people with \nmental illness, and then we made the mistake of deinstitutionalizing \npeople with mental illness, with nowhere to go and no access to \ntreatment. But I have introduced legislation that I hope will help \nbegin this conversation anew, one that we will have a hearing on next \nweek in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  The legislation is called, simply, the Mental Health and Safe \nCommunities Act. It has two overarching goals. First, it will help \nthose suffering from mental illness and their families to find a way \nforward and to get the support that they need. Second, it will equip \nlaw enforcement, teachers, judges, and people with the knowledge and \nskill sets to spot the early signs of mental illness and give them the \nmeans by which to respond effectively.\n  Sadly, we know that mental illness is a common thread through many \nsenseless acts of violence that we have witnessed across the country. \nBut this problem is more than about just that. I know some of our \ncolleagues say they don't want to talk about how to improve access to \nmental health treatment if it is going to involve any discussion of \nguns, but I don't think we can talk about this topic without talking \nabout these incidents of mass violence. But I want to make sure I am \nvery clear and to say it is much more than just that.\n  It is time for Congress to respond with proven solutions that \nactually work. The President, as is his habit, has offered \ncontroversial proposals that actually violate the Constitution and \nthreaten our rights without solving the problem. To me that is one of \nthe reasons why people get so frustrated with Washington, when people \nstand up and say that here is something we ought to do, when it really \nis symbolic in nature and it doesn't actually solve the problem they \nclaim to be addressing. And that is true of the President's Executive \nactions on guns.\n  Indeed, the AP's headline, when the President made this announcement, \nread: ``Obama measures wouldn't have kept guns from mass shooters.'' In \nother words, the Associated Press makes the point that none of this \nwould have solved the actual problem. But the legislation I have \nintroduced has a good chance to begin the effort to do that.\n  So since the President won't act responsibly and work with Congress, \nCongress must act by itself--first, to build consensus and offer \nsolutions, and not just engage in symbolic gestures and more political \ntalking points. It is time we focus our efforts on, first and foremost, \nproviding support to the mentally ill and their families to make sure, \nfirst of all, that they are less likely to be a danger to themselves, \nand, secondly, that they won't be a danger to the communities in which \nthey live.\n  Next Tuesday, we will have that hearing I mentioned at the outset in\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and we will look at some of the \nsuccessful models that have proven to be successful in places such as \nBexar County, San Antonio, TX.\n  Like many of our colleagues, I have had the occasion to visit the \nsheriffs, police chiefs, and the jails in our major metropolitan areas. \nVirtually all of them have told me that our jails have become \nwarehouses for people with mental illness. When they get out, unless \ntheir underlying symptoms are treated and unless they are on an \nenforceable treatment plan, compliant with their medication, and \nfollowing the doctor's orders, they are going to end up right back \nwhere they were. In the absence of effective treatment of their mental \nillness, we know many people with mental illness will self-medicate \nwith drugs or alcohol, compounding their problems and becoming what a \nyoung man in Houston called a ``frequent flyer,'' when referring to \nhimself. In other words, he would keep coming back again and again and \nagain and again.\n  But there are some successful models we can look at, and the results \nare really impressive. Through the reform measures instituted in places \nsuch as Bexar County, overcrowded jails have been reduced in size, \ntaxpayer dollars have been saved, and many lives have been changed for \nthe better. The secret is these jurisdictions have realized that we \nhave to focus on treating the mentally ill, not just warehousing them \nin our prisons and jails. Criminologists and mental health experts will \ntell you that locking up a mentally ill person without treatment will \nmake them even more dangerous to themselves and increase the risk to \nthe community.\n  Experts will also agree that if we identify those with mental illness \nand divert them to treatment, many of them can be restored to mental \nhealth, saving lives, increasing public safety, and reducing costs to \ntaxpayers.\n  There is a great book called ``Crazy,'' written by a gentleman by the \nname of Pete Earley. Pete is a journalist. Unfortunately, he and his \nwife had a son that exhibited mental illness symptoms. It was as a \nresult of their dealing with his illness and trying to help him get \nback onto a productive path in life that they encountered the broken \nmental health system that I have described a little bit about. The good \nnews is Pete's son is doing well. But it is because he is taking his \nmedications, and he recognizes that when he goes off of his medications \nhe gets into trouble. Pete will be testifying at our hearing next week, \nand I think he will bring home in a very real way how mental illness \naffects so many lives around the country, and what we can do to \nactually equip those families with additional tools to help them help \ntheir loved ones.\n  The truth is, this all takes cooperation. Indeed, in the criminal \njustice context, it takes collaboration between Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement. It also takes judges, doctors, and families. But \nthe good news is there are some models for success. We need to make \nthis a priority because so many of the people we encounter today on our \nstreets--the homeless--are people who are suffering from mental illness \nof some form or another that could be helped. So many people who are \njailed for minor criminal offenses are people with mental illness that \ncould be helped. I think it behooves all of us to do what we can to \nlearn from what actually has proven to work in some of our cities \naround the country, and to try to implement this on a national level.\n  In addition to Mr. Earley, we are going to be hearing from Sheriff \nSusan Pamerleau, who has been a champion of mental health reform in the \nSan Antonio area.\n  But even as the committee begins to consider long overdue mental \nhealth legislation, I have to confess that I have been disappointed at \nsome of the responses by some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, because they say: We don't want to talk about the whole problem; \nwe just want to talk about the part of the problem that we want to talk \nabout. So if this involves anything related to Second Amendment rights \nor guns, then they don't want to have that conversation. But you can't \ncircumscribe the debate or the discussion by carving that out. That has \nto be a part of it. It will be a part of it, whether we like it or not.\n  Some of these colleagues on the other side of the aisle have cited a \nprovision of my bill that would actually strengthen and clarify the \ndefinitions regarding the uploading of mental health records to the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System. Why would anybody \ndisagree with making sure that adjudication of mental illness be \nuploaded to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System? That \nis what happened with the Virginia Tech shooter, for example. He had \nbeen adjudicated mentally ill by Virginia authorities, but because the \nState didn't provide that information to the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System operated by the FBI, he was able to buy a \nfirearm without being disqualified, which he should have been, based on \nthat adjudication.\n  My bill also reauthorizes and strengthens the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System. This is something our colleagues \nacross the aisle--and, indeed, all of us--have said we support--a \nbackground check system. It would work to clarify the scope of the \nmental health records that are required to be uploaded so that there is \nno longer mass confusion among State and local law enforcement as to \nwhat is required by Federal law. And, because we can't mandate that \nStates do this, we need to provide incentives for them to encourage \nthem to share these records, because these are a national resource. To \nme, this just makes common sense. Why wouldn't we want States to comply \nwith current laws to keep the mental health background check records \nupdated? I don't understand the controversy about that.\n  I would like to make clear that if there are Members on the other \nside of the aisle willing to work with me on this legislation and \nwilling to work with the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, Senator \nMurray, and with Tim Murphy in the House--who has an important piece of \nlegislation that is much more comprehensive in nature but certainly \ndeals with this issue as well--and along with Dr. Bill Cassidy here in \nthe Senate, there are many of us on a bicameral basis and on a \nbipartisan basis who have said we want to do something about this \ncrisis in our country, and that is the mental health crisis.\n  What we ought to do is roll up our sleeves, sit down at the table, \nand begin to work through this. I know at least five Democrats are \ncosponsoring legislation identical to mine in the House of \nRepresentatives, so it is up to us to start working to find consensus \nin the Senate.\n  This is one of those issues where Republicans have said they would \nlike to see something get done, where the Democrats say they would like \nto get something done, and presumably the White House would too. How do \nyou explain our not doing what we can do? Even if we can't do \neverything some of us would like to do, why don't we do what we can do?\n  I hope we can work together to deal with these reforms and to help \nmake our communities safer. It is up to us to put our heads down and \nwork diligently for the American people and come up with solutions for \nstruggling families--families struggling with a loved one with mental \nillness and who don't know where to turn. I look forward to hearing \nmore about some of the proposed solutions next week during this hearing \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee and working with all of our \ncolleagues to try to come up with the best answers we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S155-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S155-S156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF SUPREME COURT'S CITIZENS UNITED DECISION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 6-year anniversary of the \nSupreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. In this far-reaching opinion, on a divided 5-4 vote, the \nCourt struck down years of precedent and held that the First Amendment \npermitted corporations to spend freely from their treasuries to \ninfluence elections.\n  As a result of Citizens United and the series of decisions that \nfollowed in its wake, special interests and wealthy, well-connected \ncampaign donors have so far poured more than $2 billion into\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\nrecent Federal elections, including 2016 races. About half of the total \noutside spending since Citizens United went toward the 2012 \nPresidential election. More than 93 percent of all Super PAC donations \nin 2012 came in contributions of at least $10,000 from only 3,318 \ndonors, who make up 0.0011 percent of the U.S. population. Of that \ngroup, an elite class of 159 people each contributed at least $1 \nmillion--which was nearly 60 percent of all Super PAC donations that \nyear.\n  In the lead-up to the 2016 Presidential primaries, we are once again \nwitnessing an immense amount of spending. A New York Times \ninvestigation in October found that of approximately 120 million \nhouseholds in the United States, a mere 158 families, along with \nbusinesses they own or control, had already contributed $176 million--\nnearly half of all funds raised to support the 2016 Presidential \ncampaigns before a single primary vote has been cast.\n  Congressional races have been similarly flooded with outside \nspending. For example, in the 2014 midterm elections, outside groups \nspent more than $560 million to influence congressional races--eight \ntimes the approximately $70 million spent in 2006, the last midterm \nelection cycle before Citizens United. And more than 30 percent of that \nspending came from tax-exempt, ``dark money'' groups that conceal their \ndonors from the public.\n  The impact of this incredible spending stretches from races for the \nWhite House and Congress to Governors' mansions, State capitols, and \ncity halls throughout the country. As in Federal campaigns, Citizens \nUnited has led to an explosion of outside spending at the State and \nlocal levels, with corporations and wealthy single spenders looking to \nplay kingmaker, pouring cash into races for positions ranging from \ndistrict attorney to school board members. One of the most startling \nexamples occurred in 2014 in Richmond, CA, a city with a population of \n107,000. Chevron--an energy company with more than $200 billion in \nannual revenue--spent approximately $3 million through campaign \ncommittees aimed at influencing the mayoral and city council races. \nThat means Chevron spent at least $33 per voting-age resident in \nRichmond.\n  The long-term damage to our political process from Citizens United is \njust beginning to reveal itself. Some scandals have already surfaced, \nand there will undoubtedly be more stories of corruption and corrosive \ninfluence ahead, further eroding public confidence in our government. I \nhave worked with my colleagues on a number of solutions to stem this \ntidal wave of secret unlimited spending, including improving disclosure \nand creating a more transparent campaign finance system. I will \ncontinue my efforts to establish a public financing system for \ncongressional elections through the Fair Elections Now Act, which I \nreintroduced last year.\n  We also must continue to push for a constitutional amendment that \nwould protect and restore the First Amendment by overturning Citizens \nUnited and empowering Congress and State legislatures to set \nreasonable, content neutral limitations on campaign spending. In 2614, \nJustice John Paul Stevens discussed his support for an amendment to \noverturn Citizens United in testimony before the Senate Rules \nCommittee. Here is what he said: ``Unlimited campaign expenditures \nimpair the process of democratic self-government. They create a risk \nthat successful candidates will pay more attention to the interests of \nnon-voters who provided them with money than to the interests of the \nvoters who elected them. That risk is unacceptable.''\n  As we approach the sixth anniversary of the Citizens United decision, \nwe should heed Justice Stevens's words. It is unacceptable for \npoliticians to feel more beholden to wealthy donors than their \nconstituents. We must work to fix America's campaign finance system and \noverturn Citizens United so that elected officials listen to the \neveryday Americans who voted them into office--not just those who \nbankrolled their success.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S156-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate my longtime \nstaffer Margot Allen on her retirement. Margot has been an essential \npart of my team since I became a U.S. Senator in 2011, and I am \nthankful for all of her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada.\n  For the past 5 years, Margot has gone above and beyond not only \nworking hard to help achieve my goals for Nevada's military community, \nbut also to bring southern Nevada's active military members, veterans, \nand their families an unwavering ally in fighting bureaucratic red tape \nand various issues that often occur when working with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  From helping Nevadans receive the benefits they deserve, to \npersonally meeting many serving at both Nellis Air Force Base and \nCreech Air Force Base, to welcoming a variety of veterans living \nthroughout the southern Nevada community, Margot has been there to \nsupport those that have given so much for our freedoms. I extend my \ndeepest gratitude to Margot for working with Nevada's military \ncommunity and representing my office with such a genuine concern for \nNevada's brave men and women. Not only has she gained my respect, but \nthe respect of the military community across southern Nevada through \nher tireless resolve to bring these men and women the support they \ndeserve.\n  Margot also served as my statewide coordinator for Nevada's U.S. \nservice academies. It was through her efforts in working with Nevada's \nyouth who were interested in attending these important institutions \nthat many achieved this goal and were accepted into the academies.\n  Along with helping Nevada's veterans and active military members, \nMargot also served as a point of contact to seniors across southern \nNevada struggling with Social Security, Medicare, and other programs \navailable to help our aging population. Throughout the last 5 years, \nMargot worked diligently to help seniors in need receive the help \nnecessary to remain healthy and happy. This community is fortunate that \nMargot led the way to help southern Nevada's seniors.\n  Margot also contributed greatly to my team by utilizing a completely \ndifferent skill set--a love of grammar and writing. Prior to working on \nbehalf of the people of Nevada in my office, she served as a professor \nat the University of Alabama, as well as taught English-language skills \nin Panama while her husband, Leonard, worked abroad for the Department \nof Defense. To say I was privileged to have her in my office would be \nan understatement.\n  Above all else, I want to thank Margot for all of her hard work and \ndevotion to the people of our great State. She wore many hats, working \nwith veterans, seniors, and a variety of other Nevadans struggling to \nwork with Federal agencies--we are very fortunate to have had someone \nwilling to put forth such effort and compassion to help those in need. \nHer legacy of resilience and determination will never be forgotten.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in \ncongratulating Margot on her retirement and in thanking her for all she \nhas done for the people of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S156-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S156-S157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MORGAN WALLACE\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, today we honor the life and service \nof Glen Edward Martin, whose passing signifies a great loss to Nevada. \nI send my condolences and prayers to his wife and all of Mr. Martin's \nfamily in this difficult time. Mr. Martin was a man truly committed to \nhis family, country, State, and community. He will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. Martin was born in May 1918 in Council Bluffs, IA, where he \nremained until after graduation from Abraham Lincoln High School in \n1937. He later received his bachelor's degree in economics from \nColorado College in 1941 and a master's degree in public administration \nfrom the University of Southern California in 1984. Throughout his \nlifetime, Mr. Martin had four careers, all working in support of his \ncountry and local community.\n  Mr. Martin first served as a U.S. Marine Corps officer from 1938 to \n1968. During this time, he served in World War II, the Korean war, and \nthe Vietnam war, receiving numerous Silver and Bronze Stars for his \nefforts. He was also decorated with a Navy Cross in 1944 at the Battle \nof Eniwetok. His bravery and service to our country are invaluable. \nAfter retiring from the military, Mr. Martin turned his attention to \nserving the people of Nevada by working as a Nevada State employee. In \n1968, Mr. Martin accepted his first role working for the State in \ncomprehensive health planning and later focused on the extension \nservice in civil defense. I am grateful that Mr. Martin dedicated more \nthan a decade of service toward bettering the State of Nevada.\n  In his final career, beginning in 1983, Mr. Martin served Nevada's \nseniors, working as an advocate, teacher, and trainer for exercise and \nresistance training. In 2002, he received the Governor's Point of \nLights Award for his unwavering dedication to seniors in Nevada who he \nhelped keep strong and healthy. He also led a 40-participant resistance \nexercise class 3 days a week at the Carson City Senior Center to help \nthose in need. Mr. Martin was a true role model, demonstrating genuine \ncare for those around him.\n  No words can adequately thank Mr. Martin, who served not for \nrecognition but because it was the right thing to do for both his \ncountry and community. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I recognize Congress has a responsibility not only to honor \nthe brave individuals protecting our freedoms, but to ensure they are \ncared for when they return home. I remain committed to upholding this \npromise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout \nthe Nation. Mr. Martin's service to his country and dedication to his \nfamily and community earned him a place among the outstanding men and \nwomen who have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  I am honored to commend all of Mr. Martin's hard work. His patriotism \nand drive will never be forgotten. Today I join the Carson City \ncommunity and citizens of the Silver State to celebrate the life of an \nupstanding Nevadan, Mr. Glen Edward Martin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S157-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BICENTENNIAL OF WELD, MAINE\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of Weld, ME, a small town set along Webb Lake in Franklin \nCounty. The town, with 419 inhabitants, has a long and proud history \ndating back to the 19th century, and I am pleased to join the people of \nWeld in celebrating their bicentennial and recognizing the town's \ncherished place in the State of Maine. The yearlong bicentennial \ncelebration will kick off with an event on Saturday, February 6, at the \nnewly renovated townhall.\n  First settled in 1800, Weld was incorporated in 1816 and named for \nits proprietor Benjamin Weld, of the well-known Boston family. \nIncidentally, the year of Weld's incorporation also marked the \nnotorious Year Without A Summer in New England, with 6 inches of snow \nblanketing the land in June. Widespread crop failures and other \nhardships pushed many westward, but the town of Weld prevailed, \nestablishing itself as the small but strong community it remains today.\n  Nestled in a valley created by Mount Blue and the Tumbledown \nMountains, Weld has long been noted for its striking natural beauty. \nThe area is rich with wildlife and home to many fish species, loons, \nmoose, and even the occasional bald eagle. At the core of Weld's \nidentity is Webb Lake, where many go to enjoy Maine's beloved outdoor \ntraditions.\n  The historic Kawanhee Inn, a rustic log inn that dates back to the \n1920's, has gained wide recognition for staying true to its origins and \ncharacter. Along with Mount Blue State Park, Camp Kawanhee for Boys, \nand family cottages with deep historical roots, the inn attracts many \nvisitors to Weld. In the summer months, the town's population swells to \nthe thousands as people from Maine and all around the country flock to \nWeld to enjoy fishing, boating, hiking, and a respite from fast-paced \nlifestyles.\n  When the temperatures drop and campers and summer residents pack up \nto leave, there remains a close-knit and engaged year-round population. \nThe Congregational Church, Masonic Lodge, and the Weld Historical \nSociety are bolstered by active community involvement. Additionally, \nthe Webb Lake Association is a nonprofit organization that spearheads \nconservation efforts and raises awareness about water pollutants in the \nlake. The Webb Lake Association is but one example of the townspeople's \ncommitment to preserving the area's unsurpassed beauty.\n  I commend all that the people of Weld have done to make their town \nsuch a special place to live and experience nature. Their shared love \nfor their hometown has made them one of Maine's most cohesive and \ndedicated communities. This has been especially illustrated by the \nmembers of the Weld Bicentennial Committee, whose efforts have made \nthis special celebration possible, and I am proud to recognize this \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S157-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the second time, and placed \non the calendar:\n\n       S.J.

Mr. President, tomorrow is January 22. This is a date that \nhas become known for two related but radically different reasons. \nFirst, it is the anniversary of the Supreme Court's infamous decision \nin Roe v. Wade that imposed on America the most permissive abortion \nregime in the world. That decision degraded human life by degrading the \nConstitution.\n  At the center of the debate over the morality, legality, or policy of \nabortion is the fact that each abortion kills a living human being. \nThat this fact is inescapable does not prevent many from trying \nmightily to escape it, but it cannot be avoided, obscured, or ignored. \nLet me repeat: Each abortion kills a living human being. That fact \ninformed President Ronald Reagan when he wrote a moving essay in 1983 \ntitled ``Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation.'' He wrote: ``We \ncannot diminish the value of one category of human life--the unborn--\nwithout diminishing the value of all human life.'' The real question, \nhe said, is not about when human life begins but about the value of \nhuman life. I believe that remains the real question today.\n  Starting even before America's founding, the law had been on a steady \nmarch toward protecting human beings before birth. The 19th century \nmovement that succeeded in prohibiting abortion except to save the life \nof the mother was led by medical professionals and civil rights \nactivists. That consensus, however, began to unravel in the 20th \ncentury.\n  In 1948, the United States voted in favor of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, which recognizes in its preamble the \ninherent dignity and inalienable rights of ``all members of the human \nfamily.'' Like every Member of this body, I am a member of the human \nfamily because I am a living human being. So are you, Mr. President; so \nis each of us. Article 3 of the declaration states that ``everyone has \nthe right to life.''\n  Words such as ``universal'' and ``inherent'' and ``all'' are \nunambiguous and clear. Only 25 years later, however, the Supreme \nCourt's Roe v. Wade decision declared quite the opposite--that the \nright to life is actually not universal and does not belong to every \nmember of the human family. The Court said, in effect, that some \nmembers of the human family get to determine whether others live or \ndie.\n  The contradictions continued. On April 2, 1982, the U.S. Senate \nratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \nArticle 6 declares:\n\n       Every human being has the inherent right to life. This \n     right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily \n     deprived of his life.\n\n  This time, it took the Supreme Court just 88 days to send the \nopposite message. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed \nits decision that the U.S. Constitution protects the right to abortion. \nIn other words, the right to life is not inherent, it cannot be \nprotected by law, and it can be arbitrarily taken away.\n  This sort of confusion about the fundamental value of human life has \nput the United States in an appalling position. The United States is \none of only seven nations in the world to allow abortion even into the \nsixth month of pregnancy. We join on that list China and North Korea, \nwhich are hardly champions of human rights. More children are killed by \nabortion in 2 days in America than all American servicemembers who have \nbeen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Last year, we all witnessed the depths to which this degradation of \nhuman life leads. Planned Parenthood, the Nation's largest abortion \nprovider, is in the dark business of trafficking in baby body parts and \nuses word games and spin to hide what it is actually doing. These \naren't children or babies, says Planned Parenthood; they are products \nof conception. These aren't body parts; they are tissue specimens. This \nshould come as no surprise. Stripped of inherent dignity and worth, \nhuman beings can easily become commodities.\n  Last week, in his final State of the Union Address, President Obama \nsaid that a future opportunity for our families and a peaceful planet \nfor our kids are within our reach. How can that possibly occur without \na basic commitment to the fundamental value of human life and the \ninherent dignity and worth of every human being?\n  Let me highlight one more contrast. Early feminists Susan B. Anthony \nand Elizabeth Cady Stanton published and edited a newspaper titled The \nRevolution. They editorialized against abortion and even rejected ads \nfor abortifacient drugs, arguing that abortion was a tool for \noppressing women. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to receive a \ndegree from an American medical school, strongly opposed abortion. Dr. \nCharlotte Denman Lozier, another trailblazer for women in the medical \nprofession, helped and defended women who were pressured to have \nabortions. One writer described Dr. Lozier's work\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\nas ``thoroughly woman-affirming and life-affirming.''\n  These priorities of being both pro-women and pro-life have today been \nmade enemies instead of allies. Today, the right to abortion and even \nits actual incidence have, for many, become signs or symbols of \nprogress instead of oppression. This idea that the act of killing a \nliving human being should be held up as a step forward, as a light to \nguide our way, strikes me as deeply misguided and as something to mourn \nrather than celebrate. We should instead deepen the conviction that all \nhuman beings have inherent dignity and worth. That once was, and should \nbe again, the foundation for our culture, society, and, yes, even our \npolitics.\n  The Supreme Court not only degraded human life in its Roe v. Wade \ndecision but did so by degrading the Constitution. The Court found a \nright to abortion not in the real Constitution but in a constitution of \nits own making. The real Constitution would not allow the Court to \nimpose its own values on the Nation, and so the Court simply created a \ndifferent constitution that would. By claiming to find an unwritten \nright in our written Constitution, the Justices seized control of the \nConstitution that is supposed to control them.\n  If it is possible, I urge my colleagues to set aside the particular \nsubject of abortion and consider what this really means. All public \nofficials, including Supreme Court Justices, take an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. That Constitution, \nthe real Constitution, is supposed to be the primary way that the \nAmerican people impose limits on government. In fact, as the Supreme \nCourt recognized in the 1803 Marbury v. Madison decision, the \nConstitution is written down so that those limits on government will be \nneither mistaken nor forgotten. In his farewell address of 1796, \nPresident George Washington said that the people's control over the \nConstitution is the heart of our system of government. Our freedom \ndepends on it.\n  With decisions like Roe v. Wade, however, the Supreme Court takes \ncontrol of the Constitution away from the people, distorts our way of \ngovernment, and compromises the freedom the system makes possible. \nThomas Jefferson warned against allowing the Supreme Court to twist and \nshape the Constitution into any form it pleased. Yet that is exactly \nwhat the Court does in Roe v. Wade. Instead of conforming their \ndecisions to the real Constitution, the Justices conform the \nConstitution to their own preferences, values, and agenda. They turn \ntheir oath to support and defend the Constitution into an oath to \nsupport and defend themselves.\n  January 22 is known for the decision in which the Supreme Court \ndegraded human life by degrading the Constitution. The Court used \njudicially tragic means to achieve a morally and culturally tragic end. \nThankfully, however, January 22 is also known for another, radically \ndifferent, event known as the March for Life. Every year for decades, \nhundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens have come here to \nWashington to do just that--march for life. They represent what once \nwas the norm: the belief that life itself is precious and that each \nhuman being has inherent dignity and worth. By coming to Washington \nyear after year, they stake their claim that those principles can once \nagain prevail.\n  There is reason for hope. More than 70 percent of Americans believe \nthat abortion should be illegal in most or all circumstances. That \nfigure has not changed in more than 40 years. What has changed is that \nmore Americans today identify themselves as pro-life than as pro-\nchoice. Large majorities favor a range of limitations on abortion and \nin 2014 elected scores of new pro-life legislators at both the State \nand Federal level. Perhaps most encouraging of all, the percentage of \nyoung people who believe that abortion should not be permitted in most \nor all circumstances has risen steadily and significantly. The number \nof abortions reported each year to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention has dropped by 50 percent in the last 25 years.\n\n  The organization Feminists for Life was founded in 1972 before Roe v. \nWade sent us into this tailspin. They have said for years that women \ndeserve better than abortion. Life, not death, should be our priority.\n  I hope and pray that more and more of us will be--in large and small \nways each and every day--marching for life.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/21/senate-section/article/S163-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
