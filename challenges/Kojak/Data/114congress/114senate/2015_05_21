The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly vote on cloture on \nthe Hatch substitute amendment, legislation to renew trade promotion \nauthority and trade adjustment assistance. I know some of my colleagues \nhave concerns about the process. Let me say that I also share those \nconcerns.\n  From the very beginning of our discussions over 3 years ago on the \nrenewal of TPA, I have done all I could to listen to all of my \ncolleagues and address their concerns.\n  I first worked with Chairman Baucus to find a way to update TPA in a \nway that addresses many of the issues that have arisen since 2002, \nincluding concerns over labor and the environment.\n  When Senator Wyden became chairman of the Finance Committee, I again \nwent to the negotiating table to try to address many of the \ntransparency and procedural issues he raised, and we again came to a \nbipartisan compromise.\n  When many of my Senate colleagues said renewal of TAA was a necessary \ncomponent to passing TPA, I again did my best to meet those concerns, \neven though I myself have significant reservations about the program.\n  Throughout the Finance Committee consideration, I tried to conduct an \nopen and fair process, which allowed many Members of the committee, \neven those who opposed TPA, the opportunity to be heard and to have \ntheir amendments adopted. As a result, the committee reported out four \npieces of trade legislation, all with strong bipartisan support.\n  I will acknowledge that the process on the floor has not gone the way \nany of us would like. At the outset of this endeavor, I stated my \ncommitment to a full, fair, and open debate over our TPA legislation. \nThe majority leader made a similar commitment, and I know that was our \nintention. Indeed, from the very beginning, we had planned to hear \neveryone's arguments and consider a number of amendments.\n  This is how the Senate is supposed to function. Once again, we \nintended to let it function that way. Unfortunately, there were some \nwho did not want to let that happen. They were, from the very \nbeginning, committed to slow-walking this process and preventing \nregular order. That is just a fact.\n  I know there are some who want to blame the majority leader for \nfiling cloture and trying to move this process forward. I am sure some \nare thinking of voting against cloture this morning in protest. That \nwould be a grave mistake.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we tried to move to the bill at the \nbeginning of last week. I know, after the many recent long days on the \nfloor, that seems like a long time ago, but I think everyone here can \nrecall what happened.\n  We attempted to get on the bill, and we were prevented from doing so. \nAfter we found a way to address our colleagues' concerns, we were \nfinally able to begin debate on the TPA bill, but even then the process \nwas slow-going.\n  As debate began, the majority leader attempted to keep the Senate \nopen on Friday and into the weekend to allow Senators to debate and \noffer amendments. However, the Senate minority leader objected, which \nprevented the process from moving forward and set us back even further.\n  Then, we came to this week and debate finally began in earnest. \nShortly thereafter, a new strategy emerged, wholly supported by the \nopponents of TPA. The strategy has been simple: Prevent any amendments \nfrom being called up and object to any and all unanimous consent \nrequests.\n\n  I have been here on the floor all week, and I have witnessed \nfirsthand the deployment of this plan to frustrate the process and to \nprevent a full and fair debate on trade policy. Now here we are facing \na cloture vote and the prospect of cutting off debate. It is \nunfortunate that it has come to this, but given the total lack of \ncooperation we faced and continue to face on this bill, this is really \nthe only option left.\n  Invoking cloture is not the end. If we can get agreement with our \ncolleagues, I expect there will still be opportunities to call up and \nvote on amendments, but we cannot just sit around and wait for \nsolutions to come together on their own.\n  If any Senator has a proposal for a path forward that will reasonably \nsatisfy the various demands and objections that have been raised and \nallow us to break the logjam on amendments, I am all ears. Until then, \nour only choice is to press forward. We could extend this debate \nforever and still not satisfy every demand; there is no question about \nthat. But this bill is far too important.\n  I have done all I can to address legitimate concerns, and as a \nresult, the bill is supported by me, Chairman Ryan from the House Ways \nand Means Committee, Ranking Member Wyden from the Finance Committee, \nand, most importantly, the President of the United States.\n  Let's be real here. We need to get this bill passed. Just this \nmorning, I read that a ministerial that was to begin this month has \nbeen canceled, in large part due to the fact that Congress has not \napproved this bill.\n  Our Nation's economic health and prestige are on the line here today. \nThe TPA bill is the only way Congress can effectively assert its \npriorities in our ongoing trade negotiations. It is the only way we can \nensure that our trade negotiators can reach good deals with our trading \npartners. It is the only way\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\nwe can ensure that our pending trade agreements even have a shot at \nreaching the finish line.\n  As I have stated many times here on the floor this week, I am well \naware that some of our colleagues here in the Senate oppose this bill \noutright and will do everything in their power to keep it from passing. \nAs much as I have tried to change hearts and minds on these issues, \nthere is very little I can do about that. But I also know that there is \na bipartisan majority of Senators who support TPA and who, despite \nconcerns about process, want to get this done. We are still in a \nposition to reach a positive outcome on this bill.\n  I said at the beginning of this debate that this was quite possibly \nthe most important debate we will have this year in Congress. It is \nPresident Obama's top legislative priority. It is a very high priority \nfor many of us in Congress. On the substance, this is a good TPA bill, \none Senators from both parties can support. It needs to pass. We need \nto pass it for the American workers who want good, high-paying jobs. We \nneed to pass it for our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and \nentrepreneurs who need access to foreign markets in order to compete. \nWe need to pass it to maintain our standing in the world and continue \nto advance American values and interests on the world stage. We need to \npass it to demonstrate to the American people that despite our many \ndisagreements, their elected representatives are capable of addressing \nimportant issues and solving real problems.\n  There is a path forward here, one that will still allow us to be \nsuccessful, but in order to get there, we need Senators to support \ncloture this morning.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on cloture. It is \ncrucial, it is of paramount concern, and it is something very highly \nwished for by the President of the United States and by a bipartisan \nmajority in this body.\n  I hope we will vote yes on cloture here today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the \nopportunity to share some remarks.\n  I do believe Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden allowed a good debate in \nthe committee. Unfortunately, we have not been able to have the kinds \nof amendments here on the floor that they allowed in the committee, so \nwe are moving to this massive bill with very little debate, even on the \nfast-track policy. If that is adopted and TPP appears before us here on \nthe floor, there will be no amendments on it.\n  In a few moments, we will vote on whether to shut off debate on the \nfast-track authority legislation. I see no reason that we have to rush \nthis.\n  I will just note that we have the highway bill expiring, and we have \nthe PATRIOT Act expiring. Those are crises which need to be dealt with \nthis week. This bill does not have to be done in that fashion.\n  This will be a crucial vote. Fast-track is an affirmative decision by \nCongress to suspend several of its most basic powers for the next 6 \nyears and to delegate those powers to the Chief Executive.\n  Under the fast-track procedure, the President, not Congress, writes \nimplementing legislation for any yet-unseen global trade pact. That \nlegislation, no matter its contents, cannot be amended in any fashion. \nNo individual Member of Congress can alter any line of text or remove a \nsingle provision that violates the will of Congress. That legislation, \nonce called up, is guaranteed a speedy path forward--only 20 hours of \ndebate--and the vote threshold is lowered to a simple majority. No \nmatter how far-reaching the global trade agreement, Congress cannot \nsubject it to the 60 votes applied to important legislation before the \nSenate or the 67 votes applied to treaties, as it really should be. \nCongress will have preapproved swift consideration of sweeping global \npacts before the text has been made available and seen by a single \nMember of this body or the American people.\n  As usual through these processes--and too often--amendments are being \nconstricted and blocked through one maneuver or another. The net result \nis we are coming down to a cloture vote without any amendments having \nbeen voted on.\n  Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I sent a letter to the President of the \nUnited States asking how fast-track and the vast Trans-Pacific \nPartnership would impact the jobs and wages of American workers. It is \na simple question. Would it increase or reduce manufacturing jobs and \nwages in the United States? Shouldn't we know that? Is that an improper \nquestion to ask? He has refused to answer. I think the reason he has \nrefused to answer is because the answer is not good and will not be \nwell received. They want us to shut off debate and move forward without \nhaving these fundamental questions answered.\n  For too long, the United States has entered into trade deals on the \npromise of economic bounty, only to see workers impoverished and \nbusinesses disappear. Dan DiMicco, the chairman Emeritus of Nucor \nSteel, explains that this is because these free-trade deals have not \nbeen free-trade deals at all. Instead, they have been ``unilateral \ntrade disarmament,'' where we lower our barriers to foreign imports but \nthey retain their barriers to our exports to those countries. This is \nwhat is fundamentally at stake here. A lot of people, in their \nreligious view of free trade, don't care whether other countries have \nbarriers. Their view is that we should welcome more imports. Mr. \nDiMicco has called this the ``enablement of foreign mercantilism,'' a \nphilosophy of trade that is too often present around the world and \ncertainly in the Asian sector.\n  Consider this in the context of automobiles. The Wall Street Journal \npublished a story 2 days ago about how the American auto sector could \nbe jeopardized by TPP. The Journal wrote:\n\n       In the transportation sector, led by cars, the TPP could \n     boost imports by an extra $30.8 billion by 2025, compared \n     with an exports gain of $7.8 billion.\n\n  So the imports of automobiles would increase by $30.8 billion and our \nexports would increase by only $7.8 billion. That was a study written \nby Peter Petri, professor of international finance at Brandeis \nUniversity.\n  Well, having dramatically more imports than exports is not going to \nadd jobs. Perhaps that is why we cannot get an answer. In other words, \njob-killing imports would vastly exceed any growth in foreign exports, \nthereby putting more Americans out of work.\n  We have seen this story before. The South Korea trade deal--and I \nsupported that. I have great respect for the South Korean and the \nJapanese business acumen. But the South Korean trade deal, which was \nsupposed to boost our exports by more than $10 billion, actually ended \nup increasing our exports less than $1 billion. If truth be known, it \nwas $0.8 billion. Instead, the deal boosted South Korean imports to our \ncountry by more than $12 billion and nearly doubled the trade gap \nbetween our two nations, which was already large.\n  They say: Well, this time it is different. Trust us. Give us 6 more \nyears of executive authority to pass any global deal we like under \nfast-track. No deal has ever been blocked.\n  Well, respectfully, the American people don't trust you. Here is what \nthe Pew Poll reported recently: Twenty percent of Americans think these \ntrade agreements create jobs and 50 percent say it destroys jobs.\n  Have we been adding jobs in manufacturing or losing jobs in \nmanufacturing? We have been losing jobs in manufacturing. Are the \nAmerican people so wrong in that conclusion? Forty-five percent of \nAmericans think trade reduces wages; only 17 percent say it increases \nthem. By contrast, 72 percent of Vietnamese believe this trade \nagreement would increase their salaries.\n  Because TPP is a living agreement, it can be changed after adoption. \nIt says in the language of the agreement where it has this living \nagreement language that this is unprecedented. This is the first time \nthis has been put in a trade agreement. The Congressional Research \nService tells us that, too.\n  We are now creating a foreign international entity--one more \ninternational entity--with a commission that meets and votes and makes \ndecisions that are binding on the United States of America. Frankly, I \nthink this great Nation is exposing itself to too many of these \nagreements. Tying down the ability of the world's greatest power and \neconomic engine, the United\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nStates, is weakening our ability to function in a way that sovereignty \nshould allow us to function. Dangerously, this agreement creates a new \ngoverning global authority that would add new members of their choice, \nchange the terms of the agreement, and even subject U.S. citizens to \nits ruling--adjudicated in an international tribunal.\n  It is time for Congress to defend its shareholders--our \nshareholders--the American people. It is time to return to the regular \norder and to the principles of sound governance and to assert, not \nsurrender, the power of Congress to the overreaching Chief Executive. I \nam therefore going to oppose shutting off debate that actually has not \neven begun.\n  I am frustrated that two of my reasonable amendments that I think \nwould have had a very good chance of passing have been blocked and \napparently will not get a vote. I don't think we have any need to shut \noff the debate today and to advance to a bill where we have had too few \namendments and where we have had a steadfast refusal by the President \nof the United States, who is pushing every way he can to get this \nagreement adopted, until he answers the question: Will it improve \nmanufacturing or further reduce manufacturing, as our previous \nagreement with South Korea did? It reduced manufacturing. Will it \nincrease jobs or reduce jobs? All they promised--and they promised this \nrepeatedly--is that it will increase jobs in the export sector. They \ndon't say what it will do on net, when we have three, four times as \nmany imports as we do exports, on net. As in the past, it appears this \nagreement will clearly reduce jobs and reduce wages as well, and reduce \nmanufacturing.\n\n  We can't have a strong nation without a manufacturing sector--we just \ncannot. We can't be a strong nation without a steel industry--we just \ncannot. We need to ensure in these trade agreements--when we open our \nmarkets, what these countries want so desperately is access to the U.S. \nmarket. That is something of great value. We should not give it away \nuntil they agree to open their markets. That is what a good deal is. \nThat is not what is in this deal, and it will not be in the agreement. \nIt will be like previous agreements.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I don't see any others here. I will just discuss this a \nlittle bit more.\n  When Mr. Damico, who has been involved in world trade competition for \nyears, said we are enabling mercantilism, what he is saying is that our \ntrading partners have a goal that we don't seem to have, and that is to \nmaximize their exports and minimize their imports.\n  They want access to the U.S. market. They have a mercantilist \nphilosophy, and that is what it is, really. That philosophy allows them \nto put up nontrade barriers, nontariff barriers, to use currency \nmanipulation and other tactics to make it difficult for the United \nStates to penetrate their market. They say they have signed a trade \nagreement, and they will agree on tariffs, for example, but they still, \non net, don't open their market as effectively as we open our markets. \nThat is the reality.\n  As a result, we have had a continual decline in manufacturing. We \nhave seen a surge in our trade deficits. March was the highest trade \ndeficit in almost a decade. The whole first quarter was horrible. Our \ntrade deficits are increasing.\n  If this agreement is passed, will it increase or decrease our trade \ndeficits? Isn't that a fair question to ask? Will it increase or \ndecrease our trade deficits? They will not answer. Unfortunately, the \nanswer is it is going to increase our trade deficits. We know that. If \nit were not true, they would be hollering about how it is going to \ngreatly reduce our trade deficits. They would be saying, on net, we are \ngoing to have more jobs. They would say wages would go up.\n  The truth is we are not negotiating these agreements effectively, and \nthe net result is it is going to weaken manufacturing, allow a \nreduction in jobs, and really put downward pressure on wages.\n  I hate to have to oppose this legislation at this time, but I have \ncome to that conclusion. I have supported most of the trade agreements \nin the past.\n  I understand that we are in a global economy, and we have trading \npartners around the world. There is no way we are going to reverse \nthat. Globalism is here to stay. We need to be a part of it. But it is \ntime for our Nation to protect our manufacturing and our workers from \nunfair competition.\n  We cannot take the view, as some do and say openly, that if our \ncompetitors manipulate their currency to make their products cheaper \nand they penetrate our market and close American businesses as a \nresult--we cannot say: That is all right; we have cheaper products. \nDon't worry about it. In the long run, somewhere along the way, it will \nall work out.\n  That is a guiding principle for the people pushing this legislation. \nThey won't admit it, at least the politicians won't, publicly, but we \nknow that is the guiding principle. I say that is a mistake. I say that \nis an extreme position. I say that we do have an interest in protecting \nour jobs, our manufacturing, and the ability of the American people to \nhave a good job, to have a retirement plan, to have an insurance \npolicy. I think that is important.\n  So I urge that we back off this agreement now. Let's reevaluate it \nand have the President of the United States answer the question: Will \nwe create higher wages or lower wages? Will we increase manufacturing \nor reduce manufacturing? Will we increase wages or not?\n  I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of the time on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I echo the words of Senator Sessions, my \ncolleague from Alabama.\n  These free-trade deals are not free trade. If they were free trade, \nthey would be a couple of pages long that simply listed the tariffs \nthat we are eliminating as incentives. Instead, these are a collection \nof special interest deals that take us somewhere else from where the \nproponents said they would.\n  Senator Sessions said something interesting: This is really about \njobs. They would be making claims about jobs. Instead, they make claims \nabout geopolitics in China and all of that. That is fine, but there are \ncertainly other ways to deal with that better than we have.\n  We have seen big promises. We saw them from the first President Bush \nas he negotiated NAFTA. We saw them from President Clinton when he \npushed NAFTA through Congress. We saw them from President Clinton on \nPNTR with China, which was not a trade deal but certainly acted like \none in many ways in terms of what happened with China then. We saw them \nwith the second President Bush with the Central America Free Trade \nAgreement. And we are seeing them now with President Obama and South \nKorea.\n  On South Korea, President Obama's administration promised an increase \nof 70,000 jobs and promised wages would go up. They always say more \njobs, higher wages, but then we ended up losing 75,000 jobs under the \nSouth Korea Free Trade Agreement.\n  Today we are voting on whether to end debate on the fast-track bill. \nIf people are a little confused, it is very understandable. We are \ngoing to end debate, but we have barely begun it.\n  Historically, when we do trade agreements in this town--as bad as \nthey have turned out to be for the American public and working families \nin places such as Reno and Cleveland, and smaller towns such as \nMansfield and Lima, and really small towns such as Jackson, OH--when we \npassed these trade agreements, at least we have had open debate where \nwe could offer amendments. The last time we did fast-track legislation \non the Senate floor, there were 3 weeks of debate. This is about 3 \ndays. We considered 50 amendments. We have considered two so far.\n  The majority leader came to the floor at the end of the first full \nday of debate and said we are filing cloture to shut down debate. At \nthe end of the first full day of debate, they began the process of \nshutting down debate. The majority leader promised an open process.\n  I don't get it when my Democratic colleagues--I guess I get it with \nthe free-trade fundamentalists here and people who are not as \nindependent as Senator Sessions and the total party\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\nloyalists who will always vote with their leadership. But I don't get \nit when Democrats in this body, who really do genuinely care about \nworkers, as do many Republicans--why they are willing to shut down \ndebate because the majority leader says let's shut down debate.\n  We had two votes on Monday night and none since. Six amendments are \npending, but votes for them haven't been scheduled. Two hundred \namendments have been filed. At least 30 Senators have filed amendments \nand a number of Senators have filed multiple amendments. We have 200 \namendments filed and 2 votes and 6 amendments pending, even though the \n6 amendments that are pending don't have any schedule on how they are \ngoing to be dealt with. At least one of them has been second-degreed, \nbasically obviating or taking away any ability to vote strictly on that \namendment. We had two votes on Monday night, no votes on this issue \nsince, and as for the six amendments themselves, who knows how they are \ngoing to be disposed of. That is an open process?\n  People on my side of the aisle are willing to vote to shut down \ndebate when 25 of their Democratic colleagues and another--I don't \nknow, a half dozen; I don't know how many Republicans--are also \noffering amendments. So 200 amendments have been filed by--I just found \nthis. Forty-six Senators have actually filed 200 amendments on an issue \nwe haven't considered in 13 years, and we are going to shut down debate \nat the end of the first full day of consideration.\n  We had a truly open legislative process the last time we did it. I \nthink it was a Republican Senate at the time. It was a very closely \ndivided Senate. We have been promised repeatedly that is what this \nunderlying bill deserves. It is what the American people deserve.\n  Keep in mind this fast-track legislation means that we will be \nconsidering--it opens the process, opens the door to two trade \nagreements that encompass 60 percent of the world's economy. Forty \npercent of the world's economy is in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and \nan additional 20 percent with the United States and the European Union, \nthe so-called TTIP agreement. Again, after two votes, the majority \nleader filed for cloture at the end of the first full day of debate.\n  We are not being unreasonable. We have played this straight. We are \nsimply asking for the Senate to debate this important legislation. I \nreally don't understand how any Senator in either party, when half of \nthe Senate has offered amendments--200 of them and counting and every \nday there are more amendments offered--how we can shut down debate when \n200 amendments have been filed by 46 Senators. We are simply asking for \nvotes on our amendments. I don't care when we complete it. I don't care \nif we right now defeat cloture and then come up with some kind of a UC \nto give us votes on 25 or 50 of these amendments with time scheduled so \nwe can finish. I don't care if we finish today or Friday or Saturday or \nSunday or stay to Memorial Day or come back a week after Memorial Day \nand finish. It really doesn't matter about the time. I know a lot of my \ncolleagues don't want to go home this week and have people who are \nangry because they know these trade agreements don't serve the public \ninterest, and we know there are millions of Americans who have lost \njobs because of decisions we make here.\n  We make decisions here that throw people out of work. Even the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page, the greatest cheerleader--the most \nvigorous, vociferous cheerleader for free trade of any newspaper in the \ncountry, I believe--even they acknowledge that people are thrown out of \nwork from trade agreements because of the dislocation. We are going to \nleave here and vote on this without even having amendments on how to \ntake care of those workers and how to do trade enforcement. It simply \ndoesn't make sense.\n  Amendments such as the Brown-Portman Leveling the Playing Field Act \namendment include much-needed trade enforcement provisions in this \ntrade promotion bill. It was for all intents and purposes unanimously \naccepted in the Finance Committee. It has all kinds of Republican \ncosponsorships and all kinds of Democrat cosponsorships. My colleagues \nin the leadership in both parties, even though the leadership in both \nparties doesn't reflect the majority of the Members of both parties--\nthat is the way it is sometimes--but we are asking for a vote on that. \nWe haven't been given that yet--an actual vote. There have been \npromises, but there has been nothing really substantive in the end.\n  These provisions on a level playing field are supported by the White \nHouse and by House Republicans who have asked them to be included in \nfast-track. They are supported by numbers of U.S. industries that face \nan onslaught of unfairly traded imports and need our trade remedy laws \nto be as strong as possible.\n  We are not debating the Brown-Portman amendment. We are not debating \nany amendments. We are simply rushing to conclude consideration of this \nfast-track bill.\n  We are fast-tracking this whole idea of a fast-track process. Why is \nthat good for our country or our workers or our small manufacturers and \nthe supply chains of all of these big industries? Why is that good for \nour communities?\n  We have waited 8 years, and this has to be done today. Eight years we \nhave waited for this. We had one full day of debate. Then the majority \nleader shut down the debate, after one full day of debate.\n  What we do in this fast-track bill will have implications for years \nto come. It will affect the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the \nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, both permanent trade \nagreements that represent more than half the world's economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. This will affect both TPP, 40 percent of the world's \neconomy, and then a year or so later, TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and \nInvestment Partnership, the United States-European Union agreement--\nboth permanent trade agreements. There is 40 percent in TPP of the \nworld's economy, and 20 percent in TTIP of the world's economy. These \nare permanent trade agreements that represent a huge part of the \nworld's economy.\n  This bill will affect global labor standards, it will affect global \nenvironmental standards, it will affect international intellectual \nproperty standards, and more and more and more. That is why Senator \nSessions has spoken out so effectively against it. That is why people \nin both parties are insisting they get these amendments, that they are \nvoting against cloture until they get these amendments--Members of this \nbody who have supported cloture in the past for a whole host of things.\n  Why we are rushing to end debate before it has truly begun is \nmystifying. Regardless of whether they support or oppose the underlying \nbill, I hope my colleagues recognize the importance of getting fast-\ntrack legislation right--not getting it done by Memorial Day, some \nartificial deadline that somebody somewhere set but getting this trade \nlegislation right.\n  The Senate has not given the underlying bill the attention and \ndeliberation it deserves. It has not given the amendment process the \nability to--let alone to work its way through but even to get off the \nground. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture and ensure that a \nreasonable number of amendments get considered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I can report there has been an all-night \neffort to try to work out this issue to bring parties together, \nparticularly around our colleagues being able to offer more amendments, \nand on the issue of the Export-Import Bank--something I favor very \nstrongly, and Senator Cantwell makes a very important point that we \nhave trade agreements, but it is also important to have financing \ntools, which is what the Export-Import Bank is all about. So we have \nbeen working throughout the night trying to address both of those \nissues, Export-Import Bank and the question of our colleagues being \nable to offer more amendments.\n  When you hear the words ``TPA'' and ``TPP,'' it sounds like a company \nthat has been through too many mergers,\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nbut the fact is these terms are enormously important to America's \neconomic future. Our markets are basically open. Many countries hit us \nwith double- and triple-digit tariffs on our exports. Export jobs often \npay better than the nonexport jobs do because there is a lot of value \nadded in the process.\n  The vote today will begin the efforts to replace the outdated trade \nrules of the 1990s with a modern set of trade rules that can help \nAmerica get more of those good-paying jobs.\n  When you talk about international trade, the first thing you have to \nfocus on is the estimate is, in the developing world, there are going \nto be about 1 billion middle-class consumers. Those are middle-class \nconsumers with money--money in their pockets--and they can buy American \ngoods and American services. They can buy our wonderful ag products \nlike Oregon wine. They can buy helicopters and bicycles and planes and \ncomputers. There is enormous affection around the world for buying the \nAmerican brand, for buying the Oregon brand.\n  With modern trade rules, we can make sure our exporters are able to \nget the kinds of goods and services that those billion middle-class \nconsumers are going to want to buy, and that is always what drives the \nmodern economy--middle-class consumers buying goods and services. One \nbillion people in the developing world are going to be middle class in \n2025.\n  Chairman Hatch is with me on the floor. What we have sought to do for \nnow about 7 months is replace the old 1990s playbook on trade with a \nmodern one. That is important because in the 1990s nobody had iPhones, \nnobody was texting. We are talking about a very different time.\n  Here is an example: Opponents have often, and I think with \nsubstantial legitimacy, talked about how there has been way too much \nsecrecy associated with trade. If you believe deeply in trade, as I do, \nand you want more of it, why would you want to have all this secrecy \nthat just leaves the American people with the view that something is \nbeing hidden back in Washington, DC?\n  So Chairman Hatch and I came together and put in place the most \ntransparent policies on trade in our country's history. For example, by \nlaw--by law--before the President of the United States signs the Trans-\nPacific Partnership, that document has to be public for 60 days before \nthe President signs it. On top of that, there are probably another 2 \nmonths that take place before anybody in the Senate or anybody in the \nHouse on the floor of those bodies actually votes. What that means--and \nI want to give the opportunity to my colleague to make closing \nremarks--what it means is, as part of the new day on trade policy--in \nthe past a lot of Americans were in the dark about trade policy. Now \nthey will be able to come to a townhall meeting of their elected \nofficials, such as the ones I plan to hold in a few days at home. The \nAmerican people will be able to come to a townhall meeting, and \nstarting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, have that \ndocument in their hands for close to 4 months before their elected \nrepresentative has to vote. That is what Chairman Hatch and I have \nsought to do in terms of coming up with a modern trade policy.\n  I think it is appropriate that my colleague--and I appreciate his \npartnership--will have a chance to wrap this up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my partner and his kind comments and his \nintelligent comments here this morning.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the \nfollowing amendments en bloc: 1, Boxer No. 1371; 2, Whitehouse No. \n1387; 3, Brown No. 1252, to level the playing field; 4, Feinstein No. \n1424; 5, Menendez No. 1430; 6, Paul No. 1383; 7, Paul No. 1408; 8, \nSullivan No. 1246; 9, Sessions No. 1233; 10, Cruz No. 1384; 11, Cardin \nNo. 1230; 12, Paul No. 1408.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, again, I \nappreciate the generosity of Senators Hatch and I think Wyden on this. \nSome 200 amendments have been filed by 46 Senators. We have had two \nvotes. We have six pending, but the six pending--they have had some \ninteresting adjustments in terms of second-degree amendments, in terms \nof not being actually called for votes. Now we have an offer of nine \nmore. That is a good step, but the majority leader came to the floor at \nthe end of the first full day of debate to file cloture to shut down \ndebate. We had only two votes all week.\n\n  I would like to have more votes. I think all of us on all sides of \nthe discussion on this debate--the pro-free-trade Republicans and the \nanti-free-trade Republicans, the pro-free trade Democrats and the \noverwhelming majority of Democrats who don't like the way the rules are \nunder TPA--would be willing to come together and pick out 20 or so \namendments of the 200 that have been offered by 46 different Senators \nand have that debate with time limits. We should do all of that.\n  Instead, we have nine amendments here. As I said--in case I didn't \nsay it three times--we have had only two votes so far. There are nine \namendments here. Most of these amendments--including level the playing \nfield, which seems to have unanimous support--level the playing field \nis nongermane. So if Senators vote for cloture now, then all of those \nnongermane amendments are dropped and most of these nine will not see \nthe light of day.\n  Madam President, I object to the UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I just want to point out that we tried to \nbring this bill up Thursday, then Friday. It was objected to. Then we \nbrought it up Monday. We only had two amendments. Then Tuesday, \nWednesday, and now today there have been logjams all the way through.\n  Now, look, I have been as fair as anybody could be. I have tried to \naccommodate my colleagues on the other side, and we were not making any \nheadway.\n  So I thought that by calling up these 12 amendments, that would \nresolve it. But if not, we should proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I would again reiterate our offer. I \ndon't know that I can do it exactly in a UC request. But I reiterate \nour offer that we sit down--that the leaders sit down--and discuss 15 \namendments a side--15 Republican amendments, 15 Democrat amendments--\nand that we have a serious negotiation without cloture hanging over our \nhead that will drop all of these nongermane, very serious enforcement \namendments.\n  We had a vote last Tuesday where for the first time in 25 years a \ntrade motion was actually defeated. The whole point of that vote was \nthat we wanted enforcement as part of TPA, TAA. That is what this has \nbeen all about.\n  But in this UC request, most of the enforcement--for instance, level \nthe playing field, but also some other things--will drop because they \nare nongermane.\n  I offer to Senator Hatch if there is a way of having this discussion \nand really moving forward----\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Hatch \n     amendment No. 1221 to H.R. 1314, an act to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a right to an \n     administrative appeal relating to adverse determinations of \n     tax-exempt status of certain organizations.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Orrin G. Hatch, Daniel \n           Coats, John Boozman, Thom Tillis, Mike Rounds, Pat \n           Roberts, Richard Burr, John Barrasso,\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\n           Mike Crapo, Jeff Flake, Tom Cotton, Shelley Moore \n           Capito, David Perdue, Chuck Grassley, Dan Sullivan.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nsubstitute amendment, No. 1221, offered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, to H.R. 1314, be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 62, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 183 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Capito\n     Carper\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Gardner\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kaine\n     Kirk\n     Lankford\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Perdue\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Shaheen\n     Sullivan\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Baldwin\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Hirono\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Paul\n     Peters\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 62, the nays are \n38.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am very happy the Senate has \ndecided to take another step forward on this very important initiative \nnot only of the President's but of the majority party's as well, and I \nthank the folks on the other side who are also similarly inclined.\n  Let me just make it clear. Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden have done \na terrific job. They are open to continuing to try to get amendments. \nWe still have the opportunity to do that. As everyone knows, it \nrequires some level of cooperation because anybody can object to \nsomebody else getting an amendment. But Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden \nare anxious to do additional business, to open it up for more \namendments, and with everybody's cooperation, that could be achieved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I think it would be appropriate--we have \ngotten to where we are--that we have a quorum call so we can find out \nwhere we are on amendments. There is agreement out there; we just have \nto see how we can get it arrived at. So I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, will the Senator withhold so I can make a \nshort speech, less than a minute?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Madam President, I thank all our colleagues for their support in \nhelping us get this far. This last vote was a major step forward on \nthis important legislation. We have a few more votes we are going to \nhave to do, and we are getting very close to maybe doing this very \nimportant bill. I hope that now that we have taken this step, we can \nfind a way to finish this legislation in short order, and I am willing \nto work with my colleagues to get us there.\n  Once again, I thank everyone who supported this today. It means a lot \nto me personally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson pertaining to the introduction of S. 1430 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the time, and I \nyield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we are going to be voting, we hope, on an \namendment that is called the antidocking amendment. It observes, by \nreading the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that there apparently is a path \nfor the executive branch to allow another country to become part of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership without a vote of Congress.\n  In other words, as to the world 's second largest economy, China, the \nadministration, this President or the next President, could decide \nthat, well, China should join the 12 countries already part of TPP if \nwe affirm this vote down the road with TPP.\n  If China could join--the second largest economy in the world--they \nwould backdoor, if you will, because of the administration's \nwillingness to do it, with no input from the public, with no input from \nthe Congress.\n  Our amendment is really simple. It sets up a process over a 90-day \nperiod. If a President wants to bring a country into the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, that country would have to meet certain criteria, the same \nkinds of criteria that we have seen with these 12 countries, including \nsex trafficking and some labor law and other things.\n  Then Congress would actually vote. Congress would get 90 days to \ndecide, up or down, whether a country can join TPP after it is up and \nrunning. The country that most concerns us, of course, is China. So \nwhen you hear this amendment discussed, you will hear China used as an \nexample, because its economy, obviously, is so large. It passed Japan \nas the world's second largest economy, I believe, a year or so ago.\n  We just want to make sure that our integrity and the integrity of \nthese 12 countries--12 other countries--is preserved. The way to do \nthat and for the public to be heard is that Congress has to make the \ndecision on whether another country can join.\n  That is what our so-called docking amendment does. I know Senator \nFranken is about to take the floor. I want to say a couple of other \nthings. This amendment is in no way meant to kill TPP. It simply spells \nout the process for future countries to join.\n  Here is exactly how the process would work. The President would \nnotify Congress about an intent to enter negotiations. It would require \ncertification from the two committees--Ways and Means in the House, \nFinance in the Senate. Then it would ultimately come to a Senate vote. \nThat is how this would work to protect, I think, the public interest \nand to give the public input into what countries actually join the TPP. \nIt makes sense, I think, for all countries involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM Act\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act of 2015. I am a proud cosponsor of this bicameral, \nbipartisan bill which brings much-needed reform to the Federal \nGovernment's surveillance programs, including an end to the bulk data \ncollection program that the intelligence community has said is not \nnecessary, that the public has said they don't support, and that the \nSecond Circuit has ruled as unlawful.\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n  I am particularly proud to have developed the bill's transparency \nprovisions with my friend Senator Dean Heller of Nevada. We are greatly \nindebted to Senator Lee and to Senator Leahy for their leadership and \ntheir tireless work.\n  Americans understand, as I do, that our job here is to strike an \nappropriate balance, making sure, on the one hand, that we are \nsafeguarding our national security, without trampling on our citizens' \nfundamental privacy rights, on the other hand. But the public cannot \nknow if we succeed in striking that balance if they do not even have \nthe most basic information about our major surveillance programs. That \nis why my focus has been on transparency, because I want to make sure \nthat the American people are able to decide for themselves whether we \nare getting this right.\n  I support the USA FREEDOM Act because it moves us in the right \ndirection on all of these fronts. On June 1, several national security \nauthorities will expire. The House acted responsibly and passed USA \nFREEDOM, a bill that reflects the combined efforts and agreement of \nRepublicans and Democrats, members of the intelligence and law \nenforcement communities, and advocates for privacy and civil liberties, \nas well as members of the tech sector and business communities.\n  This legislation ensures that the necessary authorities continue in \nforce through 2019, and it makes important reforms that will actually \nimprove national security. You do not need to take my word for that. \nThe Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General have \ntold us, in no uncertain terms, that we ought to pass the USA FREEDOM \nAct and promptly.\n  Yet some of my colleagues are attempting to present us with a choice \nbetween reauthorization of the soon-to-expire authorities with no \nreform whatsoever or complete expiration of those authorities. That is \nprofoundly unfortunate, because we have a compromise bill that has \noverwhelming support and was overwhelmingly approved by the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 338 to 88.\n  It draws broad-based support from business, from civil society, and \nwithin the government. I believe that the only thing that would stop \nthis bill from garnering similar strong bipartisan support here in the \nSenate is if Republican leaders who oppose this bill pressure my \nRepublican colleagues to filibuster. I really hope that does not \nhappen. I hope it does not happen because USA FREEDOM's reforms \nrepresent real and meaningful progress. The bill ends the old program \nfor the bulk collection of telephone metadata, which, according to \nreports discussed at a hearing last year, principally gathered call \nrecords from landlines. It replaces that program with a more targeted \napproach that permits the collection of call detail records, including \nprospective collection of those records. You get a warrant, and you \ncollect those prospectively, based on the government's reasonable, \narticulable suspicion of a link to international terrorism.\n  Now, I believe that is a much more sensible approach. I know that \nsome of my colleagues disagree. Last November, one of my colleagues \nsuggested that bulk collection is preferable to a targeted approach \nbecause American's privacy would be at risk if the government were \n``going to have to go to those companies and ask for the data.''\n  But of course, no matter what, we have to go to the companies and ask \nthem for the data. The records at issue here are the phone company's \nbusiness records. That is what they are. I should also note that those \ncompanies have both legal and business reasons for why they retain and \nprotect these records as they do, from the potential for billing \ndisputes to commercial analytics to regulatory concerns.\n  The FCC regulations require them to hold on to telephone call records \nfor 18 months. None of that has changed. It bears emphasizing that the \nrelationship USA FREEDOM calls for between phone companies and the \ngovernment is nothing new. Our Nation's law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies have long worked with phone companies to obtain \nspecific records, either historic or prospective records, when \nconducting domestic criminal investigations or carrying out sensitive \nnational security investigations such as FISA wiretaps.\n  So we have been doing this for a long time. The intelligence \ncommunity, national security, law enforcement experts, and American \nbusinesses, not to mention the House of Representatives, all understand \nthat we have to strike the right balance. We need to safeguard our \nnational security, but we need to do it in ways that do not unduly \ntread on privacy and civil liberties.\n  Leaders across these different public and private sectors have \nmanaged to come together to strike that balance in the USA FREEDOM Act. \nThat is where my work with Senator Heller comes in. We recognized that \nwhen the public lacks even a rough sense of the scope of the \ngovernment's surveillance programs, they have no way of knowing if the \ngovernment is getting that balance right. So there needs to be more \ntransparency.\n  Since the Snowden revelations came to light 2 years ago, a steady \nstream of news reports has provided details about NSA programs that \ncollect information about both foreign nationals and the American \npeople. Despite these disclosures, it remains impossible for the \nAmerican people to get even a basic sense of the real size and scope of \nthese programs. Americans still don't know the number of people whose \ninformation has been collected under these programs. They have no sense \nof the extent to which U.S. persons are affected and, particularly, \nhave no way of knowing how often the government has searched that \ninformation, such as call detail records of Americans. Senator Heller \nand I crafted transparency provisions to make sure Americans get that \nkind of information. That way the American people can better judge the \ngovernment's surveillance programs for themselves.\n\n  Under USA FREEDOM, the government will be required to issue detailed \nannual reports for each of the surveillance authorities at issue. \nImportantly, the government will have to tell the public how many \npeople have had their information collected, and for certain \nauthorities--like those permitting the targeted collection of call \ndetail records or the communications of foreigners abroad--the \ngovernment will also have to say how many times it has run searches for \nAmericans' data.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act doesn't just require the government to be more \ntransparent. We also make it possible for American businesses to \nprovide their customers with more information about what they are asked \nto turn over to the government. This is not only good for transparency, \nit is good for our economy. It has been estimated that the Snowden \nrevelations are costing American companies billions of dollars because \npeople have lost trust in those companies, often assuming that all \ncompanies are handing over all of their information to the government.\n  So by allowing companies to report the size and scope of the \ngovernment's requests, the public can get a better sense of what \ninformation is actually being turned over, and the bill makes clear \nthat a company that has not received any national security requests \nfrom the government is free to say so.\n  All of this will calm fears, both here and abroad, and allow American \ncompanies to better compete with their foreign counterparts.\n  The provisions Senator Heller and I wrote will expand the options \nthat companies have to issue their own transparency reports and allow \ncompanies to issue those reports more quickly. But we also listened to \nthe intelligence community to make sure we were striking the right \nbalance and ensuring that ongoing investigations are not jeopardized by \nadditional transparency.\n  Now, look, to get the broad, bipartisan support we needed, Senator \nHeller and I had to compromise a great deal. We didn't get everything \nwe wanted when we initially negotiated our provisions last year, and we \nhad to compromise further still this year, particularly with regard to \ngovernment reporting under section 702, which authorizes the \ncollection, for intelligence purposes, of communications of foreign \npersons abroad. I am disappointed the bill doesn't include all of the \nrequirements we agreed on last year and that were included in the \nSenate bill last Congress, which had 58 votes.\n  But I am committed to pressing my colleagues to revisit this issue in \nthe\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nfuture--hopefully before the sunset of section 702--in 2017. That, of \ncourse, is the Internet traffic of foreign persons abroad who are \nsuspected of being terrorists.\n  But in the meantime, the good news is that after all the give-and-\ntake, our provisions that did get included in the bill will usher in a \nnew era of transparency about our Nation's surveillance agencies. They \nwill allow the American public to see--on an annual basis--whether the \ngovernment really makes good on its promise to end bulk collection, and \nthey will give those of us in Congress important tools as we work to \ncontinually improve our country's laws.\n  The transparency provisions are an essential part of USA FREEDOM, and \nthe bill overall is a step in the right direction for reforming our \nNation's intelligence laws. It is a step that the House has already \ntaken on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. It is a step that the \nSenate should take as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on an amendment I \nhave filed regarding a crisis we are experiencing in the H-2B visas.\n  In North Carolina, we have a very large seafood industry, and we have \na crisis that is shared by a number of other States that have the \nseafood industry with respect to the availability of H-2B visas, and \nthe busy time is just about to start in a couple of weeks. It is the \nworst possible time for this industry.\n  We literally have jobs that have been created by people such as Don \nCross and his brother and their Pamlico Packing Company in Grantsboro, \nNC. They simply can't find workers to do this job. It is going to ruin \ntheir business, and it is unacceptable. These are jobs these folks have \ncreated, like the Crosses, and they can't be filled. The jobs are \nwaiting to be filled.\n  It is affecting other businesses we have in the shrimp and crab \nindustries, but it is also affecting other businesses--will affect \nother businesses--such as grocery stores, restaurants, and other \nindustries, like tourism, across the country.\n  The problem I have--and the nature of the amendment I will speak to \nbriefly--but I have reached out to the Department of Homeland Security \nto ask a series of questions, and I simply haven't received answers. \nThat is why I decided to offer an amendment--or to file the amendment.\n  DHS has refused to issue more work visas, even though the statutory \ncap of used visas has most likely not been reached. DHS claims the cap \nhas been reached, and that is really odd because it is unusually early \nfor them to take that position.\n  This is what I think the real truth is. Not every business applying \nfor these visas is using them. DHS normally approves more visas so we \nmake it more likely that we reach the cap, but we don't believe they \nhave done that this year.\n  That is why we have asked for an audit, to make sure we know how many \napplications were actually approved, how many visas are actually used \nby the State, within the State, and how many of those visas are \nactually putting legal, migrant, immigrant workers into these jobs.\n  This year, they haven't even done an audit. We simply want to know \nwhy.\n  I think DHS is playing games with the numbers, and I demand answers. \nDHS seems eager to help the illegal population get acclimated, but they \ndon't seem to place a priority on American businesses that need these \npeople to come and work in our seafood processing facilities, not only \nin North Carolina like Don Cross's Pamlico Packing Company but packing \ncompanies across the coast.\n  I have had a discussion with a number of Members on the other side of \nthe aisle. They share our concerns, and we are all working trying to \nsimply get the answers.\n  So what my amendment does is--until we get the answers, until we \nsolve the problem, we want to suspend the travel for all DHS employees \nto government conferences and symposiums until the Agency provides more \ntransparent data as to how the H-2B program is being administered for \nthis fiscal year and for the three previous fiscal years.\n  I want answers and I want action. We have businesses in North \nCarolina and across the country in the coastal States that need these \nworkers, and we want answers now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1381\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor and I, like my good \nfriend the Senator from Massachusetts, am very concerned about the lack \nof transparency in this whole process of the trade agreement, very \nconcerned.\n  I saw the TPP text. I went downstairs and I saw that. I have to say \nthe whole process was extremely disturbing to me. Members must go to a \nclassified room. Now, we do go to classified rooms, as a bipartisan \ngroup, on many issues that are very important to this country. I had \ngone down because I wanted to see for myself the transcript of the TPP, \nwhat they have dealt with and how far they are along right now in the \nnegotiations.\n  The viewing of the documents that are very technical in nature, as we \nall know, is oftentimes without a trade staffer with appropriate \nclearance. So here I am, I am not able to take staff--or only staff who \nhas had secured clearance, and it might not be the staff on my staff \nwho has the expertise in this, so that takes that equation away.\n  We are unable to take any notes to consider what we just saw unless \nwe have a photographic memory. Unfortunately, I do not. I have tried \nthe best I can to remember and look for things I knew I was looking \nfor. But still yet, it is almost impossible to walk out of there having \nthe ability to sit down and evaluate what you just saw, and then we are \nunable to talk to anyone about it--even to my staff, as I would like to \nget their input, since I have been, basically, looking at the details, \nand especially the public, too, has no idea about any issues that \nconcern them.\n  The secretive nature of the largest free-trade deal in America's \nhistory truly just lacks common sense. Let me explain. In July of 2001, \nPresident Bush at that time released the draft text of the Free Trade \nArea of the Americas Agreement, the FTAA. He did this months before he \nwas granted fast-track authority. He wasn't afraid to let us see it. He \nwasn't afraid to let the American public know what was in that. We were \nable to see it, and it didn't squelch the deal. It didn't harm \nanything.\n  They released the text of the FTAA, the different positions of 34 \ncountries in important areas such as intellectual property rights, \ninvestor-state dispute settlements, and antidumping duties--all very \nimportant to our country and the jobs we have in this country.\n  Now we have a massive 12-country trade agreement that is currently \nbeing negotiated, and the President wants us to grant him the fast-\ntrack authority before not only the American people have even seen the \ntext but mostly even our staffs whom we delegate to work on these \nintricate documents.\n  Our bill that we will be asking consideration for would simply \nrequire the President to release the scrubbed, bracketed text of any \ntrade agreement at least 60 days before Congress would grant the fast-\ntrack authority. This is pretty sensible, pretty reasonable. Just \nrelease the scrubbed document that you have agreed on so far 60 days \nbefore you ask us to give the fast-track authority.\n  Before any Member of Congress is asked to vote on the most expansive \nbill in U.S. trade history, the American people deserve to see what is \nin the bill. That is why they elect us, to make sure we are able to \nconfer with them, have a dialogue, and explain why we are or why we may \nnot be for a certain piece of legislation, especially a trade \nagreement.\n  If this bill is as good for the American worker as proponents have \nclaimed, then the administration and anybody else should not find it \nobjectionable to see the details before Congress is forced to grant the \nPresident trade promotion authority.\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n  I want to say, in my beautiful little State of West Virginia, as I go \nthrough it and we look back through the trade agreements that have \nalready been granted since NAFTA, we have not seen an uptick. In fact, \nwe have lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs. I, for one, am not willing to \nvote to put one more job in jeopardy in West Virginia.\n  That is the concern we have. So what we are asking for is a very \nmodest, very sensible, very reasonable, commonsense approach to how we \nshould do the job the people elect us to do and how it should be \ntransparent.\n  At this time I yield the floor to my friend, the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from West Virginia, \nSenator Manchin. I thank him for his leadership. I thank him for his \nindependence. I thank him for his partnership as we push for greater \ntransparency on this very important trade bill.\n  In the past few weeks, the public has heard a lot about the Trans-\nPacific Partnership, a massive trade deal the United States is \nnegotiating with 11 other trade companies. The public has heard from \nsupporters that it is the most progressive trade deal in history--a \ndeal that will benefit working families and small businesses--and they \nhave heard from opponents that it will only tilt the playing field \nfurther in favor of multinational corporations and leave workers and \neveryone else behind.\n  The public has heard a lot, but in all that time they have never \nactually seen the deal itself. In fact, the press hasn't seen the deal, \neconomists haven't seen the deal, legal experts haven't seen the deal. \nMost everyone in America hasn't seen the deal. Why? Because the \nadministration has classified the deal, making it illegal for any of \nthose people to read it.\n  Members of Congress, as Senator Manchin said, can read it so long as \nthey go into a secret room and don't leave with any notes. But even \nMembers of Congress are prohibited from talking about the details in \npublic or discussing the details with the people they were sent to \nWashington to represent. And yet, in the next day or two, the Senate is \nscheduled to vote on whether to grease the skids to make that secret \ntrade deal--the TPP--the law of the land.\n  This isn't how democracy is supposed to work. One of our fundamental \nprinciples of representative government is transparency. Our government \nis supposed to keep things secret from the people only if it has a very \ngood reason to do so. So why is this trade deal a secret? I just want \nto go over the answers I have heard so far, the reasons.\n  Some say the administration can't release the deal because the deal \nisn't finished yet. OK, so maybe there are some unresolved issues, but \neveryone agrees the deal is nearly complete. It is close enough to \nbeing done that its supporters can confidently claim it is the most \nprogressive trade deal in history. If you are sure that is right, then \nshow it to us. If some parts aren't finished, then show us the parts \nthat are finished. Don't keep every single word of the deal classified.\n  Others say releasing the text now would be tipping our hand in \ncontinuing negotiations, but that doesn't make any sense either. Our \ngovernment has already shared the details of our positions with the \nother TPP countries, and those countries have shared details with us. \nThat is how negotiations work. Publicly releasing what our negotiating \npartners have already seen couldn't possibly undermine our negotiations \nbecause, by definition, our negotiating partners have already seen it.\n  Here is another argument I have heard. Releasing the text of an \nunfinished international agreement simply isn't done; it is a breach of \nprotocol. Well, that is not true either. As Senator Manchin pointed \nout, in 2001, President George W. Bush publicly released the scrubbed \nbracketed text of the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas several \nmonths before seeking fast-track authority for that agreement. At the \ntime, his U.S. Trade Representative said that releasing the text \n``would increase public awareness and support for the trade deal.'' \nGuess what. Congress still approved that fast-track deal. Of course it \ncan be done. It has been done, and it should be done.\n  Still others say that publicly releasing the text would endanger \nstate secrets. Wow. But this agreement is not about nuclear weapons \nprograms or military operations. There isn't any national security \ninformation in this deal. This deal is about things such as copyright \nrules and labor standards. And I know the President doesn't think there \nis any sensitive national security information in the deal. That is why \nhe has already committed to publicly releasing the entire text. He just \nwon't do it until after Congress has already voted to grease the skids \nto make it law.\n  That brings us to the last justification--that we should all be \nsatisfied that the administration will release the text of the deal a \nfew months before Congress has to vote on whether to approve it. But by \nthen, Congress will have lost the ability to amend the deal, to stop \nthe deal, or to slow it down. In other words, by the time you--the \nAmerican public--can read the deal, your elected representatives will \nhave lost the ability to use your input to help shape that deal. That \nsounds like a lousy arrangement to me.\n  So if there are no good reasons for secrecy here, that leaves only a \nbad reason, and believe it or not, it is a reason I have heard people \ngive multiple times: We should keep the deal secret because if the \ndetails were made public now, the public would oppose it. Well, that is \nhow our democracy is supposed to work.\n  If the TPP is mostly done and the public wouldn't support it if they \ncould see it, then it shouldn't become the law. That is why I have \nintroduced a simple bill with my friend from West Virginia, Senator \nManchin. This bill would require the President to publicly release the \nscrubbed bracketed text of a trade deal at least 60 days before \nCongress votes on any fast-track for that deal. That would give the \npublic, the experts, and the press an opportunity to review the deal. \nIt would allow for some honest public debate. It would give Congress a \nchance to actually step in and block any special deals and giveaways \nthat are being proposed as part of this trade deal before Congress \ndecides whether to grease the skids to make that deal the law.\n  If this trade deal is so great, if it will work so well for America's \nworkers and small businesses, then make it public. We should pass this \nbill today and give the American people some time to read the deal \nbefore we tie ourselves to fast-track.\n  Whether you support fast-track or oppose it, whether you support TPP \nor oppose it, we should all agree that we should have a robust, \ninformed debate on something that is this important. Anything less is a \ndisservice to the people who sent us here to work for them.\n  So I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the Committee on \nFinance be discharged from further consideration of S. 1381, that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one concern \nI have heard from opponents of the trade promotion authority is that \ntrade agreements currently under discussion have been negotiated behind \nclosed doors and that by renewing TPA, Congress would be enabling and \neven encouraging further secrecy.\n  I am going to talk more on this in a minute, but there are 30 days \nbefore the President signs, 60 days after he signs where this will \nbecome well known. So I have to object to my dear colleagues' bill--I \nguess it is a bill at this time. I just have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard this concern from opponents of \ntrade promotion authority from time to time--that trade agreements \ncurrently under discussion have been negotiated behind closed doors and \nthat by reviewing TPA, Congress would be enabling and even encouraging \nfurther secrecy. These arguments are particularly being made about the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is not\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\nbefore us. Of course, we need to keep in mind that every Senator \ncomplaining about this supposed secrecy associated with TPP has had an \nopportunity to read through the current text of the agreement. And the \nagreement is not yet concluded. It won't be unless we pass TPA.\n  At the same time, I would be very surprised if these same Senators \ndecrying the secrecy of the TPP negotiations also believe that contract \nnegotiations between unions and management should be made public or \nthat it would be a wise negotiating tactic for a private citizen \nnegotiating the sale of their home to post all the offers they have \nreceived on the Internet.\n  My point is that in the midst of any high-stakes negotiation, some \nlevel of confidentiality is essential to getting a good deal, and \nespecially in this case.\n  That said, I certainly understand the concerns about transparency, \nparticularly when our government is negotiating on behalf of our \ncountry. Fortunately, our TPA bill strikes a good balance to address \nthese very concerns. Our TPA bill goes further than any previous \nversion of TPA to promote transparency and congressional oversight of \nthe whole trade negotiation process.\n  First of all, under our bill, the full text of a completed trade \nagreement must be made public at least 60 days before the President can \neven sign it, giving the American people unprecedented access and \nknowledge of all trade agreements before they are signed and well \nbefore they are submitted to Congress.\n  In addition, the President must submit to Congress the legal text of \na trade agreement and a statement of administrative action at least 30 \ndays before submitting an implementing bill.\n  On top of that, our bill ensures that any Member of Congress who \nwants access to the unredacted negotiated text at any time during the \nnegotiations will get it. In addition, Members of Congress will--once \nagain, at any time during the negotiations--be able to request and \nreceive a briefing from the U.S. Trade Representative's office on the \nstatus of the negotiations.\n  Our bill also creates in statute a transparency officer at USTR who \nwill consult with Congress and advise the USTR on transparency \npolicies. This will help ensure that there are consistent transparency \npolicies across the Agency and promote greater public understanding of \ntrade negotiations.\n  Now, let's be clear. I, as well as other authors of this legislation, \nunderstand the concerns we have heard from both inside and outside \nCongress about the need for greater transparency in the trade \nnegotiation process. We have really worked hard to address these \nconcerns in this legislation, and in particular the concerns of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who is a good friend, whom I \nadmire, and who I think has brought a certain dimension to this Senate \nthat is very important.\n  In short, any Member of Congress who is concerned about a lack of \ntransparency in trade negotiations should be a cosponsor of this TPA \nbill--that is, of course, if they are also supporters of expanded \nmarkets for U.S. exporters and the creation of high-paying American \njobs. Those who oppose TPA and trade agreements outright will likely \ncontinue to use this supposed lack of transparency as an excuse to \noppose the bill.\n  Those with genuine concerns will see that this bill is the right \napproach. And we have tried to make it the right approach. I believe it \nis the right approach. I believe the administration says it is the \nright approach. I know the Trade Representative says it is the right \napproach. He has bent over backwards to inform us and to open his \noffice and to open matters into these not-yet-concluded agreements.\n  There is plenty of time for us to look at those agreements--any \nagreement that comes--and make up our own determinations at that time. \nSo I don't believe the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts will be \ndeprived of an ability to look into these matters, completely test the \ntransparency, and look at these agreements in ways that I think would \nplease any reasonable person.\n  With that, I have had to object, but I hope we can pursue this bill \nand get it through as soon as we can because it will be a banner day \nfor the President, I have to admit. He is my President, but he is not \nmy party; yet, he is right on this. For the life of me, I can't \nunderstand why we are having so much difficulty with his and my friends \non the other side. We ought to be supporting a President who has bent \nover backwards, through his Trade Representative and those around him, \nto be as open as he possibly can on this matter, at least at this \nparticular time and I believe afterwards as well.\n  I always feel bad when I have to object to a person's unanimous \nconsent request, but I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Will my good friend the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, I have the utmost respect for you and the job \nyou do here every day for all of us. I appreciate that. But we have a \ndifference here. My difference is that I have to look at the people in \nWest Virginia--fewer than 2 million people--who depend on the \nopportunity to make a living for themselves, and they have hard, strong \nfeelings about what we have done over the years in trade agreements. \nThey haven't seen an uptick in opportunity for themselves or their \nfamilies.\n  With that being said, what we have asked for here, the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I, is not something that has never been done before. \nI can't explain why President George W. Bush would have done this. \nMaybe it was on his own volition, saying: I am going to put out this \nagreement that has been scrubbed. Basically everything has been agreed \non. We will let you see it and discuss it--the American people and the \nSenate and Congress that represents those people--to see if we have \ntotal buy-in and support. If not, we can make some adjustments and \nchanges.\n\n  He did that. That is really what we have asked for here. I respect \nyour right to object, and I understand the process here. But the \nAmerican people don't have input into this, and it has a 51-vote \nthreshold from this day forward. So any of us who have any objections \nor maybe have something that would enhance this bill don't have that \nopportunity. That is the reason we have asked for this.\n  I know the Senator was here and was very much involved in 2001. What \nwas your position or your opinion when President Bush released a draft \ntext of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the FTAA? Do you recall, \nby any chance?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't personally recall that at this time, other than \nthat it did pass.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. He let everybody see it months ahead of time before he \nwas granted the fast-track authority. He never even asked for TPA until \nhe released it. And I am sure that you were in the majority at the \ntime, and everyone had to support that position, I would think.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would yield--yes, we did. We supported the \nPresident's position, if I recall correctly. There is nothing that says \nthe President can't do that. But this bill says he must at least do \ncertain things.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. That is because he hasn't offered it to us.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a 6-year bill.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. It is a 3-3. You are right.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is going to be another President in 2016, whether \nRepublican or Democrat or otherwise.\n  So there is nothing that says the President can't do that, but we are \nmaking sure he does do that. We have done it because of questions that \nhave been raised by people such as the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and you. We think we have put reasonable time constraints \nin there, especially since you can review the TPP as it exists--\nalthough that may or may not be the final agreement. You can review \nthat now, if you want, and that is well in advance of it.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, again, I know you understand it. I am sure you \nprobably have gone down into the secured room and maybe have looked \nthrough some parts yourself. But it is quite an onerous process. I \ncouldn't take my staff person who had expertise in that arena because \nhe did not have that clearance. So I had to go in, and I couldn't take \nnotes out. Then on top of that, I couldn't even speak to him\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nabout what I saw because he didn't have that clearance.\n  I have never been through something like this. For me to go home to \nWest Virginia and say, with all full knowledge and my ability to make a \ndecision on the facts I have in front of me, that I support or I do not \nsupport it for these reasons--I can't really do that. I am not really \nsure if I could support it. Maybe I can support TPP. But I am really \nobjectionable to TPA by not having that opportunity to have input in \nTPP.\n  I think that is where I fall. And with a 51-vote threshold, I am not \ngoing to have any input to represent the people of West Virginia. With \nall due respect, that is where I am on this.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand the distinguished Senator. Let me say that we \nall have to make our own individual decisions here.\n  I would encourage you to reconsider because I think we have a good \nbill that is far better than it has been in the past. Frankly, it is \nyour administration that is putting this forward, and I am doing \neverything I can to help this administration get this through.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I understand.\n  Mr. HATCH. Remember that this is the procedural mechanism that gives \nCongress the right to really know what is going on and to really look \nat these matters. That is why we put in these particular provisions, \nwhich, as far as I know, are better than they have ever been. So \nMembers of Congress will have an opportunity to know what is in these \nbills. I don't know fully what is in TPP, myself, and I am going to be \none of the most interested people on Earth when that comes, if not the \nmost interested, and when we finally agree. It is still not a completed \nagreement, as far as I know.\n  All I can say is I think we provide enough time in this bill for \nanybody who is sincere enough and dedicated enough to look at it.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, if you do see something, let's say, as the bill \nunfolds and comes to its completion, that you really think is going to \nharm the people of Utah, you are not going to have any input to change \nthat harm. And it is only going to take 51 votes to pass it, even if \nharm is in there for Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will have the ability to take this floor, and those in \nthe House to take the House floor, and fight against it if you disagree \nwith it and it starts to get 51 votes.\n  The administration knows that. They know they can't do a slovenly \nagreement. They have got to do a good agreement in order to get both \nsides up here to, in a bipartisan way, accept the agreement for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I just feel very strongly that this most reasonable \nthing that we have asked for is something that was done under President \nBush. I think it was in his wisdom to put it out there before. There \nwas nothing to hide.\n  If we looked into their dialogue back at that period of time, they \nfelt it was necessary, as Senator Warren mentioned, to get the public's \nbuy-in, to get support from the public. So they were proud of what they \nput into it.\n  I am not saying things in here aren't good and won't be good for this \ncountry. But there might be some things that could be improved upon \nthat would make it much better for this country.\n  I have lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. It is hard when I \ngo through my State and I look at people struggling. The jobs have not \nreturned. They have not come to our little State. We did not see the \nuptick.\n  I am not saying my State represents every State, but I am sure there \nare parts of every State that have been hit pretty hard by this, and we \nwant to make sure we get this one right. That is all we have asked for.\n  So I am sorry you had to object. I hope you understand our position \non this.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do, and I appreciate the distinguished Senator and his \nefforts to represent his State. I know he does a very good job. I know \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts is doing a very good job. We are \nfriends. This isn't going to change that. All I can say is that we \ndisagree respectfully. I think I have made this as palatable as we \npossibly could under the circumstances.\n  The point I have been making is that the agreement is available 60 \ndays before it is even signed. So it isn't as if people will not have a \nchance to look at it or to fight against it or talk to the President--\nwhoever that might be.\n  The fact of the matter is that I am not sure that it should be longer \nthan 60 plus 60 plus, I think, another 60.\n  So all I can say is that I have to object, as manager of this bill. I \nnever feel good about objecting to something my colleagues want. I \nrespect your desire to have as much information as you can. I respect \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Would the Senator be kind enough to yield for a question \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts if I would yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I yield for the Senator from Massachusetts for the \npurpose of a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I just want to say to the Senator from \nUtah how much I respect his leadership in this Senate and his \nleadership on so many important issues.\n  All I want to say about this is that we are just asking for the trade \ndeal to be made public before we have this crucial vote about whether \nthere will be any opportunity in the future to amend the trade deal, to \nslow down the trade deal or--as the Senator from West Virginia says--if \nwe really find objectionable parts, to be able to block it. We are just \nasking for some transparency before we have this crucial vote on the \nTPA. We don't want to see fast-track until the American public can \nevaluate the deal. That is all we are asking for at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like the floor. But I would yield the floor to \nSenator Hatch, and then ask my friends to stay on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3212-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Warren and \nManchin, because what they tried to do here is to give to the American \npeople the same opportunity they had when George W. Bush was President \nand a trade deal was being negotiated. Before fast-track came up, \neverybody saw the deal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor \nto their bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate that. I am proud to stand with them on this. \nAnd I do respect Senator Hatch. He is my dear friend. But let's be \nclear. When you go down to that secret room--and I had the same \nexperience as Senator Manchin. I couldn't take the proper staffers \nbecause they didn't have the clearance.\n  This isn't about fighting ISIS or the war in Syria or any other very \nhigh security matter. It is about a trade deal that is supposed to be \nnegotiated in the best interests of the people of this country.\n  All my friends are saying is that before we give this President the \nability to fast-track this deal, let's look at it. Here is what happens \nwhen he gets fast-track authority: Not one Member of this Senate and \nnot one Member of the House can offer any amendment whatsoever.\n  I think the Senator from West Virginia was very clear on the point. \nWhat if we find out that there is something horrible in there for our \nState?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts pointed out that there are whole parts \nof this deal--and I know I am not speaking out of turn here--where it\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\njust says that they are still being negotiated. So how the heck do we \nknow what we are even voting on? And here we have given away the store \nin this last vote so that we will not have an opportunity to make it \nbetter.\n  When my friend talked about how many jobs were lost in West Virginia \nafter NAFTA, my heart sank. Those are a lot of jobs in a smaller State. \nMy State is a large State. We lost about 80,000-plus jobs. That is a \nlot. We are a larger State, though.\n  Percentagewise, you had 2 million and at the time we had about 30 \nmillion. So in terms of percentages, your people suffered mightily. But \nwe suffered mightily. More than 80,000 families lost their jobs.\n  I don't want to keep my colleagues on the floor, but I am only going \nto speak for 60 seconds more because my colleague from Delaware is such \na pal and said I could go before him.\n  I have a very simple amendment I am fighting to get a vote on. Listen \nto what it is. It simply says you cannot get fast-track authority to \nnegotiate with any country that doesn't pay at least a $2 minimum wage. \nI ask the people who are watching this debate here and at home: Do you \nknow that out of the 12 countries we are negotiating with, 7 of them \nhave less than a $2 minimum wage?\n  Let me be specific. Chile has a $1.91 minimum wage. Malaysia has a \n$1.21 minimum wage. Peru has a $1.15 minimum wage. Mexico has an 80-\ncent minimum wage.\n  Do you remember NAFTA? Let's do NAFTA. It is going to raise the \nstandard of living in Mexico, and the Mexican people won't come across \nthe border. We had all those factory jobs leave. And in this, Mexico is \npart of this deal.\n  How about Vietnam? 58 cents. And how about Brunei and Singapore? They \nhave no minimum wage.\n  What kind of a chance do our workers have? I don't care how \nproductive they are. We have the most productive workers. The people in \nthese countries are very smart. They are terrific.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor on that amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor on \nthat amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely, I am very proud to have Senator Warren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What kind of chance do our workers have? Do you think a \nmanufacturer in their right mind is going to stay here when they can go \nto Vietnam and have some terrific people?\n  I know the Vietnamese community in my home State is fantastic. They \nare fantastic leaders. They are fantastic workers. It is sad that the \nones who are left behind earn 58 cents an hour. What chance do our \nworkers have?\n  Now, we have 12 million manufacturing jobs left in this Nation of \nours--this greatest of Nations. What kind of chance do they have? Do \nyou know that I cannot get this amendment up for a vote? I think I know \nthe reason. They do not want to have to vote against it. I am still \nhopeful. I am holding out hope. I am fighting for it. But it seems to \nme when you are saying to the American people: Do you want your Senator \nto have to go downstairs to a secure room, give up your electronics to \na clerk, be told that if you take notes you have to leave them behind \nso the clerk can read it, but your staff cannot read it, you cannot \ndiscuss it with the people who do not have top clearance for the trade \nagreement?\n\n  Then, you have to have the amendment that Senators Warren and Manchin \nhave offered, which simply says: Make the trade agreement public before \nwe give exceptional fast-track authority to any President. I do not \ncare who it is--Democrat or Republican--this is not a partisan issue.\n  I have voted for half of the trade agreements, so I have voted for \nmany trade agreements but not with countries that pay slave wages. \nLet's be clear.\n  This is a tough day for the U.S. Senate. I know we have been split up \nevery which way on this, but I think there are certain things we have \nlearned from this debate: Secrecy is no good. I respect my President. I \nhave talked to him. I know in his heart he is doing what he thinks is \nright, but when he says this is not secret and everyone has access to \nit, I say to my President and I say to my friend Senator Hatch: This is \nnot an open process.\n  The secrecy is ludicrous. It is ridiculous. It is against the \ninterests of the people we represent. I represent close to 40 million \npeople. As Senator Manchin said, those people count on us, but if we do \nnot know what is in an agreement, how can we be wise about what we want \nto say about it and what we want to do about it?\n  I want to thank my friends for coming down here this afternoon. I \nknow this is hard on the Senate. We are going to probably be here a \nvery long time. But the fact is that people depend on us, and I am \nproud to stand with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3213-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3213-S3216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OUR COUNTRY'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss the \nneed to strengthen the transportation system of our country, our roads, \nour highways, our bridges--our transportation system. A long time ago, \nthe question was asked: What is the role of government? If you ask 500 \npeople, you probably will not get 100 different answers, but you will \nget a lot of different answers.\n  Abraham Lincoln was once asked: What is the role of government? This \nis what he said: The role of the government is to do for the people \nwhat they cannot do for themselves. Let me say that again. The role of \ngovernment is to do for the people what they cannot do for themselves.\n  Sometimes I go to schools and young students ask me: What do you do? \nThe kids in elementary schools, third, fourth, fifth graders say: What \ndo you do?\n  I tell them I am a United States Senator.\n  They say: What do you do?\n  I tell them I help make the rules for our country. We call them laws. \nI do that with 99 other Senators, 435 Representatives, the President, \nand the Vice President.\n  They say: Well, what else do you do?\n  I tell them I help people. I help people. The best way to help \nsomebody is to make sure they have a job--to make sure they have a job.\n  I had the privilege of being Governor of Delaware for 8 years. I am \ntold that in those 8 years, more jobs were created in Delaware than any \n8 years in Delaware history. I did not create one of them.\n  We have seen in the last 6-plus years in this country some 12 million \njobs created. I did not create one of them. My colleagues did not \ncreate those jobs. The President and the Vice President did not create \nthose jobs.\n  What we are responsible for doing here is to create a nurturing \nenvironment for job creation, access to capital--to money--for \nbusinesses that need to raise money, a world-class workforce, public \nsafety, clean environment, public health, a Tax Code that is fair and \nreasonable, regulations that embody common sense and reflect common \nsense.\n  We actually have, believe it or not, on each of our desks on the \nfloor, a book. It is called the ``Senate Manual.'' We do not look at it \nthat often, but if you go to one of the sections about two-thirds of \nthe way through the book, you will find the Constitution. The \nConstitution lays out who is responsible for what generally in our \ncountry, for different responsibilities that do fall on government.\n  There is a section in the Constitution--I am not going to read it, \nbut Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma has oftentimes referred to it--where \nit talks about the obligation and responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment to post roads--post roads. For years, that has been read and \ninterpreted to mean to build some roads, some highways, and some \nbridges.\n  As time goes by, we have more and more people to build transit \nsystems as well. As it turns out, as we go along in time--after being a \ncountry for almost 225 years or so, one of the most important things \nthat we do in creating a nurturing environment for job creation and job \npreservation is to make sure our country has transportation systems--\nroads, highways, bridges, transit\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nsystems--that are worthy of this great Nation that we are.\n  As a former Governor--as I like to say, a recovering Governor--but as \na former Governor, I have seen the impact roads, highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems have on the economic growth and success in my State, \nthe region in which we live, and across this country. It is how we move \npeople. It is how we move goods. It is the key to an efficient and \ngrowing economy.\n  For more than a decade, however, we have faced funding shortfalls for \nthe Federal highway trust fund. This stop-and-go funding and lack of \nuncertainty has undermined--has undermined--the potential for economic \ngrowth in America for years. That has to stop.\n  In fact, since 2008, we had to transfer nearly $65 billion out of the \ngeneral fund--nearly $65 billion out of the general fund--which is far \nfrom running a surplus, to patch holes in the highway trust fund.\n  I like to use the example of the glasses. We have glasses here that \nthe pages are nice enough to fill with water and to bring for us from \ntime to time. I would like for this glass to be the Federal highway \ntrust fund. It is empty. There is another glass here. This is the \ngeneral fund of the United States. It is empty. We have another glass \nover here that is full. It is full. When the general fund is empty and \nthe transportation fund, the highway fund are empty, what we do is we \ngo to this glass over here and say: How about some water? How about \nsome money?\n  We borrow money all over the world--all over the world. One of the \nplaces we borrow a lot of it is China. When the Chinese lend us money, \nthey do not want to be bothered when we feel they may have been \nmanipulating their currency.\n  They will say to us: We thought you wanted to borrow money, so leave \nus alone on currency manipulation. They may say: Leave us alone when it \ncomes to taking unfair advantage in terms of trade. When the Chinese \nare pushing around the Vietnamese in the Philippines in the South China \nSea--where I used to fly as a flight officer--they would say: You \ncannot do that.\n  And the Chinese might respond: Well, we thought you wanted to borrow \nour money.\n  We find ourselves in a very difficult position to be obligated to a \nlender that is doing things that we think are inappropriate or wrong.\n  Unfortunately, with the example like the one I have just given you, \nthis actually does happen.\n  We have not had a transportation bill that lasts for more than 2 \nyears for, I think, now 7 years. It used to be commonplace that every 6 \nyears we would pass a fund, a transportation bill, for our country. We \ncall it the highway bill, but it was for roads, highways, and for \ntransit systems--every 6 years, almost like clockwork.\n  The money provided by the Federal Government provides roughly one-\nhalf of all the money that is spent in the State highway budget, State \nhighway transportation budget. Half of that money is Federal money \nappropriated by the Congress and approved by the President.\n  Why we have not had a transportation bill that lasted for more than 2 \nyears, since 2008--we have passed some short-term funding provisions \nand authorization provisions for transportation that lasts as little as \na few days--a few days. This undercuts Governors and undercuts mayors \naround the country. It prevents them from making long-term investments \nin critical transportation projects.\n  Let me give a good example. State Route 1 Delaware runs from I-95 to \nthe north, north-south, right past Dover, our State capital, passing \nDover Air Force Base, and heads on down to the southern part of our \nState, where we raise more chickens and soybeans in Sussex County, DE, \nthan any other county in America. It is a county that has more five-\nstar beaches than anywhere else in America.\n  When I had the privilege of being Governor of Delaware, we actually \nbuilt, modernized, and expanded State Route 1. We replaced about 40 \ntraffic lights with a four- or five- or six-lane limited access highway \nthat cuts not in half but greatly eliminates bottlenecks and expedites \nthe flow of traffic in my State. It took over a decade--maybe a dozen \nyears--from start to finish.\n  Why did it take that long? It is because these projects need some \nthings. You have to take some time to plan the project. You have to \ntake some time to fund the project. You have to take time to contract \nthe project through competitive bids. You have to get the permits for \nthe project. Sometimes there is litigation to work through. It is part \nof what has to be done to build a major road, highway or bridge in a \nState. It does not take just a few weeks to do this. It does not take \njust a few months to do this. It can take years.\n  In the case of State Route 1--in a little State--it took years, \nroughly a dozen of them. And without the certainty in the future that \nthe Federal funding will be there for a project that is almost \nimpossible to do it well and, frankly, without that kind of certainty, \nit is really expensive to do these projects. Stop-and-go. ``Stop-and-\ngo'' means stop and pay lot more money for the projects we are trying \nto build.\n  Yet even though we know our States, our counties, our cities, and our \nbusinesses are counting on us in this body to do our jobs, we let them \ndown time and time again. What is worse is that Congress has known \nabout this problem for just about a decade--for almost a decade.\n  It was in 2005 that Congress included provisions in transportation \nlegislation to create not one but two blue ribbon commissions. For what \npurpose? Will it help us to figure out how to pay for highways, \nbridges, and transit systems which we are not smart enough to figure \nthis out? Why don't we put together some commissions and let the \nexperts come in and they can help us out? We received the reports and \nthe recommendations. We just never acted on them.\n  In 2008, these two Commissions delivered reports summarizing the \nadvice of countless experts and giving us a roadmap to fixing the \nproblems for good. Among all of their recommendations, one idea was \nstressed above all the rest: gradually raise transportation user fees \nand then index them to inflation going forward.\n  Despite understanding the problem and the smartest solutions for \nnearly a decade, we have only shirked our responsibility to agree on a \nsolution again and again.\n  Rather than take advantage of those blue ribbon ideas, we have \ncontinued to kick the can down the road, continued to avoid doing what \nvoters sent us here to do; that is, to make decisions, tough decisions, \nin the best interests of our country.\n  I stand here today to say it is high time we finally take care of \nbusiness and do the job the American people sent us here to do.\n  My concern about this issue should come as no surprise to any of my \ncolleagues. For years I have been outspoken about my desire to fully \nfund a multiyear transportation bill.\n  Government does have a clear role in ensuring that our country has \nmodern, high-quality roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. \nThat is why the Framers of our Constitution had the good sense to as \nmuch as say so in that Constitution. Unfortunately, it seems to me that \nour courage and willingness to fulfill this responsibility continues to \nescape us. Instead, we avoid tough choices and simply do things such as \nsmooth pensions or steal Customs fees. Sometimes we will steal Customs \nfees that are not due for maybe 6, 7, 8 years into the future, and we \nsteal that future money and use it to pay for a couple of months' worth \nof road, highway, and bridge construction today. We borrow mine safety \nfunds. We apply other bandaids as well.\n  The standard justification for each of these short-term patches has \nbeen that we need just a little more time to work out the details of a \nlong-term plan. Just give us a little more time, and we will work this \nout. But, as usual, during the 10 months we gave ourselves when we \npassed the last short-term extension, which, as I recall, was early \nlast August--the 12th time we have done this in 6 years, in case anyone \nhas lost count--we have come no closer to a solution.\n  The Washington Post last summer may have put it best, and here is \nwhat they said: ``Congress doesn't need more time, Congress needs more \nspine.''\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\n  Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing \nsomething over and over again and expecting a different result. Today, \nI am asking our colleagues to join me and others to help stop this \ninsanity. If we work together, I know we can find a way to invest in \nthe 21st-century transportation system our States, our cities, and our \nbusinesses deserve and need in order to compete in a global \nmarketplace. In an effort to do just that, Senator Boxer and I have \nintroduced a measure that would at least get us started, taking a \nconstructive step that would align the expiration of transportation \nprograms with the funding available in the highway trust fund.\n  What we have right now is that at the end of this month, the \nauthorization for spending Federal money for these roads, highways, \nbridges, and transit projects--the authorizations to spend that money \nexpires, effectively stopping the use of Federal money for these \npurposes at the end of this month. We can't let that happen.\n  The authorization ends at, we will say right here, the end of May, in \nabout 10 days. Meanwhile, the actual funds in the transportation trust \nfund, the highway trust fund, are good until the end of July. So the \nlegislation Senator Boxer has joined me in introducing says: At least, \nif we do nothing else, let's align the end of the authorization--now \nMay 31--to the end of the funding so that we can at least continue the \nwork that is being done in States across the country in the meantime. \nIf we work together, I know we can find a way forward.\n  We have introduced this legislation, and this adjustment will keep \nthe Congress from putting this issue, we hope, on the back burner yet \nagain.\n  We hope this will increase the likelihood that we can finally sit \ndown and come to a long-term solution not this fall, not next year, but \nthis summer. I know there are some who say: Well, let's just push this \noff until December. We have done that before and we can do that again. \nI just say to my friends, we have a way of--we are getting to the \nelections. We are getting into the election cycle for President later \nthis year. Maybe there are some who feel that will be helpful to us in \nfinding a way to come together and funding a transportation project. I \nwould beg to differ. I think if we don't get it done sooner rather than \nlater, if we don't make those tough decisions now, we are not going to \nmake them when the caucuses are gathered in Iowa and the primary voters \nare starting to get riled up in New Hampshire and South Carolina. That \nis not going to help us do our jobs.\n  There is a friend of mine who likes to talk about stopgap funding and \nthe need to make a long-term commitment to America's growth and \nsuccess. He says it is something like what we do now. It is something \nlike taking a road trip--maybe a summer road trip across the country--\nstopping to fill up our cars, our trucks, our minivans with gas 1 \ngallon at a time. Instead of filling up, we stop at a gas station and \nwe get 1 gallon, and then we go down the road and a little while later \nwe stop at another gas station and we buy another gallon. It is \nwasteful. It wastes time. It wastes money. It is no way to take a trip \nacross the country with your family, and I can assure my colleagues it \nis no way to build a transportation system for a world-class power--\nAmerica.\n  In any event, as I said earlier, I took two or three ideas away from \nthe elections last year. No. 1, Americans want us to work together; No. \n2, they want us to get things done; and No. 3, they want us to do \neverything we can to enhance and strengthen our economic recovery.\n  Finally finding an agreement on a way to pass a fully funded 6-year \ntransportation bill would help us do all three. We would demonstrate \nthat we can work together. We would demonstrate that we can get things \ndone for States and cities and counties across America. No. 3, we \nreally would strengthen our economic recovery. We wouldn't just put \n600,000 or 700,000 people to work across America building roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit systems; we would do a lot more than \nthat. That is important. A lot of jobs need to be filled, and a lot of \npeople would love to have those jobs.\n  As it turns out, the McKinsey Global Institute recently reported that \nmaking a major effort to repair and improve our roads, highways, \nbridges, and transit systems could add about 1.5 percent to our annual \nGDP growth and create at least 1.8 million jobs. Let me say that again. \nMaking a major effort to repair and improve our roads, highways, \nbridges, and transit systems could add about 1.5 percent to annual GDP \ngrowth. Keep in mind that GDP growth I think in the last quarter was \nonly about 1 percent. This kind of investment could add another 1.5 \npercent to annual GDP growth and create almost 2 million jobs.\n  By failing to pass a long-term transportation bill, we are \nsacrificing this potential growth and job creation. It is a little bit \nlike leaving money on a table--in this case, a lot of it on a table.\n  The Federal Government shares the responsibility with State \ngovernments to make investments in their aging infrastructure. As I \nsaid earlier, the Federal Government--when States spend money on roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit systems, whether it is in New Hampshire \nor Delaware, roughly half of that money is coming from the Federal \nGovernment. Our States are counting on us to be a partner in funding \nour transportation systems that the families and businesses we \nrepresent count on every day. When a Federal policy fails to plan for \nthe future, we leave these people in the lurch.\n  The highway trust fund has several dedicated revenue streams in the \nform of various user fees, as we know. These fees haven't been adjusted \nin over two decades. During that time, the purchasing power of \ntransportation has nearly been cut in half. There have been increases \nin the price of concrete, asphalt, steel, and labor. The 18.3-cent \nFederal gas tax that we set up in 1993 is now worth less than a dime. \nThe 24-cent diesel tax is worth less than 15 cents.\n  The Congressional Budget Office put together the chart here on my \nleft that shows the growing difference between the highway trust fund, \nthe money we put out for transportation projects, and the money we take \nin from user fees. I would say we were doing reasonably good from 1998 \nto 2014. Every 6 years, we see it go up and then it drops down, and \nthen it goes up and then it drops down. That is a 6-year transportation \nauthorization bill.\n  Look what happened starting this year.\n  I might add that over the last several years, a lot of this money was \njust transferred out of the general fund, not money we actually raised. \nThen we borrowed most of that money from around the world.\n  But we get to the year 2015, and look what happens. At the end of the \nyear, every year up through 2025, this will be the shortfall. I think \nit adds up to about $140 billion by 2020. One does not have to be an \naccountant to know we have a problem when what we are spending outpaces \nwhat we collect more and more each year.\n  We need to find a long-term solution that we can agree on to fix this \nproblem, and we need to do it this summer. We don't need to do it this \nfall. We don't need to do it next winter. We need to do it this summer. \nAgain, I talked about kicking the can into a Presidential election \nyear. If we don't do it this summer, my fear is we won't do it at all--\nat least not a long-term bill.\n  Many of my colleagues have said we must wait until we can enact \ncomprehensive tax reform that creates revenues to solve this problem. \nAs a strong supporter of tax reform, I hope we can find a way to reform \nour Tax Code, find a way to generate some revenues that can be used to \ninvest in the country's roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. \nAs I understand, this idea has support from not only President Obama \nbut also from the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, \nand that is encouraging.\n  One thing I know for sure is that this idea is a lot better than \nkicking the can down the road. Let's be honest--we have been talking \nabout tax reform for years. It is one of the most complicated problems \nCongress is facing. We can't just wait around letting our highways and \ntransit systems that people count on deteriorate while we negotiate the \nincredibly tough decisions surrounding tax reform efforts. Furthermore, \ntax reform only offers one-time revenues that won't fix the long-term \nproblem with the highway trust fund.\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\n  I believe we have to have a viable backup plan in case a bipartisan \ndeal on tax reform continues to elude the Congress. That is why I \ntalked to literally a dozen Members of the House and the Senate from \nboth parties and I asked them to share with me their most thoughtful \nideas of what I hope could become an ``all of the above'' \ntransportation funding proposal that we expect to unveil at the \nbeginning of next month. I urge any of my colleagues with serious \nthoughts on how to shore up the highway trust fund to bring us their \nideas and join this effort because I hope to present such a plan, as I \nsaid earlier, very soon and to make sure that we don't once again kick \nthis can down the road. There is time to act. It is not next year. It \nis not around Christmastime. It is this summer.\n  Gas prices this Memorial Day weekend will be lower than any Memorial \nDay in recent memory and are likely to stay that way for at least a \nwhile longer. The prediction is that they are actually going to start \ndropping again as we move into summer.\n  There is an amazing coalition of stakeholders from all parts of the \ncommunity--frankly, all parts of our country geographically--and \nthroughout the business sector and our government as well, and they \nsupport a long-term transportation bill. They are businesses, labor \ngroups, construction companies, transits, retail businesses, \nmanufacturing businesses, and a lot of American families. Their message \nto us is the same: It is time to do the right thing. It is time for us \nto do our jobs. It is time for us to give America the roads, the \nhighways, the bridges, and transit systems that we can be proud of and \nthat will help our Nation to continue to grow and to be great.\n  Mr. President, thank you so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3216-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3216-S3217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant issue to my State of New Hampshire, and that is American \ntrade and our ability to create more jobs in New Hampshire and in the \nUnited States of America by giving our businesses the opportunity to \nsell to consumers around the world since our businesses are creating \nthe very best products and technology, and their ability to sell to \nthose around the world is going to create more jobs in New Hampshire \nand in this country.\n  I also wish to speak about an important financing mechanism to \nbusinesses in New Hampshire and to businesses in this country, and that \nis the Export-Import Bank.\n  When traveling throughout New Hampshire and meeting with businesses \nboth small and large, what I hear most often is this: In Washington, \nplease make it easier, in terms of the regulatory environment and the \ntax environment, for us to do what we do best, and that is create jobs \nand put people to work. I have also heard we want more opportunities to \nsell what we produce to other countries in the world, and we also want \nopportunities to make sure financing is available to increase \nopportunities for New Hampshire businesses to export to other countries \naround the world.\n\n  An important tool for New Hampshire businesses is the Export-Import \nBank, which is set to expire next month, at the end of June, and that \nis why getting the bill pending on the floor is important. I fought to \nensure that there is a way forward to secure a path for a vote on the \nExport-Import Bank reauthorization before it expires at the end of \nJune.\n  I thank our leader for committing to allow us an opportunity to \nextend this important financing mechanism to businesses in New \nHampshire to ensure that mechanism is still available and that those \nNew Hampshire jobs continue and that we can continue to grow our \neconomy.\n  In New Hampshire, the Export-Import Bank supports $416 million in \nexports and has helped 36 New Hampshire businesses over the last 7 \nyears. Its continued existence is not only important to the Granite \nState economy, but it translates to over 2,300 jobs that are supported \nby the opportunity to have financing available through the Export-\nImport Bank to New Hampshire.\n  I met with New Hampshire exporters from around the State who have \nbeen able to grow their businesses and create more jobs by utilizing \nthe Ex-Im financing to export goods and services overseas. In fact, in \nDecember I hosted a roundtable in New Hampshire at the Seaport \nInternational Forest Products in Noshua. In the past, they have been \nable to use Export-Import financing. They were gracious enough to hold \na roundtable when Fred Hopper, the head of the Export-Import Bank, came \nto New Hampshire and met with businesses in New Hampshire to allow them \nto give him feedback as to how the Bank was working and how important \nit was to their ability to obtain this financing and expand their \nexports overseas. In fact, one of the participants in that roundtable, \nJerry Boyle, who is the leader of Boyle Energy and Technology Services \nin Concord, explained how he grew his business 75 percent in the past \nfew years because of the opportunity to use Ex-Im financing.\n  Make no mistake--failure to renew the Bank's charter would cause us \nto lose jobs in New Hampshire and lose jobs in this country and would \nhurt the economy at a time when we should be focusing on making it \neasier for businesses to create jobs and making sure our businesses \nhave opportunity and access to markets overseas to create more American \ntrade.\n  I will continue to push this body to reauthorize Ex-Im so that New \nHampshire businesses can continue to have access to this financing, can \ncontinue to grow their opportunities to create more jobs in New \nHampshire by using this financing and to sell their goods and services \noverseas to create jobs.\n  I want to address the critics of this Bank. I look at this and I \nwonder--we are competing in a global economy, and so many of our \ncompetitors are actually offering even greater financing mechanisms for \ntheir businesses. So without this opportunity for our businesses, we \nwould be putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. In fact, the \nEx-Im Bank actually has a lower default rate than commercial loans and \nreturns money to the Treasury.\n  If someone asked me about the Ex-Im Bank, I would tell them that it \ncreates American jobs and returns money to the Treasury to help pay \ndown our debt. If every Federal agency were asked that question, that \nwould be an easy question to answer, wouldn't it? We would probably be \na lot farther along in dealing with our $18 trillion in debt.\n  To me, this is a program that allows us to create more New Hampshire \njobs and more American jobs. We have to get this done. I am glad we \nhave a commitment to have a vote on it in this body to allow us to \nreauthorize it before it expires. Again, it returns money to the \nTreasury and creates American jobs. Imagine if we could say that about \nevery Federal program.\n  I wish to talk about another issue that is very important to jobs in \nNew Hampshire, and that is trade promotion authority, which we are \ncurrently debating and which is pending on the Senate floor. This will \nhave a real impact on New Hampshire's economy and create thousands of \njobs in my State.\n  In 2014, New Hampshire exported $4.4 billion worth of goods and \nservices and exports and supported about 23,000 good-paying New \nHampshire jobs. Over the past decade, we have seen Granite State \nexports increase by 175 percent. As a testament to America's \nentrepreneurial spirit, almost 90 percent of New Hampshire's exporters \nare small or medium-sized businesses.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Mercury Systems, which \ndesigns and builds defense and commercial electronics in Hudson, NH. \nSince opening in Hudson in 2014, Mercury Systems has more than doubled \nits workforce from 70 employees to now 170 employees--thanks in part to \ntheir opportunity to export what they manufacture.\n  In April, I visited Corfin Industries in Salem. Corfin provides \nrobotic processing services that are used by the defense, medical, and \ntelecommunication industries. Corfin relies on exports and access to \ninternational markets, which has helped to create 22 new jobs in New \nHampshire, and now they see a growing portion of their sales going to \nexports--American trade creating jobs.\n  There are many other important companies in New Hampshire that \nsupport trade promotion authority, and\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nthey view this as an opportunity to create more Granite-State jobs, \nincluding companies such as BAE Systems in Nashua; Bosch \nThermotechnology in Londonderry; Elbit Systems in Merrimack; Globe \nManufacturing Company in Pittsfield; General Electric in Hooksett; Goss \nInternational Americas in Durham; Intel Corporation, which also has a \nfacility in Merrimack; Medtronic in Portsmouth; and New Hampshire Ball \nBearings in Lanconia. In fact, I had a chance to visit New Hampshire \nBall Bearings and to talk to them about the importance of not only Ex-\nIm financing--as a supplier, this is important to them--but also the \nimportance, obviously, of trade. Also, Osram Sylvania in Manchester, \nHillsboro, and Exeter; Polartec in Hudson; Texas Instruments has a \nfacility in Manchester; and Velcro USA is in Manchester. These are just \na few examples of the many Granite State companies that depend on \nAmerican trade and an opportunity to sell the great products they \nproduce overseas.\n  Here is what I have heard from my constituents in New Hampshire about \nthe pending bill on the floor when it comes to creating good-paying \njobs in New Hampshire.\n  Tony Giunta, a city counselor for Franklin's Ward 1, wrote to me and \nsaid:\n\n       Our community is working diligently to boost its economic \n     development. Our priority is jobs and attracting new \n     businesses to our city. It is in that regard I am writing to \n     ask for support on the pending trade vote in the U.S. Senate \n     . . . Our President needs the flexibility to handle the \n     details and present a full plan to Congress for final \n     approval.\n       That precise system has worked for many years and I believe \n     it should be extended for another 5 years. . . . The Wall \n     Street Journal recently reported that our trade deficit rose \n     to its highest level in nearly six and a half years and the \n     trend line is headed in the wrong direction. We need to do \n     all we can to boost free trade in this country.\n       Our state's economy depends on it. My city's future depends \n     on it as well. . . . Considering nearly one-quarter of our \n     workforce provides goods and services that are exported \n     abroad means this proposal will have a tremendous impact on \n     our state's economy.\n\n  Emily Heisig is senior vice president of the New England Council. \nThis council is a very important council for employers in New England \nand in New Hampshire.\n  She wrote:\n\n       While interstate commerce among the states remains a \n     significant avenue for business prosperity, The New England \n     Council believes that foreign markets must be cultivated to \n     tap into the buying power of this vast and ever-burgeoning \n     consumer base. Indeed, across New England, more than 24,000 \n     companies export to foreign markets, and in 2014, that \n     supported nearly 265,000 export-related jobs for our region. \n     The value of goods exported from New England last year was \n     $56.5 billion.\n\n  Jim Roche is president of the New Hampshire Business and Industry \nAssociation. The New Hampshire Business and Industry Association is a \nvery important group in New Hampshire and brings New Hampshire \nbusinesses together. He wrote to me and said:\n\n       Nearly 40 million American jobs depend on trade. This is \n     especially true for New Hampshire where trade plays a big \n     role in our economy. Trade supports more than 179,000 jobs in \n     the state and our exports of goods and services last year \n     reached nearly $7 billion. Trade is especially important for \n     New Hampshire's small businesses, more than 2,200 of which \n     are exporters.\n\n  Pete McNamara, president of the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers \nAssociation, recently visited me in Washington. He also wrote to me and \nsaid:\n\n       The New Hampshire Auto Dealers Association supports free \n     trade. In this competitive world market, the U.S. needs the \n     TPA. America drives the world economy, but outside our \n     borders are markets that represent 80% of the world's \n     purchasing power, 92% of its economic growth, and 95% of its \n     consumers.\n\n  Texas Instruments has a very good facility in Manchester. I had a \nchance to visit that facility and meet the workers in these great-\npaying jobs and also jobs that are very important, with expertise on \ntechnology.\n  Mark Gary is the vice president and manager of the Manchester site. \nHe said:\n\n       Texas Instruments strongly supports TPA-2015 and urges its \n     swift approval. Renewing TPA provides an opportunity for \n     American companies and their workers to secure 21st century \n     rules to govern international trade. Innovation is the \n     Granite State's greatest asset. New Hampshire's high-tech \n     companies, startups, and universities are generating \n     breakthrough innovations and technologies. High tech \n     companies now represent 8.6% of the state's economy and pay \n     92% more than average wages. TI Manchester is the heart of \n     the largest power management unit . . . TPA is critical for \n     TI to secure market access, maintain a competitive global \n     supply chain, and support our high value-added design jobs \n     here in New Hampshire.\n\n  I also heard from Sylvia Linares, director of engineering and New \nHampshire site leader at Intel in Merrimack, NH, which is also very \nimportant for New Hampshire jobs.\n\n       Passing TPA will arm U.S. trade negotiators with a clear \n     set of principles and objectives that support our nation's \n     economic, social, and technological interests. These rules \n     have never been more important. In Merrimack, NH we have a \n     very specialized design team that stands to benefit from \n     these rules--rules around intellectual property theft, forced \n     technology transfer and compromised encryption standards. At \n     Intel, we conduct roughly three quarters of Intel's advanced \n     manufacturing and R right in the U.S., investments which \n     are supported by three quarters of our revenue from sales \n     elsewhere in the world. We are proud to be part of the New \n     Hampshire tech community by spending more than $5 million \n     annually with approximately 50 suppliers in the state.\n\n  With 95 percent of the world's customers and 80 percent of the \nworld's purchasing power outside of the United States, we have to do \neverything we can to ensure that we have more American trade. American \ntrade that supports jobs here allows us to sell the great work we and \nour workers do here and the products we produce overseas. That is why \nthe bill pending on the floor is so important to creating more American \njobs.\n  Since the 1930s, nearly every President has used trade promotion \nauthority to negotiate foreign trade policy. This bill contains the \nclearest outline of trade priorities in our Nation's history. It \nincludes almost 150 ambitious, high-standard negotiating objectives \nthat will direct our trade negotiators to break down barriers that hurt \nAmerican businesses and will allow American businesses to have more \nAmerican trade to create jobs here.\n  The bottom line is that trade promotion authority will ensure that in \nthe Granite State, New Hampshire businesses can create more jobs. In \nfact, the estimate in New Hampshire is that if you look at some of the \nagreements, such as the current transatlantic and transpacific trade \nnegotiations, those could spur international investment in New \nHampshire and create an estimated over 8,200 jobs in New Hampshire if \nthe President is able to go forward and negotiate the right agreements \nthat allow us to create American jobs.\n\n  So there are two issues that I have talked about. We need to get the \nEx-Im Bank reauthorized before it expires so that employers in New \nHampshire that have been able to use this financing mechanism and the \nmany suppliers that also support companies outside of New Hampshire but \nthat create New Hampshire jobs can have an opportunity to continue to \nuse this financing to put more people to work in New Hampshire. We also \nneed to pass trade promotion authority that is pending on the floor. If \nyou look at the list of New Hampshire businesses that will benefit from \nthis opportunity to create more New Hampshire jobs and more American \njobs in the United States of America, this is something we need to do \nto strengthen our economy in the Granite State and to strengthen our \ncountry to make sure there are more opportunities for people to work in \nthis country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3217-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3217-S3219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, shown in this picture I have in the \nChamber is Christina from Stratford, CT. She is a small business owner, \nand she has a story that is becoming pretty familiar all across the \ncountry. She left a job a couple of years ago that provided for \nemployer-based health care, and she wanted to start her own business in \nBridgeport, CT, right next to Stratford. So she stayed insured through \nCOBRA for a period of time until it expired, and then she had to go out \ninto the individual market. She recalls having to fill out a 15-page \nquestionnaire when she was applying for individual coverage. She said \nit asked about ``anything that I had even remotely discussed with my \ndoctor.'' Unfortunately\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nfor her, some of those things--preexisting conditions--meant that she \nwas denied health care coverage.\n  So she had to go into Connecticut's high-risk pool, which meant she \nwas paying $1,200 per month. Anybody who has started up a small \nbusiness from scratch knows that can be pretty prohibitive. Her \nsalvation came through the Affordable Care Act. When it went into \neffect and Connecticut's exchange was established, she was able to find \na plan that cost her $430 per month, which is frankly on the high end \nof plans but it was much more affordable than the one she had.\n  She said: ``I'm thankful that there was a solution for me to be able \nto keep my business [and] have affordable health insurance'' that can't \nbe taken away.\n  Similar stories can be told all over the country, but it is not just \nanecdotes that we have to rely on any longer to talk about the success \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  I know that we are obsessed this week, appropriately so, with the \nPATRIOT Act, the transportation reauthorization, and the free-trade \nagreement, or the fast-track agreement. But the Supreme Court is likely \nupon our return after the Memorial Day recess to rule on one of the \nmost important cases that it has heard during most of our tenures, and \nthat is the King v. Burwell case. It is important to spend some time \nbefore we break talking about the subject of that case, the Affordable \nCare Act. Christina's story is miraculous--somebody who was able to \nstart a business and keep that business open because of the Affordable \nCare Act. But she is one of 16.4 million people all across this country \nwho now have health care because of the Affordable Care Act--most \nthrough Federal and State exchanges but some because they were able to \nstay on their parents' plan until age 26 or are able to access \nMedicaid.\n  Last month's Gallup poll showed that the uninsured rate in this \ncountry has declined by 35 percent over the course of the last year and \na half, or since 2013. That is a remarkable number. We shouldn't \nhesitate from noting that it is just absolutely exceptional in the \nhistory of this country to have a one-third reduction in the number of \npeople who don't have insurance in such a short period of time. The \ngood news is that most of the folks who have insurance are satisfied, \njust as is Christina. Opponent after opponent of the ACA tells us this \nis going to be terrible health care and that there is no way the \ngovernment could have anything to do with a health care plan that \npeople want. Of course, it is not government-run health care. It is \nsubsidized by tax credits from the government, but it is private health \ncare insurance, with the exception of those Medicaid plans.\n  J.D. Power surveyed thousands of ACA enrollees and found that they \nlike their exchange plans more than people like their nonexchange \nplans. So health care on this exchange is more popular than health care \noff of the exchange.\n  The good news isn't just about the number of people who have \ncoverage; it is that costs are coming down. For the accountable care \norganizations, which are an innovation in the Affordable Care Act to \ntry to build big integrated systems of care, the pilot program just \ncame in with their savings numbers, and $384 million were saved just on \nthis one innovation alone. That is $300 per patient. That is a big deal \nbecause it speaks to a larger trend line in which we are for the first \ntime in a very long time able to control health care costs. On an \nannual basis, last year we saw the lowest increase in medical costs, \nthe lowest medical inflation number in a generation.\n  But costs are coming down in part because of things that we put into \nplace through the Affordable Care Act. My colleague Senator Barrasso \nwas down here yesterday with a wonderful chart about Connecticut. I \nappreciate his giving Connecticut a little bit of extra publicity, but \nhis speech really was a wonderful advertisement for the Affordable Care \nAct. He noted that several insurers in Connecticut just came out with \nrate increase requests, and he had the numbers up there. They were 8 \npercent and 10 percent. They were substantial increases. They were not \nunfamiliar, because prior to the Affordable Care Act, that is what \nindividuals and businesses were facing every single year. They were \ndouble-digit increases.\n  The rate increases that Senator Barrasso was referring to were \ncompletely in line with what those same insurance plans requested last \nyear in Connecticut. Last year Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield requested \na 12-percent rate increase. ConnectiCare requested 12 percent. Because \nof the Affordable Care Act, which allows States to do reviews and \namendments to those rate increases, Anthem's request last year went \nfrom 12 percent to 0 percent, and ConnectiCare's request went from 12 \npercent to 3 percent. We had in Connecticut one of the lowest increases \nin health care premiums on record because of the Affordable Care Act.\n  So it is right that these health insurers are requesting big rate \nincreases. But now, because of the law we passed, they don't get those \nrate increases in States such as Connecticut. They actually have their \nnumbers vetted. They have their actuarial analysis reviewed, and they \nget a better number to the benefit of my constituents.\n\n  But this Supreme Court case that is going to come up is important \nbecause it puts millions of Americans at risk for losing many of the \nprotections that I just talked about. It basically says that the \nAffordable Care Act was designed in a way to only provide these \nsubsidies to help people get insurance on State-based exchanges, and if \nthey were on a Federal exchange, they, by design, weren't supposed to \nget these subsidies.\n  Well, a lot of people talk about what the intent of the law is, but \nyou don't even have to get into the intent of the law. On its face the \ntext of the Affordable Care Act is absolutely clear, because, yes, \nthere is a reference--one line to the fact that subsidies will flow to \nthe State exchanges. But the plaintiffs' case completely ignores \nanother section of the Affordable Care Act which gives the Secretary \nthe power to establish exchanges in States that don't do it themselves. \nThat is what has happened by the substitution of Federal exchanges for \nState exchanges. And, of course, the text of the bill just does not \nwork if you believe the plaintiffs' analysis. The plaintiffs say this \nis supposed to be a penalty. If you didn't set up a State exchange, we \nare penalizing your constituents by withholding subsidies. Well, there \nis not a single line in the Affordable Care Act that suggests that this \nis a penalty. And there is the fact that the Supreme Court has said \nthat if you want to do that, you have to make it explicit and you can't \nhave guesswork involved as to the carrot-and-stick approach afforded to \na State.\n  Doug Elmendorf, who was the head of CBO at the time said:\n\n       I could remember no occasion on which anybody asked why we \n     were expecting subsidies to be paid in all states regardless \n     of whether they established their exchanges or not. And if \n     people had not had this common understanding about what the \n     law was going to do at the time, I'm sure we would have had a \n     lot of questions about that aspect of our estimates.\n\n  Finally, the bill doesn't work on its face if you believe the \nplaintiffs' argument. Why? Because the insurance reforms are national. \nAnd yet the subsidies, according to the plaintiffs, are only for States \nthat established their own exchanges. Well, the insurance reforms don't \nwork if everybody doesn't have insurance in those States. You can't say \nthat folks who have preexisting conditions can't be discriminated \nagainst if people in those States don't all have insurance. That \nactuarially doesn't work. So the whole bill falls apart if you believe \nthe plaintiffs' case.\n  I am, frankly, totally confident that the Supreme Court is going to \nfind in favor of the government because there is no other way to read \nthe Affordable Care Act other than to believe that subsidies go to both \nState and Federal exchanges. It is plain on the face of the statute, \nbut certainly you have to get to it in the intent as well.\n  We are starting to see that Republicans are thinking they are going \nto need to have an answer if--in the unlikely case, as I believe--the \nSupreme Court decides in favor of the plaintiffs.\n  But this is a pretty good summary of what the Republicans' plan is to \nrespond to King v. Burwell. The Republicans' plan, if King v. Burwell \ngoes in favor of the plaintiffs, is essentially a shrug of the \nshoulders.\n  The predominant bill on the Republican side is offered by my friend \nSenator Johnson from Wisconsin. He\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\nclaims that this bill is going to fix the problems in the Affordable \nCare Act if the King v. Burwell decision is decided in favor of the \nplaintiffs. But it is nothing except for just another attempt to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act. It is disguised as a way to address King v. \nBurwell, but it is simply an effort to repeal the law. You don't have \nto read too deeply in the bill to figure that out. It preserves the \nsubsidies for about a year and a half, but after that period of time it \nends subsidies in the Federal exchanges and then it also ends subsidies \nin the State exchanges.\n  Let me say that again. The Johnson bill doesn't just end the \nsubsidies that the Court might rule unconstitutional; it also ends the \nsubsidies in the exchanges that the Court won't rule as \nunconstitutional if King v. Burwell is decided in favor of the \nplaintiffs. Thus, it is a repeal of the bill. It goes well above and \nbeyond what would be necessary to address an adverse decision.\n  It then goes even further. The Johnson bill then repeals the \nindividual mandate. It repeals the employer mandate, and when you do \nthat, the insurance reforms fall apart. Even Senator Cruz on the floor \nduring his filibuster conceded that you can't protect people with \npreexisting conditions unless you also require people to get insurance.\n  Lastly, the Johnson bill ends the essential-benefits packages. So \nthis guarantee, that if you buy insurance you are going to get a basic \nfloor of services, is no longer. The Republican response to King v. \nBurwell is simply to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and I hope we \nnever get to the point where we have to debate how we address an \nadverse decision in the King v. Burwell decision, but this is a \nnonstarter. Everyone inside and outside of this building should \nunderstand that. I don't think it is coincidence at all that over 30 \ncosponsors of the Johnson bill also support repealing the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  One cannot deny that it is working. From the New York Times to the \nWashington Post to the Wall Street Journal, people understand that the \nAffordable Care Act is changing people's lives--16 million people with \ninsurance, health care costs stabilized for the first time in many of \nour lifetimes, and quality getting better. The Affordable Care Act \nworks, and I hope that our colleagues will come together, no matter the \ndecision in King v. Burwell, to make sure that it continues to work for \nAmericans all over this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about trade for a minute. \nLet me start by saying that I believe in free trade. I strongly support \nswift renewal of the trade promotion authority we are considering \ntoday. We all know the benefits of increased market access for U.S. \ngoods and services are good for American consumers and businesses.\n  Renewal of trade promotion authority will pave the way for future \nfree-trade agreements between the United States and many other nations. \nCountries around the world are not standing still on trade, and we \ncannot afford to sit idly by while they move ahead and engage with each \nother. History has shown that without trade promotion authority, there \nis virtually no chance that the United States will successfully reach \nagreement to lower trade barriers with other countries. We have to have \nthis authority.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in these \ndeliberations, with a shared goal of making sure the trade legislation \nwe are considering today ends up on the President's desk. Toward that \ngoal, I want to raise an amendment I filed that is currently pending.\n  The proposal we are now debating will renew trade promotion authority \nfor 6 years, but it will also renew trade adjustment assistance. This \nprogram will be expanded as well. The Flake amendment No. 1243 will \nstrike the trade adjustment assistance title, or TAA, in its entirety \nfrom this package. It is unfortunate that Congress has grown accustomed \nto tying legislation that expands trade opening for U.S. businesses \nwith this costly trade adjustment assistance.\n  I reject the notion that these tradeoffs are necessary. When Congress \ntakes steps to embrace trade liberalization, it is a responsible \nreflection of the changing realities in the global marketplace. Almost \n95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of our borders. The \nexport of U.S. goods and services has been and will continue to be a \nvital part of our economy. Adjusting and modernizing U.S. trade \npriorities to increase economic opportunity is a realization that there \nis a necessary shift in our economy. Changing economic trends and \nconditions are a recurring part of our country's history. Look no \nfurther than the emergence of digital technology to see a familiar \nexample. But it is only in the case of trade policy changes that the \nFederal Government is expected to layer on additional benefits for \nimpacts to the workforce.\n  When you look at this economy and you look at how we have grown and \nif you look at the shifts in the economy from the industrial age \nonward, there have been shifts and there have been dislocations, but \nthis is the only area where we say: All right, we are going to try to \naccount for that with adjustment assistance beyond what we already have \nwith the Federal Government.\n  Now taxpayers can at least breathe a sigh of relief that an amendment \noffered earlier this week that would have dramatically increased the \nprogram's authorized funding, this TAA funding, was handily defeated.\n  If this program is approved, we can expect to see $450 million a year \nspent on training, employment, case management services and job search \nand relocation allowances alone. In fact, all told, TAA reauthorization \nwill likely cost the U.S. taxpayers about $1.8 billion.\n  TAA benefits were expanded in the 2009 stimulus bill. Those expanded \nbenefits were, for the most part, continued from 2011 through 2014. \nNow, this reauthorization will restore much of that benefit expansion \nfrom the manufacturing sector to the service sector and will cover any \njobs moved overseas, not just those related to countries with which we \nhave free-trade agreements--this is despite the application criteria \nfor Federal adjustment assistance having been notoriously lax, most \nnotably when employees who were laid off after the Solyndra Federal \nloan guarantee debacle were awarded TAA benefits.\n  To be clear, it is not as if those who claim to need trade adjustment \nassistance are somehow turned away from existing Federal unemployment \nbenefits. These trade adjustment allowance benefits provide a weekly \npayment to those who have already received unemployment insurance \nbenefits. Including unemployment benefits, these payments can last as \nlong as 130 weeks.\n  Duplication in Federal job-training programs has been highlighted \nextensively in the past. According to a 2011 Government Accountability \nOffice report, although some of these have been repealed, 79 Federal \nagencies spent $18 billion to administer 47 programs in fiscal year \n2009. Again, some $18 billion was spent to administer 47 programs in \nfiscal year 2009.\n  Supporters of trade adjustment assistance claim that the needs of \nworkers impacted by vibrant international trade are somehow special in \nnature, but when the price tag for all existing and newly authorized \ntraining programs and funding reaches into the billions, those \narguments wear a bit thin.\n  There have also been persistent questions related to the program's \neffectiveness, TAA's effectiveness.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted that \n``estimating the impact of the program, for example the differences in \nemployment outcomes of TAA beneficiaries versus otherwise identical \nworkers who did not participate in TAA, is extremely difficult.''\n  A 2012 study by Mathematica Policy Research commissioned by the \nDepartment of Labor did a comparison of TAA beneficiaries to those who \nwere not receiving them. They found that after 3 years, TAA recipients \nactually had lower reemployment rates. However, after 4 years, \nemployment rates for both groups were statistically the\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\nsame. So, overall, TAA recipients ended up earning less annually.\n  At best, the impact of TAA is a multibillion-dollar question mark. At \nworst, research says it is ineffective and even counterproductive.\n  While trade adjustment assistance is of dubious value, we certainly \nknow that renewing trade promotion authority is an incredible \nopportunity for the U.S. economy. It is my fervent hope that Congress \nwill move forward in approving legislation reauthorizing TPA. It is \nalso my hope that one day we can recognize the benefits of trade and \nthe fact that it lifts our economy. I hope we can advance a sound trade \npolicy without these costly adjustment assistance programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3220-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3220-S3221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor noting that my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut was just on the floor talking \nabout the President's health care law. It is interesting that he would \ndo so at a time when we are seeing headline after headline about \nObamaCare plan premiums increasing again all over the country.\n  Remember what the President said. He said: If you like your plan, you \ncan keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n  He said premiums would go down by $2,500 for a family of four. What \nwe have seen is premiums go up across the country. Now my colleague \nfrom Connecticut says--in spite of all the money being spent on the \nPresident's health care law, premiums are still going up. In his home \nState of Connecticut, they are going up, and they are going up across \nthe country.\n  There is a headline in the Connecticut Mirror: ``Insurers seek rate \nhikes for 2016 ObamaCare plans.'' That is in Connecticut.\n  You know, it is interesting. I heard my colleague talking about the \nupcoming Supreme Court case of King v. Burwell, the implications of \nthat case. He said the Republicans did not have a plan. Where is the \nPresident's plan? He is the guy who made this mess. This is the \nPresident's law. This is the law the Democrats voted for.\n  You know, there is that old sign in the Pottery Barn: If you break \nit, you bought it. The President broke the health care system in this \ncountry. If the Supreme Court rules that he has acted illegally--he is \nthe one who made the mess; he is the one who created the problem.\n  When my colleague from Connecticut says ``Where is the Republicans' \nplan?'' I say ``Where is the President's plan?'' It is interesting. The \nPresident does have a plan to protect the insurance companies, but he \nhas no plans to protect the American public, the American taxpayers. He \nhas a built-in plan for the insurance companies so that when they wrote \nthe policies this year, there was a decision made by the White House \nthat those policies could be canceled by the insurance companies if the \nSupreme Court ruled that the President acted illegally. Yet, there is \nno path, no safe path for those American taxpayers who thought they \nwere obeying the law if the court rules the way I believe they should \nbased on the reading of the law.\n  So of course people around the country are very concerned when they \nsee once again that the insurance they are mandated to buy by President \nObama and the Democrats, the insurance they are mandated to buy by the \nhealth care law is going to be even more expensive next year than this \nyear.\n  In Connecticut--the first paragraph of this article: ``Insurance \ncompanies selling health plans through the state's health insurance \nexchange are seeking to raise rates next year. . . .''\n  It goes on to say: ``Despite that, the carriers projected increased \ncosts, citing rising claims expenses and a planned reduction in \nprotection against high-cost claims. . . .'' Reduction in protection \nagainst high-cost claims. Why? Well, it says ``from a temporary federal \nprogram intended to provide stability for insurers during the initial \nyears of the health law.'' This was the bailout of the insurance \ncompanies that President Obama and the Democrats built into the \nPresident's health care law to get them to go along.\n  It says, ``The rate filings are proposals, not actual changes.'' \nProposals, not changes. It says, ``The insurance department will now \nanalyze the proposals, accept public comments. . . .'' This is the \nConnecticut Insurance Department. Well, you know, a lot of members of \nthe public in Connecticut filed comments. I have them to share with the \nPresiding Officer and with our listeners today. These are the \nconstituents of the Senator from Connecticut, who comes here to the \nfloor and says things are working great in Connecticut. These are his \nconstituents who say:\n\n       I am barely making ends meet as it is. I was under the \n     understanding that this was to be AFFORDABLE--\n\n  With all the letters of ``affordable'' in capital letters--\n\n     --healthcare. So far it has been nothing but a burden.\n\n  This is a constituent in Connecticut--``nothing but a burden.''\n  He said:\n\n       I was happy with my previous plan. . . .\n\n  Weren't so many Americans happy with their previous plan before the \nPresident, who told them if they liked it, they could keep it--well, \nthat is why there is so much disappointment out there. And the \nPresident's statement was called ``the lie of the year.''\n  This person was happy with his previous plan, but it was eliminated \nas of January 1, 2015. ``My health care,'' he says, ``went up $100 for \nless coverage.''\n  People are paying more and getting less, and Democrats wonder why \nthis health care law is not popular. All across the country, people are \npaying more, getting less, and the Democrats are clueless as to why \nthis is so unpopular.\n  ``Please do not allow this increase.''\n  That is just one of the constituents who wrote to the Connecticut \nInsurance Department, a public comment. Here is another:\n\n       Please no rate increase. I cannot afford the insurance now. \n     I pay $594.00 a month for myself, a 60 year old female in \n     relatively good health. I have a $5,500 deductible. I cannot \n     afford to have some testing done because I don't have the \n     deductible amount.\n\n  But we heard the Senator come to the floor and say all of these \npeople have insurance. This person figures--well, she has insurance, \nbut it is of no value to her with her $5,500 deductible. She can't \nafford to have testing because of the deductible. She says:\n\n       It is bad enough we have the big security breach and we \n     have to worry about our personal info stolen in the years to \n     come and you now want to increase our rates.\n\n  That is what we are seeing happening across the country, that is what \nwe are seeing happening in Connecticut, and that is what the public is \ntelling the Connecticut Insurance Department dealing with these \nproposed health rate increases.\n  This is another:\n\n       I am writing to you regarding the . . . rate increase \n     filing in particular and the health insurance filings in \n     general. I am an individual buyer who does not qualify for \n     federal subsidies due to my income level. I have been buying \n     my family plan since before the Affordable Care Act has been \n     passed and implemented.\n\n  They had insurance and do not qualify for a subsidy. Continuing:\n\n       Since then--\n\n  Since the Affordable Care Act was passed--\n\n     buying a family health plan in CT has become almost \n     financially impossible for me to buy as it has become a real \n     financial burden for me. Currently, I am paying some 22% of \n     my Federal AGI for a high deductible (family deductible of \n     $11,000) HSA plan.\n\n  Now, the Senator from Connecticut may say: Hey, great. This person \nhas insurance, insurance they can't afford and they cannot use because \nof the deductible.\n  It says:\n\n       As you are certainly well aware before the passing of the \n     Care Act my premium for health care was much more affordable.\n\n  Why is it? Well, it is because the President decided he wanted to \ntransfer money from one group to another, and this individual who had \ninsurance that he liked, the family liked, worked for them, they could \nafford, now cannot afford, cannot use because of the deductible. They \nare still insured, so I guess the Senator from Connecticut would call \nthat a big win for one of his constituents who is clearly being hurt.\n  This is another one that has come in from Connecticut:\n\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\n\n       Are you nuts? This cannot go on. My ``affordable'' \n     insurance has already increased $200/mo and now you want \n     more? My income doesn't even increase this much.\n       Paying the penalty for no insurance is a better option than \n     this.\n       DO NOT INCREASE! Learn how to live within your means like \n     the rest of us do.\n\n  This is what we are seeing. Is this a surprise that this continues to \nbe a very unpopular law. Should it surprise?\n  It surprises the Democrats, obviously, when they see that in poll \nafter poll, month after month, the health care law is more unpopular \nthan it is popular, and the reason is people don't see it as good deal \nfor them. They feel, in terms of their own health, their own families, \ntheir own communities, this health care law has been a burden on them, \nin their lives, and has impacted them as a family.\n  There is another one from Connecticut:\n\n       The ACA raised our health insurance expense (both premiums \n     and deductibles) by 67% for similar coverage!\n\n  Sixty-seven percent for similar coverage. Remember, the President \ntold a lot of people that what they had coverage on wasn't any good. It \nwasn't good enough for the President--might have been good enough for \nthat family but not good enough for the President.\n  So they had to buy, for similar coverage, premiums and deductibles up \n67%.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Please do not approve this additional increase.\n\n  This person says they would be fine with their own policy, but they \nweren't allowed to keep it because of the health care law.\n  I could go on and on. It is astonishing what we are hearing from the \nConnecticut Insurance Department, with a response, when they were \nasked, and put out the filings of the requests for higher rates. It is \njust interesting.\n  Here is one more comment from Southbury, CT:\n\n       The alleged purpose of this pool, and the affordable care \n     act--\n\n  Alleged purpose. Remember Nancy Pelosi: First, you have to pass it \nbefore you get to find out what is in it.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The alleged purpose of this pool, and the affordable care \n     act, was to get and keep health care costs under control. My \n     (subsidized) monthly premium is more than double what I paid \n     before being forced into this pool. . . . If the ACA is a \n     failure, then why am I being penalized?\n\n  People all across the country believe they are personally being \npenalized because of the failure of the Obama health care plan and this \nadministration who chose to, with one party and one party alone, force \na very expensive, unworkable, really unaffordable, unmanageable, \nunexplainable health care system down the throats of the American \npublic.\n  So we will see what happens when the Supreme Court rules at the end \nof next month. Secretary of Health and Human Services Burwell said that \nthe administration has no plan. The President told me personally--and \nthe White House earlier this year--he had no plan to deal with the \nSupreme Court ruling that says his actions were illegal, and he has no \nplan to deal with so many people who thought they were following the \nlaw, who have been hurt by the law.\n  But he has a plan to bail out the insurance companies and to protect \nthem because we know where the President is in terms of looking at \nthis. And his proposal, his quintessential piece of legislation--the \none named after him--has clearly done a significant amount of damage to \nfamilies all across the country.\n  I believe it has harmed the health care system, which has always been \nthe best in the world.\n  We needed health care reform in the country. We did not need what \nPresident Obama forced down the throats of the American people with \npeople across the country saying no.\n  People knew what they wanted in health care reform. What they knew \nthey wanted was the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower \ncost, and they have not received that under the President's health care \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, I listened to some of the debate earlier \nthis afternoon--in between the effort to make progress toward getting a \nfair array of amendments for both sides--about this whole question of \nsecrecy surrounding trade policy. A number of Senators were discussing \nit, and so I just wanted to take a minute to be very clear that I think \nthey have a very valid point with respect to the secrecy that has long \naccompanied these trade discussions. I would like to discuss how I made \nit my paramount reform to make sure we would have a new era of \ntransparency, openness, and accountability in the discussion about \nmaking trade policy.\n  I have always felt that if you believe deeply in international \ntrade--the way I do--and you want more of it, why in the world would \nyou be for all this secrecy? That just makes Americans more cynical \nabout the whole topic and makes them think that in Washington, DC, \nthere is something to hide.\n  I note my friend and partner in all this, Chairman Hatch, is on the \nfloor, and he will recall when we began our discussions--and they went \non really for close to 7 months in our effort to forge a bipartisan \npackage--that I wanted to take a very fresh approach with respect to \ntransparency, and I wanted us to be able to say that for the first time \nin the history of debating these policies, we would no longer have the \ncountry and elected officials in the dark with respect to really what \nis at issue in these discussions.\n  So here is a short assessment of what really has changed. Of course, \nright now we are working on the rules for future trade agreements. We \nare working on the trade promotion act that sets out the rules for \nfuture agreements. Obviously, the first one will involve the Trans-\nPacific Partnership--what is known as TPP--and there are a variety of \nothers that are under discussion, particularly one with Europe.\n  If the Congress--the Senate and the other body--adopts this package \nthat Chairman Hatch and I, in conjunction with Chairman Ryan, have put \ntogether over these many months, I think we will have achieved our goal \nof making sure everybody in the Congress and everybody in the United \nStates who chooses to can have the information they need about trade \nagreements\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\nbefore a single vote is cast on the floor of the Senate or on the floor \nof the other body.\n  Here is how the reform would work: First, it is required by law--in \nother words, this isn't something that is discretionary--that these \ntrade agreements, starting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, would be \nmade public 60 days before the President of the United States signs \nthat agreement. That means if you want to come to a townhall meeting in \nColorado, held by the distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate--\neven before the President signs it--a citizen in Colorado can come with \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement--the entire agreement--in their \nhands and ask questions of the Presiding Officer of the Senate or any \none of our colleagues in the Senate and the House.\n  After that 60-day period of sunshine and exposure, the President can \nsign it, and then there would be close to 2 additional months--2 \nadditional months--before the voting on the floor of the Senate and the \nHouse begins.\n  So when I heard my colleagues--Senators whom I respect greatly--talk \nearlier today about secrecy and that secrecy was no good and why \ncouldn't this be changed and why couldn't that be changed, it made me \nwant to come to the floor--and I will do an overview of all of the \nprogressive reforms that have been made to this package; reforms I \nthought were important for a new era of what I call trade done right--\nto make sure we corrected the suggestion that somehow everybody is \ngoing to be in the dark before the Congress and the country saw voting \nbegin in the Senate and the House.\n  Chairman Hatch is here, and he remembers all of our negotiations on \nthis point. It is really going to mean--with the 60-day requirement for \nsunlight before the President signs the agreement and then probably 2 \nmore months after it has been signed, before we start voting--that a \ncitizen can come to a townhall meeting in Colorado, Utah or any part of \nthe country and have that Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement in their \nhands in order to be able to ask questions about it.\n  I certainly think that puts our trade negotiators and everybody else \nkind of on their toes because they know the American people and the \nCongress are going to have that document. That is going to start with \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.\n  Now, Chairman Hatch and I made a number of other changes. In the \nfuture, it would be possible for the discussion of negotiations--\nsummaries of the negotiations--to be made public so people would also \nhave more information about the process as it was going forward. We \nhave lifted a number of the restrictions in terms of Members having \naccess to the materials and staff having access to the materials.\n  Because the chairman is here, I want to express my thanks to him \nespecially on this point. We spent a lot of time on a whole host of \nissues: How you could put the brakes on a flawed agreement. I am glad \nthe chairman can smile about our discussions on that point today, but \nsuffice it to say they were pretty spirited. We had discussions on a \nhost of these topics. I am especially pleased we made these very \nsubstantial changes on the issue of sunlight, transparency, openness, \nand accountability because I think my colleagues--who discussed it on \nthe floor and many others who have been concerned about secrecy in the \npast with respect to these agreements--when they get a chance to \nactually see the details that are in the reforms Chairman Hatch, \nChairman Ryan, and I put together, are going to see we have made some \nvery dramatic changes.\n  Now, I think some specific changes here are areas that I would like \nto outline. I am going to go to the question of major changes in \nworkers' rights and environmental protections because I know that a \nnumber of my colleagues, when they talked earlier, were concerned about \nthese issues as well.\n  Suffice it to say, on workers' rights and environmental protections, \nif we go back to the 1990s, back to the NAFTA era, these vital \npriorities basically were just shunted to the side. It would be almost \ninflationary to say they got short shrift. They basically got no \nshrift. They just got shunted to the side. They were in unenforceable \nside deals, which meant that the United States in effect had to take it \non blind faith that our partners would live up to their commitments. It \nwas my view that many of my colleagues, particularly on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, were spot-on in saying that wasn't good enough.\n  This trade package will say in clear terms that the United States is \ndone allowing labor and environmental protections to be pushed aside \nand disregarded. Our partners will be required to adopt and maintain \ncore international labor standards. Core international labor standards \nare going to be required of our trading partners. They will have to \nadopt them, and they will have to maintain them. That is not something \nthat is to the side and is unenforceable. That is real. It has got \nteeth.\n  Also, our partners would be required to adopt what are really common \nmultilateral environmental agreements, and these would be backed by the \nthreat of trade sanctions. So these are major changes that certainly \ncontribute to what I think makes the most progressive approach with \nrespect to trade policy in the future.\n  And for the first time, the President is directed under this piece of \nlegislation to make sure our trading partners adopt and maintain key \nlaws. That is why, for example, I mentioned labor standards. And here \nis what those are: freedom of association, the effective recognition of \nthe right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of \nforced or compulsory labor, the effective abolition of child labor and \na prohibition on the worst forms of child labor, and the elimination of \ndiscrimination with respect to employment and occupation.\n  Now, those are the keys with respect to the labor side.\n  Here are the key protections on the environmental side, which I have \nagain highlighted here at the outset. The bedrock protections here are \nthat there has to be recognition to ensure that there is compliance \nwith the Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species Act, \nthe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Depletes the Ozone Layer, the \nProtocol on Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the Convention on \nWetlands, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine \nResources, the Convention on Whaling, and the Tropical Tuna Convention.\n  This, again, is not stuck in a side deal but is fully enforceable, \nand not just rearranging inadequate policies of the past, sort of \nrearranging sinking deck chairs. This is better than anything that has \nexisted before--better than the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nbetter than the Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n  With these changes, our country is saying that we will no longer take \nit on blind faith that other countries are going to adopt stronger \nstandards for protecting workers and the environment. This is the first \ntime the United States is setting the standard and demanding that \ntrading partners hit that mark. That is very real progress.\n  I will close with just this point. Many colleagues who have been \nskeptical about trade agreements always raise the issue about whether \ntrade is somehow going to be a race to the bottom. What I have just \ndescribed is a concrete way to have a new force for raising standards \nup and getting the standards up, because my colleagues are right that \nthey have been inadequate in the past.\n  So whether you are for this bill or not, I hope my colleagues will \ntake a look at the new sunshine provisions, because the American people \nare not going to be in the dark about what is in a trade agreement \nbefore anybody votes on that agreement here in the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  I hope my colleagues will especially look at the new provisions with \nrespect to labor rights and environmental rights, because the day is \nover when those considerations are going to be shunted to the side. \nThey are going to be front and center, and they are going to have \nteeth. And instead of a race to the bottom that my colleagues have been \nconcerned about, the United States will be where it always is, where we \nare at our best--forcing standards up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to personally thank the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\nSenator from Oregon for the work he has done on this bill. It couldn't \nhave been done without him. A number of other people on his side have \nbeen very contributory and helpful.\n  We are not there yet, but we are going to work at it. I just have to \nsay how much I have enjoyed working with him on the floor so far. I \njust hope everything will go smoothly so we can get this bill up and \nout and get the President what he needs to conclude these negotiations \nand also especially for our Trade Representative. Mr. Froman has done a \nvery good job, as far as I can see. We will have to see what the TPP is \nlike, but we will all have a chance to look at it for a considerable \nperiod of time before we have to vote on anything regarding that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Jill \nN. Parrish, of Utah, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Utah; Jose Rolando Olvera, Jr., of Texas, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Southern District of Texas; Patricia D. \nCahill, of Missouri, to be a Member of the Board of Directors of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting for a term expiring January 31, \n2020; and Mark Scarano, of New Hampshire, to be Federal Cochairperson \nof the Northern Border Regional Commission.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we are finally voting on the \nnomination of Jill Parrish to serve as a Federal district judge in the \nDistrict of Utah and Jose Olvera to serve as a Federal district judge \nin the Southern District of Texas. Five and a half months into this new \nCongress, these are just the third and fourth judicial nominees that we \nwill vote to confirm. That is simply unacceptable.\n  Both of these individuals were nominated last September--more than 8 \nmonths ago. After receiving a hearing in January, they were voted out \nof the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote in February. Their \nnominations have now been on the Executive Calendar for nearly 3 \nmonths. There is no good reason why these nominees should have waited \nthis long for a vote. The vacancy Jose Olvera will fill in the Southern \nDistrict of Texas has been designated a judicial emergency. In fact, he \nwill fill just one of six district court emergency vacancies in the \nState of Texas, which currently has a total of eight district court \nvacancies.\n  The Senate has a duty to fill judicial vacancies no matter which \nparty holds the majority. When I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the Bush administration, I worked quickly to schedule \nconfirmation hearings for judicial nominees and moved them through the \nconfirmation process without unnecessary delay.\n  In the 17 months I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate confirmed 100 \nFederal circuit and district court judges. I also served as chairman \nduring the last 2 years of the Bush administration and continued to \nhold regular hearings on judges. We confirmed 68 district and circuit \ncourt judges in those last 2 years.\n  Now, this Republican majority has taken 3 months to schedule a \nconfirmation vote for a single district court judge, and after today's \nvotes only 4 district court judges will have been confirmed this year. \nIn contrast, when the Democrats were in an equivalent position in 2007, \nthe seventh year of the Bush administration, we had confirmed 18 \ncircuit and district court judges after 5 months. That's 18 judges \nunder a Democratic majority compared to 4 under the Republicans.\n  Nevertheless, the Republican majority continues to make excuses for \ntheir continued obstruction and delay on confirming judicial nominees. \nTheir excuse is that the Democratic majority was only able to confirm \nthose 18 judges in 2007 because those nominees were held over from the \nprevious year. What the Republicans failed to note is that half or nine \nof the judges confirmed in the first 5 months of 2007, were not among \nthose left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar at the end of 2006.\n  The justifications offered by the Republican majority also miss the \nbigger picture. The Republican majority is simply holding up judicial \nnominations for no good reason. Since the beginning of 2015, the number \nof circuit and district court vacancies has jumped from 40 to 51 \nvacancies after today's confirmations. The number of judicial \nemergencies has doubled, from 12 to now 24 after today's confirmation \nof Judge Olvera. The Republican majority is failing to govern \nresponsibly and to fill judicial vacancies where they are needed.\n  It is unfortunate that as we head into Memorial Day recess the Senate \nRepublicans are allowing confirmations votes on only 2 of the 10 \nnoncontroversial judicial nominees pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. There is nothing keeping the Senate from confirming all 10 \nnominees--nothing, except for the mindset of delay for delay's sake, \nwhich is unfortunately the hallmark of the majority's leadership on \nnominations.\n  There are nominees that remain pending on the calendar that will fill \na vacancy on the Federal Circuit as well as a nominee to serve in the \nWestern District of Missouri who were first nominated last year, had a \nhearing more than 2 months ago, and were reported favorably out of \ncommittee 1 month ago by voice vote.\n  In addition, there are five U.S. Court of Federal Claims nominees who \nwere first nominated a year ago. These five CFC nominees had hearings \n10 months ago, were favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously by voice vote last Congress, and again earlier this year. \nWe have heard no opposition to any of these nominees, yet they have \nbeen in limbo for months and months. The CFC is where our citizens go \nto seek redress against the Federal Government for monetary claims. The \ncases this court hears include claims of unlawful takings of private \nland by the U.S. Government without proper compensation under the 5th \nAmendment, claims of veterans seeking disability benefits for combat \nrelated injuries, and vaccine compensation claims.\n  We are debating trade policy in the Senate, yet the nomination to \nfill one of four current vacancies on the U.S. Court of International \nTrade has sat idle on the Senate Executive Calendar for months. Like \nthe CFC nominees, the CIT nominee had a hearing last year, was \nfavorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice \nvote last Congress, and again earlier this year.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to clear the Executive Calendar of \nthe many consensus executive and judicial nominations before we break \nfor the Memorial Day recess. Let us show respect for our co-equal \nbranches of government and put these nominees in place to get to work \nfor the American people.\n\n\n                           Parrish Nomination\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate will soon be voting to confirm \nJustice Jill Parrish's nomination from the Utah Supreme Court to the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Utah.\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\n  Justice Parrish, who currently sits on the Utah Supreme Court, is \nextraordinarily well-prepared to fill this vacancy, and I hope and \nexpect that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support her \nnomination.\n  Justice Parrish is a well-known and highly regarded leader in the \nUtah legal community, who has served with honor and distinction on the \nSupreme Court of Utah. Her sharp legal mind, breadth of experience, and \nimpressive judicial temperament prepared her to serve on the Federal \nbench. I cannot think of a more qualified nominee to fill this vacancy \nat this time. I support Justice Parrish's nomination in the strongest \npossible terms, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  As a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have long worked \nto secure confirmations for the most qualified judicial nominees. In \nfact, I have participated in the appointment of three-quarters of the \njudges who have ever served on the U.S. District Court for the District \nUtah. That experience has given me a sense, both personally and \nprofessionally, of the kind of individual who will serve well on the \nFederal bench. That experience gives me every reason to strongly \nrecommend Justice Parrish for this appointment.\n  Justice Parrish is a talented jurist with an impressive background. \nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, she distinguished herself in \nprivate practice before appointment to the Utah Supreme Court. During \nher 30-year service, she has established a record of excellence both \nbefore and behind the bench, in both State and Federal courts, in both \nthe private and public sector, and in both trial and appellate courts.\n  The American Bar Association gave Justice Parrish a ``well-\nqualified'' rating--a distinction the organization only awards to \nexperienced nominees with the most remarkable legal ability and the \nhighest reputation for integrity. Federal nominees who receive the \n``well-qualified'' rating are also known for their breadth of \nexperience, their success in the legal community, and their capacity \nfor judicial temperament.\n  Not only does Justice Parrish match the ABA's requirements, but in \nevery respect, she exceeds them. The United States has the most \nrespected judiciary in the world, and we expect our nominees to the \nFederal bench to have a record of accomplishment in their chosen area \nof legal expertise. Justice Parrish is remarkable in that she has not \njust one but multiple areas of expertise, bringing keen judgment to an \nappointment that requires a broad range of experiences.\n  I have every confidence that Justice Parrish will serve admirably as \na district judge, just as she has served honorably on the Utah Supreme \nCourt. I might say, in supporting her confirmation, I wish to thank \nSenator Lee, who is not only my colleague on the Judiciary Committee \nbut also my partner in representing our great State and in recommending \nthe best candidate for judicial appointment. We agree that Justice \nParrish is a well-qualified nominee, and we strongly recommend her \nswift and unanimous confirmation. I call on my colleagues--Republicans \nand Democrats alike--to support her nomination.\n  I know this woman personally. I know her very, very well. All of the \nqualities I have been speaking about I have personally observed.\n  I think everybody here knows how seriously I take appointments to the \nFederal bench. In this particular case, I feel very, very good about \nthis nomination. I ask my colleagues to vote for her.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we will have the opportunity in a few moments \nto vote on a friend and colleague, Jill Parrish, who serves currently \non the Utah Supreme Court. She has been nominated by President Obama to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, replacing \nFederal Judge Dee Benson, with whom I have clerked.\n  I can think of no one better to replace Judge Benson than Justice \nParrish. She is a friend, she is a respected jurist, and she is a \ndedicated citizen. She is a friend to all who know her.\n  I am honored to have the opportunity to vote for her today, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, free trade is very important to our \ncountry and to our future economic prosperity. Anyone who does not \nbelieve that is in denial, in my opinion. We live in a global economy \nand we need to lead on the issue of free trade.\n  We must not make excuses and cower away from the opportunity in front \nof us.\n  The trade promotion authority legislation we are considering is a \ncritical tool for the advancement of our economic interest throughout \nthe world.\n  This legislation is also proof that Congress and the administration \ncan work together to increase economic opportunity for Americans across \nall 50 States.\n  Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden have worked for months to get \nus to this point. I commend them for this effort and I look forward to \nworking with them to finish this process.\n  We know that 80 percent of the purchasing power in the world is \nlocated outside the United States, along with 95 percent of the world's \nconsumers.\n  As the middle class expands in regions such as Asia, we have to make \nsure our businesses and workers have the ability to take advantage of \nthe opportunity that growth presents.\n  Some estimates predict the middle class in Asia is going to swell \nfrom half a billion people to over 3 billion people in just the next 15 \nyears. Are we going to sit on the sidelines while other countries gain \npreferential access to those consumers?\n  Governor Branstad of Iowa, recognizing the benefits of trade, sent a \nletter to me this week outlining his support for trade promotion \nauthority. The letter was signed by 74 other Iowans who represent \nbusinesses and associations that also believe it is critical that \nCongress pass TPA.\n  The letter states:\n\n       Quite simply, international trade is important to Iowa's \n     businesses, workers and farmers. A vote for leveling the \n     playing field in international trade is a vote for Iowa.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with Governor Branstad on that point.\n  Last year, U.S. exports equaled $2.35 trillion and supported nearly \n12 million jobs. Can any of us imagine our unemployment rate without \ntrade supporting 12 million jobs?\n  In Iowa alone, 448,000 jobs are dependent on trade, according to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce. And those jobs pay 18 percent higher wages on \naverage because they are tied to trade.\n  Americans know the benefits of trade. And we know that American \nbusinesses and workers are some of the most efficient and productive in \nthe world. We just need to make sure they have the opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  That is why we are considering this bill--to expand economic \nopportunities for American businesses and workers.\n  Free-trade agreements that lower trade barriers in other countries \ncan do an amazing thing--they can stimulate our economy through exports \nwithout requiring additional spending.\n  During testimony to the Senate Finance Committee, Trade \nRepresentative Froman pointed out that the U.S. is already an open \nmarketplace with tariffs that average just 1.6 percent, some of the \nlowest in the world. Yet at the same time, our companies face very high \ntariffs in other markets. Some agricultural products face tariffs up to \n400 percent, machinery can be up to 50 percent.\n  We cannot let the status quo on trade, where we have an open \nmarketplace while our businesses face extremely high tariffs, continue. \nTrade agreements set the stage for long-term opportunity. The citizens \nin Iowa who may benefit the most from more trade with Pacific rim \ncountries are probably still in school. We can help their future today.\n  Iowa exported $15.1 billion in 2014. That represents a 135 percent \nincrease compared to a decade earlier. $9 billion, or 60 percent of the \nexports went to TPP countries under current trade rules. Imagine what \nis possible just in Iowa if we reduce barriers in that region.\n  Roughly, $3.6 billion worth of machinery assembled by Iowa workers \nalone was exported last year. The goal of the legislation before us is \nto increase that number.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, fiscal years 2010-2014 \nrepresent the strongest 5 years of agricultural exports in the history \nof our country. We exported $675 billion worth of agricultural goods \nduring that period.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership would create more opportunities for our \nfarmers and ranchers in a region of the world that represents 39 \npercent of global GDP. You heard me correctly, we have a chance to give \nour farmers, ranchers, and businesses better access to markets that \nrepresent over one-third of global GDP.\n  And while I support and believe in the immense benefits of free \ntrade, I also oppose countries tilting the field in their favor through \nactions like undervaluing their currency. An undervalued currency makes \nexport goods cheaper from the country with the cheaper currency and \nalso makes it harder for consumers in that country to purchase foreign \ngoods, like our agricultural products.\n  I support addressing currency manipulation in our trade agreements. I \nhave watched administrations of both parties put their heads in the \nsand on this issue. Everyone opposes currency manipulation, yet little \never gets done.\n  This TPA bill represents the modern realties we face from the global \neconomy that need to be addressed by our trade negotiators.\n  The bill includes clear negotiating objectives for standards on \nsanitary and phytosanitary regulations that must be science-based. \nHaving science-based standards will help limit disruptions to U.S. \nagricultural exports and even open up some new markets for our \nproducers.\n  Negotiating objectives are offered related to digital trade in goods \nand cross-border dataflows that are new and unique issues for the time \nwe now live in.\n  Clear guidance from Congress is also given for localization barriers \nand intellectual property rights. More transparency and consultations \nare also required of the administration.\n  This is a good bill that we need to pass so we can finish the free \ntrade agreements we have been working on for years.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements like the \nTrans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, known as TTIP offer \ntremendous opportunity for our country and my home State of Iowa.\n  Throughout the world, there are an estimated 260 preferential trade \nagreements, the United States is only involved in 20 of them.\n  We must embrace our role in the world as the competitive economic \npowerhouse that we are. America is a country that leads, we have a \nchance to enter into a trade agreement that will set new rules and \nstandards for one-third of the global economy.\n  Getting TPA through Congress and completing more free trade \nagreements in the future can unleash economic\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nprosperity that leads to more jobs, more economic growth, and more \nopportunity for our workers.\n  I will end by asking what our alternative is for future \ncompetiveness. Other countries are working on preferential agreements. \nAre we going to sit idly while other countries enter into strategic \nagreements?\n  Should we let China start setting the rules of trade throughout the \nworld?\n  Should we allow other countries to continue blocking our agricultural \nproducts with nonscientific excuses?\n  Should we watch the growing middle class in Asia get their food and \nproducts from other countries without trying to compete for their \nbusiness?\n  The status quo on trade guarantees us a future with less economic \nopportunity compared to passing TPA and new trade agreements. That is \nwhy we must pass TPA and then pass new trade agreements to help ensure \nAmerica has a brighter economic future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk \nonce again about Congress's role in advancing our Nation's trade \npolicies and specifically on the increasingly important issues of \ndigital trade and intellectual property rights.\n  Let's keep in mind that the last time Congress passed TPA was in \n2002. We live in a very different world than we did 13 years ago. \nTechnology is vastly different. Commerce is vastly different. For \nexample, in 2002, less than 700 million people worldwide had access to \nthe Internet. Last year, that figure reached nearly 3 billion--with a \n``b''--3 billion people. In 2002, e-commerce platforms such as Amazon \nand eBay were just beginning to gain widespread use. Special media \nsites and other platforms that today drive so much Internet traffic and \nuser-generated content--sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter--\ndid not even exist.\n  In the last 13 years, an entirely new economy has developed based on \nthese online platforms. Today, Facebook has around 1.4 billion--with a \n``b''--active users, with approximately 83 percent living outside of \nthe United States of America and Canada. YouTube has more than 1 \nbillion users, with local interfaces in 75 countries and compatibility \nwith 61 different languages.\n  Mobile technology has similarly been transformed since 2002, as the \nterm ``smart phone'' has become part of our regular vocabulary. Mobile \nphones were big and clunky in 2002 and were not good for much more than \nmaking phone calls. Today, smart phones perform a myriad of functions, \nincluding streaming video from the Internet, video calling, digital \nphotography and videography, and GPS locating, just to mention a few.\n  The growth of the Internet and mobile technologies has transformed \nour economy, the products and services we buy, and how we buy them. The \nadvances have significantly reduced the cost of moving products and \nservices across borders and boosted productivity in this country and \naround the world.\n  Digitally traded goods and services are growing and are expected to \ncontinue to grow. According to a recent study conducted by the \nInternational Trade Commission, in 2012, U.S. digitally intensive firms \nsold nearly $1 trillion or nearly 6 percent of our total GDP in goods \nand services over the Internet. About one-quarter of those sales were \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. The people behind these numbers are \neveryday Americans just trying to compete in an increasingly \ncompetitive global marketplace.\n  Fortunately, our TPA bill includes upgraded negotiating objectives \nthat reflect the world in which we now live. To address this new \ndigital economy, our bill for the first time recognizes the growing \nsignificance of the Internet as a trading platform in international \ncommerce. It would also extensively update and expand the e-commerce \ndirectives from the 2002 TPA bill to require U.S. negotiators to ensure \nthat all trade agreement obligations, rules, disciplines, and \ncommitments apply to digital trade and that digitally traded goods and \nservices receive no less favorable treatment than comparable goods and \nservices and that they are classified to ensure the most liberal trade \ntreatment possible.\n  The free flow of data across borders is critical to facilitating \ndigital trade, as it allows U.S. companies to identify market \nopportunities, innovate and develop new goods and services, maintain \nsupply chains, and serve their customers around the world. \nUnfortunately, an increasing number of governments are considering or \nimposing restrictions on cross-border dataflows, including requirements \nthat U.S. companies store and process data locally. Our bill directs \nU.S. negotiators to ensure that our trading partners refrain from such \nrestrictions and requirements.\n  It also includes several new and expanded negotiating objectives to \naddress common regulatory issues faced by U.S. companies in the digital \neconomy. For example, the bill directs U.S. negotiators to seek greater \nopenness, transparency, and convergence of standards, development \nprocesses, and to encourage the use of international and interoperable \nstandards.\n  I would urge any of my colleagues who oppose this bill to explain how \nthey plan to give American workers and businesses in the digital \neconomy an opportunity to thrive in an increasingly competitive \nmarketplace--global marketplace, really. They talk about wanting to \npreserve jobs and protect Americans, but existing trade rules were \nwritten for a time long since passed.\n  Beyond transitioning our country into this increasingly competitive \nworld of technological growth, our TPA bill also takes a \nbipartisanship, bicameral approach to improving intellectual property \nrights protections. Protecting intellectual property is critical to the \ndevelopment of the digital economy, just as it is critical to overall \neconomic growth.\n  Our Founding Fathers believed intellectual property to be so \nfundamental to America's future prosperity that they explicitly granted \nCongress the congressional authority to protect it. Since Jefferson's \nmoldboard plow and Eli Whitney's cotton gin, American intellectual \nproperty has spurred on American job growth and prosperity, creating \nmore competitive businesses here--right here in America. Intellectual \nproperty, be it for mechanical products, software, or semiconductors, \ncreates value for individuals and American businesses. In turn, these \nbusinesses create jobs, spur economic growth, and enrich our culture.\n  The simply truth is, the countries that strengthen intellectual \nproperty rights enjoy great economic benefits. They attract more \ninvestment, technology transfers, increased immigration, and ultimately \nmore prosperity for their citizens. Yet, despite these fundamental \ntruths, intellectual property protections around the globe are often \nfundamentally deteriorating and continually at risk.\n  Our economic and strategic competitors are well aware that the United \nStates leads the world in innovation, but all too often they fail to \nunderstand why. Instead of fostering policies to advance innovation, \nthey seek shortcuts to undermine and even steal American intellectual \nproperty. The tools they employ are numerous and very sophisticated. \nSome of these tools include nontransparent reimbursement and licensing \nregimes, unfair standard setting, and burdensome regulations.\n  All of these mechanisms are designed specifically to pry away some of \nthe most innovative and productive parts of our economy, tearing away \nthe competitive edge our American businesses have worked so hard to \ncreate and stunting what could be a much more liberal playing field. If \nenacted, our bill would represent a significant step forward in \nstrengthening the protection and enforcement of intellectual property \nrights around the world.\n  It calls for robust intellectual property rules, building on the \nstrong intellectual property standards found in the prior 2002 TPA law. \nThis includes requiring that trade agreements meet the same high \nstandards found in U.S. law. Our bill also requires countries to fully \nimplement the TRIPS Agreement, particularly the enforcement \nobligations.\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n  To address the challenges and opportunities created by the digital \neconomy, our bill would ensure that right holders are able to keep pace \nwith technological developments by controlling and preventing \nunauthorized use of their works online.\n  A growing problem around the world is that foreign governments are \nstealing valuable technology from U.S. businesses. This type of trade-\nsecret theft threatens to diminish U.S. competitiveness around the \nglobe. It puts American jobs at risk and poses threats to U.S. national \nsecurity. To address this problem, our bill calls for an end to \ngovernment involvement in intellectual property rights violations, \nincluding piracy and cyber theft of trade secrets.\n  The bill also ensures that governments limit the unnecessary \ncollection of trade-secret information and protects any information \nthey do collect from disclosure. This is the first time TPA legislation \nhas addressed these issues--these very important issues.\n  The bill also requires the elimination of the price controls and \nreference pricing, which are used by many countries to deny full market \naccess to innovative pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\n  The bill further includes a new provision to direct the U.S. \nnegotiators to ensure that regulatory reimbursement regimes that make \npricing and reimbursement decisions are transparent, provide procedural \nfairness, are nondiscriminatory, and provide full-market access for \ninnovative pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\n  Our bill also calls for the elimination of measures that require U.S. \ncompanies to locate their intellectual property abroad as a market \naccess or investment condition. Finally, this legislation includes an \nexpanded capacity-building objective, directing the administration to \nwork with U.S. trading partners to strengthen not only their labor \nlaws, as was provided for in 2002, but also their intellectual property \nrights laws.\n  Once again, we live in an economic and technological environment that \nis very different from the one that existed in 2002. Advances in \nInternet and mobile technologies have transformed whole sectors of our \neconomy. Our bill positions our country to take advantage of the \nopportunities and face the challenges presented by the 21st century \neconomy, and that is one of the many reasons why it should pass.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to work with me to help move this bill \nforward so we can negotiate strong trade agreements that serve today's \neconomy as well as set the stage for America's next generation of \nentrepreneurs and innovators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                             Build USA Act\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about our \nNation's infrastructure. In just a few days, authorization for our \nNation's transportation programs will expire. By August, the highway \ntrust fund will run out of money. Our States and citizens will face the \nconsequences of inaction in Washington.\n  Americans depend on our Nation's roads every day as they travel to \nwork, bring their children to school, and transport goods to consumers. \nTransportation infrastructure is an essential component of our daily \nlives and for the national economy. As such, it must be efficiently \nmaintained. But today, all across America, our highways and bridges \nlanguish in disrepair. Our citizens are no strangers to potholes, road \nclosures, and ``expect delays'' signs. Moreover, as America's \npopulation continues to grow, expansion projects for our crumbling \nhighways remain caught in bureaucratic redtape.\n  For decades, it has been apparent that excessive regulations, coupled \nwith inadequate funding and financing, have delayed badly needed road \nprojects. I have firsthand knowledge of the challenges facing our \nNation's transportation system. In my home State of Nebraska, roads and \nbridges connect vibrant, urban communities with our open country.\n  Before arriving in the Senate, I served as chairman of the \ntransportation and telecommunications committee in the Nebraska \nLegislature. And while there, I spearheaded a bill that eventually \nbecame law.\n  What is now known as the Federal Funds Exchange Program provides the \nState of Nebraska with the ability to voluntarily exchange Federal \ntransportation funding for State transportation financing at 80 cents \non the dollar. In exchange for giving up this Federal funding, counties \nand cities receive State transportation dollars with more reasonable \nregulatory requirements.\n  This program has been a great success in my State of Nebraska. For \nexample, in Buffalo County, federally exchanged funding made a \nlongstanding bridge replacement possible. A major arterial street in \nSouth Sioux City is up and running because of the program. In \nScottsbluff, a city in the Nebraska Panhandle, they are using our State \nprogram to conduct important maintenance on city streets, and the \nprogram has also enabled Adams County to construct several bridges and \na large culvert project.\n  Despite these accomplishments in Nebraska, States across the country \nsuffer from very rigid, regulatory requirements and a shortage of \ntransportation funding options. Our current system is broken. States \nnot only need more options, but they need some relief as well.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service estimates that a lack of \nflexibility has caused major highway projects to take as many as 14 \nyears to plan and to build.\n  The time has come to bring successful practices from Nebraska to \nWashington.\n  For this reason, I have introduced the Build USA Act. This bill will \ncreate a new funding structure for State transportation projects. \nSpecifically, the Build USA Act establishes the American Infrastructure \nBank. The bank will allow States to remit Federal transportation \ndollars.\n  States would then be able to receive 90 percent of this money back \nand retain control over the environmental, construction, and design \naspects of highway projects. This new strategy will infuse more dollars \ninto our transportation system, and it is going to provide States with \ngreater flexibility so they can build and maintain their roads.\n  The revenues that are generated from State remittance agreements with \nthis bank would also help fund other local infrastructure projects. \nCurrently, the Federal Government only offers large-scale financing \noptions for States seeking core infrastructure funding. So, as a \nresult, smaller communities are often ineligible to receive Federal \nassistance for their projects, while major metropolitan areas benefit \nfrom easier access to financing.\n  Under the Build USA Act, bank loans would not be subject to a minimum \nproject cost or size. The revenue from these loans could help local \ngovernments apply for core infrastructure financing at a rate that is \ngoing to be more competitive than the private sector.\n  The Build USA Act provides additional funding flexibility for those \nimmediate transportation needs that we see all across this country. \nAnd, what is more, it accomplishes it without raising taxes.\n  Under this proposal, a voluntary 3-year repatriation holiday would be \nimplemented to generate seed money for the bank's revolving fund \noperations. Recent estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation suggest \nthat the first 3 years of a similar repatriation plan could raise as \nmuch as $30 billion.\n  Although some Members of Congress wish to save these revenues for an \noverhaul of the Tax Code, most of us do acknowledge that tax reform is \nunlikely to come to fruition in the near future. Meanwhile, our \nNation's transportation needs are immediate. We better address them \nnow. These dollars should go toward solving problems that our citizens \nexperience every single day. As such, revenue should help provide a \nlong-term solution to highway funding, not just a one-time jump-start \nor a shot in the arm, as some people have suggested.\n  This proposal is a long-term solution. It is a solution to issues \nthat have plagued our Nation's roads for decades. Individual States \nmust have the flexibility to address the unique needs of their local \ncommunities.\n  In order to address the transportation challenges facing our Nation, \nwe need to have more options available. Although this plan does not \naddress the immediate challenges facing the\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nhighway trust fund, it does represent a way to infuse new money into \nour Nation's transportation system, while it is offering States new \nsolutions to get transportation projects up and running.\n  It looks to the future. This is a proposal for the long term. It is \ntime that we start thinking outside the box. It is time to offer \nNebraska's best practices to help the Federal Government help itself.\n  Our Nation needs to get moving, so I encourage all of my colleagues \nto look at this proposal, to consider this proposal, because it moves \nus forward into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we have been talking over the past \nseveral days about trade. I wish to add a little discussion here about \nsome of the specific amendments that may come up over the next day or \ntwo. I am hopeful that we will have a vote on some of these amendments \nlater this evening.\n  It is incredibly important for us to expand opportunities for our \nworkers and our farmers by knocking down barriers to trade. That is why \nmore export promotion is a good thing. These are not only more jobs for \nAmerica, for my State of Ohio, for the Presiding Officer's State of \nArizona, but these are better-paying jobs as well. There is no question \nthat not having trade promotion authority over the last 7 years has \nbeen detrimental to us in terms of losing market share for our workers \nand our farmers.\n  Other countries are negotiating agreements. In fact, there have been \nwell over 100 agreements negotiated without the United States being a \nparty and that cuts us out.\n  But as we do that, as we expand exports--which is a good thing--we \nmust be sure that playing field is also more level and fairer, so that \nour workers and our farmers, and our service providers have the \nopportunity to compete.\n  That is all we are asking for.\n  There are a couple of amendments likely to come up again this \nafternoon and over the next couple of days. One is with regard to this \nissue of when somebody dumps a product or when a country has a policy \nof subsidizing a product, there should be the ability for American \ncompanies to respond on behalf of their workers.\n  When products are dumped or when there is a subsidy on an import, \nthere is a process by which you go to the International Trade \nCommission and seek help, show that you were materially injured, that \ndamage was done to you, your company, and your workers because of these \nunfairly traded imports. You then go to the Commerce Department's \nInternational Trade Administration and make the argument as to what the \ncountervailing duty ought to be, what the tariff ought to be to combat \nthis. The problem is that in that system today, it is so hard to show \nmaterial injury and to get that relief that often by the time you can \nget that relief, it is too late.\n  We certainly found this in Ohio with regard to many of our \nindustries, and a lot of them, therefore, are very interested in this \namendment. One is steel. Right now, there is a lot of tube and pipe \ncoming into this country from overseas. We believe some of it is being \nsold at below its cost here in America. That means it is being dumped. \nWe believe some is being subsidized. That means it should be subject to \ncountervailing duties. Yet, by the time you can get that relief, find \nthat remedy, often it is just too late. You have lost your market \nshare. You have lost the American jobs.\n  So this amendment, which is bipartisan and which is backed by over 80 \nAmerican companies and trade associations and many companies in my home \nState of Ohio, such as U.S. Steel, Timken Steel, ArcelorMittal, is a \ncommonsense measure that says: Look, workers shouldn't have to lose \ntheir jobs before they can get relief.\n  Seventy-eight of our colleagues backed this amendment in the Customs \nbill last week. In fact, Senator Hatch, chairman of the committee, who \nhas done a good job shepherding this process through, included this \namendment in his mark in the Committee on Finance, which demonstrates \nhow much support it has. However, we feel it is very important that it \nbe in this legislation, in the trade promotion authority bill, which is \nthe bill we are now debating on the floor. We can't let it get left \nbehind.\n  It is interesting because other countries do have provisions in their \nlaws to keep our exports out if they believe they are unfairly traded \nor for other reasons. Let me give an example of this by going to AK \nSteel, which is a company that is based in West Chester, OH. It has \n4,000 workers in the State of Ohio. AK Steel produces a high-tech steel \ncalled grain-oriented electrical steel. It is a silicon alloy used in \nthe power generation and transmission industry and is more commonly \nreferred to as GOES. GOES steel is a specialty steel. It is an \nincredibly important product for AK Steel because it is one they are \nable to export. They are so efficient at producing it and it has such \nhigh value that they are exporting it to a number of countries around \nthe world. They produce this steel with 250 United Auto Workers--\nmembers of the UAW--in Zanesville, OH.\n  Back in 2010, China imposed antidumping and countervailing duties on \nGOES from the United States, including this product from AK Steel made \nin Zanesville, OH. They claimed U.S. producers had received subsidies \nthrough the ``Buy American'' provisions in the stimulus bill. They \ndidn't, by the way, but that is what China claimed. It was really \nretaliation that had to do with some other products that had been \ncoming from China to here--tubular products for the oil and gas \nindustry--and they were retaliating. Anyway, that was China's claim.\n  So our company, AK Steel, said: Look, this is not accurate. But these \nduties were put in place anyway by China. It reduced the exports by 92 \npercent from Ohio to China. So the United States--rightfully so--took \nChina to the World Trade Organization and won the case because the \nfacts were on our side. We won the case, but China appealed it--without \nremoving the duties.\n  So this all takes time. Meanwhile, you are losing market share. \nInstead of immediately removing the duties, when they lost the appeal, \nChina chose to run out the clock, only dropping their tariff a couple \nweeks before the WTO forced them to do it. So American-made GOES was \nkept out of China for 5 years. This process took 5 years and cost \nAmerican workers millions of orders.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. domestic producer sought relief from their \ngovernment by going to the ITC as well as the ITA--the International \nTrade Commission and the International Trade Administration--and they \nfound the domestic industry was not injured in a case against producers \nfrom several countries, including Japan, Germany, China, and Poland, \ndespite surging imports and dropping prices. So on the one hand, they \nwere not able to sell in China for 5 years and lost a lot of market \nshare and millions of dollars. On the other hand, when they went to \ntheir own government to ask for a little relief on this product coming \nin, they were not able to show injury despite surging imports and \ndropping prices.\n  The provisions we have simply clarify that when a producer--a U.S. \ncompany--is injured, when it is material injury as was defined in the \nstatute, they shouldn't have to wait until after the factory is closed \nand workers are laid off for us to stand up for our workers.\n  By the way, just last month these GOES producers were cut out of \nanother large international market. The European Union announced it \nwould be imposing duties on this same electrical steel from the United \nStates, again putting millions of dollars of exports at risk.\n  So our provision is an attempt to help level this playing field. It \nis WTO-consistent; in other words, it doesn't violate our international \nobligations. It simply clarifies what ``material injury'' means. It \ngoes back to the original statutory language and makes it easier for \nAmerican companies to seek\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\nthe relief they deserve. This is going to help protect millions of \nAmerican jobs that otherwise could be at risk because our trade laws \nhaven't kept up with international commerce.\n  This is an example of one of the amendments we would very much like \nto offer on the floor. I know there is discussion right now in another \nroom in this Capitol about whether we will be able to offer this \namendment. It is an amendment by Senator Brown and me. It is an example \nof what--if we included it in the trade promotion authority \nlegislation--would make this a bill that is truly balanced, one that \nexpands exports, which is incredibly important, as I said earlier, to \nthe people I represent--our farmers, our workers--and to our State and \nour economy, but that also ensures that there is a more level playing \nfield, that there is fairness in this underlying legislation.\n  The second amendment we hope to offer is with regard to currency \nmanipulation. We have talked a lot about this on the floor this week, \nand I would just say three things.\n  One, this is something a lot of Members in this Chamber have already \nlooked at because 60 Members of the Senate in 2013 sent a letter to the \nPresident of the United States saying that with regard to trade \nagreements, there should be enforceable currency manipulation \nprohibitions--60. Some of those Senators are still in this Chamber. \nMost of them are. I would hope we again would have a strong message \nfrom the Congress, which is what trade promotion authority is, that in \nthe context of trade negotiating objectives--and there are about 20 \ndifferent trade negotiating objectives in TPA--one of them should be \nthat we have a prohibition on currency manipulation, and it should be \nenforceable.\n  Second, there will be an alternative amendment offered that agrees \nwith our amendment in terms of the definition of currency manipulation. \nSpecifically, it does not affect monetary policy. It does not affect \nwhat the United States has been doing with QE2, QE3, QE1.\n  By the way, for those who think that kind of monetary policy is \nexport-oriented, look at the value of the dollar. It has certainly not \nbeen effective at lowering the price of our currency. In fact, our \ncurrency has gone up in value. It is about stimulus. We can argue about \nthe merits or demerits of that monetary policy, but it is not affected \nat all by this amendment, and the amendment specifically clarifies \nthat.\n  So just to be clear, No. 1, 60 Senators have already signed this \nletter; No. 2, this is consistent with the International Monetary Fund \ndefinition, which says this is not about monetary policy. It is about \nreal intervention. It is about intervention in currency markets to be \nable to affect exports, to lower the price of exports unfairly and to \nincrease the cost of our exports to other countries unfairly.\n  Finally, I would just say this is about the balance we talked about \nearlier. The American people want to know that while we are expanding \nexports, we are also ensuring that we get a fair shake--our farmers, \nour workers, our service providers.\n  There is a quote by a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul \nVolcker, that I think is telling. As a former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, he said that, ``In five minutes, exchange rates can wipe out \nwhat it took trade negotiators ten years to accomplish.''\n  As a former U.S. Trade Representative, I agree with that. Currency \nmanipulation takes away so much of the value of what we are trying to \ndo on this floor. Those who support trade should be in favor of \nprohibitions on currency. This is a distortion. If you are a market-\noriented fiscal conservative, if you are someone who believes we ought \nto let markets work, then you should be against currency manipulation \nbecause it does distort the market. If you are someone who believes we \nshould be expanding exports but it should be fair, you should be for \nthis prohibition on currency manipulation and making it enforceable. \nAnd we should have the courage of our convictions. If we really do \nbelieve that, we should be sure there is some ability to make this \nenforceable.\n  The countries of the Pacific region that are currently negotiating \nwith us on the Trans-Pacific Partnership do not currently manipulate \ntheir currency, but a couple of them have in the past. Notably, Japan \nhas over 300 times before 2012. Malaysia has. It doesn't make sense to \nput in place this provision to say: In the future--once we have \ncompleted this agreement with you, we have knocked down these trade \nbarriers in the United States and in your country to enable us to have \nmore trade--you would not be able to manipulate your currency under \nthis agreement.\n  There is some polling data out there that indicates 9 out of 10 \nAmericans agree with that, by the way. And of course they do because it \nis just common sense. All we are looking for is the ability to compete \nfairly.\n  Wouldn't it be great if we could do both of these things--expand \nexports but also be sure we are getting a fair shake for the people we \nrepresent, the AK Steels of the world that have their products blocked \nin China and their products blocked in the EU and yet can't receive the \nrelief here or the companies in my home State that work hard to bring \nsome business back from China?\n  In one case, there is a small manufacturer in Cleveland, OH, that \ntold me about this. It is a company that makes highly valuable steel \nproducts, and these are products that help hold up speakers at major \nconcerts. They brought some of that business back from China.\n  One day I was in their shop talking to them, and they said: Well, we \nare going to lose this order. Why? Currency manipulation. That made the \nChinese imports into our country less expensive because they \nmanipulated their currency and lowered their value and made it much \nmore difficult for them, therefore, to be competitive. They were \nconcerned that they were going to lose that order despite the fact that \nthey had done everything to make their plant more efficient and that \nthe workers had made concessions. They had done everything right and \nplayed by the rules. That is what we are asking, that everybody be \nasked to play by the rules.\n  So I hope the underlying legislation passes, but I hope it passes \nwith these improvements to ensure that we do have a balance here; that \nwe are able to tell our farmers and our workers and our service \nproviders: You are going to have the opportunity now to access 95 \npercent of the consumers who are outside the borders of the United \nStates of America. That is a good thing. It will mean more jobs and \nhigher paying jobs, paying on average 15 to 18 percent more, and better \nbenefits. But also, by entering into these agreements, we are going to \nhave more fairness for you so you can get a fair shake and be able to \ndo what you want to do, which is to be able to compete in this global \nmarketplace and be assured that competition will be fair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the trade promotion \nauthority bill which has been debated on the Senate floor the last few \ndays.\n  I begin, though, by complimenting my good friend and colleague from \nOhio--one of the most well-respected Members of this body, I think an \nexample of a true American statesman, and certainly one of our best \nU.S. Trade Representatives who knows a lot about the topic that we have \nbeen debating. So I thank him for his tremendous service for the people \nof Ohio and of our country.\n  The TPA bill we have been debating is going to be good for the \ncountry. It will help move our country forward, provide tremendous \nopportunities for growth and expansion--for our farmers, ranchers, \nbusinesses, fishermen, workers, and those in the high-tech sector.\n  As Senator Portman mentioned, 95 percent of all global consumers lie \noutside of the United States--95 percent. What we need to do is access \nthose consumers to have more opportunity.\n  Currently, it is estimated that over 38 million jobs in the United \nStates are tied to trade. The trade agreements we are talking about on \nthe Senate floor that would come after TPA will create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs and new opportunities for Americans. These are \ngood jobs, and we need more jobs.\n  This has been one of the weakest recoveries of any major recession in \nAmerican history. We are barely growing at 1.5 percent, 2 percent GDP \ngrowth. These are not traditional levels of American growth. Why? Why \nhas our growth been so slow?\n  Well, there are many reasons. But I think the overregulation of our \neconomy by the Federal Government clearly is one of the major reasons, \nand trade agreements are exactly the kind of boost we need. What do \ntrade agreements do? They reduce regulations, they cut redtape, they \nreduce taxes on goods coming in to American families. We need this kind \nof policy, in terms of less regulation and more freedom for our \ndomestic economy and internationally. That is how we are going to get\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nmoving again. That is how we are going to get this economy moving \nagain. That is how we are going to get Americans working again. That is \nwhy TPA is so important to begin this process. But TPA is also about \nAmerican leadership--bipartisan U.S. American leadership.\n  Since the end of World War II, every administration--Democratic, \nRepublican, it doesn't matter--has wanted to lead on trade, has wanted \nto obtain trade promotion authority, and that has been critical to \nAmerican leadership, global leadership, and helping our businesses and \nworkers.\n  It is also critical to make sure we have a seat at the table, to set \nthe rules for the global trading regime as we have traditionally done--\nagain, bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans for decades have been \ndoing this--and to help make sure we are leveling the playing field for \nour workers.\n  The American workers--the American fisherman, the American rancher, \nthe American farmer--can compete against anyone in the world with a \nlevel playing field. We have done that for decades. That is the \nAmerican way, but we have to be in the game. We need to be the country \nsetting the rules. We need to be the country that lays out trade \nagreements that have strong intellectual property rights protection, \nthat open markets, that get rid of state-owned enterprises, that have \nstrong enforcement provisions--so when countries cheat in global trade, \nwe have the ability to enforce rules and strike back if we need to, to \nprotect our economy, our workers, our farmers, our fishermen.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about free trade as it relates to my home \nState of Alaska.\n  Here are some facts about trade in Alaska: Already, in my State of \nAlaska there are over 90,000 jobs tied to trade. That is more than one \nin five of all jobs in the Alaska economy tied to global trade, \nparticularly trade to the Asia-Pacific region.\n  We are also a huge recipient of foreign direct investment--foreign \ndirect investment that employs Alaskans. These are good jobs. Fourteen \nthousand Alaskans are directly employed by foreign companies, and there \nare tens of thousands more who are indirectly benefited. So many \nAlaskans count on these important jobs.\n  In terms of exports, of course we are a very large State with a \nrelatively small population--a little over 700,000 citizens. But in \n2013, the State of Alaska exported over $6 billion in goods and \nservices. Per capita exports, we are a powerhouse. We are one of the \nstrongest exporters in the country. And in terms of fish and seafood, \nwe are the superpower of exports--not per capita but absolute exports. \nIn 2013, we exported roughly $2.3 billion in seafood and fish.\n  The fishing industry is a very important industry for a lot of States \nin our country, but more than half of all seafood harvested in America \ncomes from Alaska's waters. It is also one of the biggest employers in \nmy State. In fact, it is the biggest employer in my State, even more \nthan some of the resource industries. There are 78,000 Alaskans \nemployed in this industry, and these are the epitome of small \nbusinesses.\n  Every fishing vessel, when you look at one, is a small business. What \ndo they do? They take risks. I am sure some have seen ``The Deadliest \nCatch.'' A lot of times they are family-owned. They work hard, and they \nproduce a great product--a great product--king crab, fresh Alaska \nsalmon--a great product. These are classic American small businesses, \nwhich brings me to my amendment.\n  As my colleague from Ohio mentioned, there are a lot of discussions \nright now. We sure hope Members of this body are going to have \nopportunities to present amendments to make the TPA bill stronger.\n  The amendment I have filed, that I want to offer, is a simple \namendment to make a principal negotiating objective under TPA focusing \non making sure members of the fishing community--American Fish, \nAmerican Seafoods--have opportunities for more open markets overseas. \nThis will benefit the hard-working fishing families all across America.\n  This amendment will ensure that of the many TPA objectives, this one \nwill be in there--more access to markets, more opportunities for these \ngreat American small businesses.\n  As I mentioned, not only in terms of Alaska is this an important \nindustry, this is a hugely important industry for the United States. In \n2013, our country exported over $5.5 billion worth of fish and seafood. \nThe commercial fishing industry in the United States in 2013 employed \nover 1 million Americans, with an income of $32 billion. Let me repeat \nthat: Over 1 million Americans in this industry nationwide and $32 \nbillion in income--and, again, most of these are classic American small \nbusinesses. This is who TPA should be focused on.\n  As I mentioned, the current TPA bill has negotiating objectives for a \nlot of important industries in our great country--textile, agriculture, \nservices, manufactured goods. There are about 20 specific trading \nnegotiating objectives that the TPA bill directs the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to get in terms of the free-trade agreements he will try \nto seek once TPA has been passed, and this is the way it should be. \nThose are all great sectors. Agriculture is hugely important to our \ncountry. But we should also have a similar negotiating objective for \nanother very important industry in this country--our seafood industry, \nthe fishing industry.\n  This is a simple amendment. It asks that the U.S. trade negotiator \nfocus as a principal objective to make sure this industry has \nopportunities just like all the other industries do and, importantly, \nparticularly as we are trying to work through this bill to see what \namendments we can get on it, this is a very bipartisan amendment.\n  Senator Markey of Massachusetts, on the other side, has a lot of \nhard-working fishing families. So from Alaska to Massachusetts, this is \na very bipartisan bill that will help small businesses, and it help \ncoastal communities that rely so much on fishing.\n  Finally, I want to talk about TPA and go back to the issue of \nAmerican leadership. TPA, open trade, and free-trade agreements can \nwork for America. They can work for our workers, farmers, businesses, \nranchers, fishermen. I know. I have had the opportunity of seeing this \nfirsthand.\n  I worked as an Assistant Secretary of State under Condoleezza Rice on \neconomic issues, on trade issues, and a number of the free-trade \nagreements we currently have in force were ones I had an opportunity to \nwork on with many members in the Federal Government.\n  Let me give two examples: the free-trade agreement we had with \nSingapore and the free-trade agreement we had with Australia. Once \nthese were passed and the barriers to our exports came down, American \nexports skyrocketed to these countries. As I mentioned, American \nworkers can compete with anyone. Give us a level playing field, and we \nwill take advantage of it.\n  U.S. exports, in terms of goods to Australia, rose 33 percent between \n2004 and 2009. U.S. goods exports to Singapore were up $21 billion--31 \npercent--from 2003 to 2009.\n  I met with the Singapore Ambassador today. He reminded me that we \nactually have a trade surplus with Singapore, as I believe we do with \nAustralia, because of these free-trade agreements.\n  So free-trade agreements are a win-win for our country economically, \nbut they also importantly deepen the economic ties that bind our \ncountry and our citizens to some of our most important friends and \nallies--such as the country of Singapore, such as the country of \nAustralia, and that is happening.\n  Finally, though, trade is also about American leadership, it is about \nAmerican confidence, the ability to say: Open the markets and we can \ncompete with anyone. We need that confidence back.\n  For too long under this administration we have been disengaged from \nthe world. For too long we have allowed other countries to be in the \ndriver's seat globally--where we have not been driving events, we have \nbeen reacting to events internationally. For too long we have been \nwithdrawing, for too long we have been leading from behind, and for too \nlong we have not been showing confidence globally; we have been showing \nweakness. Weakness is provocative, and you see that all over the world.\n  Now, I have been critical of this administration's approach to \nforeign policy in a whole host of areas--its foreign\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\npolicy of global disengagement, its lack of confidence, and American \nleadership in the world. But I applaud the President for what he is \ndoing now. I applaud the President for his strategy of rebalancing the \nfocus of military forces and trade in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n  I applaud the President for doing the hard work of seeking TPA. These \nare never easy votes. These are never easy votes. But we should support \nwhat he is doing because it means America is back. We are engaging \nagain. We are not leading from behind. We are leading the way countless \nadministrations in the past have done with regard to global trade.\n  This will enable us to determine our future, to drive it, not react \nto it. I urge my colleagues to vote for this TPA bill because it is a \nvote for American leadership.\n  I also urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment that is going to \nhelp many small businesses throughout the United States and coastal \ncommunities and our strong fishing communities.\n  My amendment will strengthen the TPA bill, and I encourage all my \ncolleagues to support that amendment as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Small Business and Trade\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I appreciate the chairman's leadership on the trade \npromotion authority, TPA, legislation. As he has said, this bill \ncreates the process by which the administration can negotiate trade \nagreements that have the potential to enhance trade opportunities for \nAmerican businesses. The ability to reach new markets is critical for \nensuring that American businesses can compete in a global marketplace.\n  Trade has become increasingly vital for small businesses looking to \ndiversify and grow. And yet, even though 95 percent of the world's \ncustomers live overseas, less than 1 percent of small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses in the United States sell to global markets. By comparison, \nover 40 percent of large businesses sell their products overseas.\n  As ranking member of the Small Business Committee, one of my \npriorities is narrowing that gap. I believe that, as we consider \nexpanding trade relationships, we must make sure that small businesses \nhave a seat at the table and the support they need to reach global \nmarkets and compete internationally.\n  Does the chairman agree?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. Yes, I agree \nwholeheartedly. Small businesses are a vital part of promoting \ninternational trade.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the chairman. To that end, I have filed an \namendment, amendment No. 1227, that would take a number of steps to \nensure that our small businesses benefit from international trade and \npotential new trade agreements.\n  Although I understand that we will not have an opportunity to amend \nthe TPA legislation, I hope to work with the chairman to ensure that \nthis amendment is included in H.R. 644 or a similar bill as reported by \na conference committee to reauthorize trade facilitation and trade \nenforcement functions and activities.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator has my commitment to work with her to do so.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the chairman. I appreciate his support for this \namendment.\n  Does the ranking member agree that we should ensure that small \nbusinesses are supported as part of our trade agenda?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do, and I support the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire that would make sure that we engage small businesses as part \nof our efforts on international trade. I also look forward to working \nwith her to do everything possible to get this amendment included in \nH.R. 644.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3231-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BOB SCHIEFFER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later this month, a man we have all \nbecome accustomed to welcoming into our living rooms will leave behind \na decades-long journalistic career and embark on a new journey with his \nwife, Pat.\n  Bob Lloyd Schieffer has been a Pentagon reporter. He has served as a \nState Department reporter. He has covered the White House. And he has \nroamed the halls of the Capitol as a congressional reporter.\n  It is rare to see any journalist serve in all four of the big DC \nnational assignments. But Bob Schieffer has.\n  Bob has interviewed every President since Nixon. He has moderated \ndebates between Kerry and Bush, between Obama and McCain, and most \nrecently between Obama and Romney. He has won just about every award \npossible in broadcast journalism, including a few Emmys. And he has \nturned out chart-topping hits, like ``TV Anchorman,'' as the front man \nfor a honky-tonk band.\n  Perhaps that is the passion Bob will follow in retirement. We will \nsee.\n  But here is one thing we do know: Bob Schieffer is one of the most \nfamous Horned Frogs ever to graduate from his beloved TCU. It is no \nwonder Bob Schieffer's alma mater elected to name its School of \nJournalism after the man who hosts CBS' ``Face the Nation'' every \nSunday.\n  I have been a guest on his show many times. He can ask tough \nquestions. But he is fair.\n  The last time I appeared with Bob, we talked about the new majority's \ndrive to restore the Senate. He later shared his view on our efforts \nwith his audience.\n  ``What's happening is by no means on the scale of an Old Testament \nmiracle,'' he said.\n  ``But,'' he noted, ``Every journey begins with a first step.''\n  I agree with him. It is not like we are parting the Potomac. But we \nare getting the Senate moving again, debating again, amending again, \nand working again. I think it is good for our country.\n  Perhaps Bob might take some of his own advice as he looks to the \nfuture too.\n  Because every journey does begin with a first step.\n  So whatever it is Bob ultimately chooses to do in retirement, whether \nit is penning a memoir or cutting more honky-tonk hits, it all begins \nwith that first step. He will take it on May 31, when he signs off for \nthe last time.\n  I am sure it will be a bittersweet moment for him. But it is a step \nhe is likely to ultimately welcome after so many years in the \nspotlight. The Senate wishes him all the best in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3231-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3231-S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CELEBRATING RABBI YOCHEVED MINTZ OF CONGREGATION P'NAI TIKVAH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Rabbi \nYocheved Mintz' 10th anniversary with Congregation P'nai Tikvah in Las \nVegas, NV. Through her dedication to serving others, Rabbi Mintz has \nhelped further Congregation P'nai Tikvah's commitment to providing an \ninclusive and open environment for spiritual development. I am \nappreciative of her tremendous efforts on behalf of the Jewish \ncommunity and the city of Las Vegas.\n  Rabbi Mintz' many leadership roles demonstrate the seriousness with \nwhich she takes her duties as a spiritual leader, as well as her \ncompassion and willingness to devote much of her time to helping \nothers. Within the Jewish community, her responsibilities include \npresident of the Mintz Family Foundation for Creative Jewish Education \nand serving on numerous boards, such as the Jewish Family Services \nAgency and Rabbis for Religious Freedom and Equality in Israel.

Mr. Presudent, on the floor yesterday, the majority leader \nclaimed that last Congress, Senate Democrats ``failed to bring any \ntrafficking legislation to the floor.''\n  I do not normally do this, but I must correct the record. The facts \nare exactly the opposite, and the Senate's history must be clear on \nthis.\n  Last Congress, despite the opposition of the majority of Senate \nRepublicans, including Senators McConnell and Cornyn, Senate Democrats \nreauthorized our Nation's two cornerstone pieces of legislation that \nprotect victims of sexual violence and human trafficking--the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, VAWA, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nTVPA. Combined, these two bills reauthorized nearly $1 billion a year \nin funding for survivors of these horrible crimes. As we updated and \nmodernized these landmark laws, we listened to the survivors and the \nadvocates who work with them every day to make sure that our \nlegislation responded to the real needs of real people. We were not \nlooking for gimmicks or shortcuts. Instead, we dedicated hours of time \nlearning about what was working and what needed to be improved in order \nto best meet the needs of survivors.\n  The end result was two bills that did more to prevent sexual assault \nand human trafficking and to reach more victims than ever before. \nBecause of our comprehensive and inclusive approach, these bills had \nthe strong and vocal support of more than 1,400 local, State and \nnational organizations.\n  In addition to the successful reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act last Congress, I \nlater moved a comprehensive package of legislation to address the issue \nof human trafficking here in the United States, which included critical \nsupport programs directed at runaway and homeless youth to prevent \ntrafficking in the first place. Last year that package, which included \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, as well as the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, the Bringing Missing \nChildren Home Act, and the Combat Human Trafficking Act, was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired. I then sought the \nunanimous consent of the Senate to pass that bipartisan package, and \nevery single Democratic Senator agreed. But Republicans blocked it. \nThey objected to it. Senator McConnell failed to mention any of this \nyesterday.\n  So if such assertions are going to be loosely made on this floor, let \nthe record be clear about who, in fact, stood in the way of protections \nfor trafficking victims last year. Look to see which Members voted \nagainst the reauthorizations of the Violence Against Women Act and the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act. Those two laws were passed with the \nvotes of every Senate Democrat. And last year, it was Republicans who \nobstructed passage of the subsequent comprehensive domestic \nantitrafficking package, supported by every Democrat, that included \ncritical trafficking prevention legislation. On top of all that, under \nDemocratic leadership of the Senate Appropriations Committee, total \nappropriations for trafficking victims' services more than doubled in \nfiscal year 2015, rising from $28.1 million to $58 million.\n  When we look at the facts, it is simply outrageous and laughable to \nsuggest Senate Democrats did not support antitrafficking efforts last \nCongress. These facts matter and I cannot allow revisionist history to \nmuddy the accomplishments we and so many advocates fought for in the \nlast Congress.\n  Regrettably, the newly empowered Senate Republicans have not \ncontinued the same survivor-led approach we took in the last Congress \nto pass VAWA and the TVPA. Instead they sought to use a new \nantitrafficking bill, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, JVTA, \nto expand the reach of the Hyde amendment and its restrictions on \nhealth care for these women who are survivors of trafficking crimes. In \ndoing so, the same Senators who voted against VAWA and TVPA in the last \nCongress inserted unnecessary and destructive politics into what was \notherwise a bipartisan antitrafficking bill. The result was to \nneedlessly tie the Senate in knots for weeks over this legislation. \nMore importantly, Senate Republicans' effort to expand the Hyde \namendment undermined what should be the very goal of antitrafficking \nlegislation--to help return dignity and self-determination to the lives \nof survivors of human trafficking. That was certainly the goal of our \nsuccessful effort to expand the scope of VAWA and TVPA to reach all \nvictims.\n  It is also the goal behind the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act that I reintroduced with Senator Collins \nthis Congress. This bill, which was a critical part of the debate last \nCongress and should remain a critical part of the debate in this \nCongress, aims to prevent young people from becoming victims of \ntrafficking in the first place. We know runaway and homeless children \nare exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. These children \nliterally have nowhere to go. And traffickers prey on this \nvulnerability. That is why Senator Collins and I fought so hard to add \nthis legislation to the JVTA. The runaway and homeless youth programs \nsupported by our bill keep kids safe, save lives, and prevent human \ntrafficking in the first place.\n  I was very disappointed when our amendment failed to pass by just \nfour votes. What was most disheartening was that the principal \nobjection was the inclusion of an important nondiscrimination provision \nto ensure that no child, including those who identify as LGBT, faces \ndiscrimination by service providers. But I am not giving up. I will \nkeep fighting to see this legislation passed because it is so \nimportant. As the Polaris Project, a leading antitrafficking advocacy \norganization, recently told the New York Times:\n\n       Successful efforts to combat modern slavery must address \n     the root causes that make people vulnerable in the first \n     place . . . Until critical funding is reauthorized through \n     the Runaway and Homeless Youth [and] Trafficking Prevention \n     Act to support critical services, such as shelter beds for \n     homeless kids, this population will face increased risk.\n\n  Senator McConnell and I may differ in our opinions, but I think it is \nimportant to get it right when it comes to facts. To say that Senate \nDemocrats failed to move antitrafficking legislation last Congress \nrewrites history and does a tremendous disservice to all of those \nvictims and advocates who so recently dedicated years of their lives to \nthe successful reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and to crafting a bipartisan \npackage of antitrafficking legislation that was ultimately blocked by \nSenate Republicans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3232-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3232-S3233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE J.

Warren and \nLois McClure Foundation on the celebration of its 20th anniversary. For \ntwo decades, the selfless philanthropy of the McClure family has \nallowed scores of deserving Vermonters to pursue financial stability \nand academic success.\n  Established in 1995, the foundation was built upon Lois and her late \nhusband Mac's concept of ``giving with warm hands.'' Inspired by the \nidea of collaborative philanthropy, the McClures set out to give with \nthe hope it would encourage benevolence among future generations.\n  For 20 years, the foundation has collaborated with private and public \npartners to support low-income and first-\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\ngeneration students, adult learners, and veterans. From providing \ntransition services for homeless youth, to promoting single parents' \neducation programs and mental health services for veterans, there are \nno bounds to the McClure family's encouragement of life-long success.\n  Institutions such as the Vermont State Colleges, the American Red \nCross of Vermont, the Vermont Department of Libraries, the Vermont Vet \nto Vet Program, and hundreds more have expanded innovative learning \nprograms as a result of the foundation. From cancer patients to \nlegislators, the foundation has touched countless lives, while \ninspiring those to follow their dreams.\n  The foundation has also been instrumental in supporting historical \npreservation projects at the Leahy Center for Lake Champlain and the \nLake Champlain Maritime Museum. The McClures' vision to inspire a \nlifelong cultural and historical education for all Vermonters, \nmeanwhile maintaining a commitment to environmental sustainability, has \nenhanced multiple facets of our State's diverse landscape for \ngenerations to come.\n  As someone who has met many leaders and legends within public \nservice, I am continually humbled by the McClure family's boundless \ncharity and true dedication to supporting the common good.\n  Marcelle and I are proud to call Lois our dear friend, and we were \nblessed and honored to know Mac. We are forever proud of the McClures' \nundying commitment to Vermonters, and we are thrilled to congratulate \nthe foundation on 20 wonderful years of extraordinary and selfless \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3233-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing May as National Mental Health Awareness Month. Sadly, \nmental health is a subject that often does not receive the attention it \ndeserves in our society, despite the fact that mental illness touches \nthe lives of tens of millions of Americans each year. Nearly 50 percent \nof American adults will develop at least one mental illness in their \nlifetimes, and in a given year, one in four American adults, more than \n60 million people, experiences some form of mental illness. Of that \nnumber, approximately 5.8 percent suffer from a serious mental disorder \nlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression.\n  Mental illness can have a devastating impact on an individual's \noverall health and quality of life. Those suffering from serious mental \nillnesses are not only at increased risk for chronic medical \nconditions, but they also die, on average, 25 years earlier than other \nAmericans, due in large part to treatable medical conditions. Adults \nwith severe mental disorders are also much more likely to be \nimpoverished, further limiting their access to health care services \nneeded to help manage their illnesses. A 2012 study published in the \nJournal of Mental Health Policy and Economics found that the presence \nof a household member with a severe mental illness was shown to \nincrease the likelihood of poverty in a home by more than three times.\n  Mental illness also has a significant impact on our country's \neconomy. According to the CDC, the economic cost of mental illness in \nthe United States was a staggering $300 billion in 2002.\n  The good news is that high-quality, evidence-based treatment for \nmental illnesses can be very effective. However, fewer than half of \nthose in need receive any mental health care in the United States. This \nis simply unacceptable. Stigma, cost, and other barriers, such as \nlimited capacity in some areas to serve all those in need, prevent many \nindividuals from receiving necessary mental health care. It is \nimperative that we act to improve access to high-quality, evidence-\nbased mental health care services in our country.\n  Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend the ribbon-cutting \nceremony for the Mosaic Integrated Healthcare Center, a state-of-the-\nart facility in Baltimore that will provide essential mental health \nservices, substance abuse treatment, and primary care services to the \ncommunity. Mosaic Community Services is the largest community-based \nbehavioral health service provider in Maryland, serving thousands of \nchildren, adolescents, and adults annually. The new Integrated \nHealthcare Center will allow full implementation of Mosaic's integrated \ncare model, which addresses patients' physical and behavioral health \nneeds in a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-saving manner. A pilot \nprogram based on this model, supported by a 2010 grant from Maryland's \nCommunity Health Resources Commission, resulted in an impressive 78 \npercent reduction in emergency room visits and urgent inpatient care. \nMosaic's innovative system is a perfect example of the ways in which \nintegrated care can improve quality of care, result in better health \noutcomes, and help generate long-term cost savings.\n  I am also excited to be working on an initiative to improve access \nto, and quality of, mental health care in our country by facilitating \nthe integration of mental health care services into the primary care \nsetting through the collaborative care model, developed by the late Dr. \nWayne Katon, at the AIMS Center at the University of Washington.\n  In the collaborative care model, primary care providers treat \npatients with common mental health disorders, such as depression or \nanxiety, with help from a care manager and a psychiatrist who acts a \nconsultant, reviewing patients' progress, making treatment \nrecommendations and sharing his or her expertise with the primary care \nprovider and care manager. The collaborative care model not only \nimproves patient care experiences and outcomes, it has also been shown \nto reduce overall health care costs. One large trial, which focused on \ndepression care in primary care clinics in five States, found \nsubstantial reductions in overall health costs, with an overall rate of \nreturn on investment of $6 in health care costs saved for each $1 spent \non depression care.\n  Mental illness affects the lives of so many Americans. This May, in \nhonor of National Mental Health Awareness Month, let us commit to \nworking together to improve mental health care in our country by \nbuilding on the success of integrated care models like the \ncollaborative care model and the innovative system at Mosaic's \nIntegrated Health Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3233-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3233-S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY ARFT\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and salute Larry \nArft, the city manager for Beloit, WI, on the occasion of his \nretirement. It has been my pleasure to work closely with Larry since he \nstarted in this role in 2003. Throughout that time, he has been a \ntireless and effective leader of the community. He has been a model \npublic servant, and his talent and passion will be missed by all who \nhave worked with him.\n  A Missouri native, Larry served in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. \nFollowing his military service, he graduated magna cum laude from the \nUniversity of Missouri--St. Louis. It was there that his interest in \nlocal government was sparked by an internship with a St. Louis-area \nmunicipality. Since then, Larry has served with distinction in multiple \ncommunities in three States for more than 40 years.\n  As Beloit city manager, Larry Arft has been the driving force behind \nextensive economic development. During his tenure, Beloit has \nexperienced strong and sustained revitalization of its downtown, in the \nGateway Business Park, and along its riverfront. He has always been an \nenthusiastic partner with the business community, and Larry proved that \nBeloit was--and continues to be--a good place to do business. He also \nengaged other government leaders in the area, around the State, and in \nthe Federal Government. He set an example of how things should be done \nand how people could come together to address challenges.\n  I had the privilege of working closely with him in efforts to secure \nFederal funding for the construction and improvement of local roads and \nbridges, allowing for safer and more rapid transport and economic \ndevelopment. In addition, I had the pleasure of working with him as he \nled efforts to create good jobs and attract visitors to the area \nthrough the development of a Beloit casino.\n  Larry's work extended well beyond the city limits. He actively \nengaged other communities in the region and\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nserved as the president of the Wisconsin League of Municipalities, \nadvocating for issues important to cities and villages.\n  I am grateful for Larry Arft's contributions to the people of Beloit \nand to the people of Wisconsin, and I thank him for his service. I know \nhis presence and personal commitment will be missed. I wish him and his \nwife Karen all the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3234-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY\n\n Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I rise in appreciation of \nseersucker manufacturers and enthusiasts across the country. I extend a \nHappy Seersucker Day. This uniquely American fashion has a storied \nhistory dating back to 1909. Louisiana is proud to have played an \nimportant part in introducing the country to seersucker apparel. The \nfirst seersucker suit was designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street \nfacility in New Orleans, LA.\n  This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker has \nbeen enjoyed by Americans from all walks of life during our hot summer \nmonths. Mr. Haspel said it best, ``hot is hot, no matter what you do \nfor a living.'' In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by members \nof this chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I proudly \nresumed this tradition last year in the U.S. House of Representatives \nby designating Wednesday, June 11 as National Seersucker Day. I wish to \ncontinue this tradition in U.S. Senate by designating Thursday, June 11 \nas National Seersucker Day once again. I encourage everyone to wear \nseersucker on this day to commemorate this iconic American \nclothing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3234-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE OPENING OF THE UCI-FRED HUTCH CANCER CENTRE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate the \nFred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Uganda Cancer Institute \nfor officially opening the UCI-Fred Hutch Cancer Centre in Kampala, the \nfirst comprehensive cancer center jointly constructed by U.S. and \nAfrican cancer institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The 25,000-square-foot regional cancer center is a state-of-the-art-\nfacility that can treat up to 20,000 patients a year and includes an \nadult and pediatric outpatient clinic, a specimen repository, training \ncenter, conference rooms, and a pharmacy.\n  Uganda has a substantial cancer burden, and 6 out of 10 of the most \ncommon cancers there are caused by infectious diseases. To address this \nunique health need, Uganda has invested in cancer research, training, \nand clinical care. The UCI-Fred Hutch Cancer Centre will significantly \nincrease patient access to cancer diagnosis and treatment while \nfurthering study of cancers in Uganda, particularly those that are \ninfection related.\n  This alliance brings together two international leaders in the field \nof oncology care, training, and research and is ideally positioned to \nprovide American and Ugandan physician scientists with indepth training \nin the treatment of infection-related malignancies in both the United \nStates and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The relationship between Fred Hutch and the UCI dates back to 2004, \nand the UCI/Hutchinson Center Cancer Alliance was formally established \nin 2008. The program was formed to support the development of a strong \nbiomedical infrastructure in Uganda that would contribute to the \nprevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer and \nrelated health concerns.\n  In 2008, Uganda had just one oncologist who treated more than 10,000 \npatients a year. In response, Fred Hutch spearheaded an extensive \nmedical training program that has trained more than 300 Ugandans and \nAmericans to date in the treatment of infection-related cancers, \nincluding physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, data \nspecialists, and experts in regulatory affairs and fiscal management. \nToday, the number of practicing oncologists in Uganda has increased \ntwelvefold.\n  The UCI-Fred Hutch Cancer Centre is funded in part by two grants for \nwhich I was proud to advocate totaling $1.4 million from the U.S. \nAgency for International Development (through the American Schools and \nHospitals Abroad Program), as well as an $8.6 million investment from \nFred Hutch. The Ugandan Government has supported the collaboration \nthrough donations of land, provision of funding for personnel and \nequipment, and technical support.\n  I am proud to work with Fred Hutch in their effort to bring cutting-\nedge cancer care to patients and families all around the globe. This \njoint venture with UCI has the potential to drastically improve the \nlives of many people, both in Uganda and worldwide. I am proud that my \nState of Washington is home to Fred Hutch, and I applaud them and the \nUganda Cancer Institute for their cross-national effort to effect this \ncritical change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3234-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEONARD SCHOOL OF MUSIC 70TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and \nhonor the Leonard School of Music in North Charleston, SC, for their \n70th anniversary. In 1945, the Leonard School of Music was founded by \nMr. Patrick Leonard, who became a Charlestonian early in his life. He \nwas a tromobonist for the prestigious Armco Band and the Circus \nCorporation of America. After traveling to Charleston with the circus, \nhe fell in love with the city and ultimately started the Leonard School \nof Music. Mr. Patrick Leonard eventually retired from his leadership \nrole at the school and passed it on to his son, Dan Leonard.\n  Mr. Dan Leonard is a recognized expert in the field of music \neducation. His work has received State, national, and international \nacclaim. He has taught and directed bands of all levels: elementary, \njunior high, high school, and college. Many of Mr. Leonard's students \nare accomplished musicians and teachers. His specialized rhythm \napproach has inspired Leonard School instructors' teaching strategies.\n  The Leonard School of Music became a nonprofit organization in 2010. \nThe school's mission is to provide solid music education for all \nLowcountry youth regardless of race, creed, or financial standing. On \nMay 23, 2015, the Leonard School of Music will celebrate 70 years of \nmusic excellence. I applaud Patrick and Dan Leonard for their expertise \nin music education, and therefore recognize the Leonard School of \nMusic's accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3234-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3234-S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING SID McDONALD\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

He will be \nremembered as a skilled businessman who was committed to bettering his \ncommunity and State through public service.\n  Sid was born in Springfield, AL. He earned a degree from the School \nof Commerce and Business at the University of Alabama in 1961. However, \nhis time at the University of Alabama goes well beyond his days as a \nstudent. He was a member of the University of Alabama board of trustees \nfrom 1992 to 2008, and served as the pro tempore of the board from 1999 \nto 2002.\n  Sid began his career in public service when he was named to the \nAlabama Commission on Higher Education in 1970, the year that it was \ncreated. He had a passion for education and was instrumental in \nestablishing the Arab City School system where he became the first \nboard chairman. Sid served the people of Marshall County in the Alabama \nHouse of Representatives for two terms and also served in the Alabama \nSenate from 1975 to 1979. He later served as Alabama's finance director \nunder Governor Fob James from 1980 to 1982.\n  After graduating from the University of Alabama, Sid began his \nsuccessful business career. He became president of Brindlee Mountain \nTelephone Company, which he managed until it was sold in 2000. In 1983, \nhe founded DeltaCom, a statewide long-distance telephone company, \nserving as its chairman until it was sold in 1996. He was one of the \nfirst outside members of the board of directors of Intergraph \nCorporation from 1997 until 2006. Most recently, he led the start-up of \nCBX Holding, LLC (Cold Box), an Arab producer and marketer of \ntemperature\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\ncontrolled cargo containers. In addition to his many business \nadventures, he was very active in commercial and residential real \nestate development.\n  Sid's accomplishments and contributions to the State of Alabama have \nnot gone unnoticed. He was elected in 2001 to the Alabama Academy of \nHonor's One Hundred Living Alabamians and was elected to the Alabama \nBusiness Hall of Fame in 2010. The University of Alabama also dedicated \na facility on campus in his honor, Sid McDonald Hall.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Sid's wife Jane Plunkett McDonald, \nand to all of their loved ones as they celebrate his many life \naccomplishments and mourn this great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING DOWNS ENTERPRISE, LLC\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in order to pursue the American \ndream in today's regulatory climate, small businesses owners and \nentrepreneurs require a variety of administrative and support services. \nOften, they are able to offer a helping hand to each other, building \nimportant relationships and creating economic opportunity across the \nboard. Small Business of the Week, Downs Enterprise of Bastrop, LA, is \nproviding these crucial services to fellow small businesses, \nentrepreneurs, and veterans throughout northeast Louisiana.\n  Troy Downs, founder of Downs Enterprise, LLC, has been assisting \nsmall business owners in northeast Louisiana for nearly 14 years. In \n2001 Downs opened his namesake consulting business, focusing on \nmanaging, consulting, and developing local small businesses through \nfinancial, real estate, and logistical services. After nearly 10 years \nof success, Downs visited the Louisiana Small Business Development \nCenter, LSBDC, at the University of Louisiana-Monroe, located in \nMonroe, LA, with a financial management and business development and \nexpansion plan. Downs took advantage of all the LSBDC had to offer, \nattending every seminar and networking event available to him, even if \nnot directly related to his business. Downs believed that just his \nbeing there would put him in a position to learn, and it worked--a \nsentiment that he now passes along to the businesses he consults. \nThrough Downs Enterprise, LLC, Troy and his team have assisted in \nstarting and managing over 25 successful businesses, created 50 jobs, \nand counseled over 100 individuals in the process of starting and \nmaintaining a healthy business.\n  After years of successfully guiding individuals through the hoops of \nstarting and maintaining a business, Downs, a 25-year serviceman of the \nU.S. Army, saw the need for such a consulting service geared towards \nour Nation's brave servicemen and women. After experiencing the \ndifficulties servicemen and women have in adjusting back to a civilian \nlifestyle, the Downs Foundation was born. Today, the Downs Foundation \ncontinues their original goal of assisting veterans in small business \ndevelopment, while also providing services in credit restoration, \npreparation for jobs, and counseling services. Down's work in northeast \nLouisiana has earned him the distinguished honor of being recognized as \nthe 2015 Veteran Small Business Champion by Louisiana Economic \nDevelopment and the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  Congratulations again to Downs Enterprise for being selected as Small \nBusiness of the Week. Thank you for your continued commitment not only \nto your community, but also to your fellow brothers and sisters of the \nmilitary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3235-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 880.

A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \nManagement Council; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse, I am introducing the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act \nof 2015.\n  This legislation seeks to extend simple fairness to our State's \nfishermen by giving Rhode Island voting representation on the Mid-\nAtlantic Fishery-Management Council MAFMC. The council manages stocks, \nlike squid, which are critically important to the fishing industry in \nmy State. Rhode Island's commercial fishing industry depends more on \nMAFMC-managed stocks than those managed by the New England Fisheries \nManagement Council, where Rhode Island is a member. More than that, \nRhode Island has a larger stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery than many \nof the states that currently hold seats on the MAFMC.\n  This is not a new proposal, nor is it unprecedented. North Carolina \nwas added to the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable \nFisheries Act in 1996. In addition, the last reauthorization of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act required a \nreport on this issue. Now it is time to make this change.\n  I was pleased in the last Congress that this legislation was included \nin the Commerce Committee's discussion draft for the reauthorization of \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act, as well as in the reauthorization bill \nintroduced by then-Oceans Subcommittee Chairman Mark Begich at the end \nof last year. I hope that in this Congress we can take this commonsense \nstep to bring fairness to Rhode Island's fishermen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1418. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide an \nInspector General for the judicial branch, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Judicial \nTransparency and Ethics Enhancement Act, a bill that would establish \nwithin the judicial branch an Office of Inspector General to assist the \nJudiciary with its ethical obligations as well as to ensure taxpayer \ndollars are not lost to waste, fraud, or abuse. This bill will help \nensure that our Federal judicial system remains free of corruption, \nbias, and hypocrisy.\n  The facts demonstrate that the institution of the Inspector General \nhas been crucial in detecting, exposing and deterring problems within \nour government. The job of the Inspector General is to be the first \nline of defense against fraud, waste and abuse. In collaboration with \nwhistleblowers, Inspectors General have been extremely effective in \ntheir efforts to expose and help correct these wrongs.\n  That is why, during my many years in Congress, I have worked hard to \nstrengthen the oversight role of Inspectors General throughout the \nFederal government. I have come to rely on IGs and whistleblowers, to \nensure that our tax dollars are spent according to the letter and \nspirit of the law. When that doesn't happen, we in Congress need to \nknow about it and take corrective action.\n  During the past fiscal year, Congress appropriated nearly $7 billion \nin taxpayer money to the Federal judiciary. To put this in context, the \nSmall Business Administration and the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service each received a similar or less amount than the \njudiciary. Yet both of these entities have an Office of Inspector \nGeneral. If we in Congress believed that these entities could use an \nInspector General, I cannot see why the Judiciary wouldn't deserve the \nsame assistance.\n  But there is an additional reason why the Judiciary needs an \nInspector General. The fact remains that the current practice of self-\nregulation of judges with respect to ethics and the judicial code of \nconduct has time and time again proven inadequate. I would point out to \nmy colleagues two recent events here in the Senate that support this \nconclusion.\n  In the past 6 years, the Senate received articles of impeachment for \nnot one but two Federal judges. In the first case, former Judge Samuel \nB. Kent, although charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, pled \nguilty to obstruction of justice. Who did he obstruct? Who did he lie \nto? He did this to his fellow judges, who were assembled to investigate \nthe allegations of his obscene and criminal behavior. But it took a \ncriminal investigation by the Department of Justice to uncover his \nfalse statements to his colleagues as well as substantiate the \nhorrendous claims made against him.\n  In the second case, the Senate found former Judge G. Thomas Porteous, \nJr. guilty on multiple articles of impeachment, including accepting \nmoney from attorneys who had a case pending before him in his court and \ncommitting perjury by falsifying his name on bankruptcy filings. Once \nagain, this Judge's misbehavior came to light through a Federal \ncriminal investigation, after which another judicial committee had to \nbe organized to investigate their fellow judge.\n  What's more, in each case the disgraced judge tried to game the \nsystem in order to retain his $174,000 salary. Rather than resign their \ncommissions, each first tried to claim disability status that would \nallow each to continue to receive payment, even if in prison. Then both \nplayed chicken with Congress daring us to strip them of their pay by \nimpeaching and convicting them. I am pleased that we put our foot down \nand said ``No.''\n  This bill would establish an Office of Inspector General for the \njudicial branch. The IG's responsibilities would include conducting \ninvestigations of\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\npossible judicial misconduct, investigating waste fraud and abuse, and \nrecommending changes in laws and regulations governing the federal \njudiciary. The bill would require the IG to provide the Chief Justice \nand Congress with an annual report on its activities, as well as refer \nmatters that may constitute a criminal violation to the Department of \nJustice. In addition, the bill establishes whistleblower protections \nfor judicial branch employees.\n  Ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to our \nConstitutional checks and balances. Judges are supposed to maintain \nimpartiality. They are supposed to be free from conflicts of interest. \nAn independent watchdog for the federal judiciary will help its members \ncomply with the ethics rules and promote credibility within the \njudicial branch of government. Whistleblower protections for judiciary \nbranch employees will help keep the judiciary accountable. The Judicial \nTransparency and Ethics Enhancement Act will not only help ensure \ncontinued public confidence in our Federal courts and keep them beyond \nreproach, it will strengthen our judicial branch.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the ability of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the Coast Guard, and costal States to \nsustain healthy ocean and coastal ecosystems by maintaining and \nsustaining their capabilities relating to oil spill preparedness, \nprevention, response, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today the U.S. Coast Guard and the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are responding to yet \nanother oilspill in the water. In a moment, I will bring out a \nphotograph which shows the fresh crude oil on the beach of Refugio \nState Park in California. This oilspill brings back the images from 5 \nyears ago of the oil-coated pelicans and tar-stained beaches, which \nwere once sugar white, covered with gooey mats of oil from the \nDeepwater Horizon oilspill. Although the spill happened in 2010, a lot \nof that oil is still sloshing around out there in the gulf.\n  Last week, the Department of the Interior told us that the oil \nleaking in the gulf since 2004 from Taylor Energy wells could continue \nfor a century or more ``if left unchecked.''\n  This is the oilspill that just happened in the last few days. It is \nfresh crude, and it is on the beach in California. Of course, when I \nsee this kind of picture, it brings me back to that experience all of \nus on the gulf coast had 5 years ago, and we wouldn't wish that upon \nanybody. Remember, to begin with, they said, Oh, it is just a few \nhundred barrels of oil, even though it was ruptured 1 mile beneath the \nsurface of the water.\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nThen we got the streaming video. We actually put that video on my Web \nsite. The chairman of the environment committee, Senator Boxer, put it \nup on her committee Web site. Once scientists could see how much was \nflowing, they could calculate, and then they saw that it wasn't going \nto be a few hundred or even a thousand barrels of oil a day; it was \napproaching something like 50 times that.\n\n  We know what, in fact, happened. Almost 5 million barrels of oil was \nspilled. The court in Louisiana--the Federal court that is hearing this \ncase against BP--indeed has concluded that those who are going to be \nheld responsible under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 will be \nresponsible for somewhere around 4 million barrels. That is court-\ndecided.\n  A lot of that oil is still out there. Yet, appallingly, today the \neconomy and the environment of the State of Florida are again under \nattack. I have just been informed that Senators from Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Texas are seeking to invite oil rigs within 50 miles \nof Florida's coastline.\n  Now, of course, that goes against all logic. It is certainly not what \nthe people of Florida want and it is not what the Department of the \nInterior has said is appropriate or necessary under the next 5-year \nleasing plan.\n  Florida is a unique State. This is a photo of a dead dolphin covered \nwith oil that is just another casualty of what we are seeing that is \nhappening this week.\n  The reason I am here today with these Senators who are threatening \nFlorida is because in 2006, in a bipartisan way, the other Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Martinez, a Republican, and I, a Democrat, joined together \nto put in law that the Outer Continental Shelf off Florida is off-\nlimits to oil drilling. We were successful in doing that, even though \nno other Outer Continental Shelf off the United States is off-limits. \nIn the administration's 5-year plans, they have complied with that \nbecause the off-limits to oil drilling is until the year 2022. \nTherefore, in the next 5-year plan, from 2017 to 2022, the \nadministration honored that. It is, after all, the law.\n  But why is Florida different than others? Well, in the first place, \nthere is no oil off of Florida. People think of where the oil is. It is \noff of Louisiana. The sediment came down the Mississippi River for \nmillions of years and was compacted by the Earth's crust, and that \nformed these oil deposits. There is a lot of oil in the central Gulf of \nMexico and, indeed, that is what is happening. A lot of oil is being \nproduced there. That is the first reason. There is not oil off of \nFlorida.\n  But there are other reasons, not the least of which is of all the \nGulf Coast States, Florida has the most beaches and, therefore, the \neconomy is directly charged with the fact of having those pristine, \nsugary white beaches as such an attraction for our guests to come to \nFlorida and enjoy nature's seaside.\n  Well, we found out, as a result of the gulf oilspill, that even \nthough just a little oil reached Florida--Pensacola Beach was \nblackened, tar mats came into Pensacola Bay, Destin got oil on the \nbeach, and some tar balls got as far east as Panama City Beach. So \npeople saw those pictures of oil covering the beach and they thought \nthat was the entire State of Florida and they didn't come. For a whole \nseason, the guests, the visitors, the tourists did not come. So the \nmotels were not filled and the restaurants were not filled and the \ndrycleaners, and all the ancillary businesses associated with a tourism \neconomy on the coast, they did not come.\n  Now, there is also, obviously, the environmental interests because we \ndo have a lot of the bays and estuaries and marsh grasses where \ncritters spawn so much of the marine life in the Gulf of Mexico, and it \nstarts in these bays and estuaries. That is obviously a reason as well. \nBut there is a special reason why we have kept oil off our shores. \nBottlenose dolphins in the gulf have been dying at unprecedented rates \nover the last 5 years. This is one of those sick dolphins. So from the \nBP spill, science is showing, in fact, what we intuitively knew. And \njust yesterday, a team of scientists confirmed the Deepwater Horizon \noilspill contributed to the highest number of dead bottlenose dolphin \nstrandings on record in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n  So it certainly makes little sense that we would seek more drilling \nin even riskier areas when we are still picking up the pieces from the \nlast major oilspill.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that implements many of the hard \nlessons learned in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon BP oilspill. This \nlegislation is going to make sure that NOAA and the Coast Guard have \nthe tools to prevent, to prepare for, and to respond to marine \noilspills.\n  The bill is going to give gulf coast communities a seat at the table \nin the decisions about oil drilling that affects their way of life. It \nwill strengthen State-level planning for oilspills or seismic \nexploration. But, most importantly, the bill will protect Florida from \nBig Oil's reach by keeping the eastern Gulf of Mexico off-limits beyond \n2022 and in statute until 2027.\n  Back in 2006, we passed the bipartisan Gulf of Mexico Energy Security \nAct. In that act, that is what we did in establishing this off-limits \nin law. But now, some of our neighboring States, at the behest of Big \nOil, are trying to drill again and to drill off of Florida.\n  We are going to do everything we can to make sure we don't lose \nanother tourism season. We are going to do everything we can to make \nsure we don't lose an entire year for our recreational fishermen, \ncharter boat fishermen, as well as the commercial fishermen. Drilling \noff the coast is not what the people of Florida want. We want fishing \nvessels hauling in prize catches, not Coast Guard vessels skimming oil. \nWe want dolphins rolling in the waves, not washing ashore, and we want \nsunbathers on the beaches, not HAZMAT workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 1436.

A bill to amend the Federal Credit Union Act to exclude a \nloan secured by a non-owner occupied 1- to 4-family dwelling from the \ndefinition of a member business loan, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, most of us have heard the metaphor that \nsmall businesses are the engines that power our economy. What we don't \nhear people talk about as much is the fuel that feeds the engines: \ncapital. Without capital, entrepreneurs cannot see their ideas to \nfruition, successful business owners cannot expand to meet the needs of \nthe market, and eager job seekers must take their skills elsewhere. \nWithout capital, Main Street falters.\n  Today, more than 7 years after the start of the Great Recession and \nmany policy reforms later, access to capital remains a challenge that \nstands in the way of small business growth, economic development and \njob creation in Oregon and across the country. Despite this, government \nregulation continues to tie the hands of many potential lenders; \nnamely, credit unions. According to some estimates, credit unions could \nlend an additional $16 billion to small businesses, helping them create \nnearly 150,000 new jobs in just 1 year if Congress loosened restraints \non credit union business lending.\n  With this in mind, I am pleased to introduce today the Credit Union \nResidential Loan Parity Act, which would increase access to capital by \nexempting certain loans from the member business lending cap imposed on \ncredit unions. Currently, loans made for one- to four-person, non-owner \noccupied housing are treated as business loans when they are made by \ncredit unions. As such, these types of loans count against a credit \nunion's business lending cap, and thereby limit a credit union's \nability to provide loans to small businesses. My legislation would \naddress this issue by allowing credit unions to treat these types of \nloans as residential loans--as they are when they are made by other \nfinancial institutions--therefore exempting these loans from the \nbusiness lending cap. In doing so, this legislation would increase the \navailability of business capital, providing greater opportunities for \nsmall businesses to receive credit union loans to help them continue to \ngrow and expand, create jobs and support our local economies.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation will be received by colleagues for \nwhat it is: a simple step to help ensure America's small businesses \nhave access to the fuel they need to power our economy. It is my hope \nthat the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Frank Moore Wild Steelhead Sanctuary \nin the State of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to honor my \nfriend Frank Moore, an Oregonian, World War II veteran, husband to \nJeanne, father, avid fly fisherman, and tireless conservationist.\n  Frank Moore can be found standing in the North Umpqua River in \nOregon, wearing waders and casting his fly fishing reel, for hours. He \nis a legendary presence on the River, even at 91 years young. A pastime \nhe picked up from his father, fly fishing has been a business and a \nhobby for Frank for nearly his entire life. Not only has he enjoyed the \nfishing and scenery on Oregon's rivers for decades, Frank's love of \nOregon and his tireless work to conserve our state's fish habitats and \nrivers adds up to a rich legacy that sets the standard for generations \nto come. Frank served on the State of Oregon Fish and Wildlife \nCommission and has received the National Wildlife Federation \nConservationist of the Year award and the Wild\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nSteelhead Coalition Conservation Award.\n  Frank's commitment to the health and vitality of Oregon's rivers and \nfish habitat over the years is inspiring and he deserves countless \nthanks for his work and dedication. The Frank Moore Wild Steelhead \nSanctuary will serve as a tribute to the many outstanding \naccomplishments of Frank, both on and off the river.\n  It is my honor to introduce this bill today with my colleague from \nOregon Senator Merkley on behalf of this extraordinary Oregonian.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 183\n\n       Whereas the United States Government strongly supports the \n     peaceful resolution of territorial, sovereignty, and \n     jurisdictional disputes in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas the South China Sea includes critical sea lines of \n     communication and commerce between the Pacific and Indian \n     oceans;\n       Whereas the United States Government has a national \n     interest in freedom of navigation and overflight in the South \n     China Sea, as provided for by customary principles of \n     international law;\n       Whereas the United States Government is also committed to \n     upholding internationally lawful uses of the high seas and \n     the Exclusive Economic Zones as well as to the related rights \n     and freedoms in other maritime zones, including the rights of \n     innocent passage, transit passage, and archipelagic sea lanes \n     passage consistent with customary international law;\n       Whereas the United States has an interest in encouraging \n     and supporting the nations of the region to work \n     collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes \n     without coercion, intimidation, threats, or the use of force;\n       Whereas the United States further supports the efforts of \n     states to resolve their disputes in accordance with \n     international\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n     law, including through internationally recognized legal \n     dispute settlement mechanisms, and urges the full \n     implementation of any decisions rendered by the relevant \n     courts and tribunals which are binding on them;\n       Whereas the South China Sea potentially contains great \n     natural resources, and their stewardship and responsible use \n     offers immense potential benefit for generations to come;\n       Whereas Brunei, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the \n     Philippines have overlapping territorial, sovereignty, and \n     jurisdictional claim to all or some of the Spratly Islands;\n       Whereas, on January 23, 2013, the Philippines launched an \n     arbitration process under an existing international mechanism \n     challenging China's claim of a `nine dash line' around the \n     South China Sea;\n       Whereas, although the United States does not take a \n     position on competing territorial claims over land features \n     and maritime boundaries of the Spratly Islands, it does have \n     a strong and long-standing interest in the manner in which \n     disputes in the South China Sea are addressed and in the \n     conduct of the parties;\n       Whereas, even while the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China has refused to participate in formal arbitration \n     with the Government of the Philippines, it should comply with \n     any international ruling on competing territorial claims with \n     the Philippines in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas, in recent years, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China has engaged in unilateral land reclamation \n     and construction activities in the Spratly Islands that \n     undermines regional stability and is counter to multilateral \n     efforts for peaceful resolution of territorial, sovereignty, \n     and jurisdictional disputes in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas, although other claimants to the Spratly Islands \n     have built small outposts and have engaged in minor \n     maintenance on features they already occupy, in less than one \n     year the Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     rapidly exceeded all preceding activities and acted on a much \n     larger scale;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 2002, the governments of the member \n     states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     and the Government of the People's Republic of China signed a \n     Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea \n     that, among other things, declared, ``The Parties undertake \n     to exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that \n     would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and \n     stability including, among others, refraining from action of \n     inhabiting on the presently uninhabited islands, reefs, \n     shoals, cays, and other features and to handle their \n     differences in a constructive manner.'';\n       Whereas China's land reclamation is estimated to cost the \n     region's littoral states $100,000,000 a year due to damage to \n     the ecosystem and the degradation of fish stocks;\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2015, satellite imagery showed the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China building a \n     concrete runway on the Fiery Cross Reef that is expected to \n     be 10,000 feet long and give the Chinese military the \n     capability to land fighter jets and surveillance jets, which \n     is destabilizing to regional peace and stability;\n       Whereas satellite imagery also showed the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China unilaterally constructing island \n     territory on Subi Reef that, if connected, would support an \n     additional airstrip;\n       Whereas satellite imagery also showed that Woody Island and \n     Duncan Island have grown significantly due to Chinese land \n     reclamation activities;\n       Whereas, a March 16, 2015, image published by the Center \n     for Strategic and International Studies showed that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China constructed a \n     chain of artificial land formations, new structures, \n     fortified sea walls, and construction equipment along \n     Mischief Reef, an area claimed by the Philippines and within \n     its Exclusive Economic Zone;\n       Whereas, in April 2015, the United States Office of Naval \n     Intelligence published a report on the Chinese People's \n     Liberation Army Navy showing that the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China has reclaimed hundreds of acres of \n     land at the seven features it occupies in the Spratly Islands \n     throughout 2014 and stated that China ``appears to be \n     building much larger facilities that could support naval \n     operations.'';\n       Whereas, on April 6, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter \n     noted deep concerns regarding some of the activities of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China, including ``its \n     behavior in places like the East and South China Seas.'';\n       Whereas, on April 9, 2015, President Barack Obama stated, \n     ``Where [the United States gets] concerned with China is \n     where it is not necessarily abiding by international norms \n     and rules, and is using its size and muscle to force \n     countries into subordinate positions. And that's the concern \n     we have around maritime issues.'';\n       Whereas, on April 16, 2015, the Commander of United States \n     Pacific Command, Admiral Locklear, stated that Chinese land \n     reclamation activities in the South China Sea ``would give \n     them de facto control in peacetime of much of the world's \n     most important waterways''; that China could place ``long-\n     range detection radars'' on the outposts in order to place \n     more warships there; and that Southeast Asian nations are \n     increasingly worried that China's new capabilities will allow \n     it take de facto control of the surrounding waters;\n       Whereas adding a military dimension to the territorial \n     dispute exacerbates the risks of misperceptions, accidents, \n     and other dangerous incidents in the Spratly Islands;\n       Whereas, on April 9, 2015, Chinese Foreign Ministry \n     spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, was quoted as saying, ``After the \n     construction, the islands and reefs will be able to provide \n     all-round and comprehensive services to meet various civilian \n     demands besides satisfying the need of necessary military \n     defense.'';\n       Whereas ASEAN has promoted multilateral talks on disputed \n     areas without settling the issue of sovereignty, and \n     committed with China in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct \n     of Parties in the South China Sea to ``reaffirm their respect \n     for and commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over \n     flight above the South China Sea as provided for by the \n     universally recognized principles of international law'' and \n     to ``resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by \n     peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of \n     force'';\n       Whereas the reclamation activities of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China threaten ASEAN unity and its \n     multilateral efforts to promote peaceful reconciliation of \n     territorial, sovereignty, and jurisdictional disputes in the \n     Spratly Islands and the broader South China Sea; and\n       Whereas, on January 28, 2015, Philippine Foreign Secretary \n     Alberto del Rosario urged ASEAN ``to consider reaching out to \n     the international community to say to China that what it is \n     doing is wrong--that it must stop its reclamation activities \n     at once'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China's unilateral construction of artificial land formations \n     in the disputed Spratly Islands;\n       (2) strongly urges all parties to maritime and territorial \n     disputes in the region to respect the status quo, exercise \n     self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would \n     undermine stability or complicate or escalate disputes, \n     refrain from inhabiting or garrisoning presently uninhabited \n     islands, reefs, shoals, and other features, and refrain from \n     unilateral actions that cause permanent physical change to \n     the marine environment in areas pending final delimitation;\n       (3) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to clarify the meaning of its ``nine dash line'' claim and \n     the maritime areas it claims within that space;\n       (4) further urges the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China to clarify its intentions with respect to \n     establishing ``necessary military defense'' on reclaimed \n     features and condemns the militarization of disputed \n     features;\n       (5) supports efforts by parties to maritime and territorial \n     disputes to handle their differences in a constructive manner \n     and pursue their claims through peaceful, diplomatic, and \n     legitimate regional and international arbitration mechanisms;\n       (6) reaffirms the strong support of the United States for \n     the member states of ASEAN as they seek to develop a code of \n     conduct of parties in the South China Sea with the People's \n     Republic of China, and urges China to enter into such \n     negotiations in a serious manner;\n       (7) supports efforts to strengthen regional maritime domain \n     awareness;\n       (8) supports efforts to strengthen maritime partner \n     capacity, including through the sale and transfer of \n     technology that promotes maritime domain awareness; and\n       (9) supports the continuation of operations by the United \n     States Armed Forces in support of freedom of navigation \n     rights in international waters and air space in the South \n     China Sea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3245-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3245-S3246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 184--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \nCONVERSION THERAPY, INCLUDING EFFORTS BY MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS TO \nCHANGE THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY, OR GENDER EXPRESSION OF \n AN INDIVIDUAL, IS DANGEROUS AND HARMFUL AND SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM \n                       BEING PRACTICED ON MINORS\n\n  Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Markey, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nHeinrich, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Udall, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Peters, Mr. Casey, Mr. Schatz, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \nDurbin) submitted the following resolution;

Res. 185\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States join together each \n     May to pay tribute to the contributions of generations of \n     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched the \n     history of the United States;\n       Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders in the United States is inextricably tied to the \n     story of the United States;\n       Whereas the Asian American and Pacific Islander community \n     is an inherently diverse population, comprised of more than \n     45 distinct ethnicities and more than 100 language dialects;\n       Whereas, according to the Bureau of the Census, the Asian \n     American population grew at a faster rate than any other \n     racial or ethnic group in the United States during the last \n     decade, surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, a \n     growth rate that is 4 times the rate of the total population \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the 2010 decennial census, there are \n     approximately 17,300,000 residents of the United States who \n     identify themselves as Asian and approximately 1,200,000 \n     residents of the United States who identify themselves as \n     Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, making up \n     approximately 5.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, of \n     the total population of the United States;\n       Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific \n     American Heritage Month because the first immigrants from \n     Japan arrived in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the \n     first transcontinental railroad was completed on May 10, \n     1869, with substantial contributions from immigrants from \n     China;\n       Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, \n     officially designates May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage \n     Month and requests that the President issue an annual \n     proclamation calling on the people of the United States to \n     observe Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities;\n       Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, such as \n     Daniel K.

Bush, designating \n     May to be Asian Pacific American Heritage Month;\n\n       Whereas the actions of the Hmong in Laos in support of the \n     United States during the Vietnam War saved the lives of \n     countless people of the United States;\n       Whereas as a result of Hmong support of the United States, \n     the Hmong were forced to leave Laos when the new communist \n     regime seized control of Laos;\n       Whereas May 14, 2015, marks the 40th anniversary of the \n     forced exit from Laos of Hmong people, many of whom later \n     resettled in the United States, following the withdrawal of \n     United States troops from Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in 2015, the Congressional Asian Pacific American \n     Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members of Congress advocating \n     on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, is \n     composed of 48 Members, including 13 Members of Asian or \n     Pacific Islander descent;\n       Whereas in 2015, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are \n     serving in State and territorial legislatures across the \n     United States in record numbers, including the States of \n     Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, \n     Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New \n     Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, \n     Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, \n     West Virginia, and the territories of American Samoa, Guam, \n     and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands;\n       Whereas the number of Federal judges who are Asian \n     Americans or Pacific Islanders doubled between 2001 and 2008 \n     and more than tripled between 2009 and 2015, reflecting a \n     commitment to diversity in the Federal judiciary that has \n     resulted in the confirmations of high-caliber Asian American \n     and Pacific Islander judicial nominees;\n       Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders have access to resources and \n     a voice in the Government of the United States and continue \n     to advance in the political landscape of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month \n     provides the people of the United States with an opportunity \n     to recognize the achievements, contributions, and history of \n     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and to appreciate the \n     challenges faced by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of May 2015 as Asian/\n     Pacific American Heritage Month and as an important time to \n     celebrate the significant contributions of Asian Americans \n     and Pacific Islanders to the history of the United States; \n     and\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\n       (2) recognizes that the Asian American and Pacific Islander \n     community enhances the rich diversity of and strengthens the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3247-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 186--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 17 THROUGH MAY 23, \n                2015, AS ``NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 187\n\n       Whereas 500,000 families in the United States live with \n     bladder cancer;\n       Whereas more than 74,000 people are expected to be \n     diagnosed with bladder cancer and 16,000 will die due to the \n     disease in 2015 alone;\n       Whereas bladder cancer affects people of all ages and \n     backgrounds and is among the top 10 cancers with the highest \n     incidence rates in the United States;\n       Whereas bladder cancer is known as one of the most \n     expensive cancers to treat on a per patient basis with a \n     recurrence rate of approximately 50 to 80 percent, requiring \n     lifelong surveillance;\n       Whereas bladder cancer symptoms, such as blood in the \n     urine, are easily recognized, however, many are unaware of \n     the threat of bladder cancer, often prolonging the time to \n     diagnosis;\n       Whereas if diagnosed early, bladder cancer is treatable;\n       Whereas military veterans are twice as likely as \n     nonveterans to be diagnosed with bladder cancer;\n       Whereas women are often diagnosed at a later stage in the \n     development of bladder cancer, and when diagnosed at the same \n     stage as men, women have a worse prognosis;\n       Whereas if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the life \n     expectancy of an individual with bladder cancer decreases;\n       Whereas the quality of life of a person with bladder cancer \n     will depend on future treatment and diagnosis developments, \n     which will rely on research advancements;\n       Whereas there have been no new treatments approved by the \n     Food and Drug Administration for bladder cancer in over 10 \n     years;\n       Whereas research advancements for bladder cancer are \n     limited by lack of awareness about the disease within the \n     medical community and general public;\n       Whereas increased awareness will promote early diagnosis \n     and increase the chances of survival;\n       Whereas increased awareness will bolster public support of \n     the disease and thus increase funding for innovative research \n     and the development of new treatment options and diagnostic \n     tools;\n       Whereas traditionally on the first Saturday in May each \n     year, survivors, caregivers, and loved ones walk together \n     throughout the United States to raise awareness of bladder \n     cancer;\n       Whereas the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network and its \n     community of patients, caregivers, and specialists seek--\n       (1) to foster a community of hope and support;\n       (2) to fund and conduct research for innovative treatments \n     and diagnostic tools; and\n       (3) to increase public awareness and understanding of \n     bladder cancer; and\n\n       Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as \n     ``National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of May 2015, as ``National \n     Bladder Cancer Awareness Month'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Bladder \n     Cancer Awareness Month; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of bladder cancer and to foster \n     understanding of the impact of the disease on patients and \n     their families and caregivers;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end bladder \n     cancer; and\n       (C) to observe National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3247-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1436.

Res. 109\n\n       Whereas in the mid-19th century, the Guano Islands Act (48 \n     U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) enabled companies from the United States \n     to mine guano from a number of islands in the Equatorial \n     Pacific;\n       Whereas after several decades, when the guano was depleted, \n     the companies abandoned mining activities, and the control of \n     the islands by the United States diminished and left the \n     islands vulnerable to exploitation by other nations;\n       Whereas the Far East during the late 19th century and early \n     20th century was characterized by colonial conflicts and \n     Japanese expansionism;\n       Whereas the 1930s marked the apex of the sphere of \n     influence of Imperial Japan in the Far East;\n       Whereas military and commercial interest in Central Pacific \n     air routes between Australia and California led to a desire \n     by the United States to claim the islands of Howland, Baker, \n     and Jarvis, although the ownership of the islands was \n     unclear;\n       Whereas in 1935, a secret Department of Commerce \n     colonization plan was instituted, aimed at placing citizens \n     of the United States as colonists on the remote islands of \n     Howland, Baker, and Jarvis;\n       Whereas to avoid conflicts with international law, which \n     prevented colonization by active military personnel, the \n     United States sought the participation of furloughed military \n     personnel and Native Hawaiian civilians in the colonization \n     project;\n       Whereas William T. Miller, Superintendent of Airways at the \n     Department of Commerce, was appointed to lead the \n     colonization project, traveled to Hawaii in February 1935, \n     met with Albert F. Judd, Trustee of Kamehameha Schools and \n     the Bishop Museum, and agreed that recent graduates and \n     students of the Kamehameha School for Boys would make ideal \n     colonists for the project;\n       Whereas the ideal Hawaiian candidates were candidates who \n     could ``fish in the native manner, swim excellently, handle a \n     boat, be disciplined, friendly, and unattached'';\n       Whereas on March 20, 1935, the United States Coast Guard \n     Cutter Itasca departed from Honolulu Harbor in great secrecy \n     with 6 young Hawaiian men aboard, all recent graduates of \n     Kamehameha Schools, and 12 furloughed Army personnel, whose \n     purpose was to occupy the barren islands of Howland, Baker, \n     and Jarvis in teams of 5 for 3 months;\n       Whereas in June 1935, after a successful first tour, the \n     furloughed Army personnel were ordered off the islands and \n     replaced with additional Kamehameha Schools alumni, thus \n     leaving the islands under the exclusive occupation of the 4 \n     Native Hawaiians on each island;\n       Whereas the duties of the colonists while on the island \n     were to record weather conditions, cultivate plants, maintain \n     a daily log, record the types of fish that were caught, \n     observe bird life, and collect specimens for the Bishop \n     Museum;\n       Whereas the successful year-long occupation by the \n     colonists directly enabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt to \n     issue Executive Order 7368 on May 13, 1936, which established \n     that the islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis were under the \n     jurisdiction of the United States;\n       Whereas multiple Federal agencies vied for the right to \n     administer the colonization project, including the Department \n     of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and the Navy \n     Department, but jurisdiction was ultimately granted to the \n     Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas under the Department of the Interior, the \n     colonization project emphasized weather data and radio \n     communication, which brought about the recruitment of a \n     number of Asian radiomen and aerologists;\n       Whereas under the Department of the Interior, the \n     colonization project also expanded beyond the Kamehameha \n     Schools to include Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians from other \n     schools in Hawaii;\n       Whereas in March of 1938 the United States also claimed and \n     colonized the islands of Canton and Enderbury, maintaining \n     that the colonization was in furtherance of commercial \n     aviation and not for military purposes;\n       Whereas the risk of living on the remote islands meant that \n     emergency medical care was not less than 5 days away, and the \n     distance proved fatal for Carl Kahalewai, who died on October \n     8, 1938, en route to Honolulu after his appendix ruptured on \n     Jarvis island;\n       Whereas other life-threatening injuries occurred, including \n     in 1939, when Manuel Pires had appendicitis, and in 1941, \n     when an explosion severely burned Henry Knell and Dominic \n     Zagara;\n       Whereas in 1940, when the issue of discontinuing the \n     colonization project was raised, the Navy acknowledged that \n     the islands were ``probably worthless to commercial \n     aviation'' but advocated for ``continued occupation'' because \n     the islands could serve as ``bases from a military \n     standpoint'';\n       Whereas although military interests justified continued \n     occupation of the islands, the colonists were never informed \n     of the true nature of the project, nor were the colonists \n     provided with weapons or any other means of self-defense;\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\n       Whereas in June of 1941, when much of Europe was engaged in \n     World War II and Imperial Japan was establishing itself in \n     the Pacific, the Commandant of the 14th Naval District \n     recognized the ``tension in the Western Pacific'' and \n     recommended the evacuation of the colonists, but his request \n     was denied;\n       Whereas on December 8, 1941, Howland Island was attacked by \n     a fleet of Japanese twin-engine bombers, and the attack \n     killed Hawaiian colonists Joseph Keliihananui and Richard \n     Whaley;\n       Whereas in the ensuing weeks, Japanese submarine and \n     military aircraft continued to target the islands of Howland, \n     Baker, and Jarvis, jeopardizing the lives of the remaining \n     colonists;\n       Whereas the United States Government was unaware of the \n     attacks on the islands, and was otherwise focused on the \n     entry of the United States into World War II;\n       Whereas the colonists demonstrated great valor while \n     awaiting retrieval;\n       Whereas the 4 colonists from Baker and the 2 remaining \n     colonists from Howland were rescued on January 31, 1942, and \n     the 8 colonists from Enderbury and Jarvis were rescued on \n     February 7 to 9, 1942, 2 months after the initial attacks on \n     Howland Island;\n       Whereas on March 20, 1942, Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of \n     the Interior, sent letters of condolence to the Keliihananui \n     and Whaley families stating that ``[i]n your bereavement it \n     must be considerable satisfaction to know that your brother \n     died in the service of his country'';\n       Whereas during the 7 years of colonization, more than 130 \n     young men participated in the project, the majority of whom \n     were Hawaiian, and all of whom made numerous sacrifices, \n     endured hardships, and risked their lives to secure and \n     maintain the islands of Howland, Baker, Jarvis, Canton, and \n     Enderbury on behalf of the United States, and 3 young \n     Hawaiian men made the ultimate sacrifice;\n       Whereas none of the islands, except for Canton, were ever \n     used for commercial aviation, but the islands were used for \n     military purposes;\n       Whereas in July 1943, a military base was established on \n     Baker Island, and its forces, which numbered over 2,000 \n     members, participated in the Tarawa-Makin operation;\n       Whereas in 1956, participants of the colonization project \n     established an organization called ``Hui Panala'au'', which \n     was established to preserve the fellowship of the group, to \n     provide scholarship assistance, and ``to honor and esteem \n     those who died as colonists of the Equatorial Islands'';\n       Whereas in 1979, Canton and Enderbury became part of the \n     Republic of Kiribati, but the islands of Jarvis, Howland, and \n     Baker remain possessions of the United States, having been \n     designated as National Wildlife Refuges in 1974;\n       Whereas the islands of Jarvis, Howland, and Baker are now \n     part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument;\n       Whereas May 13, 2015, marks the 79th anniversary of the \n     issuance of the Executive order of President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt proclaiming United States jurisdiction over the \n     islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis, islands that remain \n     possessions of the United States; and\n       Whereas the Federal Government has never fully recognized \n     the contributions and sacrifices of the colonists, less than \n     a handful of whom are still alive today: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the accomplishments and commends the \n     service of the Hui Panala'au colonists;\n       (2) acknowledges the local, national, and international \n     significance of the 7-year colonization project, which \n     resulted in the United States extending sovereignty into the \n     Equatorial Pacific;\n       (3) recognizes the dedication to the United States and \n     self-reliance demonstrated by the young men, the majority of \n     whom were Native Hawaiian, who left their homes and families \n     in Hawaii to participate in the Equatorial Pacific \n     colonization project;\n       (4) extends condolences on behalf of the United States to \n     the families of Carl Kahalewai, Joseph Keliihananui, and \n     Richard Whaley for the loss of their loved ones in the \n     service of the United States;\n       (5) honors the young men whose actions, sacrifices, and \n     valor helped secure and maintain the jurisdiction of the \n     United States over equatorial islands in the Pacific Ocean \n     during the years leading up to and the months immediately \n     following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entry of the \n     United States into World War II; and\n       (6) extends to all of the colonists, and to the families of \n     these exceptional young men, the deep appreciation of the \n     people of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/senate-section/article/S3251-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY\n\n  Mr. PERDUE.
