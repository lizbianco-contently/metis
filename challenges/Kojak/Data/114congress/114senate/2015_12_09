Mr. President, some questioned whether Washington \ncould ever agree on a replacement for No Child Left Behind. They \nneedn't question any longer. Just consider today's headline from the \nAssociated Press: ``Outdated education law up for major makeover in the \nSenate.''\n  This morning we expect that a new Senate that is back to work will \nsend the Every Student Succeeds Act to the President for his signature. \nThis forward-looking replacement for a broken law would open new \nopportunities for our kids and put education back in the hands of those \nwho understand their needs best: parents, teachers, States, and school \nboards.\n  This bipartisan legislation would strengthen charter schools. This \nbipartisan legislation would prevent distant bureaucrats from imposing \ncommon core. This bipartisan legislation would substitute one-size-\nfits-all Federal mandates for greater State and local flexibility. In \nshort, it is conservative reform designed to help students succeed, \ninstead of helping Washington grow. It is a significant achievement for \nour country.\n  I thank everyone who helped make this moment possible. At the top of \nthe list are two Senators. There is Senator Alexander, a former \nEducation Secretary from Tennessee, a Republican; and there is Senator \nMurray, a former preschool teacher from Washington State, a Democrat. \nThey worked very hard. They worked across the aisle, and they worked in \ngood faith.\n  Their success in this effort is our country's gain. It is a win for \nparents, and it is a win for dedicated teachers. Most importantly, it \nis a win for children because these young Americans deserve the \nenhanced opportunities the bill would provide.\n  There is something else we know about Senator Alexander and Senator \nMurray about their accomplishment. It is a testament to what a new and \nmore open approach can bring to the legislative process. It gives \nSenators of both parties more of a say. It gives Senators of both \nparties more of a stake. So Senators are more likely to be interested \nin working together and seeing good ideas through to completion. That \nis just what we have seen here.\n  Senator Murray said: ``I am very proud of the bipartisan work we have \ndone on the Senate floor--debating amendments, taking votes, and making \nthis good bill even better.''\n  Senator Alexander said: ``The bill is just one more example that \nCongress is back to work.''\n  I couldn't agree more. Finding a serious replacement for No Child \nLeft Behind eluded Washington for years. Today it will become another \nbipartisan achievement for our country.\n  I urge every colleague to join me in voting to send this forward-\nlooking, conservative reform to the President's desk. Let's help every \nstudent by passing a bill NPR calls a ``sea change in the federal \napproach'' and the Wall Street Journal hails as ``the largest \ndevolution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8507-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8507-S8508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BIPARTISAN ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the new Congress and the new Senate \nthis year have had a habit this year of turning third rails into \nbipartisan achievements. You might say we did so on highways and \ntransportation last week. You might say we are doing so on schools and \neducation this week.\n  We have also overcome significant obstacles to pass important \nlegislation that would protect America's privacy online through the \nsharing of cyber threat information that would help fight against \nunfair trade barriers, that would help our military modernize and \nprepare for future threats, and that would bring hope to victims of \ndeplorable crimes who suffer in the shadows.\n  But when it comes to the truest of third rails in American politics, \nsome boil that down to just two phrases:\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nMedicare and Social Security. We all know that positive action will be \nneeded if we care about saving these programs for future generations. \nRepublicans and Democrats are both aware of this inescapable fact. Yet \ntoo many politicians have been conditioned to believe that bringing one \ncomma of positive reform to either law is political suicide.\n  Well, bipartisan majorities in the new Congress voted to change a lot \nmore than just commas in both laws this year. We took bipartisan action \non Medicare, reforming a broken payment system that has threatened \nseniors' care. We took bipartisan action on Social Security's \ndisability component, enacting the most significant reform in a \ngeneration. As a result of these bipartisan reforms, we put a permanent \nend to Congress' annual doc fix drama. We brought reform to a program \nfor disabled Americans that was scheduled to go broke next year. And we \nbroke through on a bipartisan basis--an important psychological barrier \nthat has held back broader positive action for the American people.\n  The scale of what this new Congress was able to achieve on these \nissues is noteworthy, but it is important for another reason. It clears \na path for future wins for our constituents. That is good news for our \ncountry today, it is good news for future generations tomorrow, and it \nis another example of a Congress that is back to work for the American \npeople and back on their side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8508-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we are taking a long, overdue step in \nmoving beyond the Bush No Child Left Behind law.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act will reduce the focus on testing while \nstill ensuring that all students are making progress. This \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act also \nincludes new investments for early childhood education--a priority for \nDemocrats.\n  The senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, and the chairman of \nthe HELP Committee, Senator Alexander, did good work in getting this \nbill passed. But while we pat ourselves on the back for passing this \nlegislation, we shouldn't forget that we could have done this a long \ntime ago. It was not long after the bill passed that we knew it was \nfull of flaws, and we tried valiantly to change it for a number of \nyears.\n  Why didn't we change it? Because there were Republican filibusters. \nWe couldn't bring the bill to the floor. In fact, nearly every major \nbipartisan bill we passed this year could have become law in years past \nif Republicans had not blocked them, obstructed them, and filibustered \nthem.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about the bill we are going \nto vote on at 10:45 a.m., the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nand the so-called doc fix. My friend referred to that, the SGR. For \nyears, because of something the Bush administration had done to fix it \non paper to make the budget look good, we could not get past that. It \nwas terrible for Medicare patients and very bad for Medicare \nphysicians. We tried to change it not once, not twice, not three times, \nbut numerous times. Every time we couldn't do it because of Republican \nobstructionism.\n  We passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. Why didn't we do it \nearlier? Because the Republicans filibustered it, blocked it, and \nobstructed it.\n  The Department of Homeland Security funding that nearly shut down the \ngovernment--we tried to do it earlier. We couldn't because of \nobstruction by Republicans.\n  The Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, also called the \nClay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act--why didn't we \ndo that earlier? Because they wouldn't let us. They filibustered it, \nthey blocked it.\n  For the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill it was the same thing; \nthe USA FREEDOM Act, the same thing. As to cyber security legislation, \nmy friend comes and boasts about all the good things done, and it \nincludes cyber security. It takes a lot of gall to come here and boast \nabout that. It was filibustered time and again by the Republicans.\n  My friend also talks about how great the Senate is operating. When he \nsigned up for this job, he said that, as Republicans, they would take \nall bills through the committee of jurisdiction--absolute falsehood. \nThey have not done that.\n  What am I talking about? Well, S. 534, the Immigration Rule of Law \nAct of 2015, went directly to the floor. DHS, Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations, directly bypassed the committee. For the \nKeystone Pipeline it was the same thing; Iran nuclear agreement, same \nthing; vehicle for the Trade Act, same thing; Trade Preferences \nExtension Act, same thing. H.R. 644, Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act, same thing, went directly to the floor and skipped the \ncommittee. Patriot Act extension, same thing--it skipped the committee. \nHighway bill, same thing--it skipped the committee. Defund Planned \nParenthood skipped the committee and came right here. The vehicle for \nthe Iran bill skipped the committee and came directly to the floor. The \npain-capable bill, same thing--it skipped the committee and came here. \nAnd there are many other instances.\n  The bills I have talked about, with some exception, were good bills \nin the last Congress, and they were good bills this Congress. The only \ndifference between then and now is that Republicans no longer blocked \nthem.\n  I am not amused. I know that some may think this is amusing, but it \nis not. It is too serious. When my Republican colleagues take victory \nlaps on legislation they filibustered last Congress, that is not a \nlaughing matter. I say to my Republican friends: You get no credit for \npassing legislation now that Republicans blocked then. It doesn't work \nthat way. We have not obstructed; we have been constructive. If \nRepublicans are intent on claiming credit for moving forward bills they \nhave blocked in the past, I hope they will change course this coming \nyear and finally start to do something for the middle class.\n  Where have we done anything for the middle class during the first \nyear of this Congress? I don't see a place. We are halfway through the \n114th Congress, and I have seen little hope that they are planning on \ndoing anything in the next few months. Let's see what happens next \nyear.\n  This Congress so far has been a failure for middle-class Americans. \nWe can change that next year. We can do something about the minimum \nwage that has been filibustered numerous times by the Republicans. \nIncreasing the minimum wage is good for American workers, businesses, \nand the economy. Under Senator Murray's proposal, 38 million Americans \nstand to benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. In Nevada, \nalmost 400,000 workers will get a raise. That is almost one-third of \nour State's workforce.\n  Next year we can finally address unfair wage disparity that takes \nmoney out of American women's paychecks. On average, women make about \n77 cents for every dollar their male colleague makes for doing the same \nwork. For women of color, the disparity is even worse. African-American \nwomen make 64 cents for every dollar their male colleagues make for \ndoing the same work. Latino women make 53 cents for every dollar doing \nthe same work that a man does. That is really unconscionable. I \nencourage the Republican leader to take up Senator Mikulski's Paycheck \nFairness Act, which would help close the wage-gap disparity for \nAmerican women.\n  Next year we could pass legislation to ease the burden of student \nloans, which are so costly. Americans now owe more than $1 trillion in \nstudent loan debt. Student loans are the second largest source of \npersonal debt in the United States--even more than credit cards or auto \nloans. I hope Republicans will work with us to do something about this \nnext year. Americans with student loans need the help.\n  These are just a few of the important matters I urge Republicans to \nundertake in the coming year. There are many things we can do to help \nthe middle class. So instead of telling us how the Senate is working, \nwhy not work with Democrats? Instead of telling us how productive this \nyear has been in\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\nspite of all the empirical data that proves otherwise, why not make \nthis coming year productive for America's working families? If we do \nthat, then we can honestly tell the American people that the Senate is \nworking again--not obstructing--because they would be working with us. \nWe have worked with Republicans to pass legislation outlined by the \nRepublican leader and previously filibustered by them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8509-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8509-S8513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STUDENT SUCCESS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany S. 1177, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany S. 1177, a bill to \n     reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 to ensure that every child achieves.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 10:45 \na.m. is equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the American people have a lot on their \nminds this week about things happening in our world and in our country, \nbut today we turn our attention to something at home. The Senate and \nCongress--and I believe the President--by the end of the week will have \na Christmas present for 50 million children and 3.4 million teachers in \n100,000 public schools across this country, something they have been \neagerly awaiting. Today the Senate should pass by a large margin our \nbill to fix No Child Left Behind.\n  A lot has been said about how the bill repeals the common core \nmandate, how it reverses a trend toward a national school board that \nhas gone on through the last two Presidential administrations, and how \nit is the biggest step toward local control in a quarter of a century \nfor public schools. That is all true.\n  The legislation specifically prohibits the U.S. Secretary of \nEducation from specifying in any State that it must have the common \ncore standards or any other academic standards--not just this Secretary \nbut future Secretaries. It gets rid of the waivers the U.S. Department \nof Education has been using to act, in effect, as a national school \nboard, causing Governors to have to come to Washington and play \n``Mother May I'' if they want to evaluate teachers or fix low-\nperforming schools or set their own academic standards. And it is true \nthat it moves a great many decisions at home. It is the single biggest \nstep toward local control of schools in 25 years.\n  This morning, as we come to a vote, which we will do at 10:45, I \nwould like to emphasize something else. I believe the passage of this \nlegislation--and if it is signed later this week, as I believe it will \nbe, by President Obama--will unleash a flood of innovation and \nexcellence in student achievement across America, community by \ncommunity and State by State. Why do I say that? Look at where the \ninnovation has come from before. My own State, Tennessee, was the first \nState to pay teachers more for teaching well, creating a master teacher \nprogram in the 1980s. Florida came right behind. That didn't come from \nWashington, DC. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota created \nwhat we now call charter schools in the early 1990s. That didn't come \nfrom Washington. The Governors themselves met with President George \nH.W. Bush in 1989 to establish national education goals--not directed \nfrom Washington but with Governors working together, with the President \ninvolved in leading the way and providing the bully pulpit support. \nThen the Governors since that time have been setting higher standards, \ndevising tests to see how well students were doing to reach those \nstandards, creating their own State accountability systems, and finding \nmore ways to evaluate teachers fairly.\n  My own State has done pretty well without Washington's supervision. \nStarting with the master teacher program in the 1980s, then-Governor \nMcWherter, in his time in the 1990s, helped Tennessee pioneer relating \nstudent achievement to teacher performance. Then Governor Bredesen, a \nDemocratic Governor, realized that our standards were very low--we were \nkidding ourselves--so he, working with other Governors, pushed them \nhigher. Our current Governor Bill Haslam has taken it even further, and \nour children are leading the country in student achievement gains. So \nthe States themselves have been the source of innovation and excellence \nover the last 30 years.\n  We have learned something else in the last 10 or 15 years: Too much \nWashington involvement causes a backlash. You can't have a civil \nconversation about common core in Tennessee or many other States. It is \nthe No. 1 issue in Republican primaries, even in general elections, \nmainly because Washington got involved with it. Now Washington is out \nof it, and it is up to Tennessee and Washington and every State to \ndecide for themselves what their academic standards ought to be. The \nsame is true with teacher evaluation.\n  I was in a 1\\1/2\\-year brawl with the National Education Association \nin 1983 and 1984 as Governor, when we paid teachers more for teaching \nwell. It carried by one vote in our State senate. So when I came to \nWashington a few years ago, people said: Well, Senator Alexander is \ngoing to want every State to do that. They were absolutely wrong about \nthat. The last thing we should do is tell States they must evaluate \nteachers and how to evaluate teachers. It is hard enough to do without \nsomebody looking over your shoulder. Too much Washington involvement \nhas actually made it harder--harder to have higher standards and harder \nto evaluate teachers. I believe we are changing that this week.\n  I had dinner with a Democratic Senator last night who plans to vote \nfor the bill. He said he would have given me 5-to-1 odds at the \nbeginning of the year that we wouldn't be able to pass this bill. Why \nare we at the point where we are likely to get votes in the mid-\neighties today in favor of the bill? No. 1, because we worked on it in \na bipartisan way. And I have given credit many times to Senator Murray \nfrom the State of Washington for suggesting how we do that. I see \nSenator Mikulski from Maryland on the floor. She has been a force for \nthat as well. Our committee worked in a bipartisan way, and so did the \nHouse of Representatives as we worked through the conference.\n  The President and his staff members and Secretary Duncan have been \nprofessional and straightforward in dealing with us all year long, and \nI am grateful for that. We knew from the beginning, when we said to the \nPresident: Mr. President, we know we can't change the law; we can't fix \nNo Child Left Behind unless we have your signature. We know that. He \ndealt with us in a straightforward way.\n  Then we found a consensus. Once we found that consensus, it made a \nvery difficult problem a lot easier. The consensus is this: We keep the \nimportant measurements of student achievement so that parents, \nteachers, and schools will know how schools, teachers, and parents are \ndoing. There are 17 tests designed by the States, administered from the \n3rd grade through the 12th grade, about 2 hours per test. That is not \nvery many tests. Keep those, report the results, disaggregate the \nresults, and then leave to classroom teachers, school boards, and \nStates the decisions about what to do about the tests. That should \nresult in better and fewer tests. That consensus underpins the success \nwe have had.\n  Six years ago, in December, we had a big disagreement in this \nChamber. We passed the Affordable Care Act, with all the Democrats \nvoting yes and all the Republicans voting no. The next day, the \nRepublicans went out and started trying to repeal it, and we haven't \nstopped. That is what happens with that kind of debate. This is a \ndifferent kind of debate.\n  If the President signs this bill, as I believe he will, the next day, \npeople aren't going to be trying to repeal it. Governors, school board \nmembers, and teachers are going to be able to implement it, and they \nwill go to work doing it. They will be deciding what tests to give, \nwhat schools to fix and how to fix them, what the higher academic \nstandards ought to be, and what kind of tests should be there. It will \nbe their decision. They will be free to do it from the day the \nPresident signs this bill. It lasts only for 4 years until it is \nsupposed to be reauthorized, but my guess is that this bill and the \npolicies within\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\nit will set the standard for policy in elementary and secondary \neducation from the Federal level for the next two decades.\n  It is a compromise, but it is a very well-crafted piece of work. It \nis good. It is good policy.\n  There are some things that are undone. Senator Murray has her list of \nthings that couldn't get in the bill, and I have mine. I was glad to \nsee us make more progress on charter schools. I have watched that go \nfrom the time I was Education Secretary in the early 1990s, when I \nwrote a letter to every school superintendent asking them to try at \nleast one of those Minnesota start-from-scratch schools. I watched it \ngo from there to today where over 5 percent of our children in public \nschools go to charter schools. That is a lot of kids--almost 3 million \nchildren--going to schools where teachers have more freedom and parents \nhave more choices.\n  What we haven't made as much progress on is giving low-income parents \nmore choices of schools for their children so they have the same kind \nof opportunity that financially better off parents do. My Scholarship \nfor Kids proposal got only 45 votes here. I thought it was a very good \nidea that would give States the option--not a mandate--to turn all \ntheir Federal education dollars into scholarships for low-income \nchildren. That would be $2,100 for each of those children, and it would \nfollow them to the school their parents chose under the State's rules, \nnot Washington's rules. That is not a part of this bill, but we can \nfight about that and discuss that another day, and I intend to try to \ndo that.\n  Today I think we celebrate the fact that we have come to a very good \nconclusion. We are sending to the President a bill I hope he will be \ncomfortable with. While it does repeal the common core mandate and it \ndoes reverse the trend to a national school board and it is the biggest \nstep toward local control in 25 years, what excites me about the bill \nis I believe it will unleash a flood of innovation and excellence in \nelementary and secondary education that will be a wonderful Christmas \npresent for 50 million children in 100,000 public schools being taught \nby 3.4 million teachers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Every Child \nSucceeds Act. Today will be a great day for the Senate because we will \nactually pass a bill that is a result of a bipartisan effort led by two \nvery able and dedicated leaders, Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member \nPatty Murray. They have done an outstanding job in guiding the \ncommittee and encouraging open debate with extensive hearings, \nconsultation with Members, and committee markups that were long, hard, \nand sometimes quite feisty to say the least. That is the way the \nCongress ought to be, and I thank them.\n  I think their dedication showed that in the Senate--we acknowledge \nthe work of Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott in the House, but \nhere, we were led by two educators: Senator Alexander, the former \npresident of a university and former Secretary of Education and Senator \nMurray, a teacher herself, who has taught us many lessons in our caucus \non how to do the right job in the right way.\n  Today we come with the rewrite of a bill that started 50 years ago, \nwhen Lyndon Johnson wanted to have a war on poverty and passed the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. It was the first time the \nFederal Government was going to be involved in education and wanted to \nbe sure there were Federal resources to help lift children out of \npoverty.\n\n  Many us agree with what the great former Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice said, that education is the civil rights issue of this \ngeneration because education is what opens doors today and opens doors \ntomorrow. The legislation we pass today will make sure that we correct \nthe problems of the past and do the right thing in the future.\n  When I knew that the committee was going to be serious about the \ndoing the bill, I crisscrossed Maryland consulting with parents, \nteachers, and administrators of our school system to get the best \nideas. The first thing I asked was, what are we doing right, what are \nwe doing wrong, what do you want us to do more of, and when do you want \nus to get the heck out of the way?\n  They said to me: Senator Barb, the problem in Washington is that you \nhave a one-size-fits-all mentality. Washington wants to take the same \nrules that apply in New York City and apply them to Ocean City, MD. You \ncannot have a one-size-fits-all for every school district in the United \nStates of America.\n  The second thing they said is, yes, you need accountability; yes, you \ndo need metrics. But what we have come up with is overtesting that \nstill does not result in high performance.\n  I worked on a bipartisan basis with the leadership to do what we \ncould to get rid of the excesses of one-size-fits-all, all decisions \nthat are made in Washington, and the fact that we shouldn't be racing \nto the test, we should be racing to the top.\n  My first rule in working on this legislation was to do no harm. I was \ndeeply disturbed that there was an effort to change the formula--the \nformula that meant what Federal funds do come in the area of title I. \nWe worked very hard to make sure the formula was fair and equitable, \nalong with the rules of the game now and the groundwork for the rules \nof the game for the future.\n  What that meant was that initially Maryland would have lost $40 \nmillion and Baltimore City and Baltimore County would have each lost $6 \nmillion. In Prince George's County, which is experiencing a new wave of \nimmigrant children, we would have lost $7 million. We were able to make \nsure the formula works the way it should.\n  We also made sure our teachers have the support they need. Our \nteachers have been overregulated. They have had demands placed on them \nto solve problems that are not theirs when a child comes to the \nclassroom. Their job is to teach the child, but they can't solve every \nproblem the child has. Many of our children come to school with \nsignificant and severe health problems. Some have peanut allergies. \nSome have asthma. Some are challenged by autism. The school system \nneeds help with supportive services.\n  I am so proud of the effort I led to make sure we have opportunities \nfor school nurses to be in those schools; to make sure Federal funds \ncan be used for the coordination of the services that will be needed to \nprovide and oversee the health needs of our children, such as vision \nscreening, hearing screening, and important mental health services--\nthis is what we need to be able to do; also, to make sure that while we \nmaintain testing in reading and math, we make sure we get rid of the \novertesting and the race to the test.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act is good for all of Maryland's \nstudents. There are 874,000 boys and girls in school today. Some are \nfrom at-risk populations. What we do here is get them ready for school. \nWe make investments in preschool education, which is so important. We \nhave afterschool programming because children don't learn only during \nthe school day but through structured afterschool programming. Children \ncontinue to learn all day while they are in a safe and secure \nenvironment. We empower families, we empower teachers, and we empower \nthe local level.\n  I think this is a very good job in what has been done here. What we \nhope to be able to do is to make sure our children are ready for the \n21st century. I believe this bill is a downpayment on our children's \nfuture and therefore on our Nation's future. When we spend money on \neducation, the benefit not only accrues to the child, it accrues to our \nsociety. Every time a child can read, every time a child can \nparticipate in the demands and the knowledge of what the 21st century \nrequires, we are going to be in a better place.\n  I congratulate Senator Alexander and Senator Murray on a great job.\n  I urge adoption of the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate a truly \nbipartisan, bicameral accomplishment. For the first time in 14 years, \nCongress is on the precipice of reauthorizing the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, ESEA. First enacted 50 years ago as a part of \nthe civil rights era, this legislation sought to ensure all children, \nregardless of ZIP code, were able to obtain a high-quality education. \nThe latest reauthorization of ESEA was signed\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\ninto law in 2001 as the No Child Left Behind, NCLB, Act. Due for \nreauthorization since 2007, an entire generation of students have \nmatriculated through our Nation's public school system under this \nFederal education policy while reforms have been desperately needed. I \nam proud of the compromises that Senate HELP Committee Chairman \nAlexander and Ranking Member Murray were able to craft together \nstarting back in January and for the tireless work of their staffs to \nget us to this point we are at today.\n  Ensuring access to a high-quality education is one of the most \nimportant duties of Federal, State, and local governments. While \nCongress enacted the NCLB Act with the best of intentions and a \ncomforting name, in reality the red tape and overreliance on the \nFederal assessments it codified have left far too many children behind \nsince its passage. In the years leading up to today, I have heard from \nparents concerned about the pressure their children feel when taking \ncertain assessments, I have been disheartened to hear educators in my \nState say that they are falling out of love with teaching with \nconsistently changing mandates and the unpredictability of high stakes \ntesting, and I have met with education leaders who are trying to make \nthe best of an untenable situation. All of those involved in \neducation--from students, parents, educators, school support personnel, \neducation leaders, volunteers, and organizations which hold our schools \naccountable to ensure every child obtains a high-quality education--\ndeserve to move on from the failed NCLB Act.\n  I have often heard from educators in my State who stress that a child \nis more than a single or collective set of test scores. I am pleased \nthe Every Child Achieves Act, ECAA, will replace the Federal, one-size-\nfits-all ``adequate yearly progress'' accountability system and allow \nStates to design their own accountability systems to identify, monitor, \nand assist schools. Rather than relying on a collective set of test \nscores to determine student performance, accountability systems will be \nable to take into consideration student growth over the course of a \nschool year. States will be able to consider multiple measures of \nstudent learning, including access to academic resources, school \nclimate and safety, access to support personnel, and other measures \nwhich can allow for differentiation in student performance. All of this \nwill be done while ensuring that students are held to the high yet \nachievable standard of being college- and career-ready upon completion \nof high school.\n  I am proud that the ECAA recognizes that, to support a successful \nstudent, schools should support the whole child, both physically and \nmentally. The approved bill includes a provision I coauthored with \nSenator Roy Blunt that will allow schools in low-income areas to use \nFederal resources under title I to provide school-based mental health \nprograms. School-based mental health programs have been proven to \nincrease educational outcomes, decrease absences, and improve student \nassessments. The ECAA also makes an effort to ensure students in our \nNation have a deeper understanding of how our government functions, and \nI would like to thank Senators Chuck Grassley and Sheldon Whitehouse \nfor working with me to modify the american history and civics title of \nECAA to accomplish this goal. Our provision allows evidence-based civic \nand government education programs that emphasize the history and \nprinciples of the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, to \nreceive Federal funding for expansion and dissemination for voluntary \nuse. For too long, a singular focus on assessments pushed out other \nimportant subjects like these which ensure a student receives a well-\nrounded education.\n  My home State of Maryland has made a commitment to funding education \nadequately over the past decade that has allowed Maryland to be a \nconsistent national leader in student performance and student outcomes. \nEach day, our State's nearly 875,000 students make their way to the \nclassrooms of more than 60,000 educators and thousands more support \npersonnel and education leaders in nearly 1,446 Maryland schools. I \nappreciate the service of educators not only from the perspective of a \nlawmaker, father, and grandfather, but also as a husband of a teacher. \nI appreciate my colleague Senator Barbara Mikulski, for standing with \nme to prevent a proposal from Senator Richard Burr from being included \nin the final conference report which would have harmed Maryland's \nhardest to serve low-income students. Senator Burr's proposal would \nhave reduced Maryland's share of title I-A funding for educating low-\nincome children by $40 million per year, punishing States like Maryland \nthat have made the decision to make proper investments in funding \neducation for our children. Thanks to the work of Senator Mikulski and \na strong coalition of members from similar States, the final conference \nreport does not include this provision.\n  The legislative process is about comprise. In many respects, this \nbill is a vast improvement over the No Child Left Behind Act, and the \nhard work of HELP Committee Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, \nHouse Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline, and Ranking \nMember Bobby Scott have led us to this point. However, work remains to \naddress a current lack of protections to make our schools safer places \nfor lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, LGBT, students. In \naddition, Congress must not repeat the same mistakes we learned from \nunder the NCLB Act by underfunding our Nation's public schools. I stand \nready to work with Members from both parties to ensure that all \nAmericans can obtain a high-quality education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Duncan Taylor is the parent of a second \ngrader in Highline public schools in my home State of Washington. Like \nso many parents in my State, he got a letter in the mail saying his \nson's school was failing.\n  Last year, Washington State lost its waiver from No Child Left \nBehind's requirements. Not only did that mean most of the schools in \nthe State are now labeled as failing, it meant Washington State lost \nflexibility over how to spend some of its Federal funding.\n  As an active member of the PTA, Duncan volunteers in the classroom. \nSo he knew that the label of ``failing'' did not reflect the kind of \neducation his son was getting, but as an education advocate, he also \nknew that losing out on that funding--in effect punishing schools that \nserve students from all kinds of backgrounds--was not going to help. \nLike so many parents and teachers across the Nation, Duncan has been \nfollowing our work to reauthorize the Nation's elementary and secondary \neducation bill. We cannot let them down.\n  I thank Chairman Alexander for working with me since February on a \nbipartisan path to get us to this point today. This process started \nwhen Chairman Alexander and I agreed that No Child Left Behind is badly \nbroken and needed to be fixed. He has been a great partner, and I am \nthrilled we have reached this point together.\n  I also thank all of our colleagues on the HELP Committee for their \nwork and dedication in moving this bill forward. In particular, I thank \nmy committee Democrats for their tireless work on behalf of families, \nschools, and communities in their States. This is a stronger bill \nthanks to their commitment and effort.\n  I thank the two leaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Reid. In \nparticular, I thank Senator Reid for his guidance and support.\n  We would not be where we are without Chairman Kline and Ranking \nMember Scott in the House. While Chairman Kline and I do not see eye to \neye on everything, he has been a great partner on this bill, and I look \nforward to getting more done with him before he retires next year. \nRanking Member Bobby Scott has been a partner in getting this deal \ndone. Without him and the passion he brings around dropout factories \nand creating a real accountability system for our schools so all \nchildren can succeed, we would not have been able to get this bill to a \nplace where Democrats and the President could support it.\n  There have been many late nights and weekends for our staff this \nyear. I want to take a moment now to recognize their extraordinary \nefforts and service. On Senator Alexander's staff, I want to \nparticularly acknowledge and thank his staff director, David Cleary,\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nas well as Peter Oppenheim and Lindsay Fryer, his education and K-12 \npolicy leads, who worked closely with our staff over many months. I \nalso want to acknowledge and thank Jordan Hynes, Bill Knudson, Lindsey \nSeidman, Hillary Knudsen, Bobby McMillin, and Jim Jeffries, who all did \ngreat work on this important bill.\n  In the House, I was proud to work with Chairman John Kline, and I \nrecognize and thank his staff director, Juliane Sullivan, as well as \nAmy Jones, Brad Thomas, Mandy Schaumburg, Leslie Tatum, Kathlyn Ehl, \nMatthew Frame, Sheariah Yousefi, Krisann Pearce, and Brian Newell.\n  I was glad to work with my friend, Ranking Member Bobby Scott, and I \ntruly appreciate all of his hard work and dedication to this bill. I \nwant to recognize and thank his staff director, Denise Forte, along \nwith Jacque Chevalier, Helen Pajcic, Alex Payne, Christian Haines, \nKiara Pesante, Brian Kennedy, and Rayna Reid.\n  In addition, I thank our committed floor staff, who provide \noutstanding guidance to us every day. In particular, I thank Gary \nMyrick, Tim Mitchell, Tricia Engle, and Daniel Tinsley.\n  Finally, I cannot say enough about my own incredible staff, who have \nput their time and talents into this bill from the word ``go.'' In \nparticular, I want to thank my staff director, Evan Schatz, and my \npublic education policy director, Sarah Bolton, for their extraordinary \nefforts on this legislation.\n  I want to acknowledge the long and hard work of Amanda Beaumont, \nAllie Kimmel, Leanne Hotek, Jake Cornett, Aissa Canchola, Sarah \nRosenberg, Aurora Steinle, Leslie Clithero, Eli Zupnick, Helen Hare, \nMary Robbins, Jeff Crooks, John Righter, Beth Stein, Beth Burke, Sarah \nCupp, Melanie Rainer, Stacy Rich, Emma Rodriguez, and my chief of \nstaff, Mike Spahn. I noticed all of your long, hard work on the \nunwavering commitment.\n  As a former teacher, I want to thank you for standing up for the best \ninterests of our students, our educators, and our communities in \nWashington State and across the country. We would not be where we are \ntoday without all of your efforts. Thank you.\n  Every Senator here has heard from teachers, parents, and students in \ntheir home State about how No Child Left Behind is badly broken. For \none thing, the law overemphasized testing, and oftentimes those tests \nare redundant or unnecessary. It issued one-size-fits-all mandates but \nthen failed to give States the resources to meet those standards. I \nhave seen firsthand how this law is not working in my home State of \nWashington.\n  Thankfully, we were able to work in a bipartisan way on a solution. \nTogether, we passed our bill through the HELP Committee with strong \nbipartisan support. We passed our bill here on the Senate floor with \nstrong bipartisan support. We got approval from our bicameral \nconference committee with strong bipartisan support. Last week the \nHouse passed this final legislation with strong bipartisan support. \nToday I hope our colleagues here will approve this final bill with the \nsame bipartisan spirit that has guided our progress so far.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act will reduce reliance on high-stakes \ntesting. It will invest in improving and expanding access to early \nlearning programs so more kids start kindergarten ready to learn. It \nwill help ensure that all students have access to a quality education \nregardless of where they live, how they learn, or how much money their \nparents make.\n  With today's vote, I am looking forward to going back home and \ntelling teachers and principals that we are on their side. I am looking \nforward to showing the American people that Congress can actually work \nwhen both sides work together.\n  I am looking forward to making sure this bill is implemented in a way \nthat works for Washington State students, parents, teachers, and \ncommunities, but first we have to clear this last legislative hurdle \nbefore we can send it to the President's desk. I urge my colleagues to \nvote yes to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act. Vote yes to fix No \nChild Left Behind. Vote yes to prove Congress can break through \ngridlock, work together, and get results. Vote yes to pass this bill \nfor students, parents, teachers, and communities across the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe vote on the adoption of the conference report, the Senate be in a \nperiod of morning business until 6 o'clock p.m., with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, yesterday I extended my appreciation to \nSenator Murray's staff and to mine--some she noted yesterday. Some of \nthem have been working on this bill for 5 years. I am deeply grateful \nto them. I have deep appreciation for their hard work, their ingenuity, \nand their skill in helping us come to this result. Without their hard \nwork and tireless effort, we wouldn't have been able to reach the \nsuccessful conclusion on the passage of this important bipartisan, \nbicameral bill.\n\n  On Senator Murray's exceptional staff, I would like to thank Evan \nSchatz, Sarah Bolton, Amanda Beaumont, John Righter, Jake Cornett, \nLeanne Hotek, Allie Kimmel, and Aissa Canchola.\n  On my hardworking and dedicated staff, I would like to thank David \nCleary, Peter Oppenheim, Lindsay Fryer, Bill Knudsen, Jordan Hynes, \nHillary Knudson, Jake Baker, Lindsey Seidman, Allison Martin, Bobby \nMcMillin, Jim Jeffries, Liz Wolgemuth, Margaret Atkinson, and Taylor \nHaulsee.\n  I would like to thank some of my former staff who participated in \nthis multiyear effort, but have moved on to other endeavors, including \nMarty West, Diane Tran, Matthew Stern, Patrick Murray, and Haley \nHudler.\n  On Chairman Kline's staff, I would like to thank Juliane Sullivan, \nAmy Jones, Brad Thomas, Mandy Schaumburg, Leslie Tatum, Kathlyn Ehl, \nand Sheriah Yousefi.\n  On Congressman Scott's staff, I would like to thank Denise Forte, \nBrian Kennedy, Jacque Chevalier, Helen Pajcic, Christian Haines, Kevin \nMcDermott, Alex Payne, Kiara Pesante, Arika Trim, Rayna Reid, Michael \nTaylor, Austin Barbera, and Veronique Pluviose.\n  I would like to thank the hard-working staff of our Senate HELP \nCommittee members and conferees, who played important roles in reaching \nthis agreement, including Steve Townsend with Senator Enzi, Chris \nToppings with Senator Burr, Brett Layson with Senator Isakson, Natalie \nBurkhalter with Senator Paul, Katie Brown with Senator Collins, Karen \nMcCarthy with Senator Murkowski, Cade Clurman and Natalia Odebralski \nwith Senator Kirk, Will Holloway with Senator Scott, Katie Neal with \nSenator Hatch, Josh Yurek with Senator Roberts, Pam Davidson with \nSenator Cassidy, Brent Palmer with Senator Mikulski, David Cohen with \nSenator Sanders, Jared Solomon with Senator Casey, Gohar Sedighi with \nSenator Franken, Juliana Hermann with Senator Bennet, Brenna Barber \nwith Senator Whitehouse, Brian Moulton with Senator Baldwin, Mike \nDiNapoli with Senator Baldwin, Eamonn Collins with Senator Murphy, and \nJosh Delaney with Senator Warren.\n  Much of the hard-working staff from the White House and Department of \nEducation also provided great help in getting this conference agreement \ncompleted.\n  From the White House, I would like to thank Chief of Staff Denis \nMcDonough, Domestic Policy Adviser Cecilia Munoz, James Kvaal, Roberto \nRodriguez, Kate Mevis, Don Sisson, and Mario Cardona.\n  From the U.S. Department of Education, I would like to thank \nSecretary Arne Duncan, Emma Vadehra, and Lloyd Horwich for their \ntechnical assistance.\n  The Senate legislative counsel staff work long hours on the many \ndrafts of this bill and the amendments we considered on the floor in \nJuly, so I would like to especially thank Amy Gaynor, Kristin Romero, \nand Margaret Bomba.\n  We always rely on the experts at the Congressional Research Service \nto give us good information in a timely manner, so I extend my thanks \nto Becky Skinner, Jeff Kuenzi, Jody Feder, and Gail McCallion.\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\n  On Senator McConnell's staff, I would like to thank Sharon \nSoderstrom, Don Stewart, Jen Kuskowski, Katelyn Conner, Erica Suares, \nJohn Abegg, Neil Chatergee, and Johnathan Burks.\n  On the Senate floor staff, I would like to thank Laura Dove, Robert \nDuncan, Chris Tuck, Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, \nMike Smith, and Chloe Barz.\n  On Senator Cornyn's staff, I would like to thank Monica Popp, Emily \nKirlin, and John Chapuis.\n  From the Republican Policy Committee, I would like to thank Dana \nBarbieri.\n  Finally, I would like to thank some in the education community for \ntheir persistent help with this bill, including Mary Kusler with the \nNational Education Association, Tor Cowan with the American Federation \nof Teachers, Chris Minnich, Peter Zamora Carissa Moffat Miller, and \nJessah Walker with the Council of Chief State School Officers, Stephen \nParker and David Quam with the National Governors Association, and \nNoelle Ellerson and Sasha Pudelski with the School Superintendents \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier--and I am speaking mainly to my \ncolleagues on the Republican side now--Senator Murray's preference for \na large early childhood program is not in the bill. My preference for a \nlarge program to give parents more choices of schools is not in the \nbill. We are not voting on that today.\n  Today we are voting on one of two things: the status quo or the \nchange. You are either voting yes to repeal the common core mandate or \nno to keep it. You are either voting yes to get rid of the waivers \nthrough which the U.S. Department of Education has been operating as a \nnational school board for 80,000 schools in 42 States or a vote no is \nsaying: I like the national school board. Your voting yes means the \nlargest step toward local control of schools in 25 years or no means \nyou are voting against the largest step toward local control in 25 \nyears. A vote yes means you like the fact that this bill should produce \nless testing; no means you like the testing the way it is. Those are \nthe choices. We are past the time when each of us has a chance to offer \nan amendment. We all offered our amendments. I have offered mine. Some \nof mine got 45 votes, and I needed 60 votes, so they are not in the \nbill, but the choice today is a choice to unleash a flood of excellence \nin student achievement across this country the way it should be--State \nby State, community by community, classroom by classroom.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  I yield back any time we have remaining.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the adoption of the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Mr. President, today the Senate voted on the \nadoption of the conference report to accompany S. 1177, the Every Child \nAchieves Act. The conference report is commonly referred to as the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act. While the Every Student Succeeds Act takes \nimportant steps in restoring some control over education decisions back \nto the States, it does not go far enough. Unfortunately, the bill does \nnot grant States autonomy in all education decisionmaking, expands the \nFederal Government's role in pre-K, and fails to include important \nmeasures that broaden school choice. Due to these shortcomings, I am \nunable to lend my support to this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8513-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 85 \nto 12, has sent a Christmas present to 50 million children across this \ncountry. First, it has to go down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White \nHouse, where we hope President Obama will wrap a big red bow around it, \nsign it, and send it to the children and the 3.4 million teachers who \nare looking forward to it.\n  This is a bill that is so important that the Nation's Governors gave \nit their first full endorsement of any piece of legislation in 20 \nyears. It has the full support of the Chief State School Officers, it \nhas the full support of the school administrators, and it has the \nsupport of the American Federation of Teachers and the National \nEducation Association.\n  This is very good policy, and the reason it is, is it is bipartisan, \nit is a consensus, and instead of arguing about it after the President \nsigns it--which I hope he will--classroom teachers, school board \nmembers, Governors, community by community, State by State can go to \nwork implementing it, and making their plans to make their own \ndecisions about what kind of tests to give, how many to give, what the \nstandards should be, how to fix failing schools, how to reward \noutstanding teachers. We have created an environment that I believe \nwill unleash a flood of excellence in student achievement, State by \nState and community by community.\n  I thank the Members of the Senate. I especially thank the, members of \nthe Health Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee who have worked so \nwell together--all 22 of them. I especially thank Senator Patty Murray \nof Washington for her leadership and her effectiveness in helping to \nget such a remarkable event.\n  To take an issue this complex and difficult and have a vote of 85 to \n12 proves that when the Senate puts its mind to it, it can do some very \ngood work. We have done that today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8513-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I am going to ask for a unanimous consent \nrequest but speak for a couple of minutes, engaging in some discussion \nwith my dear friend, the senior Senator from the State of Utah.\n  First, I thank him for coming to the floor today on this issue. I am \nheartened that he has expressed interest in working with us to get \nsomething done to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. I also thank \nmy friends, the Senators from Connecticut, New Jersey, Oregon, \nWashington, Illinois, and my colleague from New York who is here for \ntheir steadfast support for helping Puerto Rico in this time of crisis.\n  I rise deeply troubled by the dire economic, financial, and health \ncare situation in Puerto Rico. The island is facing a financial crisis, \na health care system on life support, and the situation grows more dire \neach month.\n  Puerto Rico is $73 billion in debt already and large bond payments \nwill continue to become due next month and in the months to come. \nSadly, as Puerto Rico's economy and health care system has floundered, \nresidents have started to flee their homeland. As the economic \nsituation worsens, the population shift from the island to the mainland \nwill continue until the only ones left are those who don't have the \nresources to move. At that point we are going to have a humanitarian \ncrisis on our hands, if there isn't one already.\n  There are 3.5 million people, Puerto Ricans, living on the island \ntoday and another 5.2 million living in the United States, including \nover 1 million in my State of New York. We have a basic American \nresponsibility to aid all American citizens in times of crisis, no \nmatter where they live. Beyond that basic imperative, if we fail to \noffer Puerto Rico assistance now, the problem will not be contained to \nthe island.\n  We need to be concerned with these issues, not only because Puerto \nRicans are part of the American family and deserve the quality of life \nwe all expect but also because our failure to act now could result in a \nPuerto Rican financial crisis that becomes a drag on our entire \neconomy. I want to underscore this point. Congress must intervene \nbefore the crisis deepens and widens. We have the tools to fix this \nproblem. They are sitting in the toolbox. The problem is Puerto Rico \nisn't allowed to use them.\n  Similar to chapter 9 protections offered under the Bankruptcy Code, \nevery State in the United States can access chapter 9 protections for \nmunicipal and public corporate debt, but Puerto Rico, because it is a \nterritory, cannot. Providing Puerto Rico the ability to restructure its \ndebt is absolutely necessary if Puerto Rico is going to get out from \nthis financial crisis.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I have introduced legislation along with many \nof my other colleagues who will join us today that will put Puerto Rico \non an equal footing when it comes to chapter 9. At the very least we \nshould pass it right away. There are other proposals as well. We could \nwiden bankruptcy protections. There are health and economic issues as \nwell and we have to look at those.\n  I stress to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that giving \nPuerto Rico the restructuring authority in our bill isn't a bailout and \nwill not require any additional spending. It will not cost the \ntaxpayers one plug nickel, but it will do a whole lot of good to our \nfriends in Puerto Rico.\n  On the health care front, I have introduced a bill with many of my \nsame colleagues to address several aspects of the health care crisis, \nissues such as Medicaid funding and fairness, appropriate reimbursement \nrates, and equitable physician payments. Disparities in how the \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs treat Puerto Rico and our other \nterritories are significant and need to be addressed.\n  In conclusion, I am going to be the first to admit that neither of \nthese bills is a silver bullet to solve all of Puerto Rico's problems, \nnor are they the only potential solutions. We are more than willing to \nwork with the chairman of the Finance Committee, a good friend who I \nknow cares about the Puerto Rican issue, to find other solutions and \ncraft bipartisan legislation so long as it provides help to Puerto \nRico, but the clock is ticking. We are running out of time. Congress \nmust act now to address these issues that are stifling Puerto Rico's \neconomy and way of life. We must give them the tools they need to solve \nthese problems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 1774 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nsay first that I appreciate what my colleague is trying to do with \nregard to Puerto Rico. I think it is fair to say that we all share his \nconcerns, and I don't know of anyone in this Chamber who is indifferent \nto the issues facing our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico. I \nagree with the senior Senator from New York that Congress should act to \naddress these problems and we need to act very quickly. However, a \nnumber of Senators, myself included, have some concerns about the \nspecific policy in the bill he has brought up today on the floor. \nSetting aside those concerns, there are a number of questions about \nwhether this approach would effectively address Puerto Rico's problems.\n  I want to work with my colleagues and especially my colleague from \nNew York to find a path forward on this issue. Once again, there is \nbipartisan agreement that something needs to be done. I have been \nworking closely with the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee \non this issue. He has been a great help. I have also been in some \npretty involved discussions with the chairs of the Judiciary and Energy \nand Natural Resources Committees, which also have jurisdiction in this \nmatter, as we have been working to draft a legislative proposal to \naddress a number of these concerns. In fact, we are planning to \nintroduce our bill later today.\n  I am sure I will have more to say on that piece of particular \nlegislation in the coming days. For now I will say I would be happy to \nengage the senior Senator from New York on this matter as well and \nwould hope that he would be willing to do the same with me. Going \nforward, I hope we can work together to make sure we have all the \ninformation we need about the situation in Puerto Rico in order to \ncraft informed policies and effective solutions and do so in short \norder, in the interest of helping the people of Puerto Rico.\n  As of right now, I think we need additional deliberation on this \nmatter rather than simply deeming any piece of legislation to be the \ncorrect approach. For these reasons I must object to the good Senator's \nrequest at this time, but once again I will commit to working with him \nand others to address these important issues.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just briefly. I thank my colleague from \nUtah for his remarks. I want to work with him, as I know Senator Wyden, \nSenator Gillibrand, Senator Menendez, and so many others on the floor \nwant to get this done. We have to work together quickly and I \nappreciate him acknowledging that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I want to express my strong \ndisappointment that we are unable to do this legislation now. There is \na grave sense of urgency for the people living in Puerto Rico, so I \nshare the goals of my colleagues to get this done sooner than later. \nThis has to be moved forward. No American parent or child should have \nto face economic stress simply because of where they live. Congress has \nthe responsibility to actually help these families. The economic \nsituation in Puerto\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nRico is a serious problem that we can only begin to solve with \nmeaningful legislation.\n  This bill is the fiscally responsible way to help the people of \nPuerto Rico. It is the fiscally responsible way to alleviate the dire \neconomic situation in Puerto Rico. Let's be very clear. This is not a \nbailout. It is a means for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico to get \nthemselves out of serious economic distress. Congress must come \ntogether to pass this bill. The situation in Puerto Rico is desperate \nand these families need our help. There is no other way to see it. We \nhave to help them.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider this objection. Congress must help \nthe people of Puerto Rico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Menendez speak after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate Chairman Hatch's \nwillingness to work with all of us--Senator Schumer, Senator \nGillibrand, Senator Menendez, and myself--the many Senators who care \ndeeply about this issue.\n  My view is that the situation in Puerto Rico will get far, far worse, \nparticularly with inaction. That is why it is so important for this \nbody to come together, Democrats and Republicans, and move quickly.\n  As Chairman Hatch has noted, we have been working on this in the \nFinance Committee. We are appreciative of Chairman Hatch's willingness \nto listen to colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I think it is \nfair to say we have made some tangible progress.\n  Recently, the talks have bogged down, in particular because of \nefforts to change national programs that have nothing to do with Puerto \nRico. I wish to emphasize what has been the challenge in recent days. \nWe are trying to deal with the very real and significant questions \nfacing Puerto Rico. Some have said in order to do that, you would have \nto make substantial changes in national programs.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to speak briefly on the floor this \nmorning is I believe that any legislation to assist Puerto Rico needs \nto be focused on the territory and not get into unrelated provisions. \nIn addition, any legislation to assist Puerto Rico ought to include \nsome type of debt restructuring authority. Unfortunately, I think \nthings have moved past the point where any sort of austerity in Puerto \nRico can allow them to climb out of debt without causing a humanitarian \ncrisis. That is why some type of debt restructuring is so important.\n  Wrapping up, I also wish to point out that debt restructuring and \ndebt restructuring authority does not add a penny to the Federal \ndeficit. In my discussions with Chairman Hatch--and we are very \nappreciative of our relationship and discussions we have had--that has \nbeen very important to him. So I do want to point out that debt \nrestructuring authority does not add one penny to the Federal deficit.\n  This issue is too important to get lost in yet another partisan \nfight. I am going to work closely with our many colleagues, the two \nSenators from New York, Senator Menendez, who knows an enormous amount \nabout this issue, and the chairman because, as I touched on in my \nstatement, things will get much, much worse and sooner than people \nthink, in my view, if Congress fails to act.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have a lot of respect for Chairman \nHatch. I am privileged to sit with him and the ranking member on the \nSenate Finance Committee. He does try to work in ways that are \nbipartisan, so I appreciate his willingness to acknowledge that this is \na problem. But I am disappointed that this rather modest measure to \nhelp Puerto Rico address its challenges in an orderly and legal way \nseems to be in a vortex in which we can't get it out.\n  There are four things I think we need to be clear about. Every single \nmunicipality in the United States already has access to chapter 9. \nPuerto Rico had access to it until 1984, when a provision was stuck \ninto a larger bill with no explanation or debate. Restoring chapter 9 \nto the island doesn't cost the U.S. Treasury a single penny, nor will \nit raise the deficit. Perhaps most importantly, all other measures both \nthe mainland and the island can take are virtually meaningless without \nthis restructuring authority.\n  I appreciate the chairman's remarks about being open to negotiate, \nbut we have been negotiating this issue for several months now. We have \nheard from stakeholders representing every interest on the island. We \nhave had three congressional hearings. And while there may be some \ndifferences on the exact prescription, virtually everyone agrees that \nsome restructuring authority must be part of the cure.\n  Again, this is something we can do right now. This is something that \ndoesn't cost anything or need an offset, and it is something tangible \nthat will give--and I want to focus on this--the 3.5 million American \ncitizens who live in Puerto Rico a fighting chance.\n  This is not about some foreign country. The citizens of Puerto Rico \nare citizens of the United States. If all 3.5 million came to the \nmainland, they would have the rights and privileges as any other U.S. \ncitizen. They would be fully eligible for any benefit that any citizen \nof the United States has.\n  Sometimes we look at the people of Puerto Rico--and I have had \nMembers in the past when I served in the House of Representatives who \nhave asked me: Do I need a passport to go to Puerto Rico? Pretty \namazing. This is not some foreign country, this is the United States of \nAmerica. They are U.S. citizens. They deserve to be treated as U.S. \ncitizens.\n  The people of Puerto Rico have fought in virtually every war the \nUnited States has ultimately had. If you go to the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial with me, you will see a disproportionate number of names from \nthe island of Puerto Rico who served in that war or the 65th Infantry \nRegiment Division in the Korean War, which was an all-Puerto Rican \ndivision and the most highly decorated in the history of U.S. military \nactions, and on and on. It is shameful that we treat 3.5 million U.S. \ncitizens this way.\n  This crisis didn't develop overnight, nor will it be fixed in a day, \nbut the present Governor, Governor Padilla, and the Government of \nPuerto Rico have done everything they can to right the ship of \ninsolvency. Governor Alejandro Padilla didn't create this crisis, which \nhas gone on through various administrations in Puerto Rico, but he has \nmade the tough choices. He has closed schools and hospitals. He has \nlaid off police and firefighters. He has raised taxes on businesses and \nindividuals. They have gone beyond what a sovereign nation such as \nGreece, for example, would ever have imagined doing, but they have run \nout of options. All the cuts and tax hikes will not make a dent in this \ncrisis without the breathing room that restructuring authority \nprovides.\n  This problem isn't going to go away, but I do say that as Congress \nfiddles, Puerto Rico burns. It would be outrageous if the Congress goes \nhome for a holiday and leaves a brewing catastrophe for the 3.5 million \ncitizens of Puerto Rico who have fought for and died for this country.\n  So I hope these negotiations, which, as the distinguished ranking \nmember has said, should be focused on the issue of Puerto Rico and the \n3.5 million U.S. citizens who live there, who wear the uniform of the \nUnited States, who have fought for it proudly and who have died for it, \nultimately are not linked to something that has nothing to do with \nthose 3.5 million U.S. citizens.\n  Puerto Rico isn't asking us to pull them out of this hole; they are \njust asking us to give them the tools with which they can help \nthemselves. For over a century, we have had an inextricable bond with \nthe island of Puerto Rico and its people, and we should not turn our \nbacks on their great commitment to our country.\n  I am going to come to the floor again and again, and I am going to \nremind my fellow Americans of Puerto Rican descent in Pennsylvania, in \nOhio, in Florida, in New York, in New Jersey, and elsewhere around this \ncountry about their need to raise their voices on behalf of their \nfellow citizens. This is pretty outrageous to me.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am proud to follow my colleague from \nNew Jersey, my other esteemed colleagues, and the ranking member on the \nFinance Committee--Senator Wyden--and Senator Schumer simply to make a \nfew very starkly apparent points about the situation in Puerto Rico. It \naffects not only the 3.5 million citizens in Puerto Rico--and they are \nAmerican citizens of the United States--but also the financial markets, \nthe bondholders, and citizens who depend on the viability of our \nfinancial system across the country and potentially around the globe.\n  There is a reason for bankruptcy laws. They try to make the best of a \nbad situation. Bankruptcy is never pleasant or welcome. The reason for \nthe bankruptcy laws is to create an orderly, structured process for \navoiding the chaotic and costly race to the courtroom and then endless \nlitigation. It simply consumes scarce resources. That is what will \nhappen if bankruptcy protection is not provided in some way to the \nmunicipal entities, governmental function, and others in Puerto Rico.\n  By a quirk of history, Puerto Rico is not covered by chapter 9. That \nquirk of history could be extraordinarily costly, not only in dollars \nand cents but in the humanitarian catastrophe that threatens the people \nof Puerto Rico in depriving them of essential services, energy, medical \ncare, and all kinds of very necessary governmental functions that may \nbe impossible if there is no orderly resolution to its financial \nsituation.\n  We can debate how Puerto Rico arrived at this place. We should learn \nfrom history so we don't repeat it, but right now this crisis demands \naction, and that action has to come now.\n  Many of us remember when New York City faced similar financial \nstraits and the headlines in some of the tabloids. One said ``Ford to \nCity: Drop Dead.'' It was a reference to President Ford and his lack of \naction when New York City was in dire fiscal trouble.\n  The Nation would not let New York City drop dead. It should not let \nPuerto Rico drop dead financially. It should not send a message to \nPuerto Rico: Drop dead.\n  For this Chamber to say ``drop dead'' to Puerto Rico is absolutely \nintolerable and unacceptable, just as it would be if we were to say \n``drop dead'' to the people of Alaska, represented so ably by the \nPresiding Officer, in a similar situation or to the people of Oregon, \nConnecticut, or any of our States or municipal entities. We know we \ncame to the aid of Detroit, Stockton, and other municipalities when \nthey needed it. That message, ``Drop dead, Puerto Rico,'' is \nantithetical to the democracy we represent here.\n  Puerto Rico can and must reform itself, but no amount of long-term \nreform will address the short-term reality that Puerto Rico cannot pay \nits current debts when due. That is the definition of ``insolvency''--\nthe inability to pay debts as they come due. The denial of chapter 9 \nwill not create more money that makes Puerto Rico solvent and enables \nit to pay those debts. The only question is whether this reality \nresults in a chaotic and costly default, with nobody winning except the \nlegions of creditors' attorneys who will spend years and countless \nbillable hours fighting each other litigating through the State or \nCommonwealth courts, through Federal courts, through courts of appeals, \nand maybe to the U.S. Supreme Court, over years, maybe over \ndecades. The alternative is an orderly restructure, which serves the \npublic interests as well as the interests of our fellow Americans in \nPuerto Rico. It is an orderly, deliberate, rational process that only \nCongress can provide.\n\n  The actions in the long term that are necessary in the interest of \neconomic justice, as well as fairness and the welfare of our fellow \ncitizens in Puerto Rico, include addressing issues relating to \nMedicare, the earned-income tax credit, and other obligations that we \nhave recognized for the citizens of the country who live in the 50 \nStates. The financial gymnastics have enabled Puerto Rico so far to \navoid the chaos, and enabled Puerto Rico to avoid going over a cliff \nthat, in effect, is irremediable. But we need to be very blunt and \nreal. Those financial gymnastics cannot be sustained or continued \nindefinitely. The financial somersaults and headstands must end. The \nprospect of a humanitarian catastrophe within a U.S. territory is very \nreal and immediate. Congress can act to prevent it. It can choose not \nto do so. But the responsibility is ours if there is no action.\n  I urge the Members of this body, our colleagues, to give Puerto \nRico--our citizens and fellow Americans there--the respect they deserve \nand approve the bill that we have offered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8516-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8516-S8517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MENTAL HEALTH\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes today \nabout mental health. It is a topic that gets a lot of attention every \ntime somebody does something that we don't think makes sense, when \npeople do harm to others in ways that we don't seem to be able to \nrationalize in any other way but to say that we are almost 100-percent \nsure that this is a person who has a significant mental health problem.\n  Before I go any further with that idea, I wish to say that if you \nhave a mental health problem, you are much more likely to be the victim \nof a crime than you are to be the perpetrator of a crime. But when we \nsee things happen in schools--whether it is an elementary school such \nas Sandy Hook or a community college--and when we see things happen on \na military base such as Fort Hood or in the last week at a holiday \nparty, there is no way to explain those things except to say that \nsomething has gone dramatically wrong in somebody's life. But it does \nbring us to a topic that seems to be brought only by the worst of \ncircumstances.\n  Fifty-two years ago President Kennedy signed the last bill he signed \ninto law, which was the Community Mental Health Act. On the 50th \nanniversary, the last day of October 2013, Senator Stabenow and I came \nto the floor to talk about that. When you look at the Community Mental \nHealth Act, there were lots of great goals to be set for the country. \nAlmost none of those goals have been achieved. The goals of closing \nfacilities that people were concerned about, which they thought didn't \nmeet the mental health needs in the best possible way, were often \nachieved, but replacing those facilities with other places to go to and \nget care didn't happen. In fact, surprisingly, the worst partner in \nbehavioral health is the government.\n  We have mandated that some of these issues be taken care of by \nprivate insurance in what we would consider mental health equity or \nmental health parity, but seldom have we mandated that the Federal \nGovernment step up and treat behavioral health issues in the same way. \nWhile we have done that, we have largely turned to the law enforcement \ncommunity in the country and emergency rooms and said that is our \nmental health program. The truth is we never said that. We just allowed \nthat to happen.\n  The biggest program for dealing with a behavioral health issue is the \nlocal police and the emergency room--neither of which is the best place \nto do this or the right place to do this. Sometimes that is the only \noption, and it is understandable when it is the only option. But it \ndoesn't have to be the only option so much of the time.\n  The National Institutes of Health says that one out of four adult \nAmericans has a diagnosable and almost always treatable behavioral \nhealth issue. This is not something that we don't have any relationship \nwith. By the way, they don't say that one out of four adult Americans \nhas a diagnosis and is undergoing treatment. They say that one out of \nfour adult Americans has a diagnosable behavioral health issue and it \nis almost always treatable. In a hearing we had a year or so ago, they \nwent on to say that about one out of nine adult Americans has a \nbehavioral health issue that impacts the way they live every day, many \ntimes in a dramatic way.\n  We need to do something about this. The Congress took a big step to \ndo\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\nsomething about it over a year ago when we passed the Excellence in \nMental Health Act. What did the Excellence in Mental Health Act do? The \nExcellence in Mental Health Act set up an eight-State pilot where in \nthose eight States the facilities that met the requirements that the \nact specifies--community health centers, federally qualified health \ncenters, community mental health centers that have the right kind of \nstaff and have that staff available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and \nmeet other criteria--in those centers and in those eight States, \nbehavioral health would be treated like all other health.\n  What I think we will find out that happens in those eight States is \nthat there is no increase in cost. There are a few studies that would \nlead me to believe that. They are going on around the country right \nnow. Nobody will argue that if you treat behavioral health like all \nother health, the overall societal cost is going to more than pay for \nwhatever you invest in treating that mental health issue. But I think \nwhat we are likely to find out, and what studies are beginning to \nprove, is that even with the health care space itself, if you treat \nbehavioral health like all other health, your overall health spending \ndoesn't increase. It decreases because the other issues are so much \neasier to deal with. If you are taking your medicine, if you are \nfeeling better about yourself, if you are eating better, if you are \nsleeping better, if you are seeing the doctor, suddenly the cost that \nwas being spent on your diabetes or the cost that was being spent to \ndeal with hypertension gets so much more manageable that your overall \ncost goes down.\n  What we think will happen is that the eight States that move in this \ndirection will never go back even though it is a 2-year pilot. We think \nall the facts are going to show that it should be a permanent \ncommitment. In fact, what happened was that we didn't have just 8 \nStates apply or 10 States apply or even the 20 States that the Senator \nfrom Michigan and I were told would be the maximum if we made this \nmandatory for the whole country from day one. We might have as many as \n20 States that would be willing to participate, but 24 States applied \nto come up with the framework to hope to be one of the 8 States. Those \n24 States have all been given a little planning money. They will have a \nfew more months to come up with a plan that says: Here is what we would \nlike to try to prove--that if you treat behavioral health like all \nother health, good things happen, and it is the right thing to do.\n  The more I talk about that and the more others talk about that, the \nmore I think we all wonder why would we even think we have to prove \nthis. But these pilot States are going to prove that. I am beginning to \nwonder why we don't figure out how to make all 24 States pilot States. \nA very small commitment leads to a very big result. What we would find \nout is that doing the right thing produces the right kind of results. \nIf half the States in the country not only went on this 2-year pilot \nprogram but find out that this is really what you need to do, half the \nStates in the country would permanently be on a program that for the \nfirst time begins to achieve the goals of the Community Mental Health \nAct.\n  There are great discussions going on in both the House and Senate \nabout how the Senate bill can focus on expanding some of the grant \nprograms that will encourage people to become behavioral health \nprofessionals. The House legislation talks about how we can get \nfamilies more involved so they are able to keep up with the family \nmember who has a behavioral health challenge. However, none of those \nthings actually matter very much if they don't have anywhere to go. We \ncan have all the mental health professionals we can imagine we would \nwant to have, but if there is no access point for mental health \ntreatment, it doesn't do any good to have all those mental health \nprofessionals.\n  What the Excellence in Mental Health Act does and will do is create \nan access point where everybody can go. Based largely on the community \nfederally qualified health center model, those expenses will be \nsubmitted to the person's insurance company or they may have some other \ncapacity to pay. Some individuals will have a copayment for every \nvisit, which is part of that system. They can use whatever government \nprogram they might apply for, and then the difference will be made up \nwhen they submit their legitimate expense, and those payments will be \ncarefully audited.\n  The goal of the federally qualified center is year after year to get \nthe money back that they have invested in treatment so that it then \nbecomes an access point for those people.\n  I wish to point out that the access point is what really matters here \nand is the underpinning for everything else. There is no reason to have \na big debate about how they share somebody's record with the people who \nare closest to them if they don't have anywhere to go and get that \nanalysis. There is no reason to think about how many mental health \nprofessionals we could use in the country if there is no facility for \npeople to go to so they can meet their mental health professional.\n  This is a real opportunity for us. Congress has agreed to do this. I \nwill be searching--and I hope my colleagues will join me in ways to \nsearch--to see what we can do to not only have an 8-State pilot program \nbut to see if we can expand it and have a 24-State pilot program, \nassuming that all 24 of those States come back with a credible plan on \nhow we can meet the goals of not just the Excellence in Mental Health \nAct but, frankly, the goals the country set for itself 50 years ago on \nthe last day of October in 1963.\n  We are still woefully short of meeting the potential we need to meet \nin order to bring people fully into society based on what happens if \nyou treat their behavioral health issue the same way you would treat \nevery other single health problem they may have. There is no reason not \nto do that. We have the capacity and ability to do that. We have the \nprogram Congress has agreed to, and suddenly the number of States that \nare taking this seriously exceeded everybody's estimation of States \nthat would want to be a part of this program.\n  I think one could argue that 50-plus years later, we may have finally \ncome to a moment when everybody is willing to talk about this issue and \ndo something about it. We shouldn't miss this moment. It is never too \nlate to do the right thing. We are not doing the right thing now. \nTreating behavioral health like all other health issues and fully \nutilizing the skills and potential of mental health caregivers by \ngiving them just a little more assistance than they currently have will \nenable those suffering from a behavioral health issue to become a full \npart of a functioning society.\n  I am proud that my State has always been forward-leaning on these \nissues, whether it is Mental Health First Aid or trying to involve \ndifferent kinds of care that work. I hope my State will be one of the \npilot States. Frankly, I would like to see every State do this that \nwants to do this and can put together a planning grant that shows they \nhave made the local investment that is necessary so they, too, can be a \npart of the program that is moving forward to improve behavioral health \nissues.\n  We still have one or two opportunities this year. We have the rest of \nthis Congress if we don't get it done this year, but let's not miss \nthis moment to improve mental health issues. We are already 50 years \nbehind. Let's not get any further behind when there is a chance to do \nthe right thing for the right reasons at the time we have to do it in.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8517-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8517-S8520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise again today to support Adam Szubin's \nnomination to serve as Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes at the Treasury Department, as well as to support several other \nnominees whose nominations have been pending before the Senate banking \ncommittee for many months--some for almost a full year--with no vote.\n  All of these nominees have had hearings. They have all completed a \nthorough committee vetting process and\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\nthey are ready to be approved. Yet the Senate banking committee is the \nonly committee in the Senate that has not yet held a single vote on any \nadministration nominee in this Congress--not one vote on any of the \nmore than a dozen nominees this Congress.\n  There are 13 nominees pending before the committee. Here we are in \nthe final month of the year, and Republicans still have not held a vote \non any of them.\n  This inaction stands in stark contrast to this committee's record on \nnominees over the past 15 years. When we look at this chart, we see for \nthe 107th, 108th, 109th, 110th, 111th, 112th, 113th, 114th--eight \nCongresses, 15 years--this Congress is only half completed--Republican \nPresidents during much of this time and Democratic Presidents during \nmuch of this time; a Republican majority in the banking committee \nduring some of this time and a Democratic majority in the banking \ncommittee during some of this time. Yet when we look at these numbers, \nwe see lots referred to committee, but when we look at the number of \napproved by committee for this Congress: zero. The number confirmed by \nthe Senate coming out of banking for these nominations: zero. The \nnumber returned to the President: zero. The number withdrawn: zero.\n  In other words, time after time, year after year, President after \nPresident, Senate majority after Senate majority, we have seen the \nSenate banking committee actually do its work, until the 114th \nCongress, 2015: nothing in terms of approval. In this Congress, the \ncommittee has failed to carry out its duty to consider and act upon the \nPresident's nominees.\n  Let me start with Mr. Szubin, who is currently serving in his \ncritical position in an acting capacity. Despite having bipartisan \nsupport--the Presiding Officer I know is also on the banking \ncommittee--his nomination has languished for 200 days because of \nRepublican obstruction.\n  This is a critical national security post that must be filled \npermanently. Mr. Szubin heads what is in effect Treasury's economic war \nroom, managing U.S. efforts to combat terrorist financing and fight \nfinancial crimes. He can do his job better if he is not acting but if \nhe is in fact the confirmed nominee of the President of the United \nStates. He is helping to lead the charge to choke off ISIL's funding \nsources. We are introducing legislation today, in part, answering the \nthreat of ISIL and the threat of terrorism and, in part, by coming up \nwith new ways to choke off funding for the terrorists. Nobody is in a \nbetter position in our government--nobody--than Mr. Szubin, and I want \nhim confirmed so he can do his job better. It would prevent developing \nadditional capacity to strike war targets around the world. He is \nworking to hold Iran--regardless of how one voted on the Iran nuclear \ndeal, he is going to hold Iran to its commitments under the nuclear \ndeal and lead a campaign against the full range of Iran's other \ndestructive activities.\n  Mr. Szubin has served in senior positions first in the Bush \nadministration and now in the Obama administration. I don't know if he \nis a Democrat or Republican. I don't really care. He is an acknowledged \nexpert in economic sanctions and counterterrorist financing. There is \nno question--no question--that he is qualified for this position. Over \nthe last 15 years he has distinguished himself as an aggressive \nenforcer of our Nation's sanctions laws against Russia, against Iran, \nagainst North Korea, and against money launderers, against terrorists, \nand against narcotraffickers. Given all the concerns surrounding \nterrorist financing--legitimate concerns that Senator Shelby has and \nthat I have and probably all other 98 Members of the Senate have--one \nwould think a nomination would be a priority. In the past, it has been.\n  Szubin's mentor, Bush Under Secretary Stuart Levey, was confirmed by \nthe Senate just 3 weeks after his nomination came to the banking \ncommittee. The Senate took just 2\\1/2\\ months to consider Mr. Szubin's \nimmediate predecessor.\n  Mr. Szubin has support across the political spectrum. Even many \ngroups opposed to the Iran nuclear deal support his nomination. The \nbanking committee chairman, Senator Shelby, my friend who is in the \nChamber, described Mr. Szubin as ``eminently qualified.'' He deserves \nthe strong backing of the Senate. Without it, his ability to operate \nhere and abroad is less than it should be.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive \nsession and the banking committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of PN371, the nomination of Adam J. Szubin to be Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes; that the Senate proceed \nto its consideration and vote without intervening action or debate; \nthat if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am frustrated that my colleagues have \nchosen to continue to object without giving a reason why we are not \ngoing to vote on this nomination; not talking about Mr. Szubin's lack \nof qualifications--because that just wouldn't be true--and not \nultimately helping us deal with terrorism around the world in this \ncritical national security nomination.\n  Let me turn to another key Treasury official who has been nominated \nto serve in a dual economic security and national security role, \nAdewale Adeyemo, to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for \nInternational Markets and Development. The person in this role is \nresponsible for key national security issues and recommendations made \nin the CFIUS process, which assesses the major national security \nimplications of large investments in the United States made by foreign \nfirms.\n  Like Mr. Szubin, Mr. Adeyemo has been waiting for months for the \nbanking committee to act on his nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nand the banking committee be discharged from further consideration of \nPN86, the nomination of Adewale Adeyemo to be Assistant Secretary for \nInternational Markets and Development; that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration and vote without intervening action or debate; that if \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am further frustrated because of a lack \nof information as to why we are not confirming this nominee. We have \nhad hearings and they have been vetted. There is no opposition to \nqualifications. There is no dispute over how important these positions \nare.\n  Let me turn to a nomination for another key economic security \nposition in the administration: Patricia Loui-Schmicker to serve on the \nBoard of Directors of the Export-Import Bank.\n  The Export-Import Bank has been around since the days of Roosevelt. \nThere were efforts by tea party Republicans to put the Export-Import \nBank out of business. They did, for a period of time, even though for \n75 years it has been reauthorized, kept in existence, helped our \ncountry, made a difference in creating jobs, helping big companies such \nas Boeing and GE and others, and helping all kinds of small companies. \nMany of the companies they have helped people haven't even heard of, \nthat are in Ohio and that are part of the economic supply chain, the \nsupply chain for these companies.\n  This week I was with a group of people who do this kind of work in \nOhio. They were just flabbergasted that because of intransigence on the \npart of\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\ntea party Republicans, we can't get them--we didn't authorize it for \nmonths and months, and now, when we finally did and it can operate, the \nEx-Im Bank can't operate because the Senate banking committee will not \ndo its job.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive \nsession and the banking committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of PN288, the nomination of Patricia Loui-Schmicker to be \na member of the Board of Directors for the Ex-Im Bank of the United \nStates; that the Senate proceed to its consideration and vote without \nintervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nomination; that any statements related to the nomination be \nprinted in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the objections from my Senate colleague, my \nfriend Senator Shelby, costs us American jobs. When you shut down the \nExport-Import Bank, it means that workers get laid off, it means that \ncompanies can't expand, it means companies can't do what they want.\n  So the first objection means our country is less safe, the second \nobjection causes us all kinds of problems with making sure our \ncompanies and national security is what it should be, and this third \nobjection costs us American jobs. None of these do I understand.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn to another Treasury Department nominee. \nAmias Gerety has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary for Financial \nInstitutions, Department of the Treasury. Mr. Gerety has played an \nimportant role since the beginning of the current administration, \nhelping our country recover from the worst financial crisis since the \nGreat Depression. He deserves the full backing of the banking \ncommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nand the banking committee be discharged from further consideration of \nPN208, the nomination of Amias Moore Gerety to be Treasury's Assistant \nSecretary for Financial Institutions; that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration and vote without intervening action or debate; that if \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will move on to another nomination.\n  This nomination is for the Federal Transit Administration. This \ndistinguished nominee, Therese McMillan, has been awaiting confirmation \nsince January of this year. She joined FTA as the Administrator in \n2009. She has been Acting Administrator for a year and a half.\n  Apparently the Republican majority doesn't want anybody in the Obama \nadministration because the President they don't much like has nominated \nthese people. It is pretty hard to understand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and the banking committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of PN41, the nomination of Therese McMillan to be \nAdministrator of the Federal Transit Administration; that the Senate \nproceed to its consideration and vote without intervening action or \ndebate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no \nfurther motions be in order to the nomination; that any statements \nrelated to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, a nominee to be inspector general of the \nFDIC, Jay Lerner, has been awaiting confirmation since January of this \nyear.\n  We know the Republican majority doesn't much like Obama nominees, \neven though President Obama is one of, I believe, two Democrats in the \nlast 150 years who has actually--correct me if I am wrong--won at least \n51 percent of the country's votes twice. Since the Civil War, the only \nother was Franklin Roosevelt, who won more than half of the popular \nvote four times in the country. I know some of my colleagues don't seem \nto want to recognize that he is the President of the United States and, \nas we have always done in this country, the President gets to nominate \npeople. If they are qualified, they should be confirmed. Even if there \nis disagreement on their qualifications, they should be voted on and \nvoted down. We are even asking you to do that if that is what you \nchoose to do. But, particularly since they don't much like the people \nthe President puts on the FDIC, maybe we need an inspector general who \ncan find out if they are doing things wrong. That is the whole point of \nthe inspector general--to root out corruption and other problems, such \nas incompetence, in an agency. That is what Jay Lerner would do as the \ninspector general of the FDIC.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and the banking committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of PN65, the nomination of Jay Neal Lerner to be \ninspector general of the FDIC; that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration and vote without intervening action or debate; that if \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I guess that is the conclusion of my \nefforts today. Senator Shelby can return to the Republican luncheon if \nhe would like or debate me a little bit on this, but I don't get this--\nfirst of all, in terms of our national security, the importance of Adam \nSzubin; in terms of honesty in government, the importance of Jay \nLerner; in terms of creation of jobs, the nominee to the Export-Import \nBank.\n  I will not belabor this process anymore. I will not raise nominees \nanymore for reasons of time. I think I have made my point, but \nespecially for critical national and economic security, the nominees on \nthis list should move forward.\n  I don't understand this. I haven't seen anything quite like this in \nthe Congress of the United States. I continue to press this case. I am \nwilling to talk one-on-one with Senator Shelby on this. He has been \nopen to that in the past. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nbipartisan approval of these national and economic security nominees \nwho will matter for the continued greatness of our great country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8520-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8520-S8521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this week the United Nations climate \nchange conference is continuing in Paris. I understand over the weekend \na number of Democrats went to Paris to watch a part of the discussion.\n  I have been talking to folks back home in Wyoming about this climate \nconference and what the Democrats are proposing, and I will tell you, \nthe people in Wyoming are not happy. They are not happy about President \nObama's plan to destroy American energy jobs and also to destroy the \ncommunities that depend on these jobs.\n  They are not happy about the President's plan to give away billions \nof U.S. taxpayer dollars to other countries. They are not happy about \nthe President's plan to ignore the will of the American people and to \nsign an expensive, destructive treaty on climate change in Paris. That \nis what they think the President is planning to do, and I believe they \nare exactly right.\n  Last Friday, the Foreign Relations subcommittee that I chair released \na new report called ``Senate Outlook on United States International \nStrategy on Climate Change in Paris 2015,'' a new report on President \nObama's plan to bypass Congress and transfer American taxpayer funds \noverseas. This report shows how President Obama is supporting an effort \nto bypass Congress and to sign a climate deal that gives money to \ndeveloping nations.\n  The subcommittee report found four things.\n  First, the report says that the President is making false promises to \nother countries about his ability to meet his own greenhouse gas \nreduction targets. President Obama has promised to cut back American \nenergy production dramatically. The administration is pushing \npowerplant regulations that will destroy jobs and make electricity more \nexpensive and less reliable. Bipartisan majorities in Congress, in the \nHouse and in the Senate, have rejected these regulations. President \nObama wants to use this international agreement to force new \nregulations on the American people.\n  This administration has been doing all that it can to cripple \nAmerican energy producers all across the country. It has piled new \nregulations on coal producers. It is blocking exports of American crude \noil and liquefied natural gas. It set emission standards that are \ndesigned to put powerplants out of business, and that is the second \nthing that the report found--that the President's unrealistic targets \nand timetables for reducing targeted emissions are threatening jobs and \nthreatening communities all across America.\n  The third main point in this report is that the President is forcing \nAmerican taxpayers to pay for it--to pay for our past economic \nsuccesses through his contributions to the so-called Green Climate \nFund. I did a townhall event the other day in Wyoming and asked what \nthey thought about the President's plan of using their taxpayer dollars \nin this way, and 94 percent of the people in the townhall said they \nopposed President Obama's plan to send their hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars to the United Nations climate slush fund.\n  President Obama doesn't care. He says he wants the money anyway. He \nknows American emissions have actually been declining over the last \ndecade. He knows we are not the biggest source of carbon dioxide in the \nworld. Far more emissions are coming from developing countries. We see \nit in China; we see it in India. Those countries say that if they are \ngoing to cut their emissions, if they are going to be part of President \nObama's plan, somebody else is going to have to pay up. They expect \ndeveloped countries such as the United States to foot the bill.\n  How much money do they want? What are we talking about? So far, \ndeveloping countries have said they want--the number is astonishing--at \nleast $5.4 trillion--not million, not billion, but trillion. That is \nwhat 73 developing countries are demanding over the next 15 years. It \ndoesn't even count another 90 developing countries that haven't made \ntheir demands public yet. The reality is a great deal of this money is \ngoing to end up lining the pockets of government officials in these \ndeveloping countries. The American people know it. They see through it, \neven though the Obama administration will not admit it.\n  That brings up the fourth thing that this report found. Our \nsubcommittee found that the President plans to reach a climate change \ndeal that ignores the American people and cuts them out of the process \nentirely. The American public doesn't want these policies. Congress has \npassed laws to change these policies. The Obama administration just \ngoes on and on and makes the rules that it wants anyway. This \nadministration refuses to have accountability to the American people.\n  What are we talking about with regard to the money? It is interesting \nbecause just today, this morning from Paris, there is a report from the \nNew York Times: ``U.S. Proposes Raising Spending on Climate-Change \nAdaptation.''\n  Here is the byline from France:\n\n       In an effort to help smooth the passage of a sweeping new \n     climate accord here this week, Secretary of State John Kerry \n     announced on Wednesday a proposal to double its grant-based \n     public finance for climate-change adaptation. . . . Mr. \n     Kerry's announcement came as the momentum toward a deal \n     appeared to have hit a momentary snag.\n\n  Why? Well, reading further: ``The issue of money has been a crucial \nsticking point in the talks, as developing countries demand that richer \ncountries open up their wallets. . . . ''\n  So John Kerry is there to open up the wallet of the American \ntaxpayers--because it is not his money--doubling what he is offering, \nto try to buy a solution that he wants to accomplish even though it is \ndirectly in opposition to the American public. This administration, \nPresident Obama and Secretary Kerry, are out of touch with the American \npeople, who reject this expensive and destructive energy and climate \npolicy.\n  The Obama administration is also out of touch with the rest of the \nworld. The Obama administration says that some parts of the agreement \nreached in Paris will be legally binding and other parts will not \nbecause, obviously, we are the Congress. We are the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people, and we have a say. So the \nPresident is saying that parts of the agreement are binding and parts \nare not. China says the whole thing is binding. The European Union says \nthe entire thing is binding. Who is right? President Obama or the rest \nof the world?\n  The Obama administration says it is going to give billions of our \ntaxpayer dollars to these countries, including to a lot of countries \nthat don't like us very much. That doesn't seem to matter to the \nPresident. The developing countries say they want trillions. John Kerry \nis in Paris today, doubling the amount of money, doubling to try to buy \nsupport for something the American people don't support.\n  It is interesting because, if you think back just a couple of months, \nPresident Obama was frantic--desperate--to get a deal with Iran over \nits nuclear programs because of his legacy. He signed a terrible deal--\nby all accounts, a terrible deal.\n  Now he is doing it again. He is once again frantic, once again \ndesperate, to get a climate deal in Paris. Why? Because of his so-\ncalled legacy. He is planning once again to sign a terrible deal, and \nhe has his Secretary of State, John Kerry, there giving the speeches \nand making promises that the American public will have to pay for if \nthey get their way.\n  Iran says it will play the Obama administration's game on emissions \nand reduce its carbon emissions as the President wants, but before it \ndoes, it expects the Obama administration to lift all of the remaining \nsanctions from the Iranian deal. It wants the United States and other \ncountries to give them $840 billion over the next 15 years. That is \nwhat is at stake, and those are the things the President continues to \ngive away as he surrenders our energy security, our energy reliability, \nour energy jobs--a surrender by the President.

Mr. President, today is International Anti-Corruption \nDay. As the United States works to support good governance and anti-\ncorruption efforts around the world, I wish to highlight one country, \nUkraine, where these efforts are vital to the future viability of that \nstate. The U.S. Congress has stood by the people of Ukraine since the \nMaidan demonstrations in November of 2013.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed two landmark pieces of \nlegislation that are now law. This sent a clear signal to Kiev, Moscow, \nand the capitals of Europe that the United States stands squarely for \nthe development, democratic aspirations, sovereignty, and territorial \nintegrity of Ukraine and its people.\n  However, Ukraine's political leadership must also continue to hold up \nits end of the bargain. Ukraine is a country that has been plagued for \nmany years by weak democratic institutions and rampant corruption. This \ninternal threat of corrupt institutions poses the greatest long-term \nthreat to Ukraine's future.\n  Ukraine's reformers have made some progress. Last year Ukraine \nratified an association agreement with the EU, which includes extensive \ncommitments to governance reforms. The Parliament adopted a broad \npackage of anti-corruption laws and established a set of institutions \nto fight corruption. The government made changes to the tax and budget \ncodes and is starting to clean up its banking system. The government \nhas also made reforms of the energy sector a top priority, adopting \nlegislation to harmonize its natural gas markets with the EU's and \nraising tariffs to incentivize more efficient energy usage.\n  Importantly, on Monday, November 30, a new special anti-corruption \nprosecutor was appointed with the backing of the civil society, which \nis a big step forward in the fight against corruption.\n  Despite progress on these fronts, much work remains, and the \npolitical commitment to combat corruption among Ukraine's leaders is \nuneven. I acknowledge the pressure faced by the government. We all want \nto support Ukraine's positive path, but the Ukrainian people need more \nconcrete anti-corruption results--not just legislation, not just \ncommissions, as important as these are, but actual results.\n  For example, there remain thousands of allegedly corrupt officials in \nthe judicial branch, where judges and prosecutors are susceptible to \nbribes. While corruption in Ukraine's legal system cannot be resolved \novernight, I urge Ukrainian officials to take measures that would \nremove these most egregious violators from the judicial branch and \nprosecutorial ranks and to retrain those who are not corrupt to build \nthe next generation of jurists.\n  The Government of Ukraine has taken positive steps in this regard, \nincluding the establishment of a constitutional commission tasked with \nrecalibrating the checks and balances between the judiciary and the \nrest of the government. In September, the commission submitted new \ndraft amendments to the Constitution on the justice system. However, \nconcerns remain regarding the independence and integrity of the \njudicial institutions, including the newly established institution, the \nHigh Council of Justice, or HCJ, which has been called the ``gatekeeper \nto the court system.''\n  It is critical that the civil society and watchdog organizations are \nempowered to continue their work of holding the HCJ and elected \nofficials accountable to ensure that any weakness in the checks and \nbalances of the judicial system are not exploited for personal gain.\n  I am also concerned about the process for vetting the current pool of \njudges. The Government of Ukraine is developing standards for judicial \nreappointment, which will be conducted by the HCJ. This process will \ntest the political will of both the Government of Ukraine and the HCJ \nitself. Unfortunately, initial results are not positive. As of June of \nthis year, the HCJ had received 2,200 complaints of judicial \nmisconduct. Of this number, only 47 judges were disciplined and none \nwere dismissed.\n  Ukrainian citizens expect a clean government that abides by the rule \nof law. In July, I wrote to President Poroshenko, urging him to make \nanti-corruption reforms a priority by considering the appointment of a \nspecial anti-corruption prosecutor and special anti-corruption courts. \nWhile the government recently selected a special anti-corruption \nprosecutor with the backing of the civil society, the government must \nnow ensure that this office remains free from state influence and \ninterference to fulfill its mandate to root out corruption within \nUkraine.\n  I commend President Poroshenko for listening to the demands of civil \nsociety and amending the composition of the selection committee to \ninclude two candidates backed by civil society, which led to the \nselection of Nazar Kholodnytskiy. This was a step in the right \ndirection. However, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine \nitself is still woefully understaffed, which impacts its ability to \nfulfill its mandate to prosecute corrupt acts. I call on the Government \nof Ukraine to ensure that the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of \nUkraine is fully staffed and prosecuting cases without delay.\n  Polls show that most Ukrainians confront petty corruption in their \ndaily lives, and our focus on corruption at the national level should \nnot diminish the importance of programming that addresses corruption at \nthe municipal and local levels. The Government of Ukraine must invest \nin training and education to identify and root out petty corruption in \nhigher education, health care, and law enforcement. A clear commitment \nto attacking corruption in health care, education, and law enforcement \nwithin a measurable framework will pay dividends for citizens across \nthe country and will help to restore faith in Ukraine's democratic \ninstitutions.\n  The United States is prepared to make a long-term commitment to \nUkraine and, along with our European partners, we can provide support \nto Ukraine's efforts to tackle corruption within the judiciary, the \ncivil service, and law enforcement while preparing these institutions \nto attract and retain talented individuals who are committed to \neradicating graft and entitlement.\n  I firmly believe that Ukraine could be a case study for how a country \nwith the political will can work with the international community to \nroot out pervasive corruption, but that political will must manifest \nitself concretely and soon. When you look at public opinion polls in \nUkraine, fighting corruption is the Ukrainian people's No. 1 demand. On \nthis International Anti-Corruption Day, I look forward to supporting \nUkraine's leaders if they are willing and committed to answering this \ndemand.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for such time as I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here today to speak a bit about \nBurundi--something the Presiding Officer is familiar with.\n  I had occasion to be in Burundi at their request some 16 years ago. \nAt that time, the President's name was Buyoya. He is not there anymore; \nthey have changed Presidents. There is something going on there on \nwhich I\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nthink the State Department has dropped the ball one more time in not \ninterpreting, not understanding what the people of a country want: \ntheir self-determination.\n  Despite its history of outside interference, civil wars, and social \nunrest, Burundi has emerged as a largely cohesive society, overcoming \nthe ethnic divisions that plagued it in the 20th century, back at the \ntime when I was first there.\n  On April 3, I led a congressional delegation of six Members to \nBurundi, where we visited with President Nkurunziza. President \nNkurunziza is in the middle of his second elected term in office. We \ntalked to members of the Parliament, had really intimate relations with \nthe members of the Parliament. We actually prayed together. We met \ntogether, and we got to know them quite well.\n  We saw continued growth as a democracy and signs of movement toward a \ndiversified economy under the leadership of President Nkurunziza. He \nannounced on April 25 that he would run for President again and was met \nby increased protests and criticism from the international community, \nprimarily led by us. Our State Department, the United Nations, and a \nfew other countries seem to think they know more about an independent \nnation than they know. So they were criticizing him for running for \noffice again.\n  Here is the problem: A provision in their Constitution says that no \none can run for the Presidency of Burundi more than two times. The \nproblem is that he was not elected the first time; he was appointed by \nParliament. So essentially, yes, he was elected once, but he hadn't \nbeen elected again until this recent election. But, again, why would we \neven want to get involved in it?\n  On May 4, Burundi's Constitutional Court ruled that President \nNkurunziza's first term did not count because he was picked by \nParliament rather than elected by the people. That was followed by a \nfailed coup, which took place right after that.\n  Leading up to the Presidential elections, the Peace and Security \nCouncil of the African Union urged ``all Burundian stakeholders to \nrespect the decision of the Constitutional Court, when delivered.'' So \nnow we have the African Union, we have the courts, and we have the \npeople in an election talking about the fact that, yes, he is qualified \nto run a third time--all except our government, which wants to impose \nits desires on another country.\n  On May 29, six of us were in Burundi. We voiced our support for the \ndecision of Burundi's Constitutional Court and called on the \ninternational community to support the court's ruling.\n  President Nkurunziza won his reelection for President on July 21; he \ngot 69 percent of the vote. Instead of working with Burundi and its \npeople, the international community has been denouncing the election \nand stepped up pressure on the newly elected government via sanctions \nand withdrawal of support. The United States suspended military \ntraining in July.\n  That is one of the things we do around the world that are really \nworking now--a train-and-equip program, going to the country and \nworking with them, helping to train those individuals. Of course, when \nthat happens, we have the allegiance of those countries. If we don't do \nit, we can be sure that China or somebody else is going to do it. It is \nsomething that works. We withdrew that training. We are creating \nvacuums that are going to be filled by people who might be prone toward \nterrorism.\n  We suspended the military training. We announced that Burundi will no \nlonger benefit from the trade preferences under the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act beginning in 2016 and sanctioned four individuals who \nhave contributed to the turmoil, including threats to peace, security \nactions that undermine democratic institutions, and human rights \nabuses.\n  I am concerned that the responses by the United States and the \ninternational community will do more harm than good in terms of finding \na resolution to the current political crisis. Young people are going to \nbe denied jobs. They are not going to have the economic opportunities \nto participate.\n  According to a New York Times article written on December 5, the \nviolence seems to have shifted from what appeared to be government-\nsponsored to rebel-sponsored. ``There have been more assassination \nattempts, more grenades tossed at government property and more random \nshootings . . . all thought to be the handiwork of the opposition.''\n  Yesterday, December 8, nearly 100 Burundian protesters who opposed \nPresident Nkurunziza during the months of violence in Bujumbura were \nreleased from prison.\n  We have to continue to support and stand with the people of Burundi \nand their growth as a democratic nation. The United States and \ninternational community should support and encourage a political \nresolution, not drive division and further unrest.\n  While the violence and the loss of life that has occurred in Burundi \ncan't be condoned, the situation could have been much worse if it were \nnot for the actions taken by President Nkurunziza, the opposition \nforces, and the people of Burundi.\n  I have been working to bring all parties together to resolve their \ndifferences and was encouraged by comments made at Burundi's National \nPrayer Breakfast by President Nkurunziza and the representatives of \ndifferent political parties about looking forward and not looking back. \nThere was tremendous applause.\n  These countries on the continent of Africa meet in small groups on a \nregular basis, in the Spirit of Jesus, actually, and they have the \nNational Prayer Breakfast now. Except for the outside interference, \npeace has been settling in and people are living with the decision they \nmade--of course, 69 percent of them having voted for this President.\n  I echo Uganda's President Museveni's--whom we are very close to--\nconfidence that a lasting solution to the conflict in Burundi will be \nfound. I encourage all sides to meet together in Kampala or have a \nmeeting there as soon as possible to begin resolving political \ndifferences. I consider President Museveni a friend. I believe he is \nthe leader who can facilitate efforts to find a lasting solution to the \npolitical situation in Burundi. The way forward begins first with \nputting the elections behind us and acknowledging that Pierre \nNkurunziza is the President of Burundi; second, an immediate agreement \nby all sides to work together to end the violence and to provide the \ntime needed to resolve differences in Kampala, and this also includes \nthe international community, which I charge to take positive actions to \nhelp enhance peace versus merely demanding it through punishment; and \nfinally, beginning all-inclusive meetings in Kampala under the \nleadership of President Museveni from Uganda.\n  I understand the fears that Burundi may regress toward ethnic \nviolence, but I do not agree that it is a likely outcome of the current \nsituation. We are going have to work on Burundi and not isolate it and \nits people. Only by working together to maintain stability and calm can \nwe avoid widespread bloodshed, and the harshest critics are predicting \nthat will come true.\n\n  I know there are some good people there, but I have intimate \nrelations with the leadership in many of the countries. I see what we \nare doing that is wrong. I remember that the same group of people--the \nUnited Nations, the State Department, and France--got involved in Cote \nd'Ivoire when President Gbagbo had won a legitimate election. It was \nrigged by someone who wasn't even from Cote d'Ivoire.\n  I have been making several critical speeches on our involvement. It \nseems like we seem to want to impose our ideas on other countries when \nit is not to their best interest. I want everyone to be aware that this \nis a problem that is real.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8522-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8522-S8523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I just found out that supposedly the big \nparty that is taking place in Paris--it is interesting. For those \npeople who are not familiar with this issue, the United Nations puts on \na big party every year. This is the 21st year that they have done this. \nIt goes back to the Kyoto treaty and to the fact that through the \nUnited Nations they have been trying to develop some type of a thing \nwhere global warming is coming and it is going to be the end of the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\n  I remember way back when I was chairing a subcommittee that had \njurisdiction over this type of an area, back when this first started. \nWe might remember when Al Gore came back, and they had developed this \nthing called the Kyoto treaty. They signed it on behalf of the United \nStates, but they never submitted it to be confirmed by the Senate. \nObviously, that is something that has to happen. They now are going to \ngo in there to do a climate agreement. It was a real shocker on \nNovember 11 when the Secretary of State John Kerry made a public \nstatement that the United States would not be a part of anything that \nis binding on the United States. The President of France didn't know \nthat. He went into shock. He said that the Secretary must have been \nconfused. They had to reconcile themselves at that time. That was 2 \nweeks before people arrived for the big party in Paris. They decided \nthat we will put together something where we can have an understanding \nof what we want to do in the future--nothing binding.\n  The reason I am mentioning this now is that this afternoon there is \nsupposed to be a plan that is going to be unveiled that is going to \nreflect what they want everybody to do with this. I want to keep one \nthing in mind. The last event I went to was in Copenhagen. They are \ndesigned to try to get 192 countries to agree that the world is coming \nto an end and that we are going to have to do something about cap and \ntrade to stop the global warming. This has been going on for a long \ntime. There are significant problems that remain. The negotiators can't \nagree on whether it is binding or what part of the agreement might be \nbinding and still comply with our laws and constitutional restrictions. \nThey can't agree on financing.\n  This morning, in order to entice the developing countries, Secretary \nKerry, on behalf of the President, announced that the United States \nwould contribute another $800 million a year to help developing \ncountries adapt to the effects of climate change. Let's keep in mind \nthat this is in addition to the $3 billion that the President expects \nCongress to appropriate to this cause.\n  Yesterday, in Paris, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy again \nmisrepresented to the international community the EPA's authority and \nconfidence in the U.S. commitments. The highlight of her remarks was \nher claim that ``the Clean Power Plan will stick and is here to stay.'' \nWhen attending international delegates asked questions about their \nlegal vulnerability and the possibility of the future administration \nchanging anything that is adopted by this administration, she \nreportedly walked around the question and many in the audience were \nupset that she wouldn't answer the question. The reason she wouldn't is \nbecause there is no answer to it.\n  I chair the committee called the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We have the jurisdiction over these things. When the \nPresident came out with the Clean Power Plan, we said: All right, you \nare saying that you are committing the United States to a 28-percent \nreduction in CO2 emissions by 2025. How are you going to get \nthere?\n  They wouldn't say. No one to this day has talked about how they are \ngoing to do it. He said: Let's have a hearing.\n  We are the committee of jurisdiction. I don't recall any time when a \nbureaucracy that is in a committee's jurisdiction refused to testify, \nbut they did refuse to testify. I think we all know why. We know there \nis no way of coming up with that type of a commitment. If you have all \nthese costs and what it is going to cost us, does it address climate \nchange? The Clean Power Plan will have no impact on the environment. It \nwould reduce CO2 emissions by less than 0.2 percent. It \nwould reduce the rise of global temperature by less than one one-\nhundredth of a degree Fahrenheit, and it would reduce the sea level \nrise by the thickness of two sheets of paper. In fact, the EPA has \ntestified before the environment committee that the Clean Power Plan is \nmore about sending a signal that we are serious about addressing \nclimate change than it is about clearing up pollution. The Justice \nDepartment requested that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals not rule on \nthe Clean Power Plan, the principal domestic policy which supports our \ncommitments to the climate conference, until after the conference \nconcludes.\n  What they did was they went to the courts, knowing that the courts \nwere going to be acting on this power plan and probably acting against \nit, and they didn't want that to happen before the party in France. I \nthink it is the biggest signal to the international community that the \nadministration lacks the confidence in their own rules.\n  Administrator McCarthy also claimed that the next administration \ncannot simply undo the Clean Power Plan because of the extensive \ncomment period supporting the rule. The international community is not \nfooled by this either. Congress disagrees. Not only can Congress \nwithhold funding from any element of an agreement that the \nadministration refuses to send to Congress for approval, but the \nCongress has explicitly rejected the Clean Power Plan in the bipartisan \nCongressional Review Act, saying that we do not agree with this and we \nwant to do away with this Clean Power Plan before it is finalized.\n  That should be the signal to the people who are at the party in \nParis. I think that a lot of them do understand that. Even President \nObama is now conceding that specific targets each country is setting to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions may not have the force of treaties. He \nis hoping that 5 years or some type of periodic reviews of those \ncountries would be in the form of a binding commitment. But even if \nthat is the case, that would merely be a review. Although the European \nUnion and 107 developing countries are hoping for a legally binding \nlong-term deal with review mechanisms and billions of dollars, any \ntruly binding agreement must be sent to the Senate for approval.\n  Back when they first went down on the Kyoto treaty, we had the Byrd-\nHagel rule. The Byrd-Hagel rule says that we are not going to ratify \nany treaty if it either is bad on our economy or it doesn't apply to \ncountries such as China. So they have to do the same thing that we are \ndoing. That passed 95 to 0. That was way back at the turn of the \ncentury.\n  Everyone knows that he can't unilaterally do these things, even \nthough he tries. In 1992, when the Senate approved President H.W. \nBush's agreement to have the United States participate in the \nconference of parties--that is the one that is going on right now, the \n21st one--the process, any emissions, targets or requirements were \ngoing to have to be approved by the Senate. This is the President who \nwas in charge at that time, George H.W. Bush. That was the agreement in \n1992, and that agreement hasn't changed. Legally binding agreements \nmust go before the Senate for consideration, and there is no way around \nit.\n  This is the message I conveyed when I attended the COP convention in \n2009 in Copenhagen, and nothing has changed since that time. Nothing is \nhappening over there now. They are having a good time. I am sure there \nare lots to drink and lots to eat, but that party will be over.\n  Let me share one experience I had. I have been very active in Africa \nfor a number of years. There is an officeholder in the tiny country in \nWest Africa of Benin. I saw him at the convention that was in \nCopenhagen.\n  I said: What are you doing here? You don't believe all this stuff.\n  He said: No, but they are passing out hundreds of billions of \ndollars, and we want to get some of ours. Besides that, this is the \nbiggest party of the year.\n  Enjoy your party over there. Nothing is going to happen. Nothing \nbinding is going to take place on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8523-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8523-S8525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS BILL\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to congratulate \nmy colleagues on passage of the repeal and replacement of No Child Left \nBehind, the Every Child Succeeds Act. In particular, I want to thank \nChairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray. It is really an example \nof how things can work in the Senate when we put our minds to trying to \nget to good policy instead of simply trying to get to good politics. \nThere is a lot of politics surrounding early childhood education and \nelementary education.\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nThere is a lot of hyperbole out there about the role the Federal \nGovernment should play in local education--issues such as the common \ncore. Yet we were able to set aside all of those potentially \ninflammatory and toxic politics and get to a bill that despite those \nchallenges has broad consensus from Republicans and Democrats. It ends \nup in a place that is really going to support a lot of teachers, \nstudents, parents and administrators out there.\n  When you look at that vote tally, it is impressive. It is a piece of \nlegislation that has been able to unite progressive Democrats and \nconservative Republicans. In many ways it is a credit in this Chamber \nto debate that Senator Alexander and Senator Murray set us upon. They \nwere determined to get to a product that both parties could support. \nWhen you start with the idea that we can achieve a bipartisan solution, \nrather than your starting point being having a debate in order to \nmaximize political impact and political division, it is miraculous what \nwe get. We can all be blamed for falling into that trap far too often.\n  Mr. President, like you, my entire life has been spent in and around \npublic education. I went to Connecticut's public schools. My mother was \na public school teacher. My wife is a former public school teacher. I \nhave two beautiful boys--one of whom is in the public school system as \nwell. As it is for many of us, this conversation is deeply personal. It \nis also deeply personal for me as someone who is going to raise two \nboys in a country whose greatness depends more than ever on the quality \nof our public schools. The reality is that when my great-grandfather \ngot off of a boat and showed up in New Britain, CT, he was guaranteed \nto get a good job in one of the ball bearing factories there, \nregardless of his education. He could get a good wage, a pension, and a \ndecent health care benefit without a lot of skills that he couldn't \nlearn on the job inside that factory.\n  Of course, our economy has radically changed since those days. We are \nlucky that we have declining unemployment. We are lucky we continue to \ngrow jobs, as we have over the course of the last several years. They \nare totally different kinds of jobs than were available to my \nforefathers, immigrants who came to this country from places such as \nIreland and Poland and worked in those factories. We now have jobs that \nrequire highly skilled professionals. We are competitive globally, not \nbecause of the price of our workforce but because of the productivity, \ncompetence, and educational level of our workforce. We are more \ndependent now than ever on the quality and capacity of our workforce, \nwhich is, of course, dictated by the quality and capacity of our \neducational system. So getting an education policy right is not just \nabout serving kids; it is about serving our economy.\n\n  The fact is, we have been doing a disservice to students and teachers \nall across America since the passage of No Child Left Behind. This is a \nlaw that by and large was a disaster for us in Connecticut. I am \nsomebody who believes that a strong Federal Government can play a \nbeneficial role in people's lives, whether it is smoothing out the \nrough edges of the financial system, building roads and bridges, or \nprotecting America from attacks, but the Federal Government has not \ndone a good job in guaranteeing universal, quality education. Why? \nBecause bureaucrats in Washington ultimately have a hard time \nintersecting with the provision of a service which has largely been \nadministered at a local level. The prescriptive rules that were \ninherent in No Child Left Behind haven't matched the realities of how \nConnecticut assesses schools and student performance or how we think it \nis best to turn schools around.\n  No Child Left Behind did at least have one redeeming quality. The \nlegislation required an assessment of every single student no matter \nwhere they lived, what their background was, or what their learning \nability was. The law did shed light on some unjustifiable, \nunconscionable disparities that existed in this country, and it put \npressure on school districts and States to address those disparities. \nThe law brought attention to the fact that there were disparities, such \nas the fact that the graduation rate for African Americans in this \ncountry is 16 points lower than that of their white peers. The results \nshowed disparities with Latino fourth graders. Only 25 percent of them \nare meeting expectations for their grade level in math, which is half \nthe rate of their white peers.\n  The law also shed light on the practices within school districts, \nsuch as school discipline. If you are an African American and commit \nthe exact same offense in this country inside of a school, you are \ntwice as likely to get suspended or expelled as your white peer.\n  No Child Left Behind forced us to understand, recognize, and address \nthose disparities. The challenge with this repeal and rewrite was to \nhand control back to States and local districts without removing the \nimperative to identify those disparities and cure them.\n  I voted against the version of this bill that was originally passed \nby the U.S. Senate, and I did so because I labored under the belief, as \na member of the HELP Committee, that it is not worth passing a national \neducation law if it isn't also a civil rights law. I wasn't convinced \nthat we had that balance in the bill that initially came before the \nSenate. I am grateful to Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, \nRepresentatives Kline, Scott, and others who managed to get that \nbalance right in the conference committee.\n  Today we were able to pass a bill that is both a proper return of \nauthority to the States and a preservation of civil rights protections \nthat are going to guarantee the perpetuity of the small, positive \nlegacies of No Child Left Behind.\n  What we have in the bill is a recognition that school systems should \nidentify the 5 percent of schools that are the lowest performing \nschools and have specific plans to attack those schools and turn them \naround. Those interventions will be decided at the local and State \nlevel rather than at the Federal level.\n  There is a requirement in this bill to identify what we call dropout \nfactories--schools in which a disproportionate number of students show \nup freshman year but don't graduate. Similarly, States have to have a \nplan to turn those schools around, dictated by decisions that are made \nat the local level.\n  Lastly, this bill contains a provision that requires us to continue \nto track the performance of certain subsets of students, whether they \nare minority students, disabled students, poor students, or non-English \nspeaking students. Again, it requires those vulnerable populations that \nmay not be hitting the goals that are set by the State or school \ndistrict to have interventions to try to do better. All of the \naccountability will occur locally, but the mandate is to pay attention \nto those lower performing schools or those populations that sometimes \nget the short end of the stick within a school system or State \neducational system and ensure that they get special attention.\n  I think this is the right balance. This is a bill that rightfully \nreturns power to States and school districts but retains civil rights \nprotections that have been the foundation of our Federal education \npolicy since the 1950s and 1960s.\n  I am also happy that there were a number of other civil rights wins \nin this bill. States have to note on their report cards indicators of \nschool climate and safety. They have to disclose rates of suspension \nand expulsion, school-based arrests, and referrals to law enforcement \nso we can get a better handle on whether minority students are being \ntreated fairly when it comes school discipline policies.\n  States have to submit plans on how they will reduce the use of \ndiscipline practices that threaten student safety, including seclusion \nand restraint. Increasingly, school districts are relying on the \nrestraint of kids by binding their hands and feet or the seclusion of \nchildren by locking them in padded rooms as a means of discipline. In \nalmost all cases, those means of discipline make the underlying \nbehavior worse, not better. They disproportionately affect disabled \nkids and children with autism whose school districts unfortunately \ndon't understand their students' issues as well as they should. This \nlegislation will require States to submit plans as to how they will \nreduce the use of seclusion and restraint.\n  Finally, this bill retains the requirement that every kid, regardless \nof learning ability, should be expected to\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nmeet the same standard. This bill still allows for 1 percent of \nstudents to take an alternate assessment, but it requires the majority \nof special education students, or students with learning disabilities, \nto be tested against their nondisabled peers. They will have to compete \nagainst their nondisabled peers in the workforce, so they should be \nmeasured against their nondisabled peers while they are in the school \nsystem. Those are all important wins as well.\n  In the end, as someone who was educated in the public school system \nand spent his lifetime around teachers, I know that No Child Left \nBehind not only sucked the effectiveness out of schools, but it also \nsucked the joy out of learning and teaching because so much of it was \ndriven toward that test which became the only measurement of what a \ngood school is.\n  I am a parent who is deeply involved in looking at schools and \ndeciding which one is right for my kid. While I pay attention to the \ntest scores that come out of that school, that is not the beginning and \nend of my analysis. I take careful pains to meet with the \nadministrators, talk to other parents, look at their curriculum, and \nlook at other measurements, such as attendance and graduation rates, in \norder to build a full picture of what a good school is.\n  Now States will be able to devise systems of measuring schools that \nmirror the way almost every responsible parent measures schools--in a \ncomprehensive, robust way that doesn't just look at that test. Perhaps \nmore importantly, as we try to grow a healthy economy that recognizes \nthe strengths we have and the quality of our workforce under this new \nlaw, the Every Child Succeeds Act, we will be able to create a new \ngeneration that will have great innovators, great leaders, great mold \nbreakers, and not just great test takers.\n  Congratulations to Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, and many \nothers, like Senator Booker and Senator Warren, who worked closely with \nme on the accountability provisions.\n  This is a really important day for teachers, students, and parents \nall across the country. It is also a pretty good day for us when we get \nto come together and do something very important in a bipartisan pay \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \na measure that has moved through the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. This legislation is a pretty significant bipartisan \naccomplishment and I would like to share our progress with my \ncolleagues.\n  On November 19, our committee reported S. 556. We refer to it as the \nSportsmen's Act. This is a measure I have been working on, and we were \nable to report it out by voice vote. This is a bill that would benefit \nmillions of sportsmen and sportswomen all across our country. It \nincludes some key items within our jurisdiction that are part of a \nbroader Sportsmen's package. That portion is being worked on by another \ncommittee. I have been working on our iteration of this bill with \nSenator Heinrich of New Mexico, and I truly appreciate his leadership, \nhis support, and his guidance on this measure.\n  As many Members in this Chamber are aware, the broader Sportsmen's \nbill has had a long history of bipartisan support in the Senate, but \nyear after year it has failed to advance for a host of different \nreasons. It has been the victim of political brinkmanship in what for \nyears was a Chamber that wasn't working, but I think this year is \ndifferent. I outlined some of the successes yesterday when I came to \nspeak on the floor and I think we are getting back to regular order. \nThe committees are working hard--certainly the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee is working hard--and we are working to advance \nlegislation to go to the floor, whether it is this Sportsmen's bill or \nwhether it is our Energy Policy Modernization Act that we reported out \nof the committee on an 18-to-4 margin back in July.\n  Our Sportsmen's Act is the latest example of a bipartisan bill that \nencompasses both good policy and good process. I think both of those \nare key. Staff from both sides of our committee--and the Sportsmen's \nCaucus, which is led by Senator Risch and Senator Manchin, worked \ndiligently with outside stakeholders to improve and refine the bill. So \nI want to briefly summarize some of the contents found within the \nSportsmen's Act.\n  First, we included a congressional declaration of national policy to \nrequire all Federal agencies and departments to facilitate the \nexpansion and the enhancement of hunting, fishing, and recreational \nshooting on Federal lands. This is our clear goal. It is a pretty clear \nand explicit direction for the executive branch.\n  The next component within the bill--and this is the heart of the \nbill--is a provision we are referring to as ``open unless closed.'' \nThrough these, we are setting a new national standard, and that \nstandard is that our Federal lands will be open unless they are closed. \nThey are going to be open unless they are closed, not closed due to \nbureaucratic inertia. What we are trying to do is pretty simple. We are \ntrying to allow all Americans to be able to access and enjoy their \npublic lands. Under our bill, if Federal lands are going to be closed \neven temporarily, agencies will have to notify the public and provide \nopportunities for meaningful public comment. The agencies, whether they \nare the BLM or the Forest Service, will need to justify any proposed \nclosures and address issues that have been raised by the public.\n  Our bill will also prevent temporary closures from becoming permanent \nby limiting any of these designations to just 180 days. Currently the \nBLM can close lands for 2 years and does not guarantee the opportunity \nfor any public comment. BLM has acknowledged to us that they regularly \nimplement what they call temporary closures while they prepare the \npaperwork to make them permanent. My Sportsmen's Act will allow BLM and \nthe Forest Service to renew temporary closures, but they can only do it \nup to three times. Each and every time they do so, we are going to \nrequire them to engage in a public comment and notification process. \nWhat this ``open unless closed'' policy does is it reverses the \npractice of public lands being closed until opened or closed \naltogether. As a result of it, our sportsmen and sportswomen will have \nincreased access to our public lands, they will have a real voice in \ndecisions regarding any temporary closure, and they will also receive \njustifications for any temporary closures that are deemed necessary. So \nwe are providing a more fulsome public process but also a more genuine \nopportunity for access to our public lands.\n  My Sportsmen's bill also addresses concerns raised about the \nunnecessary difficulty of securing permission for commercial filming on \nour public lands. Among other steps in the bill, we require the \npublication of a single joint land use fee schedule within 180 days, \nbut we also say there are small crews that shouldn't have to go through \nthis big rigmarole and pay this big fee. So small film crews of three \nor fewer people will be exempt from having to pay a fee.\n  I have heard a lot of stories about the horrors some of our \noutfitters or guides have experienced while they were trying to film \nsome kind of promo-type material on a trip. Agencies are making them \njump through hoops by telling them that they need a separate permit and \nhave to pay additional fees. It gets to the point where you can't take \na video or a picture on our public lands. That is just wrong. These \nfolks already have a permit to be out there, and filming may be \nincidental to that.\n\n  In this bill we ensure that small crews and businesses can film on \npublic lands without having to pay to do it. That seems pretty \nreasonable and fair to me. We also protect First Amendment rights by \npreventing content from becoming a factor in issuing permits, and we \nprotect free speech by clarifying that journalism is not commercial \nactivity.\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\n  Some might say: What is this issue all about? Think about it. If you \nhave an agency that doesn't want to have filming or pictures in a \ncertain part of a wilderness area or certain part of public land \nbecause a different story might be told that doesn't fit with the \nagency's view, that is not right. This bill will ensure that we are not \ngoing to regulate content in terms of whether or not a permit is \nissued.\n  I will give a specific example of why this is needed. Back in 2014, a \nproducer for Oregon Public Broadcasting wanted to film a piece in the \nWillamette National Forest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the \nWilderness Act. To ensure that the piece had the ``primary purpose of \ndissemination of information about the use and enjoyment of \nwilderness,'' officials from the Forest Service asked to review the \nscript. They wanted to look at the script before issuing a permit. That \nwas not right. I believe giving Federal officials veto power over \ncontent can have a very chilling effect on journalism.\n  The final title of the Sportsmen's Act--this is a new title we came \nup with in committee--provides for reforms in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--LWCF. The reforms in the bill do not go as far as I \nwould like to see them go, but they do reflect what our committee could \nagree on.\n  We also agreed to reauthorize the Historic Preservation Fund and to \ncreate a fund to address the maintenance backlog at the National Park \nService. This is the same language we included in the broad, bipartisan \nEnergy bill back in July--the same language now incorporated as part of \nthe sportsmen's bill.\n  As I said before, my own proposal to reauthorize LWCF would look \ndifferent from what our committee reported. When LWCF was created \ndecades ago, monies were to be allocated each year so that Federal \nagencies would receive no less than 40 percent. States were to receive \n60 percent. But what has happened in the ensuing years is that now \nnearly 85 percent of LWCF dollars have gone to Federal land \nacquisition, and we are not seeing the original congressional intent \nbeing met. Again, keep in mind that when LWCF was first created, it was \ngoing to be so that Federal agencies would get about 40 percent and \nStates would get about 60 percent. We have now turned that on its head.\n  What our LWCF title does is recognize that States are leaders on \nrecreation and conservation. Our reforms are trying to restore balance \nto the State-Federal split by ensuring that at least 40 percent of LWCF \ndollars are allocated to States for the State-based programs, including \nthe traditional stateside program. This is an improvement, in my mind, \nbut doesn't go far enough to restore the original congressional intent.\n  The title also recognizes the importance of accessing existing \nFederal lands and sets aside the greater of 1.5 percent or $10 million \nper year to improve access for sportsmen. This is an important \nprovision for our sports men and women.\n  Like many western Members, I remain concerned about Federal \nacquisition. In Alaska, close to 63 percent of our lands are already \ncontrolled by the Federal Government. To begin to address the issue, \nthe LWCF title also emphasizes conservation easements. This will keep \nlands in private ownership as working lands and will require agencies \nto take into account certain considerations when acquiring lands, \nincluding whether the acquisition would result in management \nefficiencies and cost savings.\n  To prioritize the backlog of deferred maintenance needs, this title \nestablishes a National Park Service Maintenance and Revitalization \nConservation Fund. This fund will help shift our focus to a more \nappropriate place, which is taking care of the lands we already have \nrather than an endless acquisition of new acreage.\n  Our country is fortunate to have an abundance of lands that are \ndesignated for recreation, conservation, and preservation. It is time \nwe reached a consensus on how to care for and how to manage them. I \nbelieve we can do that best by allocating more than 40 percent of the \nLWCF to State-based programs.\n  People on the ground, who see what is happening day in and day out, \nprovide the greatest insight into management, and we should recognize \nthat. We should pair increased funding for State-based programs with \nincreased authority for States to manage public lands. And we should \nconsider giving Governors a say on Federal land acquisitions. After \nall, these are their States we are talking about--and opportunities for \nall sorts of activities on their land--are often affected by these \ndecisions.\n  The LWCF reforms in the sportsmen's bill are a step in the right \ndirection. I believe they provide a greater framework for further \ndiscussion. If we work hard and work together, we can agree on \nadditional reforms to make LWCF even more effective in the years to \ncome.\n  Those of us on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have now \ncompleted our work on the Sportsmen's Act, and that brings us to the \nnext step, which will be taken by our friends on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. They are now considering a separate bill, S. \n659, with provisions that are jurisdictional to them. I think it is \nfair to say that EPW's portion of the sportsmen's bill is also quite \nvital.\n  As I wrap up, there is one provision I would like to call attention \nto briefly, and that is the reauthorization of the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act. The NAWCA program helps conserve waterfowl, \nfish, and wildlife through partnerships involving governments, \nnonprofits, and community groups. In Alaska, we are not in any danger \nof running out of wetlands and this program has funded a lot of good \nwetlands projects in my State. For example, on the Kenai Peninsula, \npartners in the private sector provided $1.6 million to match and \nexceed an $800,000 grant provided through NAWCA. Those funds were then \nused to implement habitat protection for over 300 acres of land along \nthe Kenai River.\n  I think it is important that we reauthorize this program and provide \nfunding to it so we can see important work like this continue, \nparticularly in States that have fewer wetlands and thus have greater \nneed for conservation.\n  NAWCA is just one of the provisions the EPW Committee can and \nhopefully will report in the future. Once their work is complete, all \nwho support America's sportsmen and sportswomen and all of us here in \nthe Senate who are sports men and women ourselves, should look forward \nto considering the full Sportsmen's Act here on the floor next year.\n  I am pleased that we are on a better track for this legislation in \nthe 114th Congress. I again thank the many Members who have worked with \nus to get S. 556 to where it is today. As a result of this good work, \nmillions of hunters, fishermen, recreational shooters, and other \noutdoor enthusiasts will soon have greater access and greater \nopportunities on our public lands and Federal lands, and I think that \nis something we should all be proud to support.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague from New Jersey is here. I \nthink my time has expired. I do have a further statement about a truly \nmighty Alaskan leader who has been known throughout the education \ncommunity in the State of Alaska who passed just yesterday at the age \nof 100. The death of Sidney Huntington in Galena, AK, is news that has \nbrought great sadness to us all.\n  In deference to my colleague from New Jersey and in recognizing his \ntime, I would like to come back to the floor later this afternoon and \nprovide tribute to a great man who provided so much in terms of \nleadership and direction to so many, whether they be Alaskan Native \nchildren in the small, remote, rural communities or in our urban \ncenters. It is fair to say that as of yesterday, we have lost a great \nAlaskan, and our hearts go out to him and his family. I look forward to \ncoming back to the floor later to provide greater tribute to the great \nSidney Huntington.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8526-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8526-S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ZADROGA BILL FUNDING\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as we are all awaiting those who are \nnegotiating a multibillion-dollar omnibus package and tax extender \npackage, I wanted to come to the floor at this time of the year, as we \napproach the\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nholidays, and say that it would be unconscionable that we would go home \nto celebrate with our families without doing everything we can to make \nsure we send a clear and unambiguous message to our first responders--\nin the name of Jim Zadroga from New Jersey, for whom the 9/11 bill, the \nZadroga bill, is named, and all those who responded on that fateful \nday--that we will never forget what they did for our fellow citizens, \nfor this Nation on September 11, the day that changed the world.\n  We shouldn't have had to wait this long for the law to expire. At the \nsame time, we are being told that we can't pass the legislation because \nwe have to offset it. Yet we are talking about passing an $800 billion \ntax package, much of which goes to large corporations. I haven't heard \nany of my colleagues speak about the need to pay for this nearly \ntrillion-dollar package which will deprive the Federal Treasury of \nanywhere between $800 billion and $1 trillion. Only the men and women \nwho put their lives on the line on September 11 and the days that \nfollowed are waiting for Congress to act because we supposedly have to \npay for the way in which we take care of their health care or the way \nin which we take care of the families, for those who lose a loved one \nas a result of the toxins and other circumstances that have led to \ntheir illnesses, that have led to their deaths. And unfortunately, we \nhave seen a rising number of those individuals who responded on that \nfateful day who have died, including one very recently.\n  I don't understand how the rules don't apply to large corporations \nthat will reap billions of dollars, but somehow those rules are \nasserted when we are trying to take care of the men and women who \nresponded on that fateful day of September 11. I don't understand how \nthere is any moral equivalency between them. There is none, and no one \ncan claim there is any.\n  None of us can leave Washington for the holidays without passing this \nbill.\n  I would remind my colleagues of the immortal words of Charles Dickens \nin ``A Christmas Carol'':\n\n       I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come \n     round as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant \n     time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the \n     year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their \n     shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as \n     if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not \n     another race of creatures bound on their journeys.\n\n  We should keep those words in mind as we approach the holidays. \nBeyond that, this isn't about the holiday spirit, it is about \nobligation. We should accept our profound, collective responsibility--\nnot charity but responsibility--to act on this legislation. If we do \nnot, and if we continue to insist on pay-for provisions when we don't \ninsist on the same provisions that would provide benefits to America's \nlargest corporations to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, we \nshould be ashamed of ourselves.\n\n  I don't know which one of my colleagues can go to a September 11 \ncommemoration and look those first responders in the eye. I don't know \nhow you do that. The reauthorization bill I have cosponsored is \nnecessary to provide the security and reassurances to those first \nresponders that these critical programs will last longer than just what \nthe next couple of months' funding will provide. It also permanently \nlists the statute of limitations on the Victim Compensation Fund to \nprovide for those first responders and their families who need access \nbeyond next year and, very importantly, it exempts these key programs \nfrom the budget sequestration cuts. The sequestration, which I voted \nagainst, imposes arbitrary and capricious cuts to funding that will \ncontinue to provide care and support for those September 11 heroes who \nsacrificed everything to help those in need on that tragic day.\n  The fact is, Congress must act. I don't think we should wait for a \npublic outcry before we ensure that these heroes receive the care and \nsupport they deserve. I don't think we should wait for a future tragedy \nto observe what we should have done. The brave men and women who rushed \ninto the towers to save others did not wait or hesitate to respond. \nThey did not think about themselves. They did not think about the risk. \nThey valiantly responded, and we--we--should not hesitate or wait to \nrespond to their needs. To do so would be absolutely shameful.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SIDNEY CHARLES HUNTINGTON\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon to pay \ntribute to an amazing Alaskan, a man who lived a life that many would \nsay was remarkable. Yet I think in his humble words he would respond \nthat he just lived his life and did the best he could.\n  Dr. Sidney Charles Huntington was truly a great Alaskan. He died \nyesterday at the age of 100 years old in Galena, AK, which is on the \nYukon River.\n  Sidney Huntington was a respected Athabascan elder. He was a culture \nbearer. He was a role model--definitely a role model. He was a mentor \nto so many, not only in his village but in his region and in his State. \nHe was a prolific storyteller. He was a philosopher. He had words of \nwisdom. He was a reservoir of traditional knowledge. He was an \noutdoorsman who knew, understood, loved, and feared the land. He was a \nbusinessman. He was truly a public servant, especially when it came to \neducation and conservation, and he was a warrior in the fight against \nyouth suicide. These are just some of the words by which we remember \none of our State's most treasured, cultural icons.\n  Sidney Huntington was known to his family and his friends as Grandpa \nSid, and probably, for many good reasons, he had a lot of grandkids. \nThere were the personal stories, and I think as we reflect on the 100 \nyears of this great Alaskan, we will begin to share these many stories \nand tributes. He was certainly a savvy poker player. That is going to \ncome out. He was a very generous man.\n  We were talking about him earlier today in my office. He was one of \nthose guys who would truly give the shirt off his back. Sidney once \nencountered a young Native student who he thought had left the village \nand gone off to school, and the young man said: I couldn't go because I \nneed to stay home and earn some money. Sidney literally took out his \nwallet, gave him eight hundred-dollar bills, and he told him to get to \nschool. That was vintage Sidney. School was important. School had to be \na priority, and Sidney wasn't going to let the fact that this young man \nthought he needed to stay home and make money stop him from going to \nschool. He literally took out his wallet and solved the problem.\n  Sidney Huntington was one tough Alaskan. He was a man of very \nimpeccable standards. He told it like it was. He would hold back not \none iota.\n  I was in Galena after they had experienced some terrible flooding \nseveral years back, and the community had come together to talk about \nthe FEMA response, how that was working with the State. You had the \nFederal Agency reps, you had the State people, and everybody was trying \nto figure out how to get through a difficult situation. Sidney \nHuntington--not sitting in the back of the room but sitting right up \nfront at that table--said: By gosh, we have to get to work. No mincing \nwords about it; he told it like it truly was. He was hardy. He was \ndetermined. He was very resilient. He was the real deal.\n  I was very privileged to know Sidney, and I was honored to be called \nhis friend. That is quite an honor because you didn't choose Sidney to \nbe your friend. Sidney chose you. He had identified me as somebody who \ncould not only be helpful but that he could relate to, that we could \nhave conversation back and forth.\n  It wasn't too many years ago that I flew into Galena. Galena is a \nvery small village on the Yukon River, as I mentioned. You fly into the \nlittle airport there. I went to the very small terminal, and there was \nSidney sitting on a chair right outside the little airport terminal.\n  I asked him: Where are you going, Sidney? I am sorry you are not \ngoing to be here while I am visiting Galena.\n  And he said: No, no, no. I am here because I have some talking to do \nwith\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nyou. Where are we on some of these education things? He was talking to \nme about No Child Left Behind. So Sidney was like: I am not going to \nmiss her coming to Galena and perhaps not getting a chance to talk to \nher. He wasn't leaving. He was parked there to visit.\n  If Sidney Huntington chose to call you a friend, you didn't take it \nfor granted, and you accepted that gift with great humility. I think \nabout the relationships, the friendships I have made over the years. I \ncan say nothing can make me, a third-generation Alaskan, feel more like \nan Alaskan than knowing I had earned the respect of Sidney Huntington.\n  Eric Mack, a journalist who worked in Galena, tells the story of how \nSidney managed to survive when his snow machine fell through the ice. \nHe was coming back from a trip. He had been out tending his trap line, \nand it was cold. It was about 30 degrees below zero. It was night. It \nwas dark. He was on his snow machine. His snow machine went through a \nhole in the ice into a shallow section of the Yukon, and he was a long \nway from home. He dragged that snow machine out of the water, out of \nthe icy water by himself. He made a fire from the gasoline and some \nfrozen wood he had, and he kept himself from freezing to death. Think \nabout how you do all of that. That is one tough Alaskan there.\n  Sidney Huntington was born in Huslia, which is on the Koyukuk River. \nHe was born in 1915 to a Scots-Irish father who arrived from New York \nin 1897 to participate in the Gold Rush. His mother was Athabascan \nIndian. Sidney's mother died when Sidney was about 5 years old, and for \nabout 2 weeks it left Sidney and two younger siblings to survive in the \nwilderness. Think about that.\n  This is all laid out in an exceptional book that Sidney wrote called \n``Shadows on the Koyukuk.'' The details in the opening chapters are \nabout the situation when he, as the oldest of three children, at 5 \nyears old, was in a cabin in the middle of the wilderness with his \nmother and his mother died. At 5, he was the only one to care for his \ntwo siblings. This was the beginning of, again, a remarkable life for a \nremarkable man.\n  His father lived off the land as a trapper and a trader, and so the \nstories that are shared through Sidney's book, again, are just \nremarkable about what was happening in Alaska in the early 1900s. \nSidney and his siblings first were sent to the Anvik Mission for \nschooling, and then he later attended the BIA school at Eklutna. He \nbasically got the equivalent of a third-grade education. That was it. \nThat was it for his formal schooling--third grade.\n  You need to keep that in mind as I talk about the rest of Sidney's \nstory and his life. When he was 12 years old he returned to help his \nfather work the trap line and learn the subsistence lifestyle, so he \nwas out in the middle of Alaska. He was out in the wilderness. He was \nnot in school. By the age of 16 he was earning a living hunting and \ntrapping and at age 22 he went to work in a gold mine. In 1963 Sidney \nmoved to Galena to work for the Air Force as a carpenter, and then in \nthe 1970s he went into the fish-processing business. So he had been \neverything. He had been a gold miner, he had been a carpenter, he had \nbeen in fish processing, he had been a hunter and a trapper and a \nsubsistence guy. He was truly living a traditional life in rural \nAlaska, sustaining himself and his family through a mixture of \nsubsistence and participation in the cash economy. Many around the \nState share this life story, but that was just one dimension of Sidney.\n  This man, who had the equivalent of a third-grade education, served \ntwo decades on the Alaska boards of fish and game. In 1993 he published \nthe best-selling biography I just mentioned entitled ``Shadows on the \nKoyukuk.'' In fact, this book he wrote is so good, is so compelling, it \nis the book I take around to the high schools when I go to visit \nstudents. I never leave a school visit without leaving something there, \nand I leave a book for their library. The book I have chosen to leave \nwith students all over the State is ``Shadows on the Koyukuk'' because \nof the amazing accomplishments of this amazing Alaskan.\n  The University of Alaska Fairbanks in 1989 awarded Sidney an honorary \ndoctorate in public service. Here again is an extraordinarily \naccomplished man, a man with a third-grade education, focused on public \nservice, education, helping his community, his State, and publishing a \nbest-selling biography.\n  Through the University of Alaska system, Sidney participated in oral \nhistory interviews that will be examined by historians and students for \ndecades to home.\n  He was truly the stuff of which legends are made. Alaska holds a lot \nof legends. It is a big State with tall stories. But Sidney, once \nagain, was the real deal. His life was a profile of courage and \ninspiration. It has not only been chronicled in books and interviews--\nit was even played out in theater in a stage play called ``The Winter \nBear.''\n  ``The Winter Bear'' tells the fictional story of a young Native man \nwho contemplated suicide. In this play, this young Native man is \nsentenced to cut wood for Sidney Huntington. Making a pact with Sidney \nto live, he goes on to construct a traditional bear spear under \nSidney's guidance. That spear is used to bring down this marauding \nbear. But Sidney is injured in the incident, and the young man, who is \nvery insular and very afraid of public speaking, must now speak for \nSidney before thousands of people at the Alaska Federation of Natives \nconvention. At this point, the young man finds himself and his voice, \nrecognizes the value of his life, and emerges as a leader.\n  While this play, ``The Winter Bear,'' may be fictional, Sidney \nHuntington's experience with suicide is absolutely not. In real life, \nSidney lost children to suicide. He grieved for them every day and \nshared his loss with schoolchildren who visited his cabin. As we \nvisited in quiet conversations, he shared with me the loss and grief \nthat he felt, as not only his children but others in his community and \nhis region have suffered because of suicide.\n  Sidney was a champion for young people. He believed in the future of \nour young people, urging that they choose life, that they get a good \neducation, and that they take pride in their proud heritage.\n  Sidney Huntington was the patriarch of a large and extended family. I \nknow so very many of them, and they are all very accomplished in their \nown right. He is survived by his wife, Angela. They were married 72 \nyears; that is a pretty good marriage there. He has some 30 children, \nboth biological and adopted, and many, many grandchildren. On May 10 of \nthis year, they gathered in Galena to celebrate the centennial of \nSidney's birth, and they all wore T-shirts that bore some of Sidney's \nwords of wisdom: Make life worth living; work hard; keep up a good \nspirit; have a good attitude toward others--this will take you a long \nway in life. These are words to live by and words to remember an \nAlaskan who was truly larger than life and as large as the great State \nthat he called home.\n  I was privileged by the gift of the friendship of Sidney Huntington. \nAlaska is privileged by the gift of his legacy. This man is a true hero \nof our homeland. He is now gone, but his life of inspiration will long, \nlong be remembered. I am grateful for the opportunity to again pay \ntribute to a great Alaskan and to extend my condolences and that of the \nU.S. Senate to his family, his many extended relatives, and those of us \nthroughout the State who cherish a great Alaskan leader.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8528-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8528-S8529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS BILL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier today the U.S. Senate added to its \nlist of accomplishments this year by passing important education \nreform. The Democratic leader, our friend from Nevada, has called this \nSenate ``unproductive,'' but the Washington Post took a look at what he \nhad to say and gave him three Pinocchios for that one.\n  When we look at the accomplishments of this year, they are \nbipartisan, to be sure--as they must be. That is the nature of this \ninstitution. Even the minority can, and frequently does, stop us from \ndoing things the majority would like to do. But what has been \nremarkable is where we have been able to find consensus and work \ntogether. Certainly, the education bill--the Every Student Succeeds \nAct--is an example of that, as is the leadership not only of Majority \nLeader McConnell, who\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nscheduled the vote on this legislation, but also Chairman Alexander of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and Ranking Member \nMurray.\n  Senator Murray has also been very important in working with us on \nimportant anti-human trafficking legislation that passed the Senate 99 \nto 0. She worked with us on the President's request for us to pass \ntrade promotion authority that only 13 Democrats voted for. This is an \nimportant piece of economic legislation.\n  Then, in recent days, we passed the first multiyear highway bill. \nThat was due to the partnership of Senator Inhofe, chairman of an \nimportant committee, Chairman Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand Senator Boxer on the Democratic side basically trying to take on \nher own leadership that didn't want us to pass a multiyear highway \nbill, at least at first, because they wanted to use the pay-fors in \nthat bill to spend on other things.\n  My point is that leadership is important not only at the Presidential \nlevel; it is important here at the level of Congress in terms of \nsetting the agenda. But the hard work of legislation is actually trying \nto find areas of common ground and consensus so we can actually get \nthings done.\n  There are some times that stopping what the majority wants to get \ndone is the right thing to do--when the legislation is misguided, when \nit is the wrong kind of policy. But we found places where we can work \ntogether in order to deliver results for the American people, and the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act is an example of that. It replaced a law \nwhich was sorely in need of reform, and it stopped Washington from \nimposing common core mandates on our classrooms. It will ensure that \npower is devolved from Washington back to the local communities, to \nparents and teachers, where that power should exist.\n  In the words of Chairman Alexander, it has eliminated the Department \nof Education as a national school board. Our country is simply too big \nand too diverse, and the needs of our students in local communities are \nso different that the power to innovate, the power to set the standard, \nand then to find the most creative and innovative way to achieve those \nstandards I believe is best determined at the local level and not here \nin Washington, DC. This legislation does just that.\n  I use as an example Laredo, TX, where I went to a ninth grade science \nclass. Due to the proximity of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, \nthey were teaching ninth graders the fundamentals of petroleum geology \nas a way to teach their science courses. So the students could see the \nfuture of a job in the oil and gas sector because of the proximity of \nthe Eagle Ford Shale and the prosperity that has brought and a direct \nconnection between the otherwise abstract lessons of science that they \nmight be learning in class. Washington, DC, is not going to be able to \ncome up with that kind of creative solution or way of making science \nrelevant to students in Laredo, TX. So I use that as an example of why \nthis legislation is so important to leave to the States and local \nschool districts, parents, and teachers the ability to determine the \ncurriculum and accountability measures they want to adopt.\n  I am proud we have come together in true bipartisan fashion to \nstrengthen the hands of parents, teachers, and local communities and to \nprovide real education reform for our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8529-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8529-S8531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk about the speech the \nPresident gave on the Islamic State, or ISIS. He spoke about this to \nthe Nation last Sunday night. I read all the newsclips after having \nlistened to what the President had to say, and I think the universal \nreaction was that the President did not come up with anything new. \nBasically, the message was that we are going to stay the course.\n  Of course, this is the same President who called ISIS ``contained.'' \nI don't know of any other person--any other person with any knowledge \nof the subject matter--who would share the view the President \nexpressed, that ISIS was somehow contained. Indeed, we have learned \nthat the threat of ISIS is threefold: We have the battle raging in the \ncountry, what started out as a civil war in Syria. Now the borders \nbetween Iraq and Syria have essentially been erased, and ISIS is \ncontrolling large portions of those two countries. It is also about the \nforeign fighters who come from Europe and other places within the \nregion and even from the United States. There have been examples of \npeople who come from the United States over to the fight in Syria and \nIraq in order to help ISIS. Then, as we sadly learned again, just as we \nlearned in Paris recently, we have seen in San Bernardino, CA, the \nradicalization of people already in our country, using things such as \nsocial media and the Internet.\n  It is troubling that the President did not choose to tell us what new \nstrategy he was going to use in order to actually make sure we were \nable to accomplish his own stated objective of degrading and destroying \nISIS. Instead, we heard that he had no interest in changing course. As \nI said a moment ago, this has dangerous and dramatic consequences right \nhere at home too. In light of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino--\none that killed 14 people and wounded more than 20--you would think \nthat the President would reconsider whether the course we are on needs \na midcourse correction.\n  We saw that, for example, in Iraq. President Bush saw the war in Iraq \ngoing poorly, despite our best efforts--and then took a huge chance, \nupon advice of General Petraeus and other military leaders, to conduct \na surge. It was a big risk, but it paid off.\n  President Obama, on the other hand, does not seem to want to learn \nfrom his experience or his mistakes. This ``wait and see'' approach has \nserved only to strengthen the stranglehold ISIS has on the Middle East, \nand it has enabled the recruitment of thousands of jihadists from all \nover the world.\n  What we really need from the President is to listen to his military \nand national security leadership and to formulate a comprehensive \nstrategy against ISIS and bring additional military means against them. \nThe President likes to say this is a choice between what we are doing \nnow and American boots on the ground. That is a false choice. That is \nnot the choice. Those aren't all the options available to the \nPresident. But we need to bring means against ISIS that would inflict \nsizable losses, shatter their false narrative about their actually \nprevailing and making advances in their effort to reestablish or \nestablish a Caliphate in the Middle East, and stop them from spreading \ntheir hateful ideology and their violence--not only in Syria, Iraq, and \nin that region, but around the world.\n  In short, what we need is a dramatically different approach. This \nconcern for our current trajectory in the fight against ISIS is not \nshared only by folks on this side of the aisle. A number of our \ncolleagues across the aisle agree that the President's strategy isn't \nworking, but some of their solutions are pretty puzzling. Just this \nweek, the Democratic leader and some of the other senior leaders across \nthe aisle said that the solution is for the President to appoint \nanother czar--a czar that can eliminate ISIS.\n  We don't need another appointed bureaucrat. We need a Commander in \nChief who is willing to recognize the reality on the ground, one who \nwill step up and lead, and one who will lay out for Congress and the \nAmerican people a strategy that has a reasonable chance of success.\n  Because of the President's refusal to change course and develop a \nserious and aggressive strategy to eradicate ISIS, several of my \ncolleagues and I have sent a letter to the President with some \nhopefully constructive suggestions. We have urged him to take \ncommonsense measures that are designed to accomplish his own stated \ngoal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIS.\n  It is evident that any way forward must inflict significant \nterritorial losses to ISIS. Right now we are engaged in bombing \nmissions, which are necessary but not sufficient to actually hold any \nterritory. That takes people on the ground. It takes military advisers. \nIt takes the United States' leadership--not our U.S. military on the \nground--but it takes somebody there to reclaim territory that Americans \nfought to secure just a few short years\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nago, such as in Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul.\n  I said before that I think the President made a terrible mistake when \nhe precipitously pulled the plug on the American presence in Iraq, \nbecause what happened is we simply squandered the lives and the \ntreasure lost in securing cities such as Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul. \nIt breaks my heart to think about the Gold Star Mothers and other \npeople who lost family members in those fights only to see now that \nterritory squandered. Think about our veterans who perhaps lost a limb \nfrom an IED, a roadside bomb. It is really a terrible thing. Now the \nPresident does have a chance to try to change his strategy in order to \nreclaim the territory from Iraq and, again, to undercut this false \nnarrative of ISIS invincibility.\n  First, in this letter that we wrote to the President we suggested \nthat the United States should embed military advisers alongside of the \nIraqi Security Forces, the Kurdish Peshmerga, and Sunni tribal forces \nto strengthen their hand on the battlefield. These are some of the \npeople who can be the boots on the ground and not American soldiers and \nservice men and women. This could include additional U.S. troops to \nserve as joint terminal attack controllers--or JTACs--who can help \nensure that our airstrikes against ISIS are much more accurate, timely, \nmore lethal, and avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians.\n  We know the United States has the most powerful military in the \nworld--equipped with the most advanced aircraft and the best trained \npilots to fly them. But in order to leverage the advantage in the air, \nwe need to work more closely with those on the ground. Again, this \nisn't going to happen without American leadership. By deploying \nadditional close air support platforms--including Apache attack \nhelicopters--for use in coordination with embedded JTACs, we can bring \nreal support to those who find themselves in close contact with ISIS.\n  Again, the President likes to say ``no American boots on the ground'' \nbut the fact is there are about 3,500 or so U.S. service men and women \nin Iraq, and the President recently announced he was going to deploy a \ncontingent of special operators to help do exactly what I described \nhere. But he has not yet come up with a strategy that will actually \nhelp them accomplish their goal.\n  The President also needs to understand the real need for a thorough \nreview of the current approval process for coalition airstrikes. By \nmaking this review process less unwieldy, we can remove barriers that \ninhibit our pilots from striking strategically significant ISIS targets \nand doing it in a timely manner. On the battlefield, seconds matter. \nOur pilots who are engaging ISIS and putting their lives on the line \nshould be allowed a shorter strike-approval timeline.\n  Finally, the letter my colleagues and I sent to the President asks \nhim to establish safe zones inside Syria to protect the Syrian \nrefugees. I have had the occasion to travel to some of the refugee \ncamps in Turkey and Jordan, for example. Ever since the Syrian civil \nwar occurred a couple of years ago, there have been massive dislocation \nof people from Syria into adjoining countries, further destabilizing \nthose countries and, obviously, being a huge burden upon them. But what \nwe need is a no-fly and no-drive zone so Syrians can stay in Syria \nrather than having to flee to adjacent countries or Europe or now come \nto the United States, for example. It would help safeguard innocent \nmen, women, and children who are getting caught up in the crossfire.\n  We can do this. We have done it before in Northern Iraq. It takes a \nplan, and it takes American leadership. We can help take a lot of \npressure off of Europe and surrounding countries in the Middle East, as \nwell as our own country, by people who understandably are fleeing the \ndevastation and the danger in their own country. Of course, the \nPresident and the United States can't do it alone. That is why we also \nencourage the President to leverage our partnerships in the region and \nhopefully find ways to mobilize NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, in the planning and implementation process. NATO is very \nmuch engaged in Afghanistan, for example, and there is no reason why \nNATO, with American leadership, can't make a big contribution to what \nis happening in Syria and Iraq.\n  I hope President Obama reads our letter, and I hope he seriously \nconsiders how the United States can move forward with our partners in a \nmuch needed direction to accomplish the goal that he himself stated of \ndegrading and destroying ISIS. Unfortunately, the current plan is not \never going to succeed. Just bombing, as I said earlier--airstrikes--is \nnot sufficient.\n  Unfortunately, the recent attack in San Bernardino reveals that the \nextremist ideology of ISIS is not contained in the Middle East, as I \nmentioned earlier--the radicalization of people already here in the \nUnited States. We saw that, for example, in 2009 with MAJ Nidal Hasan \nat Ft. Hood, TX. We saw it earlier this year in Garland, TX. \nUnfortunately, we saw that in San Bernardino last week.\n  By the way, this is another item on the President's and on our to-do \nlist. The FBI Director this morning testified that before the attacks \nin Garland, TX, where two people traveled from Phoenix in full body \narmor and with automatic weapons and tried to attack an exhibit in \nGarland, TX, one of the attackers sent 109 encrypted messages overseas \nto a terrorist contact there. But because they are encrypted, even with \na court order, the FBI has not been able to see the contents of those \nmessages. The FBI Director and the Deputy Attorney General have said \nthis is a big problem for the United States because many technology \ncompanies are marketing their ability to encrypt their messaging and, \nthus, keep it out of the eyes--away from the eyes--of law enforcement, \neven with a court order.\n  Again, recently we voted to eliminate the bulk data collection at the \nNational Security Agency. To remind everybody, this was about taking a \nknown terrorist's phone number overseas and comparing that against call \nrecords here in the United States that don't reveal content but do \nreveal the domestic phone number so that the law enforcement \nauthorities can go to a court and ask the court to allow them to look \ninto the content of that communication. But, of course, this was \nmisrepresented by some who claimed the privacy interests trumped \nnational security interests.\n  Certainly, we have to find the right balance between privacy and \nsecurity. But this encryption technology, which, again, is being \nmarketed by certain companies in order to increase their market share, \nis being used by terrorist organizations. In fact, the FBI Director \nsaid this has now become part of the terrorist tradecraft--that is the \nway he put it--to use these encrypted devices.\n  My point is that whether it is the fight in Syria and Iraq or whether \nit is the foreign fighters traveling from the United States or Europe \nto Iraq and Syria and returning to the United States or whether it is \nradicalization of people already in place here in our own country, this \nis a war we cannot afford to lose. In a way, it seems like we are not \nusing all of the resources available to us to fight a war against the \nterrorist threat when clearly they are using every resource they have \navailable to fight a war against the United States and our freedom.\n  I hope the President will reconsider his course of action dealing \nwith ISIS. I am sorry to say that unless the President does, I think we \nare going to see other attacks--not just in Europe, not just people \ndying unnecessarily in Syria and Iraq, but further attacks here in the \nhomeland.\n  The President has some very talented military advisers. General \nDunford and General Milley, the Army Chief of Staff, and others can \nprovide him a strategy that actually will have a better chance of \nsucceeding if he will listen and if he will reconsider. I know that \nsometimes when people like me have criticized the President for having \nno effective strategy, people have said: What is your strategy? Well, \nit is not our responsibility. It is the Commander in Chief's \nresponsibility to come up with a strategy. But taking that challenge \non, my colleagues and I have sent this letter where we list some \noptions for the President that I hope he will consider.\n  We need a more focused, a more effective, a more robust strategy--one\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nthat is undergirded with a political framework that can sustain a \nlasting rejection of the bankrupt ideology pedaled by ISIS. We don't \nhave time to stick to a plan that has proven not to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, I wish to address an issue that has kind \nof been pushed into the background by virtue of a series of events that \nhas, quite understandably, captured all of our attention. The \natrocities committed by ISIS has justified a focus of attention on how \nwe can make America more secure from this very frightening and \ndangerous threat, but we shouldn't lose sight of an ongoing threat that \nis simultaneously developing, and I am referring to the Iran nuclear \ndeal and the very disturbing developments that have occurred just in \nthe short period of time since the JCPOA, the agreement between the \nWestern powers, including the United States, and Iran, was announced.\n  This is a deal that in its own right is very disturbing. I found it \nimpossible to defend. Since then, it has gotten worse, and in my view \nadditional developments clearly indicate that we don't really have an \nagreement here, and the President should not be lifting sanctions in a \nfew weeks. My fear is that is exactly what the President intends do. \nLet me walk through several of the items that have occurred recently \nthat are particularly disturbing.\n  Item No. 1, almost immediately after the deal was announced, the \nIranian leadership insisted they would essentially rewrite some very \nimportant parts of the deal. Specifically, they demanded that the \nsanctions had to be permanently lifted rather than suspended \nindefinitely. The JCPOA language says the United States will ``cease \nthe application of sanctions.'' The administration has been very clear. \nThey told us that means the sanctions are suspended, but the framework \nremains in place in case they need to be reapplied. They have \npredicated the entire viability of this agreement on the ability to \nreimpose sanctions, so it is essential that they in fact be available \nto reapply. The Iranians have said: No, absolutely not. That is not \nwhat the agreement says. It says these sanctions are to be lifted and \npermanently removed and they cannot be restored for any reason under \nany circumstance.\n  Well, which is it? The Iranians have clearly indicated that they have \na very different understanding than our administration does, and this \nmatters because whether sanctions can be reimposed in the event of a \nviolation is absolutely central to the enforcement of this agreement, \nand that is according to the administration.\n  Item No. 2, shortly after the deal was announced, a couple of our \ncolleagues--a House Member and a Senator--discovered the existence of \ntwo secret side deals. While on a trip to Europe, they discovered that \nthese agreements were negotiated between the IAEA, the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, charged with much of the enforcement of this \nagreement, and the government in Tehran. It went to the heart of the \npast nuclear weapons activity that the Iranian Government was involved \nin. The administration didn't tell us about these side agreements or \ngive us these side agreements, but it turns out they exist.\n  The nuclear review act stated very clearly that the President was \nobligated to give us all related documentation--all of it. The actual \nlanguage is ``any additional materials related thereto, including \nannexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, \ndocuments, and guidance.''\n  I think it is abundantly clear that the legislation actually in fact \nsays, and intended to say, that anything in any way related to this \nagreement had to be handed over to Congress. It never happened. We \nnever got it. To this day, we haven't gotten it. In fact, no Member of \nCongress has seen these agreements--these two documents. It is not just \nthat no Member of Congress has seen them, nobody in the administration \nhas seen them because the administration thought it was OK to just \ntrust some other entity to negotiate a very central enforcement \nprovision of this agreement without ever being able to even see it. It \nis unbelievable. No. 1, the President is in violation of the law if he \nlifts these sanctions because the law clearly states that process can't \nbegin until we have gotten all the documents, and we still haven't, and \na very important aspect of this agreement is something that the \nadministration has never seen.\n  Item No. 3, October 3, just a few weeks ago, Iran launched a new \nlong-range, precision-guided ballistic missile. Even the Obama \nadministration acknowledges that this is a violation of U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 1929, which prohibits any ballistic missile \nactivities on the part of Iran. Let me briefly quote from that \nresolution. It is a resolution that, by the way, supports the JCPOA. It \nis an integral part of the nuclear deal with Iran. It states that Iran \nis ``not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles \ndesigned to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including \nlaunches using such ballistic missile technology, until the date eight \nyears after the JCPOA.'' The intermediate-range ballistic missiles that \nthe Iranians launched could absolutely hold nuclear weapons. They have \na 1,000-mile range and could reach Israel.\n  A few weeks after that, on November 21, Iran launched a second \nballistic missile. In spite of everybody pointing out that they were in \nviolation of the JCPOA with the first launch, they demonstrated just \nhow concerned they were about that by a second launch. It was a \nslightly different system, quicker setup time, more mobility, more \nmaneuverable, and still capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Why does \nthis matter? Well, it matters because it demonstrates that Iran has \nevery intention to continue to improve its ability to deliver nuclear \nweapons great distances, with great precision. It demonstrates the \ncontinued intent of Iran to develop the capability to threaten and \nattack Israel and U.S. allies.\n  It is a fact that with this technology in place, if and when they \nviolate this agreement and develop nuclear weapons--or even if they \njust wait until it is over and develop nuclear weapons, which the \nagreement permits--they will be immediately prepared to launch these \nweapons great distances. Maybe most fundamentally, Iran is in open \nviolation of the JCPOA. They obviously have contempt for this \nagreement. How can we trust them when they are blatantly and flagrantly \nviolating central parts of it?\n  Item No. 4, October 29, Iran sends weapons to the Assad regime on \nRussian cargo planes, violating another U.S. Security Council \nResolution, as was part of a bigger deal. It included, in the \nnegotiation of the deal, that Commander Soleimani travel to Russia, \nwhich is in violation of the U.S. Security Council Resolutions because \na travel ban had been imposed personally on him. That didn't matter. He \nwent to Russia and negotiated an agreement that included weapons for \nAssad, in violation of another U.N. Security Council resolution, and \nRussian delivery of the SA-300 Air Defense System for Iran.\n  Why is this important? Well, it is yet another flagrant violation of \ninternational law and U.N. Security Council resolutions but also \nbecause the delivery of these surface-to-air missiles diminishes the \nability and credibility of a military strike against Iran, which we \nhave been told is always the ultimate backstop. You would think that \nmaybe the administration would have some concern about this.\n  Item No. 5, October 29, Iran arrests an American and convicts another \nAmerican. The Iranian regime arrested the Iranian-American businessman \nSiamak Namazi and convicted Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian in a \nshow trial. This American reporter has now been held for over 500 days. \nMeanwhile, of course, the Iranian hardliners continue to hold their \nanti-American rallies, burn American flags, and shout ``Death to \nAmerica.''\n  Why does all of this matter? After all, this was not contemplated by \nthe\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nJCPOA directly. It matters because it reveals the ongoing open \nhostility of the Iranian leadership to the United States. In response, \nof course, America has taken no steps and no action, but it is \nfundamentally clear that this deal has not changed the mindset or \nattitude of the regime toward America, and now it appears that Iran is \nholding some additional chips, if you will, in the form of American \nhostages and that should be pretty disturbing.\n  Item No. 6, December 2, just a few days ago, the IAEA report came out \non the previous military dimensions of Iran's weapons program. What did \nthey conclude? They concluded that up until and through at least 2009, \nIran was, in fact, working on a nuclear weapons capability. That is \nfrom the IAEA's report. That is not my opinion. That is their \nconclusion. They confirmed, among other things, that the Iranians were \nworking on neutron triggers for detonation purposes, miniaturization \nefforts for warheads so they could be put on ballistic missiles, and \nspecific designs for fitting them on weapons.\n  In addition to confirming the nuclear weapons activity of the Iranian \nregime, the IAEA report highlighted that the Iranians were not fully \ncooperating as they were trying to determine the extent of the past \nmilitary dimensions. Again, according to the IAEA, the Iranians \nconsistently tried to mislead investigators.\n  At the Parchin site, where much of the research and weaponization \nprocess was underway, the Iranians were heavily sanitizing the site. In \nrecent months, they were trying to destroy the evidence prior to the \nIAEA investigation and determination, and the Iranians did not provide \nall of the information that was requested of them. This is all from the \nIAEA.\n  Why does all of this matter? First and foremost, it is absolutely \nindisputable proof positive that Iran has been lying through this \nentire process. They have always said they have no nuclear weapons \nprogram and that all of their nuclear research has always been \nexclusively for peaceful purposes. It has been a lie. It was always a \nlie. It was a lie through the entire negotiations. If they are willing \nto lie about this, what else are they lying about? Since they were not \nwilling to fully cooperate, how much do we really know about exactly \nhow far along their weapons process was? And if and when we discover \nfuture weapons developments, we might not know whether that was prior \nto the agreement or post-agreement. It just creates a great deal of \ndangerous ambiguity.\n  Finally--and this to me is maybe the most shocking--on November 24, \nthe State Department acknowledged that the Government of Iran had never \nratified and had not signed the JCPOA. They haven't signed the \nagreement. The administration acknowledges this. In a letter to a \nMember of Congress, Congressman Mike Pompeo, on November 19, 2015, the \nState Department said, among other things, the ``JCPOA is not a treaty \nor an executive agreement, and is not a signed document. The JCPOA \nreflects political commitments. . . . ''\n  The President had previously called it a negotiated diplomatic \nagreement and attached great weight to it. The President said:\n\n       The agreement now reached between the international \n     community and Iran builds on this tradition of strong \n     principled diplomacy. After two years of negotiations, we \n     have achieved a detailed arrangement that permanently \n     prohibits Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n\n  Except that it doesn't and Iran hasn't signed it. The President even \ncompared it to the START treaty and the nonproliferation treaty. It is \nvery different. The fact is, the State Department letter openly admits \nthat this agreement, if you can call it that, is not legally binding on \nIran, and the Iranians have refused to sign it. Instead, it is supposed \nto depend on extensive verification, and we have talked about the \nproblems with that, and the ability to snap back sanctions, which, \nlikewise, have been dramatically undermined at best.\n  Then let's look at what the Iranians have done. President Ruhani \npushed the Iranian legislature specifically not to adopt the JCPOA. \nThey have ignored it. They have not voted on it. They have not ratified \nit. They have not affirmed it. So, in addition to not signing it, they \nhave not had an eradication vote to approve it. In fact, they voted on \nsome other framework. Ayatollah Khamenei has suspended further \nnegotiations with the United States, so they have not signed the \nagreement, they have not voted on the agreement, and they have \nannounced that they have no intentions of discussing any more with us \nthe substance of it.\n  It looks pretty clear to me that the Iranians are creating the \nability to completely deny any obligation on their part to honor the \nterms of the agreement. It looks pretty obvious to me that that is what \nis going on here. Yet we are just a few weeks away from what this \nagreement, which hasn't really been agreed to, calls the \n``implementation day.'' That is the day on which the sanctions will be \nlifted.\n  By all accounts, it appears as though the administration intends to \ngo ahead and lift the sanctions. Principally among them is the release \nof many tens of billions--maybe $100 billion--to Iran, despite the fact \nthat the Iranians have demanded that these sanctions be permanently \nlifted, despite the discovery of these secret agreements, despite at \nleast two ballistic missile launches in direct violation of the \nagreement, despite the violations of the arms embargoes, despite the \narrest of Americans, despite the confirmation that we all now know that \nIran has been lying throughout this entire process about the past \nweaponization, and despite the fact that they refuse to sign or pass \nthis agreement. Despite all that, we apparently are just a few weeks \naway from lifting the sanctions, releasing upwards of $100 billion to \nthe Iranians, and, of course, at that moment, losing virtually all \nleverage over Iran and their pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  I think it is time the President of the United States realizes and \nacknowledges that there is no agreement here. There is not a deal. Any \nreason one would think of at this point that Iran is going to honor \nthis agreement that is not really an agreement I think is extremely \nnaive at best.\n  I hope that in the very short time that remains, we are able to \npersuade the administration to reconsider their apparent intent to lift \nthese sanctions and reward this regime with a staggering amount of \nmoney with which they will do, in my view, very likely great harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 minutes to the 10 minutes I have been allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8532-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8532-S8535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS BILL\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator from Colorado has \nthe misfortune of presiding over the Senate when I am giving a speech, \nbut it is nice to see him.\n  I wanted to come to the floor today to mostly say thank you but also \nto make some observations on a day where I am actually proud of the \nSenate. I am proud of the work we have been able to do to reauthorize \nthe Elementary and Secondary School Act with a vote in the Senate of 85 \nyes votes. This came after a vote in the House of Representatives that \nwas 359 yes votes. And this comes after a time when just months ago it \nseemed as though we were paralyzed on this bill and unable to get a \nvote in the House and in the Senate. In fact, the House passed a very \npartisan bill that didn't get one Democratic vote. And when the \nDemocrats were in charge, we passed bills that didn't get Republican \nvotes, and then we couldn't even get them to the floor. Now we find \nourselves just a few months later with a huge bipartisan result.\n  I want to start by commending Lamar Alexander, the Senator from \nTennessee, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, for his extraordinary leadership, as well as Patty Murray, \nthe ranking member of the committee, for her leadership. They ran this \ncommittee and they ran this process in a way that ought to set the \nstandard for the rest of the committees in the Senate. They followed \nregular order. They started with a bipartisan product. They asked every \nsingle member of the committee whether we had ideas to try to\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\nimprove the legislation. They moved it out of committee unanimously--\nunanimously. This is a committee that has on it the junior Senator from \nKentucky and the junior Senator from Vermont, just to pick two \nexamples, and they got a unanimous vote. Then we brought it to the \nfloor, we had amendments, an open process, passed it off the floor, the \nHouse passed their version of the bill, and we had an actual conference \ncommittee. Can my colleagues imagine that? I think it is the second one \nor maybe the third; there was one fake one and then two real ones since \nI have been here in the last 7 years. I have actually had the good \nfortune to be on two of them, including this one. So we produced a \nproduct and got it to the floor, and now it is going to the President's \ndesk.\n  I say to the pages who are here today that we are 8 years away in the \nreauthorization of No Child Left Behind. The bill expired, in effect, 8 \nyears ago, and we have taken 8 years to get this work done, which, if \nyou were grading us in terms of getting our homework done in time--if \nthe teachers at the Page School had the opportunity to scold us for \nbeing 8 years late with our homework, they probably would. But I am \ngoing to celebrate because I am glad this day has finally come. For \nteachers and for principals and for students and for families all \nacross the country, this change is going to come as a great relief.\n  Some people ask: Why should the Federal Government have any role in \neducation at all? I think it is a fair question because of what we \nspend on K-12 education, only 9 percent of it is Federal. The rest of \nit is all State and local. The reason why the Federal Government is \ninvolved is because of the civil rights impulse that says kids ought to \nhave a great education no matter what ZIP Code they are born into. That \nis what we tell ourselves. If you are lucky enough to be born to \nwealthy parents or unlucky enough to be born to poor parents, when it \ncomes to education, you ought to be able to get a good education.\n  The Federal Government is meant to help ameliorate the differences \nthat exist in too many places all across the country. That was the idea \nwhen we got involved in this in the 1960s. Then we fast-forward to No \nChild Left Behind, the idea that George Bush had and Ted Kennedy had \nand the others who worked on that bill, including Margaret Spellings \nand others, had. The idea was that our kids are not succeeding all \nacross the country and they are not remotely having the same \nopportunities, and we ought to expose that to the country.\n  Notwithstanding all of the things about No Child Left Behind that I \ncan't stand, the one thing I will be forever grateful for was the \nrequirement that districts across the country annually assess kids and \ndisaggregate the data so people can see how kids are doing by ethnic \ngroup and by their level of poverty or affluence and that we expose \nthat to the country and stop hiding from what are terrible results for \nmany kids living in the United States.\n  Over the period of time that No Child Left Behind has been in place, \nwe have been unable to hide from the results we have seen. What are \nthose results? It is very clear now that we have studied it that if you \nare a kid born into poverty, you arrive in kindergarten having heard 30 \nmillion fewer words than a more affluent peer. Ask any kindergarten \nteacher in America whether that is going to affect the outcomes in \nkindergarten, and she will tell us.\n  We now know that there are whole communities in America, across \ncities and across rural areas, where there is not a single school that \nanybody in this body would be willing to send their kid or their \ngrandkid to--not one. And those of us who are proponents of school \nchoice, as I am, need to recognize that there are huge parts of \ngeography in the United States where there is no choice. The choice is \nillusory. You have one lousy school to choose from and another lousy \nschool to choose from.\n  Then what we have discovered is that we have made it harder and \nharder for people to be able to afford college. As other countries \naround the world are understanding more than ever, we need something \nnorth of a high school diploma to compete.\n  When George Bush, the son--and I say to the Presiding Officer that \nthis is a temporal observation, not a partisan observation--when George \nBush the son became President, we led the world in the production of \ncollege graduates. Today we are something like 16th. My question is, Do \nwe want to be 32nd or do we want to do something different to give \npeople greater opportunity?\n  As I have said on this floor before, where this all ends is in a \nsituation where if you are a kid born into poverty in America, your \nchances of getting a college degree is equivalent to roughly 9 in 100. \nThey are not roughly 9 in 100; they are 9 in 100. That means that if \nthese Senate chairs and these desks--there are 100 in this Chamber--\nwere inhabited by poor kids instead of by Senators, there would be \nthose 3 seats, then those 3 seats, and then 3 of those seats in that \nrow that would be inhabited by college graduates, and the entire rest \nof this Chamber would not be. I think that if we faced those odds for \nour own kids in this body--if Senators faced those kinds of odds for \ntheir own kids--we would quit the Senate and we would go home and we \nwould try to fix whatever we could fix to ensure that our children \ndidn't have a 9-in-100 chance but maybe had a 90-in-100 chance of being \nable to make a decision about whether they wanted to go to college.\n  I think one of the reasons why we find ourselves with those kinds of \nresults for our kids--not just around education but around health care \nand around many other issues--is that too often we are treating \nAmerica's children like they are someone else's children, not like they \nare our own children. And if we treated them like they were our own \nchildren, I think it would focus our mind.\n  I think that not just on education but on all kinds of issues, we \nwould stop figuring out how to get through the week, stop trying to \nfigure out how to keep the lights on for 1 more week or 1 more month or \ndo a temporary tax deal that we could call a yearlong deal and it is \nactually a 2-week tax deal at the end of the year, and we would \nactually start doing what the American people want us to do, which is \ninvest in the next generation--investment in the next generation in \nterms of infrastructure, in terms of immigration policies, in terms of \nenergy; approaching the next generation by saying we have a theory \nabout how we are going to right the fiscal problems this country faces. \nAnd we would be doing a lot--State, local, and Federal Government--to \nensure that we had an education system that was much more aligned to \nthe outcomes we want for our kids than the system we have.\n  Having said all of that, I am so glad we have made the decision that \nwe have made to pass this bill today because if we had a rally tomorrow \non the steps of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the same, \nliterally no one would show up, which maybe explains why we have been \nable to get this bipartisan result in the end.\n  I think the other thing that explains it is the fact that the No \nChild Left Behind bill, when it was passed, represented perhaps the \nbiggest and greatest Federal incursion on State and local governments \nthat we have seen in modern American history. Part of what we are doing \nhere by changing the way this bill works is retreating, which I think \nis appropriate and what we should do.\n  When I was superintendent of the Denver public schools, I used to \nwonder all the time why people in Washington were so mean to our kids \nand to our teachers. What I realize being here is that they are not \nmean; it is just that they have absolutely no idea what is going on in \nour schools and our classrooms.\n  I think it is perfectly reasonable for the Federal Government to say: \nWe expect you to do better. We expect you to close these achievement \ngaps. We have a national interest in knowing that kids are moving \nforward no matter where they are born, just as I think we have a \nnational interest in understanding where the next 1.5 million teachers \nare going to come from to replace the teachers we have lost. But when I \nwas a superintendent, the last thing I wanted was anybody in Washington \ntelling me how to do the work or telling my teachers and principals how \nto do the work. That is not the province of anybody in Washington, DC, \nand there was too much of that with No Child Left Behind.\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n  I want to talk a little bit about a few aspects of the bill today \nthat I think are important. I am not going to talk about everything \nbecause there is an awful lot that changed. The first thing that is \nimportant to me was thinking about how we spend money when it comes to \nschools and understanding better how those resources are used.\n  I mentioned earlier that the whole reason the Federal Government is \ninvolved in education is because of a civil rights impulse. It might \nsurprise the Presiding Officer to know that we are only one of three \ncountries in the OECD that spend more money on affluent kids than we do \non kids in poverty as a country. Part of that has to do with the way we \nfund education through property taxes, but part of it is compounded by \nthe way the Federal Government has required reporting from school \ndistricts and States, going back to the 1960s, where we said to States \nand school districts: You need to report not an actual teacher's salary \nbut an average teacher's salary, and that is what we are going to \nrequire you to do. For reasons that I am not going to belabor here \ntoday, that became something called the comparable loophole and meant \nthat it was unclear where the resources were going, including the title \nI resources which are meant for kids living in poverty.\n  I wanted to close the comparability loophole as part of this \nlegislation. We got a vote in the committee, but it didn't make it into \nthe bill. But we have made a change in reporting, which is that we are \nnow requiring districts and States to report on actual teachers' \nsalaries, not average teachers' salaries, and what that is going to \nmean is much more transparency about where money is going in our school \ndistricts.\n  It is pretty easy to think about it this way. If you imagine an \naverage salary for a school district, if you are in a high-poverty \nschool, it tends to be that younger teachers, newer teachers are in \nthat school. Those newer teachers are paid not at the average salaries \nbut an actual salary down here. If you go to a more affluent school, \nteachers tend to be more experienced and paid more, and they are paid \nup here. So in the wealthier schools, the school is billed as though it \nis paying lower average salaries even though it is paying higher \nsalaries. The poor schools are being billed as if they are paying \nhigher salaries, but they are paying lower salaries. That is a \ntravesty. That is a massive subsidy going from poor kids to wealthier \nkids in this country because of the requirements of the Federal \nGovernment going back to the 1960s. We have to change that reporting, \nand I believe in the next incarnation of this legislation we will \nfinally change the budgeting itself.\n  We also focused on teacher leadership as part of this bill and \nteachers in general. They are the most important thing when it comes to \na quality education. We know that the most important thing a kid who is \nliving in poverty can get is 3 years of tremendous instruction. If they \ndo, we can close the achievement gap. We know we can.\n  There is a lot of attention paid to this question of how we get rid \nof low-performing teachers, and having been a superintendent, I am all \nfor it. But the most important question or fact we need to observe is \nthat we are losing 50 percent of our teachers from the profession in \nthe first 5 years. What is it we can do to keep teachers longer than \nthat? We can't keep them for 30 years anymore. It is not going to \nhappen. We imagine that is going to happen. We have exactly the same \nsystem that was designed when we had a labor market that discriminated \nagainst women and said: You have two choices--one is being a teacher \nand one is being a nurse. So come teach Julius Caesar every year for 30 \nyears of your life in the Denver public schools.\n  Those days are over. They are over. Our compensation system and the \nway we train people and the way we inspire people to teach needs to \nchange to match the labor market we have today. We could not solve that \nproblem in this bill. That problem is not going to be solved here, but \nwe did create more flexibility when we rewrote title II, which has been \nessentially a slush fund of lousy professional development, and we \nfocused our funding on opportunities for teachers to serve as mentors \nand academic coaches. Eagle, Durango, and Adams 12 in our State are \nleading the way in these innovative practices.\n  We create support for teacher residency programs inspired by the \nDenver and Adams State teacher residency programs so that we are not \nsaying we are going to have to rely on higher education programs that \nare not going to prepare our teachers to do the work we need them to \ndo. Instead, we are going to train them in classes with master teachers \nso they can perfect the craft of teaching. They can bring their \ncontent-matter expertise, and they can learn how to teach in the place \nthat matters, which is in school.\n  We have resources to train great principals because there is nothing \nmore frustrating for teachers than somebody in their building who \ndoesn't know how to lead.\n  We have funding to help modernize the teacher profession for \npreparation, recruitment and hiring, replacement and retention, \ncompensation, and professional development.\n  I am often asked what is the one thing that will change outcomes in \nour schools. What I tell people is that there is not one thing, it is \neverything. There is almost nothing about the incentives and \ndisincentives in our K-12 system that are aligned to the outcomes we \nwant for kids--almost nothing. What we say is: On all of these \ndifferent dimensions, school districts, feel free to innovate and feel \nfree to use some Federal resources on the most important thing you can \ndo, which is making sure you have a great workforce in your building.\n  We have funding to create differentiated compensation systems and \nincreased school leader autonomy to support the reshaping of \ninstructional time, planning time, and professional development. We are \nnot going to hire teachers in Washington. We shouldn't hire teachers in \nWashington, but as I said earlier, we do have a vital national interest \nin knowing we have a pipeline of the very best people who are coming to \nteach our kids.\n\n  I did not mean this to sound political or sound like a politician or \nsound a little bit like that, but, believe me, there is nobody in this \nroom who has a job that is harder than being a teacher. There is nobody \nin this building who has a job that is harder than being a teacher in a \nhigh-poverty school--nobody. Nobody. That is the hardest job you can \nhave. We train people in ways that don't prepare them for the work, we \ngive them leadership that doesn't support them in the work they are \ntrying to do, and we pay them a crummy wage that no one in their \ncollege class would subject themselves to. No wonder that fewer than \none-third of eligible voters under the age of 30 would recommend \nteaching as a job to a friend.\n  Until we change that, until we have a system that says that teaching \nis a great and noble profession, that it is something we can do as a \nway to give back to the community, a way to build the future of this \ncountry, and 70 percent of American voters are saying ``I would \nrecommend that to a friend,'' we know we are not on the right track. \nThis bill doesn't solve the problem, but it points the way to \nflexibility that I think is vitally important--flexibility around \nteachers and also innovation to try new things, funding for schools and \ndistricts to innovate. St. Vrain instituted a STEM academy that ought \nto be replicated all over. Northwest BOCES is modernizing professional \ndevelopment and support for rural educators. We have some very \nimportant parts of this bill related to rural schools, and Denver \nPublic Schools has developed a unique English learners program. These \nare the kinds of things that can be replicated with the innovation \ndollars that are in this bill.\n  Very important to me, the bill supports the replication and expansion \nof high-quality charter schools, which we have seen have great success \nin Denver.\n  I mentioned support for rural schools and districts. We have support \nfor rural districts that I heard from that said: Michael, it is all \nwell and good that Denver is able to get that grant money, but we don't \nhave a grant writer to be able to do it.\n  This will give them assistance to be able to write those grants, and \nit will allow rural communities for the first time--like the community \nthe Presiding Officer is from--to be able to come together, as they \nwant to do, and apply jointly for funds from the Federal Government.\n  On accountability, very importantly, we kept the requirement for \nannual\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\ntesting in this bill. I hate testing as much as anybody else. Believe \nme, the Bennet girls who are students in the Denver public schools hate \ntesting more than anybody else. But it is critically important that \nuntil we can figure out another measure, the only way we can measure \ngrowth of kids is through that annual test. I commend Chairman \nAlexander for keeping that option alive in his opening bill, and we \nkept it in the end.\n  It still requires that we break down data so we can see how kids of \ncolor are doing compared to their peers and how low-income kids are \ndoing compared to wealthier kids. It requires that States address the \nbottom 5 percent of schools and requires States to deal with the \nstubborn cases of high-performing schools where there are kids in \nsubgroups--kids of color and in particular special needs kids--who \naren't succeeding and aren't performing.\n  It also relents in important respects and says that decisions about \nhow to change schools don't belong in the Federal Government, don't \nbelong with the Department of Education, but they belong at home. I \nagree with that completely.\n  I want to close, and I say to the Presiding Officer, forgive me for \nasking for a few more additional moments. I want to thank all the \nColoradoans who helped us write this bill. I thank the Colorado \nAssociation of School Executives, the Colorado Association of School \nBoards, the Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado Board of \nCooperative Educational Services, the Colorado Education Association, \nthe American Federation of Teachers in Colorado, the dozens of teachers \nwho took time to speak with us, numerous school districts and \nsuperintendents who provided us feedback and ideas, civil rights groups \nacross the State, including the NAACP, the Urban League, and Padres & \nJovenes Unidos, the Colorado Impact Aid advocates, Colorado's Children \nCampaign, Colorado Succeeds, the Charter School League, Rural Schools \nAlliance, Colorado PTA, Clayton Early Learning, the Merage Foundation, \nthe Colorado Education Initiative, and many more.\n  This is a great day in the Senate. It is proof that we can overcome \nour differences and come together and actually solve problems. But it \nis only the start of what we have to do. It is the next generation of \nAmericans that is going to have the opportunity we have. In this global \neconomy, this shrinking economy, in some ways this savage economy, it \nis going to be harder and harder to get by without an education. It is \ngoing to be harder to get by with something north of a high school \ndiploma, harder to get by with something less than a college education. \nIt is hard to get by if you don't have access to midcareer education so \nyou can change your profession. But we have taken a step forward in \nthis bill.\n  I look forward to the day when I can come to the floor based on the \nresults that we see to demonstrate that the ZIP Code you are born into \ndoesn't determine the education you get; when we are actually funding \nwhat we say we are funding in order to close the achievement gap; when \nwe see that kids 0 to 5 actually have access to those 30 million words \nthat their more affluent peers have; when we can say that every kid in \nAmerica is going to a school that any Senator in this place would be \nproud to send their kids; when we can say to anybody in America who has \nworked hard through their K-12 education and been admitted to the best \ncollege they could get into that ``You can go there and not bankrupt \nyourself or your family.'' Then we can come to the floor and say we are \nnot treating children like they are someone else's children; we are \ntreating America's children like they are America's children. And I \nthink we can get there working together.\n  I will close by again saying thank you to my colleagues on the HELP \nCommittee. Thank you to Senator Alexander and Senator Murray and their \ncounterparts in the House of Representatives. Thank you for all of your \ngood work.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleague, the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8535-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8535-S8538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS TAX REPEAL ACT\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, together we rise to share our concerns \nabout the devastating impact of the Cadillac tax enacted as part of \nObamaCare. As the Presiding Officer knows, I know, and those around the \ncountry know, the Cadillac tax is a 40-percent excise tax set to take \neffect in 2018 on employer-sponsored health insurance plans.\n  My colleagues from across the country have heard the same concerns \nthat I have. As both my friend from New Mexico and I have heard, this \n40-percent tax will increase costs, significantly reduce benefits, or \nresult in employers getting rid of their employer-sponsored health care \ncoverage all together.\n  This is precisely why Senator Heinrich and I have offered the Middle \nClass Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2015, the only bipartisan piece \nof legislation that would fully repeal this onerous tax. Our bill has \n22 bipartisan cosponsors. We all agree that this tax should be fully \nrepealed because we know it will have a negative effect on hard-\nworking, tax-paying Americans. This was clearly demonstrated last week \nwhen the Senate overwhelmingly supported and adopt our amendment to \nfully repeal the Cadillac tax by a vote of 90 to 10.\n  Organized labor, the chamber of commerce, local and State \ngovernments, small businesses, seniors, and, together, 90 percent of \nthe Senate--we put forth a solution to fix a problem affecting many \nAmericans and their families. It is very rare these days to see this \nmuch agreement in Washington. Members on both sides of the aisle--\nSenator Heinrich and I--came together, listened to what our \nconstituents had to say, and sent a mandate to the President to repeal \nthis tax. Today we will discuss why fully repealing the 40-percent \nexcise tax is so important for middle-class families. Whether it is \nthrough our legislation, which is S. 2045, the Middle Class Health \nBenefits Tax Repeal Act of 2015, or through other must-pass \nlegislation, we hope to address this by the end of the year. Senator \nHeinrich and I will do everything we can within our power to repeal \nthis tax.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership in making real \nprogress in fully repealing the Cadillac tax a reality, as we are here \nto speak about today. With our vote last week, the Senate sent a clear \nmessage that we can, and we should, fully repeal this tax. It takes \nboth sides of the aisle listening to the American people.\n  With that, I ask Senator Heinrich what he has heard from his \nconstituents that makes full repeal of the Cadillac tax so important.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I start by thanking my colleague, \nSenator Heller of Nevada, for his partnership and his leadership in \npushing this issue forward and doing so effectively. I think the \namendment we saw last week speaks to just how bipartisan this has \nbecome and how important it is. These days, there truly aren't many \nthings around this place where we get a 90-to-10 vote.\n  This tax, which will go into effect in 2018, was meant to help pay \nfor other parts of the Affordable Care Act by charging a 40-percent tax \non the highest cost, employer-based health plans. It was supposed to \ntarget only overly generous health plans--the ``Cadillacs on the health \ncare highways,'' so to speak. In practice, however, the tax has become \nmore of a ``Ford Focus tax.'' It will impact middle-income families \nwho, for reasons that are largely outside their control, have health \nplans that already or soon will reach their policy limits.\n  The tax will force many employers to pay steep taxes on their \nemployees' health plans and flexible spending accounts. It will \npossibly eliminate some employer-provided health care plans altogether.\n  The Cadillac tax has already limited options for New Mexicans to curb \ncosts and keep plans affordable. Let me give an example. I recently \nheard from Jamie Wagoner, the benefits and compensation manager for the \ncity of Farmington, NM. Under her leadership, the city began \nimplementing wellness programs to slow the increase in health\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\nspending--exactly what we all wanted. Unfortunately, the city recently \nlearned that its wellness programs would ultimately be factored in as a \nbenefit subject to the Cadillac tax.\n  It doesn't make sense that benefits designed to promote health and \nwellness, and ultimately drive down costs, actually end up triggering \nthis new tax. This creates an inverted incentive for employers to avoid \npreventive benefits, such as wellness programs, that we all know are \ncentral to keeping our health care costs under control.\n  There are better ways to pay for the good things in the Affordable \nCare Act. Doing away with this onerous tax on employees' health \ncoverage before it goes into effect will protect important benefits for \nworkers and ensure that businesses and families get a fair deal.\n  I have always opposed this tax on the middle class, and I worked to \nstrip it from the ACA when I was a freshman legislator in the House of \nRepresentatives. In New Mexico, small business owners, labor unions, \ncounties, rural electric co-ops, municipalities--you name it--all \noppose the tax. When was the last time we had a piece of legislation \nthat united all of those constituencies?\n  That is why Senator Heller and I introduced the Middle Class Health \nBenefits Tax Repeal Act of 2015 to fully repeal this tax. This \nbipartisan effort also has companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives--legislation that has 178 cosponsors from both sides of \nthe aisle. There was a vote on an amendment that Senator Heller offered \nto include a full repeal of the Cadillac tax in the budget \nreconciliation bill, and the amendment was adopted 90 to 10, as my \ncolleague pointed out.\n  The landmark reforms in the ACA have given thousands of my \nconstituents access to affordable, quality health care for the first \ntime in their lives. But even the strongest supporters of this law know \nit is not perfect, and there are some parts of it that we absolutely \nneed to fix. This is one of them.\n  Republicans and Democrats need to put aside the partisan politics, \nput aside the grandstanding, and remember why Congress passed the ACA \nin the first place--to expand access to quality health care for all \nAmericans. We need to work together to produce pragmatic policy that \nhelps us achieve that goal.\n  So I ask my colleague from Nevada specifically how this Cadillac tax, \nas it is called, would impact his residents and constituents in the \nState of Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nthe question. It is a simple answer. That answer is 1.3 million \npeople--1.3 million Nevadans are affected by this Cadillac tax. There \nare 1.3 million workers who have employer-sponsored health insurance \nplans, and they will all get hit by this Cadillac tax.\n  Let me tell you what I am talking about. In this case, we are talking \nabout public employees across the State. We are talking about service \nindustry workers, those who work in Las Vegas on the Strip. They will \nbe impacted by this legislation. We are talking small business owners \nacross the State of Nevada. They all know they are going to get hit by \nthis 40-percent excise tax. Not to be left out, of course, are the \nretirees, the seniors in the State of Nevada that will also be affected \nby this particular tax.\n  We are talking about three things: reducing benefits, increasing \npremiums, and also higher deductibles. Let me repeat the three things \nthat this excise tax does: It reduces benefits, increases premiums, and \nraises deductibles. These are three things that none of us want to see, \nnot in this Chamber. All these lead to more money being taken out of \nthe pockets of taxpayers and hard-working families.\n  For those who supported this law, this tax was intended to go after \nhigh-cost plans provided to the very wealthiest Americans. Clearly, we \nsee in this colloquy back and forth that is not the case. This is going \nto hurt every middle-class, hard-working, tax-paying American.\n  We know this tax is hard hitting, and it will affect the middle \nclass. For that purpose, the Senator from New Mexico and I have brought \nthis legislation to this floor. Again, we will repeat, it was a 90-to-\n10 vote--something we don't see very often in this Chamber. I believe \nthat kind of a vote is a message for every American.\n  I said on the floor recently when we were having this debate that \nnobody in America supports this; nobody in America supports a 40-\npercent excise tax on their health care benefits. Nobody does. There \nmay be a few here in Washington, DC, but when you get outside of \nWashington, DC, nobody supports it. That is why we are having this \ndiscussion today, so we can inform not only Nevadans, not only New \nMexicans but our colleagues here in this Chamber how important and how \nonerous this is.\n  Having said that, maybe we can get more information on what the \nCadillac tax really does, and we will hear the answer to that question \nfrom Senator Heinrich.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, the whole policy objective of the Cadillac tax was \nsupposed to cap excessive spending as a way to reduce health care \nspending and to generate revenue for other parts of the ACA. Obviously, \nthe popular name of the tax implies that it is only going to hit a few \nindividuals with gold-plated health insurance plans. When this was \nproposed and included in the ACA, people cited Goldman Sachs' executive \nhealth benefits plans as sort of the poster child for the Cadillac \nplan. Obviously, they chose very wisely in the way that they branded \nthis. But this tax targets many plans that aren't gold plated; they are \nbarely bronze plated. It solidly taxes middle-class workers.\n  Proponents of the Cadillac tax are operating under the clearly flawed \npremise that plans with overly generous benefits are the primary \ndrivers of increased health insurance programs, and we know today that \nis not the case. The data doesn't back it up.\n  According to a 2014 report, the richness of plan benefits accounts \nonly for about 6 percent of the overall increases in a plan's premium \ngrowth. The costs of employer health plans are actually driven by \nfactors that are largely out of the control of the actual beneficiary--\nthings like the group's size, the health status of the firm's \nemployees, or the age band for those employees. Geography alone \naccounts for 69.3 percent of a plan's premium growth, which obviously \nwould be completely unaffected.\n  It is clear that the Cadillac tax will hurt millions of workers, \ntheir families, retirees--all with health plans of modest value. This \nincludes low- and moderate-income families, people on fixed incomes \nbecause they are retirees, public sector employees, small businesses, \nthe self-employed, including three-quarters of a million New Mexicans. \nLet me put that in perspective: There are only 2 million of us.\n  I ask Senator Heller, my colleague from the Silver State: What are \nemployers in the State of Nevada expecting will happen when the \nCadillac tax goes into effect if we aren't able to pass this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, to answer the question of the Senator from \nNew Mexico: As he just mentioned, three-quarters of a million New \nMexicans will be affected by this legislation. As I said earlier, 1.3 \nmillion Nevadans will be affected. I think we have 3 million, so \nroughly half of Nevadans are going to be affected by this excise tax--a \n40-percent excise tax.\n  Fortunately, through Senator Heinrich's hard work and our efforts \nhere on this floor, again, I repeat, we passed this legislation 90 to \n10. I think it bears heavily on the hard work my friend from New Mexico \ndid to get this in front of this Chamber.\n  As we can imagine, if 1.3 million Nevadans are affected by this, you \nwill hear from all of them. You do. You hear from all of them. I have \nheard from large companies, I have heard from small businesses, and I \nhave heard from health care employees such as hospitals and the \nAmerican Cancer Society. Organized labor in Nevada has contacted my \noffice, as have senior citizens throughout my State. They are all \nsaying the same thing. They are saying: The Cadillac tax needs to be \nfully repealed or our employees will experience massive changes to \ntheir health care. I think that bears repeating. The Cadillac tax needs \nto be fully repealed or our employees will experience massive changes \nto their health care.\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\n  Large employers who negotiate multiyear contracts are seeing this tax \ncome up quickly for 2018. Yes, this tax goes into effect in the year \n2018. As my friend from New Mexico and I know, they are negotiating \nthese contracts today. For 2018, they are negotiating contracts for \nlarge companies, labor organizations, and even public employees--today \nfor 2018. That is why it is so important at this moment. They are \nplanning and negotiating with employers now for how this tax will \nimpact their employees' benefits within the next 2 years.\n  I was talking with D. Taylor from the Culinary Union, a prominent \norganized labor group in my home State of Nevada, as well as in New \nYork City and California. D. told me that if Congress doesn't repeal \nthe Cadillac tax, culinary employees will see massive changes to their \nhealth care plans.\n  In a letter he sent me in September, urging Republicans and Democrats \nto work together on this issue--which we are--he called the 40-percent \nexcise tax a ``dark cloud . . . that has already started to impact \nnegotiations and shift costs to [their] members.'' That is what it is \ndoing to the Culinary Union in Nevada. It is a dark cloud, according to \nD. Taylor, and it is already impacting negotiations, shifting costs \nover to the employers.\n  To make matters worse, the chief financial officer of a waste \nrecycling company, Action Environmental, recently told the Wall Street \nJournal that his company would consider getting rid of its employee \ncoverage altogether because of ObamaCare's Cadillac tax.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question at \nsome point?\n  Mr. HELLER. Certainly.\n  Mr. SASSE. It doesn't need to be now.\n  Mr. HELLER. Let me finish this.\n  He said: ``I'd be lying if I said we haven't had that discussion.'' \nAgain, this goes back to the chief financial officer of a waste and \nrecycling company.\n  Delta Airlines expects ObamaCare will cost it $100 million per year. \nImagine that, one company--Delta Airlines--and the ACA will cost them \n$100 million per year. One reason for new costs is the 40-percent \nexcise tax on Delta's employee health benefits.\n\n  As if Americans don't have enough trouble as it is with issues with \nairlines these days, just add a 40-percent excise tax. Some have \nidentified the Cadillac tax as a tax that just hits unions or a tax \nthat just hits wealthy Americans, but the Cadillac tax is a tax on the \nmiddle class. I think we know that. I think we understand that. That is \nwhy we saw the vote we did last week. It is a tax on small businesses, \nit is a tax on the middle class, and it is a tax on retirees.\n  With that, I know we have a question from my friend from Nebraska. I \nwish to give him an opportunity to raise that question.\n  Mr. SASSE. Thank you, sir, and the Senator from New Mexico. Thank you \nfor letting me get in.\n  I know we don't have a lot of genuine open debates around here, so I \nwant to be honest. This is a little bit awkward to delicately step onto \nthe floor.\n  I was listening to the debate. I wasn't planning to speak, but I \nthought I would ask the question. I think the pay-fors in ObamaCare are \nproblematic across the board. I am not a particular defender of any of \nthese pay-fors, but I would ask sincerely, Why would you two be \ninterested in prioritizing changing the tax deductibility or the limits \nfor people who already have tax-protected insurance, but we are not \ntalking about any sort of tax break for the small business people who \nhave none?\n  The simple fact is we have the particular problems we have in America \nin health care because of wage and price controls at the end of World \nWar II, where if an employee could get an extra dollar of wages, they \nwould clearly be taxed, but if they got an extra dollar of benefits \nthrough their large employer group, that would be tax-free. That is \nlimitless, but that tax benefit only applies to people who are in large \ngroups. If you are in a small business, you don't get any \ndeductibility.\n  I am not disagreeing with the specific policy you are advocating, but \nI would ask why would we prioritize this policy when there is no \nconversation happening on the floor for all the small business men and \nwomen in America, the farmers and ranchers who get absolutely zero tax \nprotection? I am trying to understand the prioritization.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I want to first welcome our colleague from Nebraska to \nthis conversation. I am sure he has heard a lot about this from his \nconstituents as well. I think the reason the timing of this is so \ncritical is because we see the impacts of this coming at the moment. We \nstill have enough time to do something about it, but we are already \nseeing the impacts on people who are negotiating contracts now, the \nimpacts of business plans for this.\n  I think the Senator from Nebraska raises a valid question in that we \nhave a certain incentive built into the current system by virtue of \nhaving large health care plans, employer-based plans not be taxed. I \nactually think it points a way to a more reasonable and elegant way to \npotentially pay for things in the ACA that some of us value, but that \ndoesn't mean we shouldn't also have that conversation about individual \nplans and small business and farm and ranch plans because obviously \nthose are people who have a very hard time attaching themselves to \nthese large pools.\n  Mr. SASSE. I thank the Senator. I think we all know we need to do \ngenuine health care reform sometime soon in the future because the \nreality is, the No. 1 driver of uninsurance in America is not \npreexisting medical conditions, although we all should empathize with \nthe 4 million of the 320 million of us in America who have uninsurable \npreexisting medical conditions, but we are dealing with something on \nthe order of 70 to 80 million Americans in a given calendar year who \npass through a period of uninsurance, and the vast majority of them are \nuninsured because of our insurance pooling arrangements that are still \nan artifact of the 1940s and 1950s, where people had one job for \ndecades at a time.\n  When I was a college president, until a year ago coming to join you \nall here, and I would shake kids' hands at graduation when they walked \nacross the stage, they were not going to just change jobs, they were \ngoing to change industries three times in their first decade \npostcollege. The No. 1 driver of uninsurance in America is job change. \nThese kinds of policies that we are debating on the floor today make it \nharder to create portable health insurance plans that go with people \nacross job and geographic change, which is actually what is driving the \nuninsurance in America.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me to sneak in for a minute. I am a \nrookie learning my way around here, but I was on the floor listening to \nyour debate. Thank you for the opportunity.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \ninput. He is right. There is a broader discussion that has to be had. \nThe Senator from New Mexico and myself are trying to hit on an issue \nthat we feel is vitally important going forward as this new excise tax \nhits the American people in 2018.\n  To the Senator from Nebraska, I have no doubt that there is a much \nbroader discussion that needs to be discussed on health care. In fact, \nthis discussion the Senator from New Mexico and I are having isn't on \nthe Affordable Care Act at this point. We are not discussing the \nAffordable Care Act. We are talking about a principle within it--a tax \nincrease that we believe is onerous and important today. What you are \nsaying is important. Don't get me wrong. It ought to be discussed. We \nhave to find a venue to have that discussion. Thank you very much for \nyour involvement.\n  I want to ask the Senator from New Mexico how this 40-percent excise \ntax would affect workers in New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. According to one source, the Kaiser Family Foundation, \none in four employers that offer health care benefits will be affected \nby the Cadillac tax in 2018 if their plans remain unchanged. Despite \nthe fact that the tax doesn't go into effect until then, many employers \nhave already begun scaling back their coverage to avoid that. Despite \nthe fact that the tax itself is set to go into effect in 2018, we are \nalready seeing the impacts to small businesses, to economies now.\n  As employers consider ways to lower the costs of their health care \nplans, many are shifting costs to their employees. Increased \ndeductibles, copays,\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\nout-of-pocket maximums, higher copayments and deductibles leave many, \nespecially low- and middle-income workers, underinsured, who are \nexactly the folks who were not supposed to be touched by the Cadillac \ntax. These are definitely people in my State who are not driving \nCadillacs. I can assure you of that.\n  According to a study by the American College of Emergency Physicians, \nhigher out-of-pocket costs result in delayed medical care as many forgo \nessential care when they get sick and become less likely to fill their \nprescriptions or stick to their doctors' treatment plans, and those \nwith higher out-of-pocket costs are also more likely to seek medical \ntreatment in emergency rooms--the most expensive way to get health care \ntreatment. This is precisely what we were trying to avoid with the \nadvent of the Affordable Care Act.\n  I want to ask my colleague from Nevada, in particular, you mentioned \na number of different constituencies whom you have heard from about \nthis tax--people such as the culinary workers. Are they upper class, \nCadillac-driving constituents or are they middle-class folks who are \njust trying to put food on the table and maybe send their kids to \ncollege someday? Who is going to be impacted by this?\n  Mr. HELLER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I want to go to the \nsame report. I think it clarifies his point and the question he just \nasked me.\n  Again, as he mentioned, 1.3 million Nevadans are going to be affected \nby this 40-percent excise tax. Three-quarters of a million New Mexicans \nare going to be affected by this excise tax. So I have hard time \nbelieving that most of them are wealthy enough to have to pay and for \ntheir employers to have to pay this kind of tax.\n  Let's go back to the Kaiser Family Foundation--a report that you \nquoted from. I have a number of statistics. I think it will better \nclarify. There is a quote in here that I want to emphasize that answers \nthe point and the question you brought out. According to the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, employees who have job-based insurance have \nwitnessed their out-of-pocket expenses climb from $900 in 2010 to \n$1,300 in 2015. That is an average. That is on average a 50-percent \nincrease in their health care costs in the last 5 years. Employees \nworking for small businesses now have deductibles over $1,800 on \naverage. Kaiser also noted that the deductibles have risen nearly seven \ntimes faster than workers' earnings since 2010.\n  If you are the average middle-class family, with an average income, \ncan you imagine your deductibles rising seven times faster than your \nearnings have since 2010? Here is the quote from Kaiser's president, \nDrew Altman, that really answers your question:\n\n       It's quite a revolution. When deductibles are rising seven \n     times faster than wages . . . it means that people can't pay \n     their rent . . . they can't buy their gasoline. They can't \n     eat.\n\n  If that doesn't answer the question of who is getting affected by \nthis--they are individuals who go month to month, week to week, day to \nday on their wages. When you have deductibles rising seven times faster \nthan your earnings, you get to a point, as Mr. Altman said, that you \ncan't pay your rent, you can't pay your gas, and you can't afford to \neat.\n  As deductibles rise, another way employers are planning on avoiding a \nmassive new tax is by eliminating their popular health savings \naccounts--HSAs--and FSAs. Over 33 million Americans who have FSAs and \n13.5 million Americans who are using HSAs may see these accounts vanish \nin the coming years as companies scramble to avoid this 40-percent \nexcise tax. HSAs and FSAs are used for things such as hospital and \nmaternity services. HSAs and FSAs are used for things such as childcare \nand dental care, physical therapy, and access to mental health \nservices. Access to these lifesaving services could all be gone for \ntens of millions of Americans if the Cadillac tax is not fully \nrepealed. Deductibles are rising, premiums are rising, and services are \nbeing cut.\n  Today we have talked a lot about how employers are making major \nchanges to their workers' health care in order to avoid this tax. If \nemployers--whether it is a union or private company--are changing their \nemployees' health care benefits to avoid the Cadillac tax, this tax is \nnot going to generate the kind of revenue the Congressional Budget \nOffice originally anticipated.\n  To that question directly, I ask Senator Heinrich, are CBO's cost \nassumptions accurate?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank the Senator for the question because I think \nthis is incredibly important. The CBO estimated that the ACA would \ngenerate $93 billion over 10 years with this tax, but when you drill \ndown on that, only one-quarter of that--about $23 billion--actually \ncomes from excise tax receipts themselves. The remaining three-quarters \ncomes from revenue that would be theoretically generated from increases \nin taxable wages that some economists expected would be coupled with \nreductions in health care benefits. In other words, all the money you \nare saving, you are going to pass on to the employees in the form of a \nraise. We simply know that is not what happens in the real world. In \nfact, employer surveys over the past few years have conclusively \npointed to one unifying fact, that at best employers will not raise \nwages for their workers to compensate for downgrading of employee \nhealth insurance benefits.\n  In fact, a recent American Health Policy Institute study found that \nthree-quarters of employers said that they would not raise wages in \norder to make up for less comprehensive health insurance plans.\n  I say to Senator Heller, I know we are being joined by the leader \nhere, and I am going to have to run to another event in a few minutes, \nbut I want to ask you if you would maybe consider a quick wrapup. I \nwant to make the point that I think we have gotten as far as we have \nwith this effort because of the incredible leadership you have shown, \nbecause of the bipartisan nature of this effort, because it is simply \ncommon sense that we need to make sure people have easier access to \naffordable care, and that the Cadillac tax may have sounded good at the \ntime, but we are clearly learning today that this is a Ford Focus tax \nthat will hit your middle-class families, my middle-class working \nfamilies, and it is something we ought to be able to agree should be \nrepealed.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I want to wrap this up. I know the leader \nis here, and I want to give him ample time.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his comments and for his help \nand support on this legislation moving forward. I appreciate all the \nwork to get this bipartisan bill to the finish line, and I know we will \ncontinue to work together to repeal this bad tax. Once again, whether \nit is my bipartisan bill, our bipartisan bill, this Chamber's \nbipartisan bill or a year-end package like tax extenders, we need to \nrepeal this bad tax. Fully repealing the Cadillac tax is an opportunity \nfor Republicans and Democrats to work together and join forces to \nappeal a bad tax for one purpose, and that is to help 151 million \nworkers keep the health insurance they love.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8538-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8538-S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO WILL RIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nWill Ris for his service to American aviation and to congratulate him \non his well-deserved retirement.\n  For nearly 20 years, Will has been senior vice president of \ngovernment affairs for American Airlines--the principal government \nrelations executive for the airline. His diverse responsibilities \ninclude directing all of American's activities with Congress, the \nadministration, and several Federal agencies. And what could possibly \nbe better than waking up every day and helping Congress and the Federal \nGovernment better understand the airline industry?\n  Earlier this year, Will announced that he will retire from American \nAirlines at the end of this month.\n  Will Ris's impact on American Airlines and its people cannot be \noverstated. Since joining American in 1996, Will has been a dedicated \nrepresentative and the voice of the airline and its people; but, more \nimportantly, he has been a trusted advocate on Capitol Hill. I have \nworked with Will and his American Airlines team on countless issues \nthat affect passenger air service\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\nat Chicago O'Hare International Airport and throughout downstate \nIllinois. His honesty, professionalism, patience, and sense of humor \nhave made him one of the most sought after advisors on airline industry \nissues. He will be missed.\n  During Will's tenure at American, he led the effort to protect the \ndomestic aviation industry, assure the continued viability of passenger \nservice, and establish new security measures in the wake of the attacks \nin 2001. He has also led the effort to gain public and political \nsupport for the merger between American and U.S. Airways--creating a \nstrong, competitive airline employing more than 100,000 people all over \nthe world.\n  American Airlines chairman and CEO Doug Parker recently honored Will \nwith these words: ``Will understands commercial aviation and cares \nabout the frontline professionals who are the backbone of our business. \nWill embodies all of the best things about American Airlines, and \nthanks to his extraordinary efforts, American will be great for \nyears.''\n  Prior to joining American, Will represented the airline as outside \ncounsel for 13 years as the executive vice president of the Wexler \nGroup. He also served as a trial attorney for the U.S. Civil \nAeronautics Board from 1975 to 1978. In 1978, Will was appointed \ncounsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation and its Aviation Subcommittee. In this post, Will played \na major role in drafting the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and \nsuccessfully navigating the legislative maze all the way to President \nJimmy Carter's desk for his signature. This landmark law changed the \nface of commercial aviation in this country.\n  Will Ris's love of aviation and passion for American Airlines is well \nknown, but more importantly, Will is known as one of the most decent \nmen in Washington. He spends countless hours committed to community \nservice. He serves as chairman emeritus of the board of directors of \nthe Green Door, Inc., the oldest and largest behavioral health \nproviders--helping nearly 1,600 people every year battling chronic \nmental health and substance abuse conditions. Additionally, he serves \nas vice chair of the American Association of People with Disabilities--\nthe country's largest cross-disabilities membership organization. He is \nalso a director of the Ford's Theater board of governors, the Business-\nGovernment Relations Council, the Advanced Navigation and Positioning \nCorporation in Hood River, OR, and a member of the board of trustees \nfor the Woolly Mammoth Theater right here in Washington, DC. Where does \nhe find the time?\n  I want to congratulate Will Ris on his distinguished career and thank \nhim for his service to American Airlines. I have had the privilege in \npublic life to meet some outstanding people; I count Will Ris as one of \nthose people. I wish him and his wife, Nancy, all the best in the next \nchapter of their lives.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8539-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION CBO COST ESTIMATE--\n                                S. 2044\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, when the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation filed its report on S. 2044, the Consumer Review \nFreedom Act of 2015, the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office \nwas not available.

John Thune,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2044, the Consumer \n     Review Freedom Act of 2015.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Susan \n     Willie.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Keith Hall.\n\n              S. 2044--Consumer Review Freedom Act of 2015\n\n       S. 2044 would void provisions of certain types of contracts \n     that:\n       Restrict the ability of a party to the contract from \n     publishing a review or analysis of the performance of another \n     party under the contract;\n       Impose a penalty or fee for publishing such a review; and\n       Transfer or require the transfer of any rights to the \n     intellectual property of the person who created the review.\n       The bill would prohibit the use of contracts that contain \n     those provisions and authorize the Federal Trade Commission \n     (FTC) to enforce those new prohibitions. In addition, the FTC \n     would be authorized to seek civil penalties for violations of \n     the new prohibitions. Finally, S. 2044 would direct the FTC \n     to develop an education and outreach program to provide \n     businesses with best practices for complying with the new \n     restrictions.\n       Based on information from the FTC, CBO estimates that the \n     cost of implementing S. 2044 would not be significant because \n     the agency is able to enforce similar prohibitions and \n     provide compliance assistance under its existing general \n     authorities. CBO estimates that enacting S. 2044 would \n     increase federal revenues from the added authority to collect \n     civil penalties; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. \n     However, we expect those collections would be insignificant \n     because of the small number of cases that the agency would \n     probably pursue. Enacting the bill would not affect direct \n     spending.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 2044 would not increase net \n     direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four \n     consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2026.\n       S. 2044 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would not \n     affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Although the Federal Trade Commission has begun to enforce \n     prohibitions on contract provisions similar to those outlined \n     in the bill under its existing authorities, to the extent \n     that such provisions are not currently considered void in all \n     jurisdictions, the bill would impose a private-sector mandate \n     as defined in UMRA on entities that use such provisions in \n     their contracts. The cost of the mandate would be the value \n     of forgone income from out-of-court settlements and \n     compensation for damages the entities could be awarded under \n     a breach of contract claim. However, reliable and \n     comprehensive information concerning the number of businesses \n     that continue to use contracts containing such provisions, \n     the number of those that require monetary payment, and the \n     level of any such payments is not available. In addition, \n     although the court cases in which consumers have challenged \n     these provisions have resulted in judgments in favor of the \n     consumer, the limited sample of such cases cannot be used to \n     generalize about the results of such cases in other \n     jurisdictions. Therefore, CBO cannot determine whether the \n     cost of the mandate would exceed the annual threshold \n     established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($154 million \n     in 2015, adjusted annually for inflation).\n       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Susan Willie \n     (for federal costs) and Logan Smith (for the impact on the \n     private sector). The estimate was approved by H. Samuel \n     Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8539-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8539-S8540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 4305 of S. Con. Res. 11, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016, allows the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, \naggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation related \nto health care reform. The authority to adjust is contingent on the \nlegislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2016-2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \nyears 2016-2025.\n  I find that H.R. 3762, as passed the Senate, fulfills the conditions \nof deficit neutrality found in section 4305 of S. Con. Res. 11. \nAccordingly, I am revising the allocations to the Committee on Finance, \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, and the \nbudgetary aggregates to account for the budget effects of the bill. I \nam also adjusting the unassigned to committee savings levels in the \nbudget resolution to reflect that, while there are savings in the bill \nattributable to both the HELP and Finance Committees, the Congressional \nBudget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation are unable to produce \nunique estimates for each provision due to interactions and other \neffects that are estimated simultaneously.\n  The adjustments that I filed on Thursday, December 3, 2015, are now \nvoid and replaced by these new adjustments.\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide \ndetails about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS\n  (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and\nSection 4305 of S.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service of Thomas ``Al'' Logsdon. A dedicated educator \nand a longtime community leader, Al represents Hoosier values at their \nfinest.\n  Beginning his career in 1964 after graduating from Western Kentucky \nUniversity with a degree in biology and Spanish, he taught science and \ncoached several sports. From 1970 to 2003, Al has served as the \nprincipal of several schools across Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois.\n  During this time, Al continued his education earning a Master of \nScience and Education Specialist degrees from Murray State University \nin 1970 and 1980, respectively.\n  As principal, Al led his schools to great success and they received \nwell-deserved awards for their hard work and achievement. In both 2000 \nand 2003, Heritage Jr./Sr. High School was selected as one of the top \nsix schools in Indiana, as well as being honored with the International \nReading Association's National Award in 2000 for having an outstanding \nhigh school reading program. Al was honored as the Indiana High School \nPrincipal of the Year in 1989 and was selected by his peers to serve \nboth on the executive committee of the Indiana Principal's Association \nand to represent them for 8 years as State coordinator to the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals.\n  In 2005, Al was elected Spencer County Commissioner. In that \ncapacity, Al maintains various responsibilities, but one that he \nconsiders to be among the most rewarding and challenging has been \nserving as president of the drainage board. The board's initiative of \ncreating a nine-member advisory board, which makes recommendations \nacross the county, won statewide recognition by the Indiana Association \nof County Commissioners. Al later served on the State board of the \nIndiana Association of County Commissioners and eventually as \npresident, as well as serving on the Association of Indiana \nCommissioners Executive Board.\n  Never one to leave teaching completely, Al became involved in \nnational, State, and local teacher retirement organizations currently \nserving as the president of the Spencer County Retired Teachers \nAssociation.\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\n  Since his retirement, Al has been serving as a private consultant for \nan organization in southwestern Indiana that is engaged in assisting 32 \nschools implement school improvement plans. He is also spending time \nwith several school districts in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and \nIndiana, helping them in efforts to begin schoolwide reading programs \nfor all students.\n  In addition to his longstanding community service, Al is a loving \nhusband, father, and grandfather. Al's wife, Jeanne, is a retired \nschoolteacher, and together, they have four children and six \ngrandchildren. In his free time, Al has enjoyed coaching three sports \nand officiating basketball and baseball contests. He is a member of the \nKnights of Columbus Chapter at St. Francis of Assisi Church, a member \nof Optimist Club, and serves on the Spencer County Bank Board of \nDirectors. He enjoys visiting with family and friends, as well as \ntraveling, reading, fishing, and, of course, playing golf.\n  Today I honor Al's legacy of service and wish to express my sincere \ngratitude for his leadership and dedication to his community and our \ngreat State of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8541-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING OUR LADY OF MOUNT CARMEL SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I wish to applaud Our Lady of \nMount Carmel School of Carmel, IN, for being recognized as a 2015 \nNational Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has \nrecognized over 7,500 public and nonpublic schools that have \ndemonstrated a vision of educational excellence for all students, \nregardless of their social or economic background. Since its inception, \nthis program has offered the opportunity for schools in every State to \ngain recognition for educational accomplishments in closing the \nachievement gaps among student groups.\n  Our Lady of Mount Carmel School continues to be one of the best \nperforming schools in the State of Indiana. It has been named an \nIndiana Four Star School.\n  In 2014, Our Lady of Mount Carmel School's ISTEP+ pass rate for \nEnglish/Language Arts scores increased reached 96.9 percent. \nMathematics scores increased to 98.8 percent combined for third through \nfifth grades.\n  Our Lady of Mount Carmel School's effectiveness can be found in its \nholistic approach and dedication to student achievement.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the extraordinary life of Douglas Shorenstein, a loving \nhusband, father, brother, passionate philanthropist, and pillar of the \nSan Francisco community who passed away on November 24 after a long and \ncourageous battle with cancer.\n  A proud San Francisco native, Douglas Shorenstein was born on \nFebruary 10, 1955. After graduating from the University of California, \nBerkeley and the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, \nDoug worked as a real estate attorney in New York before returning to \nhis beloved hometown in 1983 to join his father's real estate \ninvestment and management firm, Shorenstein Properties. Doug became \nchairman and CEO in 1995 and over the years transformed his local \ndevelopment company into a major national real estate group. A true \nvisionary, Doug had a keen ability to keep his thumb on the pulse of \nSan Francisco's evolving market. Because of him, key neighborhoods of \nSan Francisco have been revitalized, and the company once started by \nhis father now owns iconic buildings in cities across America.\n  Doug also dedicated his immense talents to supporting many important \ncauses that were dear to his heart. He was a board member of the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, a member of the University of California \nSan Francisco Medical Center Executive Council, and on the boards of \nseveral educational institutions, including the Shorenstein Center on \nMedia, Politics, and Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of \nGovernment, Vanderbilt University, and the Yale School of Management. \nHe was also appointed to serve on the board of directors of the Federal \nReserve Bank of San Francisco in 2007, becoming chairman of the board \nin 2011.\n  San Francisco has lost a true civic leader, and Doug will be deeply \nmissed by all of us fortunate enough to have known him. I send my \ndeepest condolences to his wife, Lydia; his children, Brandon, Sandra, \nand Danielle; and his sister, Carol Shorenstein Hays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8542-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1461.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CONFIRMATION BY SENATE OF \n                   PENDING NATIONAL SECURITY NOMINATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the terrorist attacks in November 2015 demonstrate the \n     need for renewed vigilance to prevent an attack on the United \n     States homeland;\n       (2) national security positions throughout the United \n     States Government are essential to protect the safety of the \n     American public, and vacancies in such positions hurt our \n     efforts to combat terrorists;\n       (3) greater global coordination will be required to defeat \n     the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), so the Senate \n     should promptly confirm pending nominations to positions of \n     ambassador in order to represent United States national \n     security interests abroad;\n       (4) to assist with negotiations on global anti-terror \n     efforts, the Secretary of State should have a full complement \n     of political and career senior advisors, so the Senate should \n     confirm pending nominations to such positions;\n       (5) intelligence sharing with our allies could prevent an \n     attack on the United States homeland, so the Senate should \n     confirm pending nominations to intelligence positions of the \n     Department of Defense and in other elements of the \n     intelligence community;\n       (6) service members are on the front lines of the fight \n     against terror, so the Senate should confirm pending \n     nominations for promotion in the Armed Forces;\n       (7) cutting off the money supply for the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and Syria is a critical part of United States strategy \n     to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, so the Senate \n     should confirm pending nominations to positions in the \n     Department of the Treasury with responsibility for disrupting \n     terrorist financing networks; and\n       (8) the Senate should confirm the pending nominations to \n     national security positions described in this resolution \n     without further delay.\n\n                       Subtitle B--Combating ISIS\n\n     SEC. 111. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The terrorist organization known as the Islamic State \n     of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) poses a grave threat to the people \n     and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, to regional \n     stability, and to the national security interests of the \n     United States and its allies and partners.\n       (2) ISIS holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria and \n     is a growing threat in other countries and has stated its \n     intention to seize more territory and demonstrated the \n     capability to do so.\n       (3) ISIS has claimed responsibility for or conducted \n     horrific terrorist attacks, including hostage-taking and \n     killing, in Sousse, Tunisia; Ankara, Turkey; the Sinai in \n     Egypt; Beirut, Lebanon; Paris, France, against a Russian \n     charter plane, and elsewhere.\n       (4) ISIS has brutally murdered United States citizens, as \n     well as citizens of many other countries.\n       (5) ISIS has stated that it intends to conduct further \n     terrorist attacks internationally, including against the \n     United States, its citizens, and interests.\n       (6) ISIS has committed despicable acts of violence and mass \n     executions against Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not \n     subscribe to the depraved, violent, and oppressive ideology \n     of ISIS, and has targeted innocent women and girls with \n     horrific acts of violence, including abduction, enslavement, \n     torture, rape, and forced marriage.\n       (7) ISIS has threatened genocide and committed vicious acts \n     of violence against other religious and ethnic minority \n     groups, including Iraqi Christians, Yezidi, and Turkmen \n     populations.\n       (8) ISIS finances its operations primarily through looting, \n     smuggling, extortion, oil sales, kidnapping, and human \n     trafficking.\n       (9) As a result of advances by ISIS and the civil war in \n     Syria, there are more than 4,000,000 refugees, more than \n     7,500,000 internally displaced people in Syria, and nearly \n     3,200,000 internally displaced people in Iraq.\n       (10) President Barack Obama articulated a multi-dimensional \n     approach in the campaign to counter ISIS, including \n     supporting regional military partners, stopping the flow of \n     foreign fighters, cutting off the access of ISIS to \n     financing, addressing urgent humanitarian needs, and exposing \n     the true nature of ISIS.\n       (11) In August 2014, President Obama directed the United \n     States Armed Forces to build and work with a coalition of \n     partner nations to conduct airstrikes in Iraq and Syria as \n     part of the comprehensive strategy to degrade and defeat \n     ISIS.\n       (12) Since August 2014, United States and coalition nation \n     aircraft have flown more than 57,000 sorties in support of \n     operations in Iraq and Syria, including airstrikes that have \n     destroyed staging areas, command centers, thousands of \n     armored vehicles, oil and other financing infrastructure, and \n     other facilities and equipment of ISIS.\n       (13) Coalition airstrikes have killed at least 100 high-\n     value individuals, including a United States strike against \n     Mohamed Emwazi, known as ``Jihadi John''.\n       (14) ISIS is under pressure from a coalition of 65 nations, \n     which is conducting air strikes, supporting local forces on \n     the ground, and cutting off financial support to ISIS, \n     thereby evicting ISIS from as much as a quarter of the \n     territory it previously controlled.\n\n     SEC. 112. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States condemns the horrific and cowardly \n     attacks by ISIS, particularly the recent attacks in Tunisia, \n     Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, and France;\n       (2) it is critical that the response to ISIS by the United \n     States and the Anti-ISIS coalition, including countries \n     within the region, be multi-dimensional and consist of \n     coordinated and intensified efforts on intelligence sharing \n     and on the military, civilian, and humanitarian aspects of \n     the current campaign;\n       (3) ISIS will only be defeated if there are enduring, \n     inclusive, sustainable political solutions in Iraq and Syria \n     that enable all citizens to realize their legitimate \n     aspirations;\n       (4) the only path to a sustainable end to the civil war in \n     Syria is a diplomatic solution that removes Bashar al-Assad;\n       (5) the United States and our coalition partners must \n     continue to conduct the campaign of airstrikes against ISIS \n     in both Syria and Iraq to counter ISIS forces and deny it a \n     safe haven;\n       (6) no matter how effective the air campaign, defeating \n     ISIS requires reliable, effective, and committed local forces \n     on the ground in Syria and Iraq to clear and hold territory \n     retaken from ISIS, including continuing to work with Kurds in \n     Syria and Iraq, Sunnis in Iraq, and the moderate opposition \n     in Syria;\n       (7) the United States and our coalition partners must work \n     with local forces in Iraq and Syria to identify and strike \n     ISIS targets and support local forces in the fight on the \n     ground;\n       (8) the United States and our coalition partners must build \n     the capabilities and capacities of our local partner forces \n     in Syria and Iraq and across the region to sustain an \n     effective long-term campaign against ISIS;\n       (9) United States and coalition advisors and enablers are \n     critical to improving the ability of local forces to plan, \n     lead, and conduct operations against ISIS;\n       (10) the United States and our coalition partners must \n     continue to target the leadership of ISIS, deny it sanctuary \n     and resources to plan, prepare, and execute attacks, and \n     degrade its command and control infrastructure, logistical \n     networks, oil and other revenue networks, and other \n     capabilities;\n       (11) the United States and our coalition partners must work \n     to improve the security of the borders of Syria and end the \n     flow of new foreign recruits to ISIS, including working with \n     Turkey and local forces to control the entire Turkey-Syria \n     border;\n       (12) the United States and our coalition partners must make \n     sure that the commanders on the ground have the operational \n     flexibility required to execute the mission against ISIS, \n     particularly related to the activities of special operations \n     forces in Syria; and\n       (13) appropriate resources and attention should be applied \n     to stopping the spread of ISIS and its apocalyptic ideology \n     to other countries and regions, including North Africa, \n     Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n\n                  Subtitle C--Combating ISIS Financing\n\n     SEC. 121.

Res. 332\n\n       Whereas the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association (in \n     this preamble referred to as the ``M.E.B.A.'') was founded in \n     1875 and is the oldest maritime union in the United States;\n       Whereas, soon after the founding of the M.E.B.A., the \n     M.E.B.A. battled for beneficial legislation to certify, \n     license, and protect waterborne engineers;\n       Whereas the M.E.B.A. prevailed in securing deck and engine \n     officers of the United States aboard flagships of the United \n     States, displacing foreign seamen;\n       Whereas, since 1875, the M.E.B.A. has been the premier \n     maritime labor union for the officers of the United States \n     Merchant Marine;\n       Whereas the members of the M.E.B.A., including thousands of \n     marine engine and deck officers, are unparalleled in maritime \n     training and experience;\n       Whereas M.E.B.A. members crew the most technologically \n     advanced ships in the flag fleet of the United States, \n     including container ships, tankers, Great Lakes and liquefied \n     natural gas vessels, and a cruise ship;\n       Whereas M.E.B.A. members sail aboard Government-contracted \n     ships of the Military\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\n     Sealift Command of the United States Navy and the Ready \n     Reserve Force of the Maritime Administration, on tugs and \n     ferry fleets around the United States, and in various \n     capacities in shoreside industries;\n       Whereas M.E.B.A. members provide critical support to the \n     United States by carrying cargo to aid the Armed Forces of \n     the United States in overseas conflicts;\n       Whereas, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the commercial, \n     privately-owned fleet, crewed by civilians of the United \n     States, carried more than 85 percent of the materials and \n     equipment needed by the United States and the allies of the \n     United States to achieve victory;\n       Whereas, since 1875, M.E.B.A. members have served in every \n     conflict and war in which the United States has been \n     involved, including the Spanish-American War, World Wars I \n     and II, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       Whereas the M.E.B.A. brings critical food aid to starving \n     people in Ethiopia, Somalia, and dozens of other countries \n     around the world;\n       Whereas, as the people of the United States watched the \n     tragedy of September 11, 2001 unfold, members of the M.E.B.A. \n     ferried thousands of people to safety in New York;\n       Whereas, during the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita, the tsunami in Southeast Asia, and countless other \n     disasters, the M.E.B.A. was there with the professionalism, \n     pride, and patriotism that has long been the hallmark of \n     mariners of the United States;\n       Whereas the M.E.B.A. has its own maritime training center, \n     the Calhoon M.E.B.A. Engineering School in Easton, Maryland, \n     which keeps seafaring members on the cutting edge of the \n     industry; and\n       Whereas the Calhoon M.E.B.A. Engineering School was \n     originally located in Baltimore because of the rich maritime \n     tradition in that city but later moved to the Eastern Shore \n     of Maryland when the school needed to expand: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commemorates the 140th \n     anniversary of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8559-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act.\n  I am pleased that the Senate was able to come together on a \nbipartisan basis to pass meaningful education reform, and I commend \nSenator Murray and Senator Alexander for their leadership on this bill.\n  I would like to speak about three things this bill does that I \nstrongly support and that I believe are of particular importance. \nFirst, the bill supports financial literacy programming. Family \nfinancial literacy programming can ensure that our Nation's parents and \nchildren have the skills necessary to properly utilize credit, finance \nan education, manage a household budget, and plan for retirement. I \nbelieve that we must do all we can to help our Nation's parents and \nstudents succeed in every aspect of their lives.\n  Second, the Every Student Succeeds Act addresses the lack of data on \ndual status youth--children who come into contact with both the child \nwelfare and juvenile justice systems. Many at-risk children lack stable \nhome lives, and they are frequently funneled through the school-to-\nprison pipeline. I was happy to work with the chairman and ranking \nmember to include language in the bill that will help us identify and \nassist our most vulnerable youth.\n  Finally, I was happy to join Senator Gardner in introducing language \nthat will begin to help schools address the dual enrollment \navailability gap by enabling high schools to expand access to such \nprograms using title I funding. I applaud the bill's focus on dual \nenrollment and early/middle college programs. At a time when student \ndebt is crushing young Americans' economic prospects, dual enrollment \nand early/middle college programs allow high school students to begin \nearning college credit by taking college-level courses either at their \nschool, online or through a local higher education institution. These \nmodels improve access to college while reducing degree completion time \nand tuition costs.\n  Findings from the ACT's most recent ``Condition of College and Career \nReadiness'' report suggest that many students are ready for dual \nenrollment programs. Forty-two percent of the most recent cohort of \nhigh school graduates who took the ACT test were ready for college-\nlevel mathematics. Nearly 30 percent were college ready in all four \nsubject areas: English, reading, mathematics, and science.\n  Unfortunately, hurdles to assessing dual enrollment are particularly \npronounced for low-income students who also face the greatest obstacles \nto college completion. After participating in these programs, many \nstudents who may not have planned on attending college realize their \npotential and go on to attain higher levels of education. A recent \nstudy found that dual and concurrent enrollment participation increases \nthe probability of a student completing a degree by 6 percent.\n  In addition to a Gardner-Peters amendment, the Every Student Succeeds \nAct includes several other provisions that support dual enrollment and \nearly/middle college programs. The bill supports professional \ndevelopment for teachers, principals, and other school leaders, focused \non building their capacity to deliver dual or concurrent enrollment \nopportunities.\n  Additionally, States and school districts will be able to use \nresources provided through the student support and academic enrichment \ngrants to improve students' access to dual enrollment programs, either \nonline or in person. These policy improvements will make an incredible \ndifference for the Nation's students.\n  There are a number of Senators who support dual enrollment and early/\nmiddle college programs, and I plan on introducing legislation to \nsupport dual enrollment and early/middle college programs in the near \nfuture.\n  My legislation would amend the Higher Education Act to expand access \nto dual and concurrent enrollment programs as well as early/middle \ncollege programs that enable students to earn college credit while in \nhigh school. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming \nmonths to expand access to these programs.\n  Again, I applaud the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/09/senate-section/article/S8561-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
