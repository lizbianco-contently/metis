Madam President, I wish we had been able to move the \ncloture and amendment votes we will consider today to yesterday. I made \nan offer to do so because it is hard to see the point in allowing yet \nanother day to elapse when everyone has already had a chance to say \ntheir piece, when the end game appears obvious to all, and when the \nneed to move forward in a thoughtful but expeditious manner seems \nperfectly clear. But this is the Senate, and Members are entitled to \ndifferent views and Members have tools to assert those views. It is the \nnature of the body where we work.\n  Moreover, it is important to remember that it was not just the denial \nof consent which brought us to where we are. The kind of short-term \nextension that would have provided the Senate with the time and space \nit needed to advance bipartisan compromise legislation through regular \norder was also blocked in a floor vote.\n  But what has happened has happened, and we are where we are. Now is \nthe time to put all that in the past and work together to diligently \nmake some discrete and sensible improvements to the House bill.\n  Before scrapping an effective system that has helped protect us from \nattack in favor of an untried one, we should at least work toward \nsecuring some modest degree of assurance that the new system can, in \nfact, actually work. The Obama administration also already told us that \nit would not be able to make any firm guarantees in that regard--that \nit would work--at least the way the bill currently reads. And the way \nthe bill currently reads, there is also no requirement--no \nrequirement--for the retention and availability of significant data for \nanalysis. These are not small problems.\n  The legislation we are considering proposes major changes to some of \nour Nation's most fundamental and necessary counterterrorism tools. \nThat is why the revelations from the administration shocked many \nSenators, including a lot of supporters of this legislation. It is \nsimply astounding that the very government officials charged with \nimplementing the bill would tell us, both in person and in writing, \nthat if it turns out this new system doesn't work, then they will just \ncome back to us and let us know. If it doesn't work, they will just \ncome back and let us know. This is worrying for many reasons, not the \nleast of which is that we don't want to find out the system doesn't \nwork in a far more tragic way. That is why we need to do what we can \ntoday to ensure that this legislation is as strong as it can be under \nthe circumstances.\n  Here are the kinds of amendments I hope every Senator will join me in \nsupporting today.\n  One amendment would allow for more time for the construction and \ntesting of a system that does not yet exist. Again, one amendment would \nallow for more time for the construction and testing of a system that \ndoes not yet exist.\n  Another amendment would ensure that the Director of National \nIntelligence is charged with at least reviewing and certifying the \nreadiness of the system.\n  Another amendment would require simple notification if telephone \nproviders--the entities charged with holding data under this bill--\nelect to change their data-retention policies. Let me remind my \ncolleagues that one provider has already said expressly and in writing \nthat it would not commit to holding the data for any period of time \nunder the House-passed bill unless compelled by law. So this amendment \nrepresents the least we can do to ensure we will be able to know, \nespecially in an emergency, whether the dots we need to connect have \nactually been wiped away.\n  We will also consider an amendment that would address concerns we \nhave heard from the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts--in other words, the lifetime Federal judges who actually serve \non the FISA Court. In a recent letter, they wrote that the proposed \namicus provision ``could impede the FISA Courts' role in\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nprotecting the civil liberties of Americans.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  So the bottom line is this: The basic fixes I have just mentioned are \ncommon sense. Anyone who wants to see the system envisioned under this \nbill actually work will want to support them. And anyone who has heard \nthe administration's ``we will get back to you if there is a problem'' \npromise should support these modest safeguards as well.\n  We may have been delayed getting to the point at which we have \narrived, but now that we are here, let's work cooperatively, seriously, \nand expeditiously to move the best legislation possible and prevent any \nmore delay and uncertainty.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Administrative Office of the\n\n\n                                         United States Courts,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Devin Nunes,\n     Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House \n         of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 2048, the ``USA \n     Freedom Act,'' which was recently ordered reported by the \n     Judiciary Committee, to provide perspectives on the \n     legislation, particularly an assessment that the pending \n     version of the bill could impede the effective operation of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts.\n       In letters to the Committee on January 13, 2014 and May 13, \n     2014, we commented on various proposed changes to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Our comments focused on \n     the operational impact of certain proposed changes on the \n     Judicial Branch, particularly the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court (``FISC'') and the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review (collectively ``FISA Courts''), \n     but did not express views on core policy choices that the \n     political branches are considering regarding intelligence \n     collection. In keeping with that approach, we offer views on \n     aspects of H.R. 2048 that bear directly on the work of the \n     FISA Courts and how that work is presented to the public. We \n     sincerely appreciate the ongoing efforts of the bipartisan \n     leadership of all the congressional committees of \n     jurisdiction to listen to and attempt to accommodate our \n     perspectives and concerns.\n       We respectfully request that, if possible, this letter be \n     included with your Committee's report to the House on the \n     bill.\n\n\n                          Summary of Concerns\n\n       We have three main concerns. First, H.R. 2048 proposes a \n     ``panel of experts'' for the FISA Courts which could, in our \n     assessment, impair the courts' ability to protect civil \n     liberties by impeding their receipt of complete and accurate \n     information from the government (in contrast to the helpful \n     amicus curiae approach contained in the FISA Improvements Act \n     of 2013 (``FIA''), which was approved in similar form by the \n     House in 2014). Second, we continue to have concerns with the \n     prospect of public ``summaries'' of FISA Courts' opinions \n     when the opinions themselves are not released to the public. \n     Third, we have a few other specific technical concerns with \n     H.R. 2048 as drafted.\n\n\n                       Nature of the FISA Courts\n\n       With the advent of a new Congress and newly proposed \n     legislation, it seems helpful to restate briefly some key \n     attributes of the work of the FISA Courts.\n       The vast majority of the work of the FISC involves \n     individual applications in which experienced judges apply \n     well-established law to a set of facts presented by the \n     government--a process not dissimilar to the ex parte \n     consideration of ordinary criminal search warrant \n     applications. Review of entire programs of collection and \n     applications involving bulk collection are a relatively small \n     part of the docket, and applications involving novel legal \n     questions, though obviously important, are rare.\n       In all matters, the FISA Courts currently depend on--and \n     will always depend on--prompt and complete candor from the \n     government in providing the courts with all relevant \n     information because the government is typically the only \n     source of such information.\n       A ``read copy'' practice--similar to the practices employed \n     in some federal district courts for Title III wiretap \n     applications--wherein the government provides the FISC with \n     an advance draft of each planned application, is the major \n     avenue for court modification of government-sought \n     surveillance. About a quarter of ``read copies'' are modified \n     or withdrawn at the instigation of the FISC before the \n     government presents a final application--in contrast to the \n     overwhelming majority of formal applications that are \n     approved by the Court because modifications at the ``read \n     copy'' stage have addressed the Court's concerns in cases \n     where final applications are submitted.\n       The FISC typically operates in an environment where, for \n     national security reasons and because of statutory \n     requirements, time is of the essence, and collateral \n     litigation, including for discovery, would generally be \n     completely impractical.\n       At times, the FISA Courts are presented with challenging \n     issues regarding how existing law applies to novel \n     technologies. In these instances, the FISA Courts could \n     benefit from a conveniently available explanation or \n     evaluation of the technology from an informed non-government \n     source. Congress could assist in this regard by clarifying \n     the law to provide mechanisms for this to occur easily (e.g., \n     by providing for pre-cleared experts with whom the Court can \n     share and receive information to the extent it deems \n     necessary).\n\n\n The ``Panel of Experts'' Approach of H.R. 2048 Could Impede the FISA \n                              Courts' Work\n\n       H.R. 2048 provides for what proponents have referred to as \n     a ``panel of experts'' and what in the bill is referred to as \n     a group of at least five individuals who may serve as an \n     ``amicus curiae'' in a particular matter. However, unlike a \n     true amicus curiae, the FISA Courts would be required to \n     appoint such an individual to participate in any case \n     involving a ``novel or significant interpretation of law'' \n     (emphasis added)--unless the court ``issues a finding'' that \n     appointment is not appropriate. Once appointed, such amici \n     are required to present to the court, ``as appropriate,'' \n     legal arguments in favor of privacy, information about \n     technology, or other ``relevant'' information. Designated \n     amici are required to have access to ``all relevant'' legal \n     precedent, as well as certain other materials ``the court \n     determines are relevant.''\n       Our assessment is that this ``panel of experts'' approach \n     could impede the FISA Courts' role in protecting the civil \n     liberties of Americans. We recognize this may not be the \n     intent of the drafters, but nonetheless it is our concern. As \n     we have indicated, the full cooperation of rank- and-file \n     government personnel in promptly conveying to the FISA Courts \n     complete and candid factual information is critical. A \n     perception on their part that the FISA process involves a \n     ``panel of experts'' officially charged with opposing the \n     government's efforts could risk deterring the necessary and \n     critical cooperation and candor. Specifically, our concern is \n     that imposing the mandatory ``duties''--contained in \n     subparagraph (i)(4) of proposed section 401 (in combination \n     with a quasi-mandatory appointment process)--could create \n     such a perception within the government that a standing body \n     exists to oppose intelligence activities.\n       Simply put, delays and difficulties in receiving full and \n     accurate information from Executive Branch agencies \n     (including, but not limited to, cases involving non-\n     compliance) present greater challenges to the FISA Courts' \n     role in protecting civil liberties than does the lack of a \n     non-governmental perspective on novel legal issues or \n     technological developments. To be sure, we would welcome a \n     means of facilitating the FISA Courts' obtaining assistance \n     from non-governmental experts in unusual cases, but it is \n     critically important that the means chosen to achieve that \n     end do not impair the timely receipt of complete and accurate \n     information from the government.\n       It is on this point especially that we believe the ``panel \n     of experts'' system in H.R. 2048 may prove counterproductive. \n     The information that the FISA Courts need to examine probable \n     cause, evaluate minimization and targeting procedures, and \n     determine and enforce compliance with court authorizations \n     and orders is exclusively in the hands of the government--\n     specifically, in the first instance, intelligence agency \n     personnel. If disclosure of sensitive or adverse information \n     to the FISA Courts came to be seen as a prelude to disclosure \n     to a third party whose mission is to oppose or curtail the \n     agency's work, then the prompt receipt of complete and \n     accurate information from the government would likely be \n     impaired--ultimately to the detriment of the national \n     security interest in expeditious action and the effective \n     protection of privacy and civil liberties.\n       In contrast, a ``true'' amicus curiae approach, as adopted, \n     for example, in the FIA, facilitates appointment of experts \n     outside the government to serve as amici curiae and render \n     any form of assistance needed by the court, without any \n     implication that such experts are expected to oppose the \n     intelligence activities proposed by the government. For that \n     reason, we do not believe the FIA approach poses any similar \n     risk to the courts' obtaining relevant information.\n\n\n   ``Summaries'' of Unreleased FISA Court Opinions Could Mislead the \n                                 Public\n\n       In our May 13, 2014, letter to the Committee on H.R. 3361, \n     we shared the nature of our concerns regarding the creation \n     of public ``summaries'' of court opinions that are not \n     themselves released. The provisions in H.R. 2048 are similar \n     and so are our concerns. To be clear, the FISA Courts have \n     never objected to their opinions--whether in full or in \n     redacted form--being released to the public to the maximum \n     extent permitted by the Executive's assessment of national \n     security concerns. Likewise, the FISA Courts have always \n     facilitated the provision of their full opinions to Congress. \n     See, e.g., FISC Rule of Procedure 62(c). Thus, we have no \n     objection to the provisions in H.R. 2048 that call for \n     maximum public release of court opinions. However, a formal \n     practice of creating summaries of court opinions without the \n     underlying opinion being available is unprecedented in \n     American legal administration. Summaries of court opinions \n     can be inadvertently incorrect or misleading, and may\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\n     omit key considerations that can prove critical for those \n     seeking to understand the import of the court's full opinion. \n     This is particularly likely to be a problem in the fact-\n     focused area of FISA practice, under circumstances where the \n     government has already decided that it cannot release the \n     underlying opinion even in redacted form, presumably because \n     the opinion's legal analysis is inextricably intertwined with \n     classified facts.\n\n\n               Additional Technical Comments on H.R. 2048\n\n       The Judiciary, like the public, did not participate in the \n     discussions between the Administration and congressional \n     leaders that led to H.R. 2048 (publicly released on April 28, \n     2015 and reported by the Judiciary Committee without changes \n     on April 30). In the few days we have had to review the bill, \n     we have noted a few technical concerns that we hope can be \n     addressed prior to finalization of the legislation, should \n     Congress choose to enact it. These concerns (all in the \n     amicus curiae subsection) include:\n       Proposed subparagraph (9) appears inadvertently to omit the \n     ability of the FISA Courts to train and administer amici \n     between the time they are designated and the time they are \n     appointed.\n       Proposed subparagraph (6) does not make any provision for a \n     ``true amicus'' appointed under subparagraph (2)(B) to \n     receive necessary information.\n       We are concerned that a lack of parallel construction in \n     proposed clause (6)(A)(i) (apparently differentiating between \n     access to legal precedent as opposed to access to other \n     materials) could lead to confusion in its application.\n       We recommend adding additional language to clarify that the \n     exercise of the duties under proposed subparagraph (4) would \n     occur in the context of Court rules (for example, deadlines \n     and service requirements).\n       We believe that slightly greater clarity could be provided \n     regarding the nature of the obligations referred to in \n     proposed subparagraph (10). These concerns would generally be \n     avoided or addressed by substituting the FIA approach. \n     Furthermore, it bears emphasis that, even if H.R. 2048 were \n     amended to address all of these technical points, our more \n     fundamental concerns about the ``panel of experts'' approach \n     would not be fully assuaged. Nonetheless, our staff stands \n     ready to work with your staff to provide suggested textual \n     changes to address each of these concerns.\n       Finally, although we have no particular objection to the \n     requirement in this legislation of a report by the Director \n     of the AO, Congress should be aware that the AO's role would \n     be to receive information from the FISA Courts and then \n     simply transmit the report as directed by law.\n       For the sake of brevity, we are not restating here all the \n     comments in our previous correspondence to Congress on \n     proposed legislation similar to H.R. 2048. However, the \n     issues raised in those letters continue to be of importance \n     to us.\n       We hope these comments are helpful to the House of \n     Representatives in its consideration of this legislation. If \n     we may be of further assistance in this or any other matter, \n     please contact me or our Office of Legislative Affairs at \n     202-502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James C.

It happens \nevery day in America. Overall, on average, 88 Americans are killed by \ngun violence every day.\n  Today, June 2, 2015, would have been Hadiya Pendleton's 18th \nbirthday. Today also marks the first annual National Gun Violence \nAwareness Day. It is an idea that was inspired by Hadiya's family and \nfriends in Chicago. They decided they would ask us to wear something \norange today. It is a color that hunters use when they are in the woods \nto make sure that no one shoots them.\n  All across the Nation, Americans are wearing orange in tribute to \nHadiya Pendleton, in tribute to the tens of thousands of other \nAmericans killed by gun violence every year, and in support of a simple \ngoal: Keep our kids safe. I am proud to join them in wearing orange \ntoday. I want to commend Hadiya's parents--my friends--Nate and Cleo, \nher brother Nate, Jr., and her friends who have turned their pain into \npurpose.\n  They are working to reduce the scourge of gun violence and to spare \nother families and loved ones what they have gone through. I hope \nlawmakers here in Washington and throughout the Nation will pay \nattention and commit themselves to do something about these terrible \nshootings and deaths. We need to do all that we can to keep guns out of \nthe hands of those who would misuse them and, especially, keep our \nchildren safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks \non our country on 9/11/2001--terrorist attacks that killed some 3,000 \npeople--I authored legislation, along with former Senator Joe Lieberman \nof Connecticut, to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \nto reform and restructure the intelligence community, to improve its \ncapabilities, and also to increase accountability and oversight.\n  Now, this law is different and distinct from the PATRIOT Act. Our law \nestablished the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to \ncoordinate all of the agencies involved in intelligence gathering so \nthat we would reduce the possibility of the dots not being connected \nand to allow terrorist attacks and plots to be detected and thwarted.\n  Our legislation also created the National Counterterrorism Center, \nwhich helps to synthesize the information across government and share \nit with State and local governments to help keep us safer. Our bill \ncreated the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and it \ninstalled privacy officers in the major intelligence agencies.\n  But our law, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act, \nshared the common goal of the PATRIOT Act of better protecting our \nNation from terrorist attacks because none of us who lived through that \nterrible day\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\never wanted to see Americans die again because our Nation failed to use \nthe tools and capabilities it had to prevent terrorist attacks.\n  We have had terrorist attacks since that time. The Boston Marathon is \nan example of a terrorist attack that occurred despite our best \nefforts, but we have been able to thwart and uncover and detect and \nstop terrorist attacks--both here and abroad--due to the important \ntools and capabilities our government has. Like the Presiding Officer, \nI serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I have sat \nthrough countless hours of briefings, I have asked the hard questions \nabout our intelligence programs, and I have challenged those who have \ncome before us.\n  I wish to explain how the current program works at NSA because I \nbelieve there is so much misinformation about this important program. \nOne of the most egregious misinformation points that have been made is \nthat the NSA is listening to the content of calls made by American \ncitizens to other American citizens. That is simply not true.\n  Let me tell you how this program works. First, it starts with a call, \na phone number from a foreign terrorist or a foreign terrorist \norganization. When we get a foreign terrorist's--who is based \noverseas--telephone number, the NSA is allowed to query a database to \nsee if that foreign-based terrorist is calling someone in our country. \nWhy is that important? Well, we know ISIS and other terrorist groups \nhave been recruiting Americans and trying to train them to attack our \ncountry. That is why it is important.\n  Only 34 highly trained, vetted Federal employees are allowed to query \nthat database, and even then they are allowed to do so only if a \nFederal judge finds that a standard has been reached to allow that \nquery to be made. Even if that query is approved by that Federal judge, \nthe analyst can only see the phone numbers called by the terrorist, the \ndate, the time, and the duration of the call.\n  If there is a match, then the case is turned over to the FBI for \nfurther investigation. The FBI must get a court order to wiretap the \nphone of the American who is talking to that foreign terrorist.\n  Last month, during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, I asked \nthe Attorney General whether there have ever been any privacy \nviolations regarding that telephone data. She replied no.\n  I am truly perplexed that anyone would argue that telephone data are \nbetter protected in the hands of 1,400 telecom companies and 160 \nwireless carriers than in a secure NSA database that only 34 carefully \nvetted and trained employees are allowed to query under the supervision \nof a Federal judge.\n  Under the USA FREEDOM Act--the House bill--when we get the telephone \nnumber of an overseas terrorist, we potentially are going to have to go \nto each one of those 1,400 telecom companies, 160 wireless carriers, \nwhich potentially will involve thousands of people. The privacy \nimplications are far greater if we have the telecoms control the data, \nfar greater.\n  Moreover, we know private sector data is far more susceptible to \nhackers, to criminals. Look at all the breaches of sensitive data that \nhave occurred during the past year alone. Plus, I simply don't think \nthe system will work without a data-retention requirement now that most \ncarriers have flat-rate telephone plans that don't require detailed \ncall data records. The telecom companies have made very clear they will \noppose any bill with a data-retention requirement, and there will be a \nrace to the bottom to market the data in a way that says to people: \nSign up with us and your data will be safe from the government.\n  That kind of demagoguery--even though the commerce committee has done \nan excellent study that shows the data broker companies sell our \npersonal data, including our names, our phone numbers, our addresses to \nthe highest bidder for telemarketing and other purposes, and some of \nthat data ends up in the hands of con artists.\n  So I don't see how vesting the authority in the telecom \ncommunications companies increases the privacy of our data, safeguards \nit. I think just the opposite is the case. It is going to be less \nsecure because it is going to be more exposed to hackers and criminals \nwho will attempt to do data breaches and have successfully done so. It \nis going to be less secure because instead of 34 people having access \nto just the phone numbers and call duration data, we are going to have \npotentially thousands of people who are going to be asked to query \ntheir database. The system is going to be less effective because there \nis absolutely no guarantee this data will be retained by the telecom \ncompanies and the wireless carriers.\n  Finally, I am persuaded by the cautions given to us, by the direct \nwarnings of former Director of the FBI Robert Mueller and the former \nDeputy Director of the CIA Mike Morell, who tell us that had this \nprogram been in place prior to 9/11, it is likely that terrorist plot \nwould have been uncovered and thwarted.\n  The fact is the House bill substantially weakens a vital tool in our \ncounterterrorism efforts at a time when the terrorist threat has never \nbeen higher. The current program has never been abused. The government \ncannot listen to your phone calls or read your emails unless there is a \ncourt order--because you are directly communicating with an overseas \nterrorist--and then it goes to the FBI for investigation.\n  It is a false choice that we have to choose between our civil \nliberties and keeping our country safe. There are actions we can and \nshould take to strengthen the privacy protections in the NSA program. \nSeveral were included in the bipartisan bill reported by the \nIntelligence Committee last year. Unfortunately, the USA FREEDOM Act \nprovides a false sense of privacy at the expense of our national \nsecurity.\n  For these reasons, while I will support the amendments today to try \nto make modest improvements to the House bill, I simply cannot support \nthe bill on final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 7 minutes, to be divided between Senator Leahy and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ncourtesy.\n  The fact is the USA FREEDOM Act that was passed overwhelmingly in the \nHouse of Representatives--that has strong bipartisan support here--is \nsupported by the Director of National Intelligence. It is also \nsupported by our Attorney General. It is supported by our intelligence \ncommunity. And it is a step forward because, ultimately, the \nlegislation protects the privacy of individuals.\n  I agree with the Senator from Maine that we have strong restrictions \nat the NSA on the information. However, they were not strong enough, of \ncourse, to stop Edward Snowden from walking off with all the \ninformation that was there.\n  We had six public hearings on these issues in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee last Congress. The original USA FREEDOM Act was introduced by \nSenator Lee and me and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner in the other body.\n  We all knew section 215, the roving wiretap authority, and ``lone \nwolf'' provision, would expire June 1, 2015. That is why we started \nworking to change it. We are also well aware of the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals decision that made part of the program illegal.\n  I think what we have in the USA FREEDOM Act is a carefully crafted \nbill by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate. \nThat is why it passed 338 to 88 in the House. If we start amending it, \nwe don't know how much longer it is going to take and we end up with no \nprotections. I think that is not a choice we want to make.\n  On Sunday night, with only a few hours before the sunset of section \n215 and the other two expiring FISA authorities, Republican leadership \nin the Senate finally agreed to begin debate on the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  For nearly 2 years, I have been working on a bipartisan basis with \nmembers in both the Senate and the House to address these matters. As \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee last Congress, I convened \nsix public hearings to examine the NSA's bulk collection program and \nconsider reforms to\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nsection 215 and other surveillance authorities.\n  In October 2013, I introduced the original USA FREEDOM Act with \nCongressman Jim Sensenbrenner, Senator Lee, and others. We introduced \nan updated version of the USA FREEDOM Act in 2014 and pushed for the \nSenate to pass that bill last November, months before Sunday's \nexpiration date.\n  The American people were demanding meaningful reforms, but the \nintelligence community also needed operational certainty.\n  We all knew that section 215, the roving wiretap authority, and the \nlone wolf provision would expire on June 1. That is why I started \nworking months ago with Members of Congress from both parties and both \nChambers to forge a compromise that protects both Americans' privacy \nand our national security.\n  We were able to reach agreement on a bill that certainly does not go \nas far as I would like, but that definitively ends the NSA's bulk \ncollection of phone records, improves transparency and accountability, \nand includes other important reforms. Our bill--the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2015--is a carefully crafted bill that has now earned the support of \nthe intelligence community, privacy and civil liberties groups, \nlibrarians, the tech industry, and a bipartisan super-majority of the \nRepublican-led House of Representatives. Our bill represents \nsignificant progress toward real surveillance reform.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the Senate has tried to \nblock this progress at every turn. They blocked the Senate from \ndebating the USA FREEDOM Act last November. They again blocked the \nSenate from debating the bill 2 weeks ago, despite knowing full well \nthat failure to swiftly consider the House-passed bill would lead to \nexpiration of these critical surveillance authorities. This \nbrinksmanship is not a responsible way to govern.\n  The expiration of the PATRIOT Act provisions on Sunday night was \nentirely avoidable, and the unfortunate consequence of a manufactured \ncrisis. The Senate must now act responsibly and swiftly. It is time to \npass the USA FREEDOM Act, which would restore the expired provisions \nand add much needed improvements and reforms.\n  I hope that we will invoke cloture and then quickly dispense with any \ngermane amendments so that we can move to passage of the bill. The \nHouse passed the USA FREEDOM Act almost 3 weeks ago by an overwhelming \n338 to 88 vote.\n  Senator Lee and I sought an open amendment process in the Senate, but \nwe were blocked. Now, we simply do not have any time to spare. The \nSenate must pass this bill without any amendments so that the President \ncan sign it into law immediately and restore these expired provisions \ntoday.\n  A vote for any amendment is a vote to prolong the expiration of the \nsurveillance authorities that ended on Sunday. If the Senate changes \nthe underlying bill in any way, it must go back to the House for its \nconsideration, and there are no guarantees that it will pass the new \nbill.\n  In fact, Chairman Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee, Ranking \nMember Conyers, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and Congressman Nadler \nwarned that ``[t]he House is not likely to accept the changes proposed \nby Senator McConnell. Section 215 has already expired. These amendments \nwill likely make that sunset permanent.''\n  Let us have no more unnecessary delay or political brinksmanship. It \nis time to do our jobs for the American people--to protect their \nprivacy and maintain our national security. Now is not the time to seek \nunnecessary changes to this bill. If Senators believe that the Senate \nshould consider some of these changes, we can consider them after we \npass the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I urge Senators to vote for cloture because we need to move forward. \nWe cannot afford to waste any more time. The USA FREEDOM Act includes \nimportant reforms, and we need to give the intelligence community the \ntools they need to keep us safe. That means we must pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act without change and without any more unnecessary delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I first want to thank my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Vermont, for his tireless work on \nthis issue. Senator Leahy and I, along with Senator Heinrich and so \nmany others who are participating in this process, have worked together \nto develop a legislative strategy that is both bicameral and \nbipartisan. This legislation we are about to vote on today was passed \nwith an overwhelming supermajority in the House of Representatives--338 \nvotes to 88 votes. This is a testament to the fact that in so many \ninstances there is more that unites us than divides us in today's \npolitical environment. This is an example of the type of win-win \nsituation we can develop.\n  This bill protects America's national security, and it does so in a \nway that is respectful of the privacy interests and both the letter and \nthe spirit of the Fourth Amendment.\n  The American people understand intuitively that it is none of the \ngovernment's business whom they are calling, when they are calling \nthem, who calls them, and how long their calls last. The American \npeople intuitively understand what graduate researchers have confirmed, \nwhich is that this type of calling data--even just the data itself, not \nanything having to do with recorded conversations, just the data--\nreveals a lot about an individual, about his or her political \npreferences, religious views, marital status, the number of children \nthe person may have, and all kinds of interests that are none of the \ngovernment's business.\n  Moreover, the way this data is collected is inconsistent with the way \nour government is supposed to operate. Rather than going out and \ndemonstrating some type of connection between the data set requested \nand a particular investigation, under the current system the government \nsimply issues orders saying: Send us all of your data. Send us all your \ndata on all calls made by all of your customers. We want all of it. If \nthat means 300 million phone numbers, we want all of that regardless of \nits connection to any suspected terrorist operation.\n  That is wrong. Our bill would change that, and it would change it \nquite simply by requiring the government to request information \nconnected to a particular phone number--a phone number that is itself \nsuspected of being involved in some type of terrorist activity.\n  This bill represents a good compromise. This bill represents reason. \nThis bill would protect America's national security while also \nprotecting privacy. This bill, in so doing, recognizes that our privacy \nis not and ought not ever be deemed to be in conflict with our \nsecurity. Our privacy is, in fact, part of our security.\n  We are, unfortunately, considering this bill with too little time \nleft. In effect, we are considering this bill after the PATRIOT Act \nprovisions at issue have expired. This is unfortunate. It was \nunnecessary, and it represents a longstanding bipartisan problem within \nthe Senate--a problem pursuant to which we establish cliffs. We \nestablish these artificially designed deadlines.\n  We have known about this particular deadline for 4 years. For 4 \nyears, we knew these provisions were going to expire. We should have \ntaken up these provisions far in advance of now. Many of us tried. We \ndid so unsuccessfully. Senator Leahy and I and others have been working \non this legislation for years. We have been ready, willing, eager, and \nanxious to do so, and we haven't been able to do so until very \nrecently. Now, because of the fact that these provisions have expired, \nit is incumbent upon us to move these things forward in all deliberate \nspeed.\n  Whatever the outcome of this vote and of those votes which will \nfollow later today, the American people deserve better than this. Vital \nnational security programs that touch on our fundamental civil \nliberties deserve a full, open, honest, and unrushed debate. This \nshould not be subject to cynical, government-by-cliff brinksman-\nship. If Members of Congress--particularly Republican Members of \nCongress--ever want to improve their standing among the American \npeople, then we must abandon this habit of political gamesmanship.\n  Finally, it is time for us to pass this bill--this bill which passed \noverwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, this bill which \ncarefully balances important interests the American people care deeply \nabout.\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this week the Senate will consider the USA FREEDOM Act \nof 2015, H.R. 2048. I am proud to have introduced the Senate companion \nto this bill, S. 1123, along with Senator Patrick Leahy, ranking member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have worked closely with our \npartners in the House of Representatives, House Judiciary Committee \nChairman Bob Goodlatte, Ranking Member John Conyers, and Congressmen \nJim Sensenbrenner and Jerrold Nadler.\n  Since revelations in June 2013 that the National Security Agency was \nsecretly and indiscriminately collecting Americans' telephone records, \nSenator Leahy and I have worked together on legislation to end this \nmass surveillance program and to enact greater transparency and \noversight over the government's intelligence gathering operations. The \nUSA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is the result of that 2-year collaboration, and \nit contains strong reforms. Most importantly, it would definitively end \nthe NSA's bulk collection of Americans' telephone metadata and ensure \nthat the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act pen register statute and \nthe national security letter statutes cannot be used to justify bulk \ncollection.\n  On May 13, 2015, the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act by an \noverwhelming, bipartisan 338-to-88 vote. More than 80 percent of House \nRepublicans and 75 percent of House Democrats voted for the bill, \nincluding the chairmen and ranking members of the House Judiciary and \nIntelligence Committees, as well as the leadership of both parties.\n  The resounding vote in the House is a direct result of the \ncommonsense and meaningful reforms contained in the bill. It is also a \ntestament to the will of the American people, who have been unequivocal \nin their demand for reform and their demand that the NSA stop the \nindiscriminate collection of their private records.\n  As our colleagues in the Senate consider the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, \nSenator Leahy and I want to detail the extensive legislative process \nundertaken to develop this bill and provide additional clarity on the \nbill's provisions.\n  Senator Leahy, I know that you have a long history of pushing for \nmeaningful oversight and transparency of our government's intelligence \ngathering operations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Utah for his advocacy on behalf \nof Americans' privacy rights and for his dedicated efforts to end the \nNSA's illegal program.\n  In June 2013, Americans learned for the first time that section 215 \nof the USA PATRIOT Act has for years been secretly interpreted to \nauthorize the collection of Americans' phone records on an \nunprecedented scale. And they learned that the NSA has engaged in \nrepeated, substantial legal violations in its implementation of section \n215 and other surveillance authorities.\n  Since that time, Congress and the American public have been engaged \nin an important debate about the breadth of government surveillance \npowers and the legal rationale used to authorize the collection of \nAmericans' data. Under my chairmanship last Congress, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee held six open and public hearings that sharpened \nthe committee's thinking and furthered the public dialogue on these \nimportant issues. Senator Lee, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, \nCongressman John Conyers, and I introduced bicameral, bipartisan \nlegislation, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2013, S. 1599/H.R. 3361, on October \n29, 2013, to end bulk collection and reform our surveillance laws. The \nPresident announced his support for ending the bulk collection of \nAmericans' phone records in March 2014. The House of Representatives \npassed a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act in May 2014, and after \nlengthy discussions with the executive branch, the technology industry, \nprivacy advocates, and other stakeholders, Senator Lee and I introduced \nthe USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, S. 2685, on July 29, 2014. On November 18, \n2014, the full Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, by a vote of 58 to 42.\n  Despite falling two votes shy last Congress, Senator Lee and I knew \nthat the May 31, 2015, expiration date was approaching, and we \ncontinued to work on a bill to reform these authorities. Senator Lee, \ncan you explain the process we have undertaken this year?\n  Mr. LEE. Since November 2014, Senator Leahy and I have been engaged \nin conversations with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, \nRanking Member Conyers, and Congressmen Sensenbrenner and Nadler to \ndevelop a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act. After extensive \nnegotiations with the administration, intelligence community officials, \nprivacy and civil liberties groups, the technology industry, and other \nstakeholders, we introduced the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, S. 1123/H.R. \n2048, on April 28, 2015.\n  Of course, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 was not introduced in a \nvacuum. Nearly 2 years ago, on June 5, 2013, the Guardian newspaper \npublished an article and posted a classified FISA Court order revealing \nthat the U.S. Government had been engaging in the bulk collection of \nAmericans' telephone metadata. One day later, on June 6, 2013, the \nWashington Post published an article and posted further classified \ninformation about a separate government surveillance program called \nPRISM involving the collection of the contents of Internet \ncommunications. The administration subsequently acknowledged that the \nNSA's bulk collection of telephone metadata was being conducted \npursuant to section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. The NSA's PRISM program \nto collect the contents of Internet communications of certain overseas \ntargets was being conducted pursuant to section 702 of FISA, which was \nenacted as part of the FISA Amendments Act.\n  Once these programs were revealed, then-Chairman Leahy convened a \nnumber of hearings so that the American people could better understand \nwhat the NSA was doing.\n  Senator Leahy, can you remind us of the Judiciary Committee's \nactivities in the 113th Congress?\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I mentioned, during the last Congress, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee held six open, public hearings to examine the legal \nbasis, effectiveness, and impact of these programs on Americans' \nprivacy rights and civil liberties. We heard testimony from a wide \nrange of government officials, legal scholars, technologists, and \noutside experts as the Committee sought to understand and evaluate the \nnumerous issues raised by these activities.\n  On July 31, 2013, I chaired the first full Judiciary Committee \nhearing to examine government surveillance programs with administration \nofficials and outside experts. At the hearing, the NSA Deputy Director \nconfirmed that the NSA's bulk telephony program did not help to thwart \ndozens of terrorist plots, as some administration officials defending \nthe program had been contending. He confirmed that section 215 was only \nuniquely valuable in thwarting one terrorist ``plot''--the case of \nBasaaly Moalin, a Somali immigrant who was convicted of material \nsupport for sending $8,500 to al-Shabaab in Somalia.\n  As a result of continued public debate about the government's \nsurveillance activities, on August 9, 2013, President Obama announced \nthat he was ordering the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, to \nestablish a group of outside experts to review the government's \nintelligence and communications technologies and provide \nrecommendations on possible reforms to surveillance authorities. He \nalso announced the public release of additional documents, including a \nDepartment of Justice white paper outlining the legal justification for \nthe section 215 bulk collection program.\n  Over the course of the following months, the DNI declassified and \nreleased a host of documents related to activities conducted under \nsection 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and section 702 of FISA. The \nreleased documents detailed serious incidents of noncompliance and \nviolations of law in implementing both of these programs. For example, \nthe documents revealed that for several years, the NSA was unlawfully \ncollecting thousands of wholly domestic emails and other electronic \ncommunications as part of its section 702 collection. In addition, FISA \nCourt orders relating to the section 215 program revealed significant \ncompliance problems and were highly critical of the NSA's oversight and \noperation of the program.\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\n  On October 2, 2013, I chaired a second full Judiciary Committee \nhearing on government surveillance authorities. NSA Director Alexander \nrevealed for the first time that the NSA had previously conducted a \npilot program to test its capability of handling location data as part \nof the section 215 phone records program, although he emphasized that \nit was only a test. The second panel of witnesses at the hearing \ntestified about the government's legal justification for the collection \nof telephone records under section 215. A technologist and computer \nscientist provided testimony to illustrate the power of metadata and \nthe blurring distinction between content and metadata in the digital \nage.\n  Shortly after that hearing, on October 29, 2013, I joined with \nSenator Lee, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and Congressman Conyers to \nintroduce the bipartisan, bicameral USA FREEDOM Act of 2013 to \ncomprehensively reform a range of surveillance authorities. This \nlegislation served as the basis for many of the reforms Congress is now \ndebating.\n  On November 13, 2013, Senator Franken chaired a Judiciary Committee \nsubcommittee hearing on legislation that he had introduced, the \nSurveillance Transparency Act of 2013, components of which were \nincluded in the USA FREEDOM Act. Government witnesses testified about \nexecutive branch efforts to promote greater transparency of \nsurveillance activities. In addition, several outside witnesses, \nincluding representatives from the U.S. technology industry, spoke \nabout the economic harm and damage to American technology companies as \na result of revelations of government surveillance activities. These \nwitnesses testified that American businesses stand to lose billions of \ndollars in the coming years as a result of revelations about U.S. \nsurveillance activities.\n  On November 18, 2013, the DNI declassified and released a host of \ndocuments related to a previously classified program that collected \nbulk Internet metadata. The documents included a FISA Court opinion \nauthorizing the bulk collection of Internet metadata under the FISA pen \nregister and trap and trace device authority. As with the section 215 \ntelephone metadata program, the declassified documents revealed that \nthe bulk Internet metadata collection program also encountered major \ncompliance problems during its operation. In 2011, the program was \nended by the government because it was not meeting operational \nexpectations.\n  On December 9, 2013, eight leading technology companies--AOL, Apple, \nFacebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo!--wrote an \nopen letter to President Obama and Congress laying out five \nsurveillance reform proposals. The companies called for a prohibition \non the bulk collection of Internet data and argued that governments \nshould limit surveillance to specific, known users for lawful purposes. \nThe companies also urged stronger checks and balances, including an \nadversarial process at the FISA Court.\n  On December 11, 2013, the Judiciary Committee held its fourth hearing \non these issues. At the hearing, government witnesses discussed the \npossibility of placing a privacy advocate at the FISA Court, the \nrecently declassified documents about the bulk collection of Internet \nmetadata, and the scope of collection that is permitted under \ntraditional section 215 orders. We learned that the problems with the \nInternet metadata program were so severe that the FISA Court suspended \nthe program entirely for a period of time before approving its renewal. \nBut then, in 2011, the government ended this Internet metadata program \nbecause, as Director Clapper explained, it was no longer meeting \n``operational expectations.'' However, senior government lawyers \ntestified that under the statute, there was no legal impediment to \nrestarting this bulk Internet data collection program. If the executive \nbranch--or a future administration--wanted to do so, it would simply \napply for an order from the FISA Court.\n  On December 18, 2013, the President's Review Group on Intelligence \nand Communications Technology publicly released its final report, which \nincluded 46 recommendations and findings to reform government \nsurveillance activities. The review group members included Richard \nClarke, former counterterrorism adviser to Presidents George H.W. Bush, \nBill Clinton, and George W. Bush; Michael Morell, former Acting \nDirector of the CIA; Geoffrey Stone, professor at the University of \nChicago Law School; Cass Sunstein, Harvard Law School professor and \nformer senior OMB official in the Obama administration; and Peter \nSwire, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and former \nadviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton. They concluded that the \nsection 215 phone records program had not been essential to national \nsecurity, saying: ``The information contributed to terrorist \ninvestigations by the use of section 215 telephony meta-data was not \nessential to preventing attacks and could readily have been obtained in \na timely manner using conventional section 215 orders.'' The review \ngroup further stated that ``Section 215 has generated relevant \ninformation in only a small number of cases, and there has been no \ninstance in which NSA could say with confidence that the outcome would \nhave been different without the section 215 telephony meta-data \nprogram.''\n  This sort of massive surveillance presents significant privacy \nimplications in the digital age, and the review group's report provided \nvaluable insights. The report explained that keeping a record of every \nphone call an individual has made over the course of several years \n``can reveal an enormous amount about that individual's private life.'' \nThe report further explained that in the 21st century, revealing \nprivate information to third party services ``does not reflect a lack \nof concern for the privacy of the information, but a necessary \naccommodation to the realities of modern life.'' And the report \nquestioned whether we can continue to draw a rational line between \ncommunications metadata and content. This is a critically important \nquestion given that many of our surveillance laws depend upon the \ndistinction between the two.\n  The review group also addressed the national security letter, NSL, \nstatutes. Using NSLs, the FBI can obtain detailed information about \nindividuals' communications records, financial transactions, and credit \nreports without judicial approval. Recipients of NSLs are subject to \npermanent gag orders. The review group report made a series of \nimportant recommendations to change the way national security letters \noperate. I have been fighting to impose additional safeguards on this \ncontroversial authority for years--to limit their use, to ensure that \nNSL gag orders comply with the First Amendment, and to provide \nrecipients of NSLs with a meaningful opportunity for judicial review.\n  Following release of the review group's report, the Judiciary \nCommittee then held its fifth hearing on the NSA's programs and called \nthe members of the review group to testify. On January 14, 2014, the \nmembers of the review group testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and explained that in light of changing technology and the \ncreation of more and more data, it recommended transitioning to a \nsystem where the government does not hold massive databases of \nAmericans' metadata. Rather, metadata could be held by providers or a \nthird party, and could be searched by the government only with advance \njudicial approval. The five members of the panel made clear that while \nwe must always consider ongoing threats to national security, \npolicymakers should consider all of the risks associated with \nintelligence activities: the risk to individual privacy, to free \nexpression and freedom of association, to an open and decentralized \nInternet, to America's relationships with other nations, to trade and \ncommerce, and to maintaining the public trust.\n  Following the review group's report, in January 2014, President Obama \ntook an important step to restore American's privacy and civil \nliberties by embracing the growing consensus that the section 215 phone \nrecords program should not continue in its current form. During a \nspeech at the Department of Justice, the President announced that he \nhad directed the intelligence community to develop alternatives to the \nprogram and asked the Justice Department to seek advance judicial \napproval from the FISA Court to query the section 215 phone call \ndatabase. Additionally, he ordered the\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\ngovernment to limit searches of the section 215 database to two \n``hops,'' instead of three. He also recommended reforms to the secrecy \nsurrounding national security letters.\n  A January 23, 2014, report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board, PCLOB, added to the growing chorus calling for an end \nto the government's dragnet collection of Americans' phone records. On \nFebruary 12, 2014, the Judiciary Committee held its sixth public \nhearing, this time with the members of the PCLOB to explain the \nconclusions in their report. As with the President's review group, the \nPCLOB report likewise determined that the section 215 program has not \nbeen effective, saying: ``We have not identified a single instance \ninvolving a threat to the United States in which the program made a \nconcrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. \nMoreover, we are aware of no instance in which the program directly \ncontributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot or \nthe disruption of a terrorist attack.''\n  The PCLOB report also provided the public with a detailed \nconstitutional and statutory analysis of this program and concluded \nthat the program ``lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215'' \nand ``implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth \nAmendments.'' The PCLOB report further revealed that although the FISA \nCourt first authorized this program in 2006, it did not issue an \nopinion setting forth a full legal and constitutional analysis of the \nprogram until 2013.\n  In March 2014, after consulting with the intelligence community, \nPresident Obama announced that his administration would work with \nCongress to pass legislation to end the NSA's section 215 bulk phone \nrecords collection program and to transition to a new program in which \nthe data is not held by the government. Ending bulk collection is a key \nelement of what I, Senator Lee, and others have included in the various \niterations of the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  After the President's announcement, the House of Representatives took \naction. Senator Lee, would you like to expand on what transpired in the \nHouse?\n  Mr. LEE. On May 5, 2014, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte \nannounced that he had agreed with Representatives Sensenbrenner and \nConyers on a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act. On May 7, 2014, the \nHouse Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to report this revised USA \nFREEDOM Act. The next day, the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence convened a markup to consider the version of the bill \nreported by the House Judiciary Committee and voted unanimously to \nreport the bill to the full House.\n  Following action by the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, \nfurther changes to the text of the reported bill were considered and a \nsubstitute amendment to the USA FREEDOM Act was unveiled on May 20, \n2014, when the House Rules Committee adopted a rule for floor \nconsideration. Following the release of the substitute amendment, some \nconcerns were raised that the substitute amendment did not effectively \nprohibit bulk collection, even though that was clearly its intent. On \nMay 22, 2014, the House of Representatives passed the amended version \nof the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 303 to 121. Many of those who voted \nno on the bill did so because they were concerned that its reforms did \nnot go far enough.\n  After the House passed its version of the USA FREEDOM Act, Senator \nLeahy and I worked hard to build on that legislation.\n  Senator Leahy, can you talk about what led to the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2014, S. 2685?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Immediately following passage of the House version in May \n2014, Senator Lee and I began working to address concerns that the text \nof the House bill, although clearly intended to end bulk collection, \ndid not do so effectively. We spent several months in discussions with \nthe intelligence community and a wide range of stakeholders, including \nother Senators, privacy and civil liberties groups, and the U.S. \ntechnology industry, to build on the framework established by the \nHouse-passed bill.\n  Those negotiations led to the introduction of the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2014, S. 2685, on July 29, 2014. More than 50 organizations, interest \ngroups, trade associations, and technology companies from across the \npolitical spectrum publicly endorsed the bill. On September 2, 2014, \nthe Attorney General and DNI wrote a letter in support of the USA \nFREEDOM Act of 2014. The letter noted that the bill preserved the \nintelligence community's capabilities while also enhancing privacy and \ncivil liberties and increasing transparency. Likewise, members of the \nPresident's review group wrote a letter to myself and Senator Grassley, \nexplaining that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 was consistent with the \nrecommendations contained in their December 2013 report.\n  On November 12, 2014, Senator Reid filed cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014. A few days later, on November \n17, 2014, the Obama administration released a Statement of \nAdministration Policy on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 strongly \nsupporting passage.\n  Despite the wide-ranging support for these commonsense reforms, on \nNovember 18, 2014, the full Senate failed to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, by a vote of 58 to \n42. I was extremely disappointed that the Republican leadership in the \nSenate decided to use a procedural vote to block debate and amendments \non such an important piece of legislation.\n  With the start of the 114th Congress, Senator Lee and I began \ndiscussions with the House to develop a new version of the USA FREEDOM \nAct. We knew that the June 1, 2015, sunset of several surveillance \nauthorities, including section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, would come \nup fast. For several months, we engaged in conversations with House \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, Representative Sensenbrenner, \nand House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Conyers, as well as \nofficials from the administration, intelligence community, privacy and \ncivil liberties groups, the technology industry, and other stakeholders \non a path forward. Those extensive deliberations produced another set \nof bipartisan, bicameral surveillance reforms to end the bulk \ncollection of Americans' phone records and amend other surveillance \nlaws.\n  On April 28, 2015, Senator Lee and I introduced the USA FREEDOM Act \nof 2015, S. 1123, and Representatives Sensenbrenner, Goodlatte, \nConyers, Nadler, and others in the House introduced the House \ncompanion, H.R. 2048. The Senate version of the bill was originally \ncosponsored by Senators Heller, Durbin, Cruz, Franken, Murkowski, \nBlumenthal, Daines, and Schumer. It has also received the support of \nthe administration, privacy groups, and the technology industry.\n  On May 11, 2015, the Attorney General and Director of National \nIntelligence wrote a letter in strong support of the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2015. The letter notes that the legislation ``is a reasonable \ncompromise that preserves vital national security authorities, enhances \nprivacy and civil liberties and codifies requirements for increased \ntransparency.'' The Obama administration also issued a Statement of \nAdministration Policy on May 12, 2015, in strong support of the USA \nFREEDOM Act of 2015.\n  In early May, as the House and Senate were preparing to consider the \nUSA FREEDOM Act of 2015, the Second Circuit issued a decision \nconfirming what we knew all along.\n  Senator Lee?\n  Mr. LEE. It did. On May 7, 2015, a three-judge panel from the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously concluded that the \nNSA's bulk collection program is illegal. The court held that section \n215 of the USA PATRIOT Act does not authorize bulk collection of \nAmericans' private records and roundly rejected the argument that all \nof our phone records can be ``relevant'' to any particular authorized \ninvestigation.\n  In ACLU v. Clapper, the Second Circuit provided a detailed statutory \nand legal analysis of section 215 and the bulk collection program. It \nstated that the government's ``expansive'' interpretation of \n``relevance'' in the context of Section 215 ``is unprecedented and \nunwarranted.'' The court further stated:\n\n       The interpretation that the government asks us to adopt \n     defies any limiting principle. The same rationale that it \n     proffers for the ``relevance'' of telephone metadata cannot \n     be cabined to such data, and applies\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\n     equally well to other sets of records. If the government is \n     correct, it could use Sec. 215 to collect and store in bulk \n     any other existing metadata available anywhere in the private \n     sector, including metadata associated with financial records, \n     medical records, and electronic communications (including e-\n     mail and social media information) relating to all Americans.\n       Such expansive development of government repositories of \n     formerly private records would be an unprecedented \n     contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans.\n\n  The court also rejected the government's attempt to compare the NSA's \nsection 215 orders for bulk collection of telephony metadata to grand \njury subpoenas, citing the expansive scope and breadth of the \ninformation requested. The court correctly noted:\n\n       The sheer volume of information sought is staggering; while \n     search warrants and subpoenas for business records may \n     encompass large volumes of paper documents or electronic \n     data, the most expansive of such evidentiary demands are \n     dwarfed by the volume of records obtained pursuant to the \n     orders in question here. . . . The government can point to no \n     grand jury subpoena that is remotely comparable to the real-\n     time data collection undertaken under this program.\n\n  While the Second Circuit held that the NSA bulk collection program \nwas illegal, it did not issue a preliminary injunction to enjoin the \nprogram. The Second Circuit remanded the case with instructions for the \ndistrict court to consider whether an injunction was appropriate in \nlight of the upcoming June 1, 2015, expiration of section 215 and \nongoing efforts in Congress to enact legislation before the sunset.\n  As both Senator Leahy and I have mentioned, the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2015 passed the House of Representatives less than a week later by an \noverwhelming and bipartisan vote of 338 to 88.\n  In order to aid Senators' consideration of this bill, and to prevent \nmisinterpretations of Congress's intent, we want to state clearly that \nwe agree with the section-by-section analysis contained in House Report \n114-109, ``UNITING AND STRENGTHENING AMERICA BY FULFILLING RIGHTS AND \nENSURING EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE OVER MONITORING ACT OF 2015,'' to \naccompany H.R. 2048 as adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on May \n8, 2015. There are a few additional matters that Senator Leahy and I \nshould take an opportunity to clarify. Senator Leahy?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The core of this legislation is its prohibition on the \nbulk collection of records under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, \nthe FISA pen register and trap-and-trace device statute, and the \nnational security letter statutes. Though there are some minor wording \nchanges, these provisions are substantively identical to the version in \nthe USA FREEDOM Act of 2014. For section 215 and the FISA pen register \nand trap and trace device statutes, under the bill the government must \nuse a ``specific selection term'' to limit its collection and \ndemonstrate reasonable grounds to believe that the records sought are \nrelevant to the underlying investigation, which cannot be a threat \nassessment. These requirements are independent of each other, and both \nmust be satisfied.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is being considered with full knowledge \nof the Second Circuit's decision in ACLU v. Clapper and its \ninterpretation of the term ``relevant,'' which rejects the prior \nreading of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. According to \nthe Second Circuit, information that the government seeks to obtain \nmust be presently relevant to the specific underlying investigation. \nThe Second Circuit correctly noted:\n\n       ``Relevance'' does not exist in the abstract; something is \n     ``relevant'' or not in relation to a particular subject. \n     Thus, an item relevant to a grand jury investigation may not \n     be relevant at trial. In keeping with this usage, Sec. 215 \n     does not permit an investigative demand for any information \n     relevant to fighting the war on terror, or anything relevant \n     to whatever the government might want to know. It permits \n     demands for documents ``relevant to an authorized \n     investigation.'' The government has not attempted to identify \n     to what particular ``authorized investigation'' the bulk \n     metadata of virtually all Americans' phone calls are \n     relevant. Throughout its briefing, the government refers to \n     the records collected under the telephone metadata program as \n     relevant to ``counterterrorism investigations,'' without \n     identifying any specific investigations to which such bulk \n     collection is relevant. . . . Put another way, the government \n     effectively argues that there is only one enormous ``anti-\n     terrorism'' investigation, and that any records that might \n     ever be of use in developing any aspect of that investigation \n     are relevant to the overall counterterrorism effort. The \n     government's approach essentially reads the ``authorized \n     investigation'' language out of the statute. Indeed, the \n     government's information-gathering under the telephone \n     metadata program is inconsistent with the very concept of an \n     ``investigation.''\n\n  The USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 reauthorizes section 215, but it does so \nin light of the understanding of how the Second Circuit interprets \n``relevance.''\n  Mr. LEE. I agree that the new requirement for a ``specific selection \nterm'' in the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is separate from the requirement \nof ``relevance.'' I would like to clarify one last point. Section 104 \nof the bill authorizes the FISA Court to impose additional, \nparticularized minimization procedures for information obtained under \nsection 501 of FISA. That section provides that the FISA Court may \nimpose additional procedures related to ``the destruction of \ninformation within a reasonable time period.'' That provision therefore \nprovides authority for the FISA Court to specify a time period within \nwhich the government must destroy information.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been proud to work with Senator Lee for nearly 2 \nyears to develop the legislation that we have been discussing. It has \ninvolved many hours of hard work over many months. The result is a \nsolid bill with a set of commonsense reforms that has overwhelming \nsupport. The Senate should pass it today.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 2048, an \n     act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to \n     require the production of certain business records, conduct \n     electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace \n     devices, and use other forms of information gathering for \n     foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal \n     purposes, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Ron Johnson, Dean Heller, \n           Steve Daines, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Richard \n           Burr, Tim Scott, James Lankford, Jeff Flake, Mike Lee, \n           Lisa Murkowski, John Barrasso, Thom Tillis, Chuck \n           Grassley, Richard C.

On this vote, the yeas are 83, the nays are \n14.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the Senate will hold a series of votes \nthis afternoon on the underlying bill, and I think it is important for \nall of us to understand exactly what those amendments will do.\n  The underlying House bill makes some changes in the way the National \nSecurity Agency operates and uses what the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has held is not private information--in other words, the time, \nduration, and number involved in a telephone call that is contained in \na typical telephone bill.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has said there is no right of \nprivacy in that information. As the Senate knows, what the House bill \ndoes is it leaves these phone records in the possession of the \ntelephone company. Then, over a period of 6 months, the National \nSecurity Agency is supposed to come up with a means of querying those \nrecords in the possession of the various phone companies.\n  Some, like me, have wondered why it is that we are trying to fix a \nsystem that is not broken, because there is absolutely no documented \nrecord of any abuse of this information as it is currently retained by \nthe NSA. The way it is used is to help the intelligence community \ndiscover people who have communicated with known or suspected \nterrorists abroad in a way that will help to provide an additional \npiece of data that will hopefully help them prevent terrorist attacks \nfrom occurring on our home soil.\n  The FBI Director has said that in the 56 field offices in the United \nStates, every single one of these field offices has an open inquiry \nwith regard to potential homegrown terrorist attacks.\n  As I mentioned before, in Garland, TX, just a few weeks ago, two men \ntraveled from Phoenix, AZ, and obtained full-body armor and automatic \nweapons and were prepared to wreak havoc and murder innocent people in \nGarland, TX, because they were exercising their First Amendment rights \nand were displaying cartoons that these two jihadists felt insulted the \nProphet Muhammad.\n  Thanks to the good police work of a Garland police officer, both of \nthose people were taken out of action before they could kill anybody \nthere at that site. But why in the world would we want to take away \nfrom our intelligence authorities the ability to detect whether \nindividuals, such as these two jihadists from Phoenix who traveled to \nGarland, had been communicating with known terrorist telephone numbers \nin Syria or anywhere else in the world? These are foreign telephone \nnumbers that are matched up and provide an essential link and, really, \na tripwire for the intelligence community.\n  What the amendments that we will vote on this afternoon would do is \nto slow the transition from NSA storage to the telephone company \nstewardship from the 6 months prescribed in the underlying bill. For \nthose who believe that the underlying bill is the correct policy, I do \nnot know why they would object to a little bit of extra time so we can \nmake sure that this is going to work as intended.\n  Indeed, the second amendment does relate specifically to that. It \nwould require a certification by the Director of National Intelligence \nthat the software is actually in place that will allow the National \nSecurity Agency to query the phone records in the possession of the \ntelephone companies.\n  Another amendment would provide that the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, which is a group of experienced Federal judges who \nreview the requests from the FBI and other law enforcement authorities, \nwould be able to query these telephone records. It would establish a \npanel of experts, so to speak, to argue against the government's case \nin front of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. As somebody \nwho used to be a judge for some time, this is a rather strange \nprovision because what it does, essentially, is to put a defense \nattorney in the grand jury room and create an adversarial process at \nthe early stages of an investigation, which may or may not lead up to \nan indictment in that case.\n  The final amendment would require the phone companies to notify \nCongress if they are going to change their policy for retaining \ncustomer records. This is a serious concern because it could well be \nthat some telephone companies will start marketing to potential \ncustomers that they will not retain any records, thus eliminating an \nimportant tool which helps keep Americans safe and has absolutely zero \nthreat to civil liberties.\n  There has been so much misrepresentation about what this so-called \nmetadata program has done. I think that is one of the reasons we find \nourselves here today. Many who believe the program is useful are \nreluctant to even talk about it in public because, as we know, so much \nof what is done to protect our country is classified. So rather than \nhave a public debate and actually correct the misstatements of fact and \nthe demagoguery that unfortunately attends this subject, many people \nare simply confused about what exactly is going on and what Congress is \ndoing. But I would just point out that oversight of these programs is \nabsolutely rigorous. It is executive, judicial, and legislative \noversight. It is not a matter of trust as to whether these programs \nwork the way they are supposed to; it is actually verified on a regular \nbasis, universally verified.\n\n  Also, we have to go before these Federal judges known as a FISA \nCourt--a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--in order to make our \ncase. Unless we can make our case to these judges that there is reason \nto continue the investigation, they will shut it down.\n  One of the things I think we have forgotten is that we want to treat \nintelligence gathering and prevention as we do ordinary law \nenforcement. What I mean by that is that ordinarily, in the criminal \nlaw context, government doesn't get involved in a case unless something \nbad has already happened. If there has been an explosion or a murder or \na bank robbery or something like that, it is after the fact that we try \nto figure out what happened and then, if we can, to identify the \nperpetrator and to bring them to justice. That satisfies an important \nneed in our society to enforce our criminal law, but that is far \ndifferent from what our intelligence community is supposed to be doing \nbecause they are supposed to be detecting threats and intervening in \nthose ongoing schemes and stopping them before they ultimately occur.\n  That is the important lesson we learned on 9/11. Unfortunately, it \nhas been so long ago now that many people have simply forgotten or they \ndon't feel as though this is an imminent threat. But when Director \nComey says they have open inquiries in all 56 FBI field offices about \nthe potential threat of homegrown terrorists, I take that very \nseriously. I believe it is absolutely reckless for us to take any \nunnecessary chances.\n  There are some who say this underlying bill is important because \ninstead of the National Security Agency collecting these telephone \nnumbers, we are going to leave the data with the telephone companies. \nBut none of the people who are going to be querying these records at \nthe phone companies have security clearances. One can just imagine the \npotential for abuse at the phone companies of these phone records once \nthey receive some sort of request from the government.\n  We know the current system as run at the National Security Agency is \nsubject to rigorous oversight, as I mentioned. In addition to the \nexecutive, judicial, and legislative oversight, we actually have a \nprivate and civil liberties\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\noversight board which makes sure that we strike the right balance. \nNobody wants to see the privacy rights of American citizens undermined, \nbut we all are adult enough to know that there has to be a balance and \nthat in order to provide for security and to avoid terrorist attacks \nsuch as occurred on 9/11, we are going to have to take some actions to \nreach the right balance, and I believe the current law does that.\n  Unfortunately, we have a traitor such as Edward Snowden who \nselectively leaked certain portions of this program, and it has created \nan uproar. I think that unfortunately, as a result of his leaks and the \nensuing political environment after that, America is at greater risk, \nand that is a terrible shame.\n  So I think it is reckless to take a chance. We have been fortunate \nthat there have been no terrorist attacks on our homeland since 9/11. \nWell, I take that back. Five years ago, at Fort Hood, MAJ Nidal Hasan \nkilled 13 people and injured 30-something more. Of course, we know now \nthat he had been in constant communication over the Internet with Anwar \nal-Awlaki, who subsequently was killed in a drone strike--even though \nhe was an American citizen--overseas. He was overseas because he was \nrecruiting people to Islamic extremism, including Nidal Hasan, who \nkilled 13 people at Fort Hood 5 years ago.\n  It is simply a fact that the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution involving searches and seizures doesn't apply to foreign \nterrorists; it applies to Americans. Under the procedures used under \ncurrent law, all requests for additional information are subject to \nFederal court supervision and permission.\n  So we will vote on a number of amendments this afternoon. I can tell \nmy colleagues, after talking to a number of our colleagues, many of \nthem have said they don't really have any disagreement over the content \nor the policy of these amendments. Actually, these amendments are \ndesigned to try to strengthen the underlying House bill.\n  We all understand that the House is going to prevail in the basic \nstructure of the underlying piece of legislation, but since when did \nthe U.S. Senate outsource its decisionmaking to the other body across \nthe Capitol? We have a bicameral legislature--a Senate and a House--for \na reason. We know we make better decisions when we have consultation \nbetween the two branches of the legislature--not capitulation but \nconsultation. The Senate should not be a rubberstamp for the House or \nvice versa.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues say that if the Senate were to \nchange a period or a comma or a dash in the underlying legislation, it \nwould be a poison pill, that the House would reject it and we would \nhave nothing to show for our efforts. But I have great faith that if \nthe Senate will do its job and vote to pass these underlying amendments \nand strengthen this underlying bill, the House will take up the bill \nand vote on it and it will pass. So if my colleagues feel as though \nthese amendments would actually strengthen the underlying House bill \nand represent good policy, why in the world would they vote against \nthese amendments because of some fantasy that the House will simply \nreject any changes at all? Why would they essentially capitulate any of \ntheir prerogatives as U.S. Senators to represent their constituents in \nthis body? We all know we make better decisions in consultation with \nother people.\n  Certainly I think it is true that the House's bill is not holy writ. \nIt is not something we have to accept in its entirety without any \nchanges. I think where the policy debate should go would be to embrace \nthese amendments and to say that we understand the House wants to \nchange the current custody policy of these phone records and leave them \nwith the phone company, but we sure need to know the new system will \nactually work. Doesn't that make sense? That is why the certification \nfrom the Director of National Intelligence is so important. It makes \nsense to provide a little bit more time--from 6 months to a year--in \norder to make sure this transition goes smoothly.\n  I know no Member of the Senate and no Member of the House and no \nAmerican wants to look back on our hasty treatment of this underlying \nlegislation and say: If we were just a little more careful, if we had \njust taken a little bit more time, if we had just been a little more \nthoughtful, a little more deliberative, and talked about the facts as \nthey are and not some misrepresentation of the facts, we could have \nactually prevented a terrorist attack on our home soil.\n  Unfortunately, by increasing the risk to the American people, as I \nbelieve this underlying legislation will do, we may not find out about \nthat until it is too late. I hope and pray that is not the case, but \nwhy should we take the risk to the homeland? Why should we risk anyone \nbeing injured or potentially killed as a result of a homegrown \nterrorist attack on our own soil because we have simply blinded \nourselves in a significant way to the risks? Not that this is a \npanacea, not that this is some litmus test, but it is one essential \npiece of information that will help law enforcement make the case to \nnot just prosecute crimes after they occur but to prevent them from \noccurring in the first place through the good and sound use of \nconstitutional intelligence gathering in a way that respects the \nprivacy of all Americans but lives up to our first and foremost \nresponsibility, and that is to keep the American people safe.\n  Madam President, I yield to the distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, nobody disputes that we all want to keep \nAmerica safe. We all agree on that. We also want to make sure that we \nkeep Americans free and that their constitutional freedoms are \nprotected. None of us would think that we were making the country safer \nif we were to try to pass a law that said law enforcement or anybody \nelse can walk into our homes at any time they want and go through any \nfiles we have, follow us anywhere they wanted just on a whim. We would \nbe totally opposed to that. But some would say that in the aftermath of \n9/11, in some of the aspects of the PATRIOT Act, we did just that.\n  Congressman Armey, who was the Republican leader, the majority leader \nof the House at the time--a very conservative Republican--he and I \njoined together after consultation to put into the PATRIOT Act sunset \nprovisions which would require us to have the debate we are having \nright now.\n  We talk about consultation. The fact is that there have been hours \nand days and weeks and months of consultation between the House and the \nSenate on the USA FREEDOM Act. We had a bill before us last year that \nwas filibustered. It still got 58 votes. That was done in consultation \nwith the House. The majority leader of the House has already said--the \nRepublican leader--he has warned the Senate not to move ahead with \nplanned changes to the House bill because it could bring real \nchallenges in getting the USA FREEDOM Act passed through the House \nagain.\n  The fact is that we have had so much consultation. Senator Lee, I, \nRepublicans and Democrats have met continuously for months--even a \nyear--with House Republicans and House Democrats to get the bill that \nis before us now. That is probably why it passed by such a lopsided \nmargin in the House of Representatives.\n  My distinguished friend from Texas says these are minor changes. \nWell, actually, they are not. One would weaken the FISA Court amicus \nauthority. We know that for years the FISA Court secretly \nmisinterpreted section 215. As a result, after the program leak, that \nis the only time the FISA Court finally heard the government's \nargument. Before that, they only heard the government. Once a legal \nreason justifying this program became public, challenges were brought, \nand the Second Circuit last month ruled unanimously that the program \nwas unlawful.\n  Having amicus in there is not having a defense attorney in a grand \njury room at all. Amicus on questions of law can be invited by the \ncourt to step in. This could be a relatively rare case, completely in \nthe discretion of the court. It is hard to talk about weakening that \nfurther, especially when we are talking about a secret court.\n  I oppose the amendment to extend the current bulk collection program \nin place for a full year. We have a 180-day transition period. And the \nDirector of\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nthe NSA said: ``We are aware of no technical or security reason why \nthis cannot be tested and brought online within the 180-day period.'' I \nthink the NSA Director is as knowledgeable about this subject as \nanybody in this Chamber, and he says we can go forward with it.\n\n  I think all of these amendments that are talked about would simply \ndelay passing an excellent piece of legislation, one that has been \nworked on by Republicans and Democrats for months and even years. Let's \npass it today.\n  We hear about stopping terrorism attacks. We all want to do that. But \nI remember some of the statements made by a former NSA Director that \nthis had stopped 54 terrorist attacks. When he was pressed on that \nclaim, it came out that the bulk collection program was only important \nafter the fact in one case--and that was not a terrorist attack.\n  We also know that 9/11 could have been avoided. The evidence was \nthere. The information was there. But the dots had not been connected. \nEverybody was frantically taking information they already had--\nrecordings they already had after 9/11--and saying: We ought to get \naround to translating what is in these things. We know that in \nMinnesota, the FBI warned that people were taking flight lessons and \nthere was no good reason. That warning was ignored. They basically were \ntold: We know better.\n  I remember the day or so after the attack, at FBI Headquarters, \npeople were calling in with information from different field offices. \nSomebody would write it down and would hand it to somebody else who \nwould rewrite it and hand it to somebody else who would put it in a \nfile. They would charter planes to bring photographs around to \ndifferent places so our offices could see them. And I said: Well, why \ndon't we just email the photographs? They would say: Well, we don't \nhave the ability to do that. I said: Well, my 11-year-old neighbor \ncould do it for you if that would help.\n  The fact of the matter is we had the information prior to our own new \nlaws, and it didn't make us safer--any more safer than when we voted \nfor $2 to $3 trillion to go into Iraq because, as the Vice President \nand others were saying, they were about to attack us with nuclear \nweapons, and they were implying they were involved in 9/11.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the distinguished ranking member yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the ranking member has made a number of very \nimportant points here.\n  The fact of the matter is that we are all here because the majority \nleader wasn't able to defeat the surveillance reform. So instead, he \nhas chosen to introduce amendments designed to water it down. I am \ndisappointed by this. I will oppose all of these amendments, and I want \nto have a colloquy briefly with the ranking minority member.\n  The ranking minority member and our colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Blumenthal, have done very good reform work with respect to the \nFISA Court. In particular, what the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nhas done, with the help of the Senator from Connecticut, is to bring \nsome very important sunshine and transparency to the court. As my two \ncolleagues have pointed out on the Judiciary Committee, we really meet \non the major questions--not all of them, as the Senator from Vermont \nhas just said--but what is really needed is to make sure that both \nsides get a chance to be heard, not just the government side.\n  So what troubles me--and I am interested in the reaction of my \ncolleague from Vermont, and I want to praise him and my colleague from \nConnecticut--is that it seems to me that what the Senate majority \nleader wants to do is basically to take us back to the days of secret \nlaw.\n  What is important, as we get into this, and particularly with this \namendment, is that there is a difference between secret operations and \nsecret law. Operations always have to be kept secret.\n  I see my friend Chairman Burr here. We serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee together. The two of us feel so strongly about making sure \nsecret operations are kept secret because otherwise Americans are going \nto die. We can't have secret operations splayed all hither and yon in \nthe public square.\n  But the law always ought to be public. As Senator Leahy has pointed \nout for some time--and I warned about it here on the floor--what we \nwould see is, if you live in Connecticut or Vermont, the PATRIOT Act \ntalked about collecting information relevant to investigation. Nobody \nthought that meant millions and millions of records on law-abiding \npeople. That decision was made in secret. It was made without the \nreforms advocated by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nVermont.\n  So I would be interested in my colleague from Vermont's reaction to \nthe majority leader's amendment to scale back your very constructive \nreforms on the FISA Court. And my sense is that what the majority \nleader's approach would do would take us back to the days of secret \nlaw. I think that is a mistake, and I would be curious about the \nreaction of my colleague from Vermont on this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would say to my friend from Oregon that the American \npeople want to know how the laws are being interpreted. They want to \nknow what the courts are doing.\n  As to secret operations, of course, you have had briefings on those. \nI have had briefings on those. I have been in places I will not name \nhere. They are places overseas where I was there in the operations \ncenter as operations were taking place and being briefed on what they \ndid, where they got the information, and what they were going to do \nnext. Of course, none of that you want to be reading in the press or \nseeing in real time.\n  But I also know that when we are dealing with Americans and with \ntheir lives and with their sense of privacy, we have to protect them. \nThe USA FREEDOM Act makes very simple changes to the FISA court. The \nbill provides the FISA Court with the authority to designate \nindividuals who have security clearances to be able to serve as an \namicus or a friend of the court. It is triggered in only relatively \nrare cases involving a novel or significant issue of law, and the \ndecision of appointment is left entirely up to the court. That is about \nas narrowly drawn as you can get. But I think we have to have this \nability to know what the court is doing because we have known for years \nthat the FISA Court secretly misinterpreted Section 215 to allow for \nthe dragnet collection of Americans' phone records.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Connecticut, who has \nworked so hard on this and is a former attorney general of his own \nState.\n  My own experience in getting search warrants for phone records or \nanything else as a prosecutor--and I realize it is not of the \ncomplexity of what we have today, but I realize we had to follow the \nlaw--is that, ultimately, that protects us more than anything else. I \ndo not want this administration or any other administration to have the \nability just to go anywhere they want. I am not encouraged by those who \nsay this is so carefully maintained. We were given information earlier \nthat just a small number of people can have access to those records. I \nguess it is one less since Edward Snowden walked out the door with all \nof it.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Connecticut if he would like to \nspeak on this subject.\n  The Senator from Oregon has been such a strong and passionate leader \non this, and I know from what I hear from the people of my State and \nwhen I am down in his State that people want us to be safe, but they \nalso want their privacy protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am very grateful for the opportunity to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont and to emphasize some of the \npoints that he has just made. But first let me thank Senator Wyden for \nhis leadership and his courage on this issue of foreign intelligence \nsurveillance reform. He has helped to lead this effort, long before I \nwas in the Senate, in favor of more transparency and accountability. \nThose are among the overarching objectives here.\n  My colleague from Vermont, who shares with me a background as a \nprosecutor, rightly makes a point that warrants and other means of \nsurveillance when prosecutors seek them are sought\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nultimately from judges. I want to speak to some of the myths and \nmisconceptions here that endanger this key reform.\n  Our colleague from Texas, whom I greatly respect, has argued that the \nFISA Court is like a grand jury. In fact, he has said that an amicus \nshould not be appointed, in effect, to intervene with a body that is \nlike a grand jury. Well, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is \nnot a grand jury, as my colleague from Oregon has said very well. The \nFISA Court makes law. It interprets the law in ways that are binding as \nlegal precedents. Far from being like a grand jury, as a truly \ninvestigative tool of the court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt is a court. In fact, it is composed of article III judges who do \nas they do on their own district courts or appellate courts; that is, \nthey interpret law and thereby, in effect, make law.\n  To keep that law secret is a disservice to the American people and to \nour legal system. To have only one side represented skews and, in \neffect, impedes the operations of that court because we know that \njudges make better decisions when they hear both sides and rights are \nbetter protected. Even so, the FISA Court needs to hear from that \namicus panel only when it chooses to do so, ultimately.\n  It has the discretion under the statute, as it exists now, to decide \nto appoint an amicus in any particular matter. It is required to \nappoint an amicus in novel or significant cases unless--and the word \n``unless'' is in the statute--it issues a finding that the appointment \nis not appropriate. It can make that finding whenever it wishes to do \nso. So the discretion is for the FISA Court in whether to hear from an \namicus, even under the bill that the USA FREEDOM Act is now. It can \npermit the amicus to address privacy, technology or any other area \nrelevant to the matter before the court--not just constitutional \nrights. And that leads to the second misinterpretation, if I may say \nso, in the remarks made by my colleague from Texas.\n  The bill does not direct an amicus to oppose intelligence activity or \nto oppose the government's view or position. In fact, it is to \nenlighten the court. In some instances it may oppose the government, \nbut it is as part of that process of constructively arriving at the \ncorrect legal interpretation--not as a kind of knee-jerk reaction to \noppose the government.\n  Again, I stress, a novel or significant issue in the discretion of \nthe court may be addressed by the amicus. What the amendment does is to \ndeprive the amicus or expert panel of the access it needs to facts and \nlaw to be the best that it can be in interpreting, arguing, and \nprotecting rights. It, in effect, bars access to past precedents of the \ncourt, to briefings from intelligence experts, to facts that may be \nknown to the Department of Justice or intelligence agencies. That \nhampering and hobbling of the amicus in no way serves the cause of \njustice. It in no way serves the cause of intelligent intelligence \nactivities--in fact, it undermines that activity.\n\n  It undermines trust and confidence in the court. This court has \noperated in secret. It has heard arguments in secret. It has issued \nopinions in secret. It is the kind of court our Founders would have \nfound an anathema to their vision of democracy and freedom. We may need \nsuch a court now to authorize surveillance activities that must be kept \nsecret, but we need to strike a balance that protects very precious \nconstitutional rights and liberties.\n  After all, what does our surveillance and intelligence system protect \nif not these fundamental values and rights of privacy and liberties \nthat have lasted and served us well because we respect them?\n  More than a physical structure that we seek to protect through this \nsystem, it is those values and rights that are fundamentally paramount \nand important. So this FISA Court reform goes to the core of the \nchanges--constructive changes that we seek to make. I hope my \ncolleagues will defeat amendment 1451, along with all of the other \namendments, because the practical effect of adopting amendments is it \nfurther delays implementation of the USA FREEDOM Act at a time when our \ncountry may be at risk from the expiration of the PATRIOT Act. We \ncannot afford for this country----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will my colleague yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Because I think, again, my colleague from Connecticut has \nspoken to what the stakes are here. For the last decade, intelligence \nofficials have been relying on secret interpretations of their \nauthorities that have been very different from the plain reading of \npublic law. The public has seen the consequences of that, and they are \nangry because the American people know we can have policies that \npromote both security and liberty.\n  I would just like to ask a question of my colleague with the respect \nto what the implications would be of hollowing out the good work you \nand Senator Leahy have done with respect to having more transparency \nand both sides making a case on key questions with respect to the FISA \nCourt. I would like to note that the majority leader's second amendment \ndelays implementation of other important reforms that you all have \ndealt with.\n  For example, one question I was asked about at a townhall meeting \njust this past weekend in Tillamook, OR, where I was, is people were \nconcerned about what would we do to protect our Nation when there was \nan emergency. You all, in your good work, have, in effect, said you \nwould strengthen the language to make sure that when there was an \nemergency--government officials already can issue an emergency \nauthorization to get the business records and you would then seek court \napproval, and you all strengthen that.\n  All of you on the Judiciary Committee said: We are going to provide \nanother measure of security for the American people; in other words, we \nare going to protect their liberty and we are going to strengthen their \nsecurity. It looks to me like the combination of the majority leader's \ntwo amendments scaling back the reforms, the transparency reforms in \nthe FISA Court, and delaying the strengthening of emergency authorities \nthat can protect the American people without jeopardizing their liberty \nwould really roll back the kind of reforms the American people want.\n  I would be interested in my colleague's reaction to that.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am happy for that very pertinent and important \nquestion from my colleague from Oregon. In fact, the majority leader's \namendments would not only scale back and roll back the protections for \nthe American people in the event of exigent or urgent situations, they \nwould also undermine the confidence and trust of the American people in \nthis system to protect the homeland.\n  Delaying these kinds of reforms undermines the goal of protecting our \nnational security as well as preserving our fundamental constitutional \nrights. Delay is an enemy here. Uncertainty is an adversary. We owe it \nto the American people not only to restore their trust and confidence \nand sustain the faith of the American people in the intelligence \nagencies but also to make it more transparent, where it can be made so \nwithout compromising security and increasing accountability.\n  That is what the FISA Court reforms do. That is why the Director of \nNational Intelligence as well as the Attorney General, the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board, the President's Review Group, at least \ntwo former FISA Court judges, civil rights advocates, and \nrepresentatives of many of the most informed and able in our \nintelligence community all support these reforms.\n  The Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General said \nin 2014, ``The appointment of an amicus in selected cases as \nappropriate need not interfere with the important aspects of the FISA \nprocess, including the process of ex parte consultation between the \ncourt and the government.''\n  Ex parte communication, in effect, secret conversation or \nconsultation, can continue to go forward under this bill. The amendment \nwould not alter that fact. The amendment simply makes the amicus less \neffective by depriving that amicus of access to facts and law that are \nnecessary to do its job. So, in my view, these amendments fundamentally \nundermine the purpose of reforms that a vast bipartisan majority of \nthis body has already approved today. It is an increasingly large \nmargin that has voted for these\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\nreforms, recognizing what I hear from Connecticut, what my colleagues \nhear in their States; that people want to believe the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court is, in fact, operating as a court, \nhearing both sides, keeping secrets but at the same time increasing \npublic access to facts and laws that are important to them without \ncompromising our national security.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to reject these amendments. As the \nSenator from Oregon has said, adopting them will simply serve to delay \nreforms that are necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, there are always two sides of every picture, \ntwo sides of every story. I have tremendous affection for Ranking \nMember Leahy. We are friends. We look at this issue differently. I have \ndeep respect for Senator Blumenthal, Senator Wyden.\n  The fact is I look at history a little bit differently and I look at \nthe future a little bit differently because I think what the American \npeople want to believe is that America is doing everything possible to \nkeep them safe. I think, at the end of the day, that is the single most \nimportant issue: Are we doing everything we can to keep America safe?\n  Now, Senator Wyden opposes section 215. He talked about changes. He \nis opposed to section 215. He is a member of the committee. I know \nexactly where he stands, and I respect it. The fact is that 215 is a \nvery effective program. My colleagues are right. It was not a public \nprogram until Eric Snowden, a traitor to the United States, published a \nlot of information about what the intelligence community does. This was \none small piece. Eric Snowden put the lives of Americans and foreigners \nat risk in what he released.\n  You cannot put the genie back in the bottle, but you also cannot hide \nfrom the fact that this program enabled us to thwart terrorist attacks \nhere and abroad. I quoted the four of them yesterday. This program \nitself was what we were able to use post the Boston Marathon bombing to \nfigure out whether the Tsarnaev brothers had an international \nconnection that directed that horrific event at that marathon.\n  Yes, the FISA Court operates in secret. Why? It is the same reason \nthe Senate sometimes clears the Galleries, shuts the doors, cuts off \nthe TV, and as an institution only cleared people here--classified and \ntop secret information--can make decisions. Therein describes the FISA \nCourt. They always deal with classified and top secret documents. They \nare called on a minute's notice. No other court in the world responds \nlike that. There is a FISA judge on the bench 24/7, 365 days a year. It \nrotates. These are the best of the best of the judicial system around \nthe country, picked by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Could it be open? Sure. But we would then expose either classified \nand top secret documents or we could not use the documents to make the \ncase to the FISA Court that we have a suspected individual of terrorism \nand we need the authority to see who that person is. Well, we have \nheard a lot about the FISA Court. A lot of it is true.\n  The people who serve on the bench are heroes because they take the \ntoughest cases America is presented with, and they rule on them in the \nmost judicial way they possibly can, demanding, over 25 percent of the \ntime, that an application be resubmitted after changes because they did \nnot think it had met the threshold.\n  Much has been focused on the changes to the amicus language or the \n``friend of the court.'' This is not a normal court. When the choice is \nto go to the FISA Court, it is because we are concerned. We are \nconcerned about an imminent threat.\n  Let me explain, once again, for my colleagues and for the American \npeople what the section 215 program is. It is a program where at the \nNSA we collect raw telephone numbers from telephone companies--numbers, \nnot names.\n  We have a number that does not have a person's name with it. They are \ndeidentified. We collect a number, the date the call was made, and the \nduration of the call. For us to trigger any search or we call it query \nof that database, we have to have a foreign telephone number that we \nknow is a telephone number used by a terrorist.\n  Those are all the components of the section 215 program. That is it. \nWe can have a database, but without a foreign terrorist telephone \nnumber, we cannot search the database. If we have a foreign terrorist \ntelephone number and no database, which is where we are moving to--I \nconcede this legislation is going to move, and we are going to \ntransition over to hundreds of telephone companies.\n  Now, rather than have a number of people controlled and supervised \nwithin the NSA to carry out these queries, we are going to have \ntelephone company employees carry out a query with a known foreign \nterrorist's telephone number against all of the numbers in their \ndatabase. Again, hopefully, they will not tie a person's name to it. We \ndo not even get a person's name at the NSA.\n  The only people who should be worried are Americans who have actually \nhad a communication with a known terrorist abroad. Now, I think when \nthe American people hear me talk about this, up to this point they are \nsaying: That is a good thing. We want to know if somebody here has \ntalked to a terrorist because we want to be kept safe.\n  Well, not only are we shifting the database out of the NSA over to \nthe telephone companies, which means our response time is going to be \ndelayed--let me remind everybody that whether we search the meta \ndatabase at NSA or whether we search the database at the telephone \ncompany, we first have to go to the FISA Court and get a court order \nthat says: You have the authority to do this based upon what you have \npresented the court.\n  Now we have to go to the telephone companies, and in a timeframe that \nis conducive to them, they are going to search their database for a \nknown terrorist's cell phone number, and now we are relying on hundreds \nof companies to search their database in a timely fashion and get back \nto us because we are trying to be in front of a threat versus behind a \nthreat. In front of a threat, it is called intelligence; behind a \nthreat, it is called an investigation.\n\n  When we thwarted the New York City subway bombing, we were in front \nof the threat. That was intelligence. When we reacted to the Boston \nMarathon, that was an investigation led by the FBI, not the NSA.\n  So when you inject this new requirement for a friend of the court--\nand I would disagree with my colleagues. This is not a voluntary thing \nfor the FISA Court. It is something that is available to the FISA Court \ntoday if they choose to have somebody come in to counsel them on \nsomething. This is mandatory. In the legislation, it says ``shall.'' \nThe court shall set up a panel. The court shall choose a friend of the \ncourt. A friend of the court is not there to facilitate a timely \nprocessing of information.\n  Let me remind everybody that we are dealing with the safety of the \nAmerican people. They always stress this at the end of the \nconversation: We want the confidence and trust to be rebuilt that we \nare protecting our homeland. If you are moving a database, you are \nmaking it slower. Now you are setting up a mechanism inside to slow it \ndown even more.\n  What we are doing is shifting from intelligence gathering to \ninvestigations. Nobody knows how long it is going to take from the time \nwe present the FISA Court with a foreign terrorist's telephone number \nbefore we actually complete a search process within this new database.\n  I happen to be the one behind a 12-month transition versus a 6-month \ntransition, and it was all stimulated off of exactly the same person \nwhom Senator Blumenthal or Senator Wyden quoted. They said the Director \nof the NSA said: We think we can do this in 6 months.\n  Well, I am telling you, if I am the general public in America and I \nam concerned about my safety and the people who are supposed to be \nprotecting me say ``I think I can do this in 6 months''--I would like \nsomebody to say ``I am absolutely 100 percent sure I can do it in 6 \nmonths.'' But they think they can do it in 6 months. There is the \nreason for a year. There is the reason for a longer transition period.\n  If privacy were really the concern--and everybody has come down and \nsaid: I want to protect the privacy of the American people. Let me \npoint out a couple of things.\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\n  No. 1, we didn't collect anybody's name in this program. It is hard \nto intrude on somebody's privacy when you didn't collect their name. We \ncollected the number, the date of the call, and the duration of the \ncall. That is it. Anything else that turns into an investigation is the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation going to a court and saying: We have to \nhave more information because we know the President of the Senate is a \npotential threat to us. And then more information can be found out, \nsuch as his identity and anything else that might be part of the \ninvestigation. But from the standpoint of the NSA, those are the only \nthings we have--a telephone number, a date, and the duration of the \ncall.\n  If privacy is the concern, I don't think we have breached it. As a \nmatter of fact, since this program has been in existence, there has not \nbeen one case of a breach of anybody's privacy--not one.\n  If they were truly concerned about privacy, they would be on the \nfloor today with a bill abolishing the CFPB, which is a government \nagency, a government entity that collects every financial transaction \nof the American people by name, by date, by amount, by transaction. But \nthey are not down here doing that. Why? Because they don't like the \nfact that the FISA Court operates in secret. They don't think there \nshould be classified or top-secret documents. They believe everything \nshould be transparent.\n  Well, let me say to my colleagues, my friends, and to the American \npeople that we have done more over the last month to destroy the \ncapacity of this program because of the debate we have had. There is \nnot a terrorist in the world now who doesn't understand that using a \ncell phone or a land line is probably a pretty bad thing. It probably \nputs a target on their backs. We have done a great job of chasing \npeople to alternative methods of communication, and I would suggest to \nyou that is not making America any safer. If anything, maybe we should \nhave had this debate in secret simply so we wouldn't give them a \nroadmap as to what we do.\n  Therein lies the reason that there are some things on which I think \nthere is a determination made by the executive branch and by the \nlegislative branch and I think in many cases at the dining room tables \naround America where Americans say: You know, you don't need to share \neverything with me. I am tired of hearing things on the nightly news \nthat I think shouldn't be discussed.\n  This probably happens to be one of them because it doesn't make us \nmore safe, it makes us less safe.\n  I will end the same way Senator Blumenthal did. People want to \nbelieve--question mark. I think people want to believe we are doing \neverything we possibly can to strengthen our national security, to \neliminate the threat of terrorism here and abroad. My fear, quite \nfrankly, is that this bill doesn't accomplish that.\n  Again, I have deep affection for those whose names are on the bill \nand for what they believe is the intent. But I think that at the end of \nthe day the only responsible thing to do right now is to accept three \namendments--one, a substitute, and two, a first-degree and a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Let me say briefly that the substitute incorporates two changes. One \nchange is that the telephone companies would be required to notify 6 \nmonths in advance of any change in their retention program--in other \nwords, how long they hold the data. I have received calls from both big \ntelecom companies today, and they have both said: We have no problem \nwith that.\n  The second one would have the Director of National Intelligence \ncertify at the end of the transition period that technologically we can \nmake the transition. I don't find anybody who has really objected to \nthat.\n  Then there is an amendment that extends the transition period from 6 \nmonths to 12 months. There have been people who object to that. I would \nonly tell you we have a difference of opinion. They are willing to \ntrust the NSA on their ability to make the transition in 6 months. I \nthink that is ironic because the reason we are here having this debate \nis because they have made us believe we can't trust NSA. Yet, they are \nwilling to trust the NSA relative to a transition time that is \nsufficient to accomplish the transition.\n  Let's err on the side of caution. Let's do it at 12 months. If they \ncan do it sooner, then let them petition us, Congress can pass it, and \nwe will turn to it sooner. But let's not get to 6 months and be \nchallenged with not being ready to make that transition.\n  The last one is a change to amicus language. Clearly, that is the \nbiggest difference we have. I would say to my colleagues that you \neither vote for the amendment or you vote against it. If you vote for \nit, you will delay the time it will take for us to connect the dots \nbetween a foreign terrorist's telephone number and a domestic telephone \nnumber they might have talked to. If that doesn't bother Members and it \ndoesn't bother the public, I am all for giving the American people what \nthey want. But I think most American citizens sit at home and say: You \nknow, the faster you do this, the safer I am. I have a responsibility \nfirst and foremost to the protection of the American people. It is in \nour oath.\n  I also share something with the Presiding Officer and my colleagues \nwho are here--to protect the rights and liberties of the American \npeople. And as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I don't \nthink we have in any way infringed on that.\n  I am now in year 21. I have come a lot closer to the line than I ever \ndreamed when I came to Congress in 1995. But I also never envisioned an \nevent as horrific as 9/11. I never envisioned an enemy as brutal as \nISIL or Al Qaeda or the Houthis. I could go on and on.\n  What has changed since 9/11? On 9/11, we had one terrorist \norganization that had America in its crosshairs. Today, we have tens to \ntwenties of organizations that are offshoots of terrorist organizations \nthat would like to commit something right here in the United States. \nThe threat hasn't become less; it has become more. We are on the floor \ntoday talking about taking away some of the tools that have been \neffective in helping us thwart attacks. It is the wrong debate to have, \nbut we are here.\n  I would only ask my colleagues to show some reason. Extend by 6 \nmonths the transition period. Make sure it doesn't take longer to \nsearch these databases. Make sure we are ready for the telephone \ncompanies to carry out the searches because there is one certainty on \nwhich I think I would find agreement from all of my colleagues here: \nThe terrorists aren't going away. America is still their target. No \nmatter what we say on this floor, we are still in the crosshairs of \ntheir terrorist acts.\n  Only by providing the intelligence community and the law enforcement \ncommunity the tools to carry out their job can they actually fulfill \ntheir obligation of making sure America is safe well into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues in the Senate and the \nAmerican people are listening to this discussion because there isn't \nanything that is more important than defending our country. The debate \nwe are having in the Senate today is really about the tools our \nintelligence community uses to prevent terrorist attacks.\n  As we look at and discuss the legislation in front of us, I think it \nis very important that we not forget we are living in dangerous times. \nThis is the most dangerous time, literally, since 9/11 in terms of the \nterrorist activity that is out there. As the Senator from North \nCarolina pointed out, we have a big bull's-eye. The United States and \npeople in this country, the things we believe in--the terrorists would \nlove nothing more than to be able to take out and destroy, through some \nterrorist act, Americans and American interests. So I think it is very \ncritical.\n  The Senator from North Carolina did a great job. I know the Senator \nfrom Indiana is going to speak here on the subject in a few minutes. \nBut I hope everyone listens carefully because we are on the cusp of \ndoing something that does weaken the very tools that have been used, \nthe very capabilities that have been used to prevent those terrorist \nattacks.\n  The ironic thing about it, as you frame this up, you look at the \nthreats that are out there, the dangerous times in which we live, and \nthe success of these programs and how effective they have been in the \npast at preventing a terrorist attack, and what is being\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\ntalked about are potential abuses, hypothetical examples of how these \nprograms could be abused, but they haven't been. The fact is, they \nhaven't been.\n  We have a long period of time now in which to examine the \neffectiveness of these tools relative to the arguments that are being \nmade about their abuse. They just don't exist. There isn't a documented \ncase, in the time these tools have been in existence, of anybody's \nprivacy being breached.\n  So it is very important that we look at these issues in light of what \nwe are up against and what our No. 1 responsibility is; that is, \ndefending Americans and Americans' interests. And this discussion is \ncritical to that.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak on another subject this morning, and \nthat has to do with the headline of the New York Times from Friday \nmorning of last week, which I thought was pretty grim, and that is \n``U.S. Economy Contracted 0.7% in First Quarter.'' Let me repeat that. \nNot only did our economy fail to grow in the first quarter of 2015, it \nactually shrank.\n\n  That is pretty discouraging news for millions of Americans still \nstruggling in the Obama economy, and the Obama administration didn't \noffer them any consolation. Too often the administration has met \nstories of economic woe with excuses: uncertainty in the eurozone, not \nenough foreign demand, the Japanese tsunami, too much snow, too many \ncongressional Republicans, and of course the Obama administration's \nfavorite excuse, the Bush administration.\n  This time, among other things, the administration is blaming the \nmeasurements themselves. The administration claims the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis is not accurately measuring economic growth from \nquarter to quarter. Now, of course, the Department of Commerce should \nalways be looking for ways to modernize our measurements and adjust for \nseasonal changes, but no arithmetical sleight of hand can disguise the \nfact that our underlying economy is so weak that isolated events can \nshut down economic growth altogether and actually push our economy into \nthe red.\n  Economic growth has averaged an abysmal 2.2 percent under this \nadministration since the end of the recession. That is one of the \nweakest economic recoveries in the past 70 years. If the Obama recovery \nhad met the average economic growth experienced in all post-World War \nII recoveries, our economy would be $1.9 trillion larger than it is \ntoday.\n  If you look at the President's record, it is easy to see why our \neconomy is still sputtering along: a failed $1 trillion stimulus, $1.6 \ntrillion in new taxes, the President's health care law, which raised \npremiums for families and increased costs for small businesses, 2,222 \nnew regulations costing more than $653 billion in new compliance costs, \na Federal debt that has doubled on the President's watch, a financial \nreform bill that has overreached and is stifling community banks and \nlending across the country, and a runaway EPA that wants to increase \nelectricity rates on families who are already struggling with stagnant \nwages and now--now--wants to regulate ditches and ponds in farm fields \nacross the country.\n  All of this has led some economists to wonder if 2 percent growth is \nthe new normal. If it is, it is very bad news for American families who \nwill face a future that is less prosperous with less economic \nopportunity and mobility.\n  During the entire postwar period, from 1947 to 2013, our Nation \naveraged 3.3 percent growth. At that pace, the standard of living in \nAmerica almost doubles every 30 years. Incomes rise, financial security \nincreases, and more people are able to afford homes, take vacations, \nand save for higher education. At the pace of growth we have seen since \n2007, on the other hand, it will take closer to 99 years for the \nstandard of living to double.\n  Unfortunately, our recent weak economic growth shows every sign of \ncontinuing. The Congressional Budget Office projects our economy will \ngrow at an average pace of 2.5 percent through 2018 and just 2.2 \npercent from 2020 through 2025.\n  That is not good news for American families. For generations, \nindividuals have clung to the promise America has always held out: If \nyou work hard, you could build a better life for yourself and an even \nbetter one for your children. But after years of economic stagnation, \nthat promise is now in jeopardy.\n  A survey released last September reported that nearly half of \nAmericans over 18 believe their children will be worse off financially \nthan they are. A similar percentage of Americans no longer believe if \nyou work hard you will get ahead.\n  Their disillusionment is not surprising. The weak economic growth we \nhave experienced over the past several years has left families \nstruggling to make ends meet. Americans are struggling to make health \ncare costs and to make mortgage payments. They are no longer sure they \ncan put their children through college and retire comfortably. Some \nhave even lost their homes. Good-paying jobs are few and far between.\n  The U.S. Census Bureau reports that for the time since the government \nbegan tracking the number, more businesses are closing each year than \nare being opened. Think about that. More businesses are closing. There \nare more business deaths than there are business births in this country \ntoday.\n  Millions of Americans are unemployed, and millions more are being \nforced to work part time because they can't find full-time work. Forty \npercent of unemployed Americans have become so disillusioned with the \nlack of opportunity, they have given up entirely looking for work--40 \npercent. That is a staggering number. If the unemployment rate were \nchanged to reflect the number of unemployed who have given up looking \nfor work, our current unemployment rate would be well over 9 percent.\n  The good news is that things don't have to stay that way. We can \nenact progrowth policies that will return our economy to a more \nprosperous path in the 21st century. According to former CBO Director \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, the differences between 2.5 percent growth and 3.5 \npercent growth would have a major impact on the quality of life for \nlow- and middle-income families.\n  If our economy grows at a rate that is just 1 percentage point faster \nthan what is projected, we will have 2\\1/2\\ million more jobs and \naverage incomes will be $9,000 higher. Average incomes would be $9,000 \nhigher if we grow just 1 percentage point faster than what is \nprojected. For a lot of Americans, that is the difference between \nowning your home and renting one. It is the difference between being \nable to send your kids to college or forcing them to go deeply into \ndebt to pay for their education. It is the difference between a secure \nretirement and being forced to work well into old age.\n  Additionally, the CBO estimates that for every additional one-tenth \npercent increase in economic growth, it reduces our deficits by $300 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That means an additional percentage \npoint in economic growth will reduce our deficits by $3 trillion over \nthe next 10 years, and that in turn--reducing deficits--would further \nenhance economic growth.\n  Senate Republicans have laid out a number of policies to help grow \nthe economy and open up opportunities for low- and middle-income \nAmericans. We proposed energy policies that will expand domestic energy \ndevelopment which will help drive down energy prices. We are advancing \ntrade policies that will help create more opportunities for American \nworkers here at home by increasing the market for U.S. goods and \nservices abroad. We have proposed tax reform that will simplify our \noutdated Tax Code and make our businesses more competitive, which will \nopen up new jobs and opportunities for American workers. We have laid \nout entitlement reforms that will keep our promises to our seniors \nwhile protecting our economy by reducing our long-term deficits. We are \npushing for regulatory reforms that will rein in the out-of-control \ngovernment bureaucracies that are stifling economic growth.\n  Years and years of government overspending, burdensome taxation, \nmassive government programs--many of which don't work--and excessive \nregulation have taken their toll on our economy, but we can still undo \nthat damage. For generations, America has held out the promise of hope \nand opportunity, and Republicans are committed to ensuring it does so \nagain. We invite\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nour colleagues to join us because we can have a better, brighter, and \nmore prosperous future for future generations of Americans by changing \ndirections, changing the policies, doing away with the regulations, the \noverreaching government that has made it so difficult for so many \nAmericans to get ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are fortunately moving forward on this \nissue of extreme importance to the security of the American people. \nThese are necessary procedures we should take to do everything we can \nto ensure our safety, to publicly discuss and debate the issue of \nterrorist threat and the measures the people's government is taking to \ndefend our country and to defend each individual American from being a \nvictim of terrorism.\n  As Senator Burr, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, just \nrelated, the threat to our certain security and to our safety has never \nbeen stronger, never been more threatening, with the proliferation of \nterrorist organizations, the unfortunate proliferation of the \ninspiration that is being provided through social media to any number \nof American citizens--and those who may not be citizens but are \nresiding in this country--to take up arms or to create a bomb or bring \nharm to Americans in the name of support for jihad, in the name of \nISIS, in the name of Al Qaeda, in the name of support for the extreme \nfundamentalist activities of terrorists that are prevailing not only \nthrough the Middle East but affecting the world in various places.\n  We know through intelligence gathering and through public statements, \nthe United States has been put in the crosshairs. ``Kill Americans, no \nmatter how you do it, take it up. We will learn today, if we haven't \nlearned already,'' something that has just come across the wires of \nsomeone who was attempting to do just that, and we just see more and \nmore references to these types of attacks.\n  Unfortunately, we are in a period of time when one of the methods we \nhad to try to detect these threats is no longer in operation. It is not \nin operation because the authorization for going forward with this \nprogram, described as section 215 of the PATRIOT Act--the collection of \nraw telephone numbers, not anybody's name but raw telephone numbers--\nthat we could use as a base to determine whether, from a foreign \nsource, a known terrorist or someone connected to a terrorist \norganization is talking to somebody in the United States. That is the \nprogram. Unfortunately, that program is dark. It is shut down. It shut \ndown at midnight Sunday.\n  The program was shut down because we could not achieve support for \neven a minimum extension of time for which to better understand the \nprogram, to better debate and discuss the program, to make adjustments \nnecessary to ensure that Americans' privacy was not being breached. \nSeveral requests were made and, unfortunately, one Member, exercised \nhis right to say no to a unanimous consent request, and we were in a \nposition where we had to ask for consent driven by our procedural \nprocess we have to go through to achieve a vote. But, that vote was \nrejected time after time after time. So on the basis of one Member's \nobjection, we have what I believe, what many believe, and what those \nwho better understand this now that we have been able to disclose what \nit is believe is a necessary tool that ought to be in place.\n  This program ought to be in place for the very purpose of doing \neverything we can to prevent another 9/11, to prevent something much \nworse than 9/11, which would involve a 9/11 type of action coupled and \nmarried with a weapon of mass destruction. Where an attack in New York \nwould not result in 3,000 in casualties--it would potentially result in \n3 million casualties or even more or something concocted by a small \ngroup of people who would shoot up a shopping mall or rush into an \nelementary school or just simply take down someone on the subway system \nor an individual attack by someone with a knife or an ax or a gun.\n  One of the essential programs we have had that has been successful \nhas been under attack in terms of breaching the privacy of American \ncitizens. I think it has been made clear in the last few days that \nthere has been no abuse of this program and that no one's privacy has \nbeen breached. The only allegation that holds true is that it has the \npotential to breach someone's privacy. Over the years, there has never \nbeen documented abuse. No one's privacy has been breached. To shut down \na program with that kind of record on the basis that something could \nhappen, that government could use this, I know resonates with a number \nof people in the United States. I really don't blame them.\n  This current administration's policies have created great distrust \namong the American people as to their leadership, as to their \noperations, as to their policies.\n  When we look at what has taken place with the IRS, definitely \nbreaching people's privacy for political purposes, when we look at \nBenghazi and the coverup that has taken place in Benghazi, with the \nadministration refusing to stand up and take responsibility for not \nresponding adequately and changing the narrative and rewriting the \nintelligence. And when we look at Fast and Furious and the agency \nresponsible there. I fully understand not just the frustration but the \nanger that American people have and the distrust they have.\n  One of the most difficult issues those of us in the Intelligence \nCommittee have had to deal with is that when there are descriptions of \npolicies that are implemented in terms of providing for an intelligence \ngathering and necessary response to prevent terrorist attacks, that \ninformation is classified. So when we see the program being \nmisrepresented and described as something that it isn't, we don't have \nthe ability to respond. We can't go to the press without breaching our \noath to secrecy. We do not and cannot release classified material.\n  So while we now are in a position of having to unclassify this \nmaterial, we have to understand that everything we say is not only \nlistened to by the American people in an attempt to ensure their \nprivacy is not being breached--and that this is an essential tool to \nhelp prevent terrorist attacks. Terrorist groups know everything that \nis being said and done, and they will make behavioral changes. They \nwill make changes in terms of how they communicate.\n  So the program is being compromised by the very fact that we have had \nto come on the floor and publicly address it and release information as \nto what it is to help assure the American people that, in fact, what \nhas been said about the program is simply false.\n  I have been on the floor several times raising that issue, using the \nquotes of what has been said by Members on this floor--particularly one \nMember. That is blatantly false. It is a blatant misrepresentation of \nwhat the program is. Now, I am not questioning their motive. I am not \nquestioning the individual's decision in terms of whether he is for or \nagainst or wants to support or not support. All I want to do is clarify \nso that the public has the facts and they can make their own \ndetermination. We make a valid case that privacy is not breached. If \nsomeone comes to the conclusion that they don't trust what we say, \ndon't believe what we say or don't agree with what we say, that is \ntheir decision. All I want is for them to have the facts in front of \nthem so that when they make that decision, it is based on fact and not \nbased on what has been misrepresented.\n  That is why I took the actual words stated on this floor relative to \nthe program--which I believe misrepresented the program--and challenged \nthem. I challenged them with the factual information. I am not going to \nrepeat them. That is a matter of record.\n  We now are at the point, however--because we were not able to achieve \nany support for any kind of extension to either clarify what the bill \ndoes and doesn't do or to clarify with the House of Representatives how \nwe best can coordinate this process and come up with a good solution to \nthe issue--where, procedurally, we only have two options.\n  One option is essentially to do nothing. The program does not secure \nthe votes to be reauthorized, and that program is taken off the books \nand is no longer there. In my opinion and in the opinion of many, that \nmakes us more vulnerable. That gives us less access to be able to stop \na terrorist attack.\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\n  The second option is to support an effort that was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives, the USA FREEDOM Act, which I wish I could say \naddressed the issue and doesn't compromise the program. But it severely \ngoes against what this program attempts to do. It compromises the \nprogram to the point where I am not even sure the program can exist \nunder the provisions that have been enacted by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Three very experienced and trustworthy individuals who don't have to \nsalute the Commander in Chief and can give their own unbiased opinions \non this came before our Intelligence Committee and basically said that \nwith the structure of the USA FREEDOM Act, you might as well not have \nthe program in it because it will take down the program. There are a \ncouple of major issues here that these amendments try to address but \ndon't technically address. I am going to be supporting those \namendments. I think they make a bad piece of legislation a little bit \nbetter. But I have real questions as to whether it addresses the \nproblems that really render the program inoperable.\n  The first is retention. There is no mandatory retention among \ntelephone companies that they keep the information--the phone numbers--\nthat we need in order to create a haystack of numbers from which we can \nidentify connections between foreign terrorist organizations and \noperatives inside the United States. That is not done by somebody \nlooking at anybody's records. Before the NSA can even use a phone \nnumber, it needs to have outside approval--legal approval--to query \nthat.\n  If the telephone companies don't retain those numbers, we can't go \nout and match them up. And there is no mandatory retention of those \nnumbers. It is simply an amendment now that would basically say they \nwould have to give us notice that they don't retain them. But there is \nno mandatory retention.\n  I can just see a lot of companies saying--and I have heard from a lot \nof companies: We don't want to be responsible for trying to build in \nthe protections and hire the people who have the background checks and \nthe security clearances to put a regulatory process in place to make \nsure our people don't abuse this or use it for the wrong purpose.\n  So here we have a program that is accessible only by a very limited \nnumber of people at the National Security Agency, overseen by layers \nand layers of lawyers and legal experts and others to make sure it is \nnot abused in any way. They have been successful because there has not \nbeen one case of an abusiveness process against anybody's personal \nliberties. There are six layers of oversight that are in place before \nthey can even take it to the court and say: We think we have a problem \nhere. We think there is a suspicion--a reasonable suspicion--that a \nphone number may be associated with a terrorist organization.\n  Then the court looks at that and says: We think you have something \nhere. But let's check it further before we give you the authority to \nturn this over to the FBI so they can then look into this in greater \ndetail to determine whether this is a live terrorist act.\n  As Senator Burr said, it works on the negative side, also, and there \nare some examples of live situations--as in the Boston bombing and so \nforth--that proved the negative. It proved there wasn't a conspiracy. \nIt proved that just two people were involved in this. There were no \nconnections. So they didn't have to waste a lot of time trying to query \nand pull up a bunch of information about whom they had talked to, and \nthe police were then allowed to focus their efforts on Boston and what \nthen took place in Boston and not throw the alarm out to New York \nCity--the allegation was that they were on the way to New York City--\nand shut down New York City, causing panic and causing scare and \nalerting police and so forth. They were able to prove the negative of \nthat. So it works both ways. But without that retention, we are not \ngoing to be able to accomplish that.\n  So I don't understand how the USA FREEDOM Act is a better way of \nprotecting privacy and a better way of dealing with the fact that time \nis of the essence here. Instead of querying one area, we now have to go \nto multiple telephone companies, and there are 1,400 in the country. \nLet's say there are 100 major companies or let's say there are 10 major \ncompanies. We have to go to all 10 or to all 100 or more in order to \nfind out whether in their database that telephone number exists. Time \nis of the essence here. If you are detecting a terrorist attempt and \nyou build in all kinds of steps you have to take in order to get to the \npoint where you think you really have something here, the act could \nhave already been undertaken.\n  So those two issues, I think, are major problems with the FREEDOM \nAct.\n  The third is simply to think that the layers of protection and \njudicial oversight, executive oversight, and congressional oversight \nthat take place to make sure we don't abuse the program through NSA--\nevery telephone company has to insert that same level of oversight, and \nthey simply won't be able to do it. It will take months. It takes \nmonths to get background checks and security clearances. Many telephone \ncompanies don't have the capacity to do that. They do not have the \nfinancial ability to do that. The irony is that individuals' privacy is \nmore at risk by the telephone companies holding the numbers than the \nNSA holding the numbers, but, of course, we have not been able to \nconvince the American people of that partly because the program has \nbeen so distortedly reported. But this as the saving grace to protect \neverybody's privacy by turning it over to the phone companies instead \nof turning it over to NSA just doesn't add up.\n\n  It is going to be very difficult for me and I think for many of my \ncolleagues to think--while many of us are going to support these very \nlimited amendments, which we don't even know the House will accept, it \ndoes not resolve the issue and does not solve the problem that we are \ndealing with here and, in effect, could render the program inoperable.\n  I think when Members are making decisions about which option to \nchoose, it is a devil's choice. Is something better than nothing or is \nsomething really nothing and you end up with nothing and nothing? None \nof us wants our country to be put into that position, but that is where \nwe are. If we are not able to secure passage of these amendments to \nimprove this and the House rejects it--or we reject it or the House \nrejects it, then the program will stay inoperable.\n  I think the American people will then be picking up their phones and \nwriting and emailing us and urging us to rethink this program through \nnow that they know more about it, now that they know that much of what \nhas been said irresponsibly by Members of this body and others is not \ntrue. Once they learn more about it, I think they will be calling on us \nto take a new look, and they will take a new look.\n  The arguments simply do not hold up because they are not factual. Now \nthat we have been able to release some of this classified information \nand now that people have the ability to understand, if they so choose--\nto take another look at this and the proof we have provided relative to \nthe success of the program and relative to the need for the program.\n  That is what is before us. There has been a constitutional argument \nhere regarding the Fourth Amendment, and it is important to note: ``The \nright of the people to be secure in the persons, houses, papers, and \neffects against unreasonable searches.'' Unreasonable. I think we have \nproven this is not an unreasonable search. It does not identify \nanybody's name. Only after a court approves and gives the NSA the \nauthority to go forward, similar to seeking the authority of a judge \nfor other suspected criminal activity taking place in every \njurisdiction across America, every town, every police department going \nto court. We tune in to ``Law & Order'' and ``CSI'' and all these \nprograms and we see exactly how this works. You cannot go barging into \na house without a warrant. You cannot collect information without a \nwarrant.\n  The case being made that there is a violation here of the Fourth \nAmendment simply has not held up with legal authorities. Secondly--this \nis interesting. This was just pointed out to me. I am not a \nconstitutional scholar. I took constitutional law in law school\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nand probably have forgotten half of it. But I do carry it around. I do \nlook at it, but I am not a scholar. But I think it is pretty clear and \npretty interesting that article I, section 5, talking about the \nlegislature, says:\n\n       Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and \n     from time to time publish the same--\n\n  It is on our desks here. Every day, our Congressional Record, these \nare our proceedings--\n\n     excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require \n     secrecy.\n\n  That is why we have an Intelligence Committee. There are some things \nthat require secrecy. Unfortunately, we have had to unclassify \ninformation to try to let the public know that what they have been told \nby their government, elected members of their government, is breaching \ntheir privacy, which is not true. We have a constitutional right as a \nbody to make a decision and a judgment requiring secrecy. On this \nprogram, we require secrecy because once our adversaries know what we \nare doing, they are going to change what they are doing and it will not \nbe worthwhile anymore.\n  Also, relative to the statements made by the Senator from \nConnecticut, who opposes the amendment on the amicus issue, it is my \nunderstanding that the Administrative Office of the United States \nCourts, Director Duff, sent a letter to the House asking for their \nconcerns about the amicus issue effect on the court be placed in the \nbill. That was turned down by the House, unfortunately.\n  The letter says, ``We respectfully request that, if possible, this \nletter be included with your Committee's report to the House on the \nbill.''\n  It was sent to the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, United States House of Representatives. It is in regard \nto H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I am \nreferencing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Administrative Office of the\n\n\n                                          United States Courts\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Devin Nunes,\n     Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House \n         of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 2048, the ``USA \n     Freedom Act,'' which was recently ordered reported by the \n     Judiciary Committee, to provide perspectives on the \n     legislation, particularly an assessment that the pending \n     version of the bill could impede the effective operation of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts.\n       In letters to the Committee on January 13, 2014 and May 13, \n     2014, we commented on various proposed changes to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Our comments focused on \n     the operational impact of certain proposed changes on the \n     Judicial Branch, particularly the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court (``FISC'') and the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review (collectively ``FISA Courts''), \n     but did not express views on core policy choices that the \n     political branches are considering regarding intelligence \n     collection. In keeping with that approach, we offer views on \n     aspects of H.R. 2048 that bear directly on the work of the \n     FISA Courts and how that work is presented to the public. We \n     sincerely appreciate the ongoing efforts of the bipartisan \n     leadership of all the congressional committees of \n     jurisdiction to listen to and attempt to accommodate our \n     perspectives and concerns.\n       We respectfully request that, if possible, this letter be \n     included with your Committee's report to the House on the \n     bill.\n\n\n                          Summary of Concerns\n\n       We have three main concerns. First, H.R. 2048 proposes a \n     ``panel of experts'' for the FISA Courts which could, in our \n     assessment, impair the courts' ability to protect civil \n     liberties by impeding their receipt of complete and accurate \n     information from the government (in contrast to the helpful \n     amicus curiae approach contained in the FISA Improvements Act \n     of 2013 (``FIA''), which was approved in similar form by the \n     House in 2014). Second, we continue to have concerns with the \n     prospect of public ``summaries'' of FISA Courts' opinions \n     when the opinions themselves are not released to the public. \n     Third, we have a few other specific technical concerns with \n     H.R. 2048 as drafted.\n\n\n                       Nature of the FISA Courts\n\n       With the advent of a new Congress and newly proposed \n     legislation, it seems helpful to restate briefly some key \n     attributes of the work of the FISA Courts.\n       The vast majority of the work of the FISC involves \n     individual applications in which experienced judges apply \n     well-established law to a set of facts presented by the \n     government--a process not dissimilar to the ex parte \n     consideration of ordinary criminal search warrant \n     applications. Review of entire programs of collection and \n     applications involving bulk collection are a relatively small \n     part of the docket, and applications involving novel legal \n     questions, though obviously important, are rare.\n       In all matters, the FISA Courts currently depend on--and \n     will always depend on--prompt and complete candor from the \n     government in providing the courts with all relevant \n     information because the government is typically the only \n     source of such information.\n       A ``read copy'' practice--similar to the practices employed \n     in some federal district courts for Title III wiretap \n     applications--wherein the government provides the FISC with \n     an advance draft of each planned application, is the major \n     avenue for court modification of government-sought \n     surveillance. About a quarter of ``read copies'' are modified \n     or withdrawn at the instigation of the FISC before the \n     government presents a final application--in contrast to the \n     overwhelming majority of formal applications that are \n     approved by the Court because modifications at the ``read \n     copy'' stage have addressed the Court's concerns in cases \n     where final applications are submitted.\n       The FISC typically operates in an environment where, for \n     national security reasons and because of statutory \n     requirements, time is of the essence, and collateral \n     litigation, including for discovery, would generally be \n     completely impractical.\n       At times, the FISA Courts are presented with challenging \n     issues regarding how existing law applies to novel \n     technologies. In these instances, the FISA Courts could \n     benefit from a conveniently available explanation or \n     evaluation of the technology from an informed non-government \n     source. Congress could assist in this regard by clarifying \n     the law to provide mechanisms for this to occur easily (e.g., \n     by providing for pre-cleared experts with whom the Court can \n     share and receive information to the extent it deems \n     necessary).\n\n\n The ``Panel of Experts'' Approach of H.R. 2048 Could Impede the FISA \n                              Courts' Work\n\n       H.R. 2048 provides for what proponents have referred to as \n     a ``panel of experts'' and what in the bill is referred to as \n     a group of at least five individuals who may serve as an \n     ``amicus curiae'' in a particular matter. However, unlike a \n     true amicus curiae, the FISA Courts would be required to \n     appoint such an individual to participate in any case \n     involving a ``novel or significant interpretation of law'' \n     (emphasis added)--unless the court ``issues a finding'' that \n     appointment is not appropriate. Once appointed, such amici \n     are required to present to the court, ``as appropriate,'' \n     legal arguments in favor of privacy, information about \n     technology, or other ``relevant'' information. Designated \n     amici are required to have access to ``all relevant'' legal \n     precedent, as well as certain other materials ``the court \n     determines are relevant.''\n       Our assessment is that this ``panel of experts'' approach \n     could impede the FISA Courts' role in protecting the civil \n     liberties of Americans. We recognize this may not be the \n     intent of the drafters, but nonetheless it is our concern. As \n     we have indicated, the full cooperation of rank- and-file \n     government personnel in promptly conveying to the FISA Courts \n     complete and candid factual information is critical. A \n     perception on their part that the FISA process involves a \n     ``panel of experts'' officially charged with opposing the \n     government's efforts could risk deterring the necessary and \n     critical cooperation and candor. Specifically, our concern is \n     that imposing the mandatory ``duties''--contained in \n     subparagraph (i)(4) of proposed section 401 (in combination \n     with a quasi-mandatory appointment process)--could create \n     such a perception within the government that a standing body \n     exists to oppose intelligence activities.\n       Simply put, delays and difficulties in receiving full and \n     accurate information from Executive Branch agencies \n     (including, but not limited to, cases involving non-\n     compliance) present greater challenges to the FISA Courts' \n     role in protecting civil liberties than does the lack of a \n     non-governmental perspective on novel legal issues or \n     technological developments. To be sure, we would welcome a \n     means of facilitating the FISA Courts' obtaining assistance \n     from non-governmental experts in unusual cases, but it is \n     critically important that the means chosen to achieve that \n     end do not impair the timely receipt of complete and accurate \n     information from the government.\n       It is on this point especially that we believe the ``panel \n     of experts'' system in H.R. 2048 may prove counterproductive. \n     The information that the FISA Courts need to examine probable \n     cause, evaluate minimization and targeting procedures, and \n     determine and enforce compliance with court authorizations \n     and orders is exclusively in the hands of the government--\n     specifically, in the first instance, intelligence agency \n     personnel. If disclosure of sensitive or adverse information \n     to the FISA Courts came to be seen as a prelude to disclosure \n     to a third party whose mission is to oppose or curtail the \n     agency's work, then the prompt receipt of complete and \n     accurate information from the government would likely be \n     impaired--ultimately to the detriment of the national \n     security interest in expeditious action and the effective \n     protection of privacy and civil liberties.\n       In contrast, a ``true'' amicus curiae approach, as adopted, \n     for example, in the FIA,\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n     facilitates appointment of experts outside the government to \n     serve as amici curiae and render any form of assistance \n     needed by the court, without any implication that such \n     experts are expected to oppose the intelligence activities \n     proposed by the government. For that reason, we do not \n     believe the FIA approach poses any similar risk to the \n     courts' obtaining relevant information.\n\n\n   ``Summaries'' of Unreleased FISA Court Opinions Could Mislead the \n                                 Public\n\n       In our May 13, 2014, letter to the Committee on H.R. 3361, \n     we shared the nature of our concerns regarding the creation \n     of public ``summaries'' of court opinions that are not \n     themselves released. The provisions in H.R. 2048 are similar \n     and so are our concerns. To be clear, the FISA Courts have \n     never objected to their opinions--whether in full or in \n     redacted form--being released to the public to the maximum \n     extent permitted by the Executive's assessment of national \n     security concerns. Likewise, the FISA Courts have always \n     facilitated the provision of their full opinions to Congress. \n     See, e.g., FISC Rule of Procedure 62(c). Thus, we have no \n     objection to the provisions in H.R. 2048 that call for \n     maximum public release of court opinions. However, a formal \n     practice of creating summaries of court opinions without the \n     underlying opinion being available is unprecedented in \n     American legal administration. Summaries of court opinions \n     can be inadvertently incorrect or misleading, and may omit \n     key considerations that can prove critical for those seeking \n     to understand the import of the court's full opinion. This is \n     particularly likely to be a problem in the fact-focused area \n     of FISA practice, under circumstances where the government \n     has already decided that it cannot release the underlying \n     opinion even in redacted form, presumably because the \n     opinion's legal analysis is inextricably intertwined with \n     classified facts.\n\n\n               Additional Technical Comments on H.R. 2048\n\n       The Judiciary, like the public, did not participate in the \n     discussions between the Administration and congressional \n     leaders that led to H.R. 2048 (publicly released on April 28, \n     2015 and reported by the Judiciary Committee without changes \n     on April 30). In the few days we have had to review the bill, \n     we have noted a few technical concerns that we hope can be \n     addressed prior to finalization of the legislation, should \n     Congress choose to enact it. These concerns (all in the \n     amicus curiae subsection) include:\n       Proposed subparagraph (9) appears inadvertently to omit the \n     ability of the FISA Courts to train and administer amici \n     between the time they are designated and the time they are \n     appointed.\n       Proposed subparagraph (6) does not make any provision for a \n     ``true amicus'' appointed under subparagraph (2)(B) to \n     receive necessary information.\n       We are concerned that a lack of parallel construction in \n     proposed clause (6)(A)(i) (apparently differentiating between \n     access to legal precedent as opposed to access to other \n     materials) could lead to confusion in its application.\n       We recommend adding additional language to clarify that the \n     exercise of the duties under proposed subparagraph (4) would \n     occur in the context of Court rules (for example, deadlines \n     and service requirements).\n       We believe that slightly greater clarity could be provided \n     regarding the nature of the obligations referred to in \n     proposed subparagraph (10).\n       These concerns would generally be avoided or addressed by \n     substituting the FIA approach. Furthermore, it bears emphasis \n     that, even if H.R. 2048 were amended to address all of these \n     technical points, our more fundamental concerns about the \n     ``panel of experts'' approach would not be fully assuaged. \n     Nonetheless, our staff stands ready to work with your staff \n     to provide suggested textual changes to address each of these \n     concerns.\n       Finally, although we have no particular objection to the \n     requirement in this legislation of a report by the Director \n     of the AO, Congress should be aware that the AO's role would \n     be to receive information from the FISA Courts and then \n     simply transmit the report as directed by law.\n       For the sake of brevity, we are not restating here all the \n     comments in our previous correspondence to Congress on \n     proposed legislation similar to H.R. 2048. However, the \n     issues raised in those letters continue to be of importance \n     to us.\n       We hope these comments are helpful to the House of \n     Representatives in its consideration of this legislation. If \n     we may be of further assistance in this or any other matter, \n     please contact me or our Office of Legislative Affairs at \n     202-502-1700.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James C. Duff,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. COATS. There is a lot more that could be said. We will shortly be \nvoting on the amendments here. I probably said more than I should.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Senator from Indiana yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield.\n  This is one of the most important issues I have had to deal with \nduring my times of service on behalf of our State and our country. I \nthink getting the facts out has been necessary. It is a momentous \ndecision that has momentous consequences. I hope each of us will take \nvery seriously all that has been said and weigh that in their own \njudgment and hopefully make the right decisions for the future of this \ncountry.\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I know we are about to adjourn for lunch, but I have to \ncome to the floor and pay the Senator a great compliment. For the last \n6 days, the Senator has tried to illuminate some misperceptions and, \nquite frankly, half-truths that have been talked about in terms of the \nNSA program. You have provided great information to the Senate and to \nthe people of the United States of America, and I think it is ironic--\nand I do not believe the Senator from Indiana knows this--but today in \nthe Finance Committee at 10:30 we had a hearing before the IRS \nCommissioner, Mr. Koskinen, who was trying to explain what the IRS was \ndoing with the 104,000 identities that were stolen from the IRS, which \nincluded the Social Security numbers, church contributions, home \nresidences, rent payments, debts, obligations, the entire amount of \ninformation of 104,000 American citizens. Nobody is talking about \ngiving the IRS to the phone companies. Nobody is talking about the \namount of information the IRS has and whether the government abuses or \nuses it. And here we are worried about 41 individuals who have the \nability to know 2 telephone numbers, the origination of a call and the \nduration of that call, without its association to a name, unless a \njudge says it is OK.\n  I think there has been a lot of misdirection this week. The American \npeople are starting to listen. I think the Senator from Indiana has \ndone a great job of illuminating the truth behind this issue. We have a \ngreat country. You do not find anybody trying to break out of the \nUnited States of America. They are all trying to break in. They are \nbecause we are safe and secure. I commend the Senator for fighting for \nthe safety, the security, and the rights of the American people.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for those words. I think this is a \nfight for all of us. How I wish we had been putting our time and our \npassion into what the Senator from Georgia just mentioned--a clear \nbreach of people's privacy on the record and a clear defense effort by \nthis administration to not have us go forward and examine this. If we \nhad been putting half of the passion into that, we would really be \nservicing the American people and the breaches of their privacy that \nare just apparent.\n  Here we have a program that has never had a case of a breach of \nprivacy, that has more oversight than any other program in the entire \nU.S. Government, that involves all three branches of our government--\nthe judicial, the legislative, and the executive--all with the intent \nof having something in place that can stop Americans from being killed \nby terrorists, and we have to spend weeks arguing just to correct the \nrecord, when so clearly in front of us are abuses by this \nadministration that we are not putting attention to--the irony of that \nand the irony of the fact that every day we have more information about \nthe scope of these potential terrorist attacks against Americans. Here \nwe are releasing five known terrorist leaders from Guantanamo to a \ncountry. We are combing the world to see if somebody will take them \nbecause we do not want to retain them here, and we know they are going \nto go back. They are not going back to be baristas at Starbucks. They \nare not going back to do lawn work back home or start a microbusiness. \nThey are going back to join the enemy attack against us. They are going \nback to the Taliban. They are going back to Al Qaeda. They are going \nback to do what they were arrested for in the first place.\n  How ironic and how uncertain our situation here is relative to our \nsecurity, and we are arguing over a tool that can help protect us \ninstead of focusing on the real threat.\n  Anyway, I got worked up during the 6 days a number of times. I \nappreciate the opportunity to, once again, try to clarify where we are. \nHopefully, the American people are listening.\n  We have a momentous decision to make coming up here very shortly. I \nhope each of us will use not polls and not what the public perception \nis, I hope each of us will use the judgment that we have had and the \naccess to information that we have had to make a\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\ndecision on the basis of what is best for the American people, not \nabout what is best politically, not what gets us past the next \nelection, not what is pleasing to people who want to hear things back \nat home, not on any other basis than what is necessary to do everything \nwe can to keep us safe from known terrorist attacks that are \nmultiplying faster than we can keep up with across the world, and \nAmericans are in the crosshairs. Our decision should be based on that \nand that alone.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3439-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know we have all had a chance to talk \nabout this and the seriousness of what is now before us at this time. I \nlook at the seriousness of this, and I listened to a lot of people \nstanding on the floor and saying things that sound popular to people \nback home, and I have heard from some of the people in my State of \nOklahoma, saying: They talk about the privacy problems and all these \nthings that might be existing. Then I always think about my 20 kids and \ngrandkids and think that they are the ones who are at stake.\n  This world we have right now is a much more dangerous world than it \nhas ever been before. I look wistfully back at the good old days of the \nCold War when we had a couple superpowers. We knew what they had--\nmutual assured destruction. It really meant something at that time. Now \nwe have crazy people with capabilities, people in countries who have \nthe ability to use weapons of mass destruction.\n  So right after 9/11 we formed the NSA. We have been talking about \nthat down here. It is not perfect, but I think it is important at this \nlast moment to point out the fact that a lot of lies have been told \ndown here. I heard one person--I think two or three different ones \ntalking about and making the statement that since the NSA procedure was \nset up after 9/11, that has not stopped one attack on America. I would \nlike to suggest to you that a good friend of mine and a good friend of \nthe Chair's, General Alexander, who is a very knowledgeable person and \nran that program for a while, said--and this was way back 2 years ago, \n2013--information ``gathered from these programs provided government \nwith critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in \nmore than 20 countries around the world'' and that the phone database \nplayed a role in stopping 10 terrorist acts since the 9/11 attacks.\n  I was very pleased to hear from my good friend, Senator Sessions, a \nfew minutes ago that a brand new poll that just came out of the field \nshows that almost two-thirds of the people in America want to go back \nand give back to the NSA those tools we took away 2 days ago.\n  Now we have a situation where we can talk about a few of the cases \nwhere major attacks on this country were stopped by the process we put \nin place after 9/11.\n  One was a planned attack in 2009. Najibullah Zazi was going to bomb \nthe New York City subway system. The plan was for him and two high \nschool friends to conduct coordinated suicide bombings, detonating \nbackpack bombs on New York City subway trains near New York's two \nbusiest subway stations; that is, Grand Central Station and Times \nSquare.\n  Sean Joyce, the Deputy FBI Director, said that the NSA intercepted an \nemail from a suspected terrorist in Pakistan communicating with someone \nin the United States ``about perfecting a recipe for explosives.''\n  On September 9, 2009, Afghan-American Zazi drove from his home in \nAurora, CO, to New York City, after he emailed Ahmed--that was his Al \nQaeda facilitator in Pakistan--that ``the marriage is ready.'' That was \na code that meant ``We are ready now to perform our task.'' The FBI \nfollowed Zazi to New York and broke up the plan of attack, and they \nstated it was because of the email that was intercepted by the NSA that \nallowed them to do that.\n  How big of a deal is that? People do not stop and think about the \nfact that if you look at the New York City subway stations down there, \nwe know that the average ridership of the New York City subway during \npeak hours averages just under 900,000 people--that is 900,000 people, \nAmericans who are living in New York City.\n  What we do know is that when they came to New York City to perform \ntheir plan at Grand Central Station and Times Square, it was the NSA \nusing the very tools we took away from them 2 days ago, and you wonder, \nhow many lives would have been lost? If there are 900,000 riders on the \nsubway and they are ready to do this at two stations, are we talking \nabout 100,000 lives, 100,000 Americans being buried alive? That attack \nwas precluded by the tools that were used by the NSA that we took away \nfrom them just 2 days ago. Many more have not been declassified.\n  GEN Michael Hayden and GEN Keith Alexander, who are both former \nDirectors of the NSA, and others have confirmed to me personally that \nat least one of the three terrorist attacks on 9/11 could have been \navoided, and perhaps all three could have been avoided if we had had \nthe tools we gave the NSA right after 9/11, and also the attack on the \nUSS Cole could have been prevented entirely.\n  So you have to stop and think, it is a dangerous thing to stand on \nthe floor and say we have formed this thing in this dangerous world and \nit has not stopped any attacks on America. That is what we are faced \nwith today.\n  I voted against the program the House passed that is going to be \nconsidered in just a few minutes. I felt it was better to leave it as \nwe had it. Now that is gone. I look at it this way: I do support the \namendments that are coming up. I do think the last opportunity we will \nhave will be the program we will be voting on in just a few minutes.\n  So let's think about this, take a deep breath, and go ahead and pass \nsomething so we at least have some capability to stop these attacks and \nto gather information from those who would perpetrate these attacks and \nthen have time to put together a program that will be very workable and \nmake some changes if necessary.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Extending FISA Provisions\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is unfortunate that we were unable to pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act before the June 1, 2015, sunset of sections 206 and 215 of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act and the so-called ``lone wolf'' provision of the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. Senator Lee and I \nboth sought to bring up the USA FREEDOM Act well before the sunset date \nto avoid just this situation. Now that the roving wiretap, business \nrecords, and so-called ``lone wolf'' provisions have lapsed, it is \nimportant that we make clear our intent in passing the USA FREEDOM Act \nthis week--albeit a few days after the sunset. Could the Senator \ncomment on the intent of the Senate in passing the USA FREEDOM Act \nafter June 1, 2015?\n  Mr. LEE. Although we have gone past the June 1 sunset date by a few \ndays, our intent in passing the USA FREEDOM Act is that the expired \nprovisions be restored in their entirety just as they were on May 31, \n2015, except to the extent that they have been amended by the USA \nFREEDOM Act. Specifically, it is both the intent and the effect of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act that the now-expired provisions of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, will, upon enactment of the USA \nFREEDOM Act, read as those provisions read on May 31, 2015, except \ninsofar as those provisions are modified by the USA FREEDOM Act, and \nthat they will continue in that form until December 15, 2019. Extending \nthe effect of those provisions for 4 years is the reason section 705 is \npart of the act.\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would also point out that when we drafted the USA \nFREEDOM Act, we included a provision to allow the government to collect \ncall detail records, CDRs, for a 180-day transition period, as it was \ndoing pursuant to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders prior \nto June 1, 2015. This provision was intended to provide as seamless a \ntransition as possible to the new CDR program under section 101 of the \nUSA FREEDOM Act. I thank the junior Senator from Utah for his \npartnership on this bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, our terrorist enemies continue to present a \nclear and present danger to our Nation's safety. We must use a broad \narray of information gathering tools to be successful in thwarting \ntheir plots and preventing future attacks. As the top Republican on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee after 9/11, I worked across party lines to \ngive our law enforcement and intelligence communities the authorities \nthey need to keep us safe. Having served longer than any other \nRepublican on the Intelligence Committee, I can personally attest to \nthe critical importance of these authorities in combating real \nterrorist threats.\n  Given the extensive and effective privacy and civil liberties \nsafeguards already in place, I strongly supported a clean \nreauthorization of the existing law. Unfortunately, such legislation \ncould not gather sufficient support in today's climate of \nmisinformation about our efforts to stay one step ahead of the \nterrorists. Contrary to the claims of its proponents, the so-called USA \nFREEDOM Act will hamper our ability to address serious terrorist \nthreats. My concerns about this legislation were further enhanced when \nthe Senate voted down several reasonable amendments that represented \nmodest changes needed to preserve our security. Accordingly, I voted \nagainst the bill because it will not provide the protections we need \nand will put our Nation at risk.\n  One of the fundamental flaws of the USA FREEDOM Act is its creation \nof unnecessary delays and impediments to our efforts to protect the \nAmerican people. Under this legislation, telephone metadata-consisting \nof information like the number calling and the length of the call-would \nno longer be collected by the government but instead be retained by \nprivate communications corporations. Proponents of the bill argue that \nthis move is necessary to protect privacy. This argument is \nunpersuasive, given that the data collected does not include the \nidentities of the callers or the content of their communications. I \noppose this approach because the bill lacks any requirement for these \ncompanies to retain this data for any length of time. Without such a \nrequirement, the effectiveness of a search of telephone metadata would \nobviously be compromised.\n  One of the other major flaws of the USA FREEDOM Act is its amicus \ncuriae provision, which would insert a legal advisor into the FISA \nCOURT process to make arguments to advance privacy and civil liberties. \nSuch an approach threatens to insert leftwing activists into an \nincredibly sensitive and already well-functioning process, a radical \nmove that would stack the deck against our law enforcement and \nintelligence communities. Given that previous law already provided \nintense scrutiny and oversight from the Justice Department, Congress, \nand the courts, this new provision is both unnecessary and potentially \nquite dangerous.\n  The Senate's action today undermines not only the operational \neffectiveness of one of our most critical tools to safeguard our \nnational security. Going forward, I will do everything within my power \nto ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence professionals have \nall the tools they need to keep us safe.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Sunday night was just another self-\ninflicted crisis from Senator McConnell and the Republican leadership. \nPlaying politics with our national security is reckless. And allowing \nothers to play politics with our national security, against the \nmajority of the U.S. Senate and House, is not leadership.\n  The Republicans said, ``Put us in the majority and we will govern \nresponsibly.'' They claimed there would be no more shutdowns, no more \ngoverning by crisis. Yet, on Sunday night our intelligence \nprofessionals were left without the important tools they need to fight \nterrorism. And now Republicans are at it again--proposing amendments \nthat would delay the process and leave us without these critical \ncapabilities for even longer.\n  FBI Director Comey said that his Agency uses section 215 fewer than \n200 times per year, but when the FBI uses it, ``it matters \ntremendously.'' And the White House National Security Council's Ned \nPrice said that a sunset would result ``in the loss, going forward, of \na critical national security tool.''\n  I can't believe Republicans would take us to the brink and put our \ncountry at risk. It is shameful. The USA FREEDOM Act is supported by a \nwide, bipartisan majority in both Chambers. It passed the House with \n338 votes. A little over a week ago, a clear majority of Senators, 57, \nvoted to proceed to this legislation. That still wasn't enough. Senator \nMcConnell and his Republican colleagues blocked it from moving forward. \nOn Sunday night, even more Senators did the right thing and voted in \nsupport of the USA FREEDOM Act. Mr. President, 77 Senators voted to \nproceed to a debate on the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who worked tirelessly on this \nlegislation, who reached out to the intelligence community, technology \ncompanies, and privacy and civil liberties groups to come up with a set \nof reforms that maintains the important balance between protecting \nprivacy and keeping our country safe. It is not easy to get this level \nof support. The USA FREEDOM Act strikes an important balance between \nprotecting our privacy and defending our country.\n  The bill reforms the PATRIOT Act by ending the bulk collection of \nAmericans' telephone records while still providing the ability for \ninvestigators to get the records in a more targeted manner. It would \nimprove the transparency of the government's surveillance activities by \nadding additional reporting requirements and giving private companies a \ngreater ability to publically report when they receive requests for \ninformation from the FBI or NSA. And it would add a panel of experts to \nthe FISA Court who can assist in providing additional points of view \nwhen cases involve significant or novel interpretations of the law.\n  We need to pass this bipartisan bill immediately and send it to the \nPresident, without amendments to water it down and further delay the \nintelligence community's access to these important authorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I rise today to urge prompt passage of the House-passed USA FREEDOM \nAct of 2015 and to urge opposition to the amendments offered by the \nmajority leader. Those amendments are unnecessary. They would weaken \nthe bill in unacceptable ways, and they would only serve to prolong and \ndeepen the uncertainty around the reform and continuation of important \nnational security authorities.\n  The House-passed USA FREEDOM Act is measured, compromise legislation \nthat is the result of lengthy negotiations that bring much needed \nreforms to some of our surveillance authorities, ensuring that we \nsafeguard Americans' rights while increasing the government's \naccountability. I am proud to have worked with Senator Dean Heller of \nNevada to craft the bill's transparency provisions, which draw support \nfrom privacy advocates, the business community, and national security \nexperts.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act works to end bulk collection programs that our \nintelligence community has told us are not necessary. At the same time, \nthe bill makes sure our national security agencies have legal tools \nthat are necessary to protect our Nation. Put simply, the USA FREEDOM \nAct of 2015 strikes the balance we need--making sure that our \ngovernment can keep our Nation safe without trampling on our citizens' \nfundamental privacy rights.\n  Of course, the public cannot know if we are succeeding in striking \nthat balance if they do not have access to even the most basic \ninformation about our major surveillance programs. That is why my focus \nhas been on the legislation's transparency provisions. Under the \nprovisions I wrote with Senator\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\nHeller, the American people will be better able to decide for \nthemselves whether we are getting this right.\n  For all these reasons, the act has my strong support. And I am in \ngood company. The House has passed it. The President is ready to sign \nit. We have the votes here to pass it. So what are we waiting for?\n  Senator McConnell has offered several amendments. And here is the \nproblem: They deviate from the House bill without improving the \nlegislation. At best, the result of adopting these amendments would be \nfurther delay, further negotiation, and a highly uncertain outcome.\n  Now that we have allowed the national security authorities at issue \nto expire, we simply do not know how the House would proceed if we sent \nthem back a modified bill. Maybe that kind of risk and delay would be \njustified if these amendments improved the bill, but they do not. I \nwould like to talk a little bit about why these amendments are both \nunnecessary and problematic.\n  The majority leader's main substitute amendment makes two additions \nto the bill. The first is a requirement that electronic communications \nservice providers notify the government if they plan to shorten the \nlength of time they retain call detail records--records that the \ngovernment may seek to query under the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  The fact is, based on how our country's telecom infrastructure is set \nup, the government only goes to a handful of companies for call detail \nrecords, and those companies have told us they have business reasons \nfor retaining records. Based on a long history of working with these \ncompanies--under these authorities, other authorities--the Attorney \nGeneral and the Director of National Intelligence have told us the USA \nFREEDOM Act is fine as it is. There simply is not a problem in need of \na solution here. And look, this is the kind of thing that we can \nrevisit if in the future some change in circumstances means that data \nretention threatens to become a problem. It certainly does not need to \nrisk derailing the bill and its reforms now.\n  The second change in the majority leader's substitute amendment is a \ncertification requirement asking the Director of National Intelligence \nto certify to Congress that the USA FREEDOM Act's transition from bulk \ncollection of call detail records to a more targeted approach is \noperationally effective.\n  To be clear, this certification, whether issued or not, in no way \naffects the effective date of the bill or the timeline for the \ntransition. It has no statutory limitations. It is a wholly unnecessary \ndeviation from the House-passed bill. If there is a problem with the \noperational effectiveness of the transition, you can bet that the \nDirector of National Intelligence is going to let us know, and I would \ncertainly hope and expect that we would all be ready to listen and work \nwith him at that point. Again, this is the kind of thing that should \nnot risk derailing the bill now.\n  The majority leader has offered other amendments that seek to weaken \nthe USA FREEDOM Act more directly. One amendment would lengthen the \ntime before the bill with its various reforms goes into full \neffect. That would do nothing but unnecessarily extend bulk collection \nprograms. NSA has told us they can transition in 6 months, as provided \nfor in the bill as it stands. There is no justification for extending \nthe timeline now.\n\n  Another amendment would render ineffective one of the safeguards for \nAmericans' privacy rights and civil liberties in the bill. This \namendment would weaken the role of outside, nongovernment experts in \nparticipating in certain cases before the FISA Court. That is an \nunacceptable change to a provision that has already been the subject of \nbipartisan negotiations and compromise.\n  That is really the thing to remember--this is a compromise bill. In \nwriting our transparency provisions, Senator Heller and I had to \ncompromise a great deal. We didn't get everything we wanted when we \ninitially negotiated these provisions last year, and we had to \ncompromise further still this year. I am disappointed that the bill \ndoesn't include all of the requirements that were agreed to in our \ndiscussions with the intelligence community and that were included in \nthe Senate bill last Congress. But that is the nature of bipartisan \ncompromise. And I recognize that right now we need to start by taking \none big step in the right direction, and that is by passing the USA \nFREEDOM Act.\n  Down the road, we will have the opportunity to revisit these issues \nas needed. For my part, I am committed to pushing my colleagues to \nrevisit the transparency provisions. We still have work to do, \nparticularly with regard to section 702, which has to deal with the \ncollection of communications of foreigners abroad. But, again, right \nnow it is clear what needs to happen in this Chamber. We need to pass \nthe House-passed USA FREEDOM Act without further amendment. If we do \nthat, we can get these authorities back up and running. That is exactly \nwhat we should do.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Minnesota \nfor his words. The press and everybody else does not see the hundreds \nof hours of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, Senators \nand Members of the House of Representatives working on this. The \nSenator from Minnesota is one of those who worked very hard to get us \nto the point where we are today. It has not been easy. Nobody got \neverything they wanted. I didn't get everything I wanted. Senator Lee \ndidn't get everything he wanted. The Senator from Minnesota didn't get \neverything he wanted. But because of the work of people such as the \nSenator from Minnesota, we have a far better piece of legislation, and \nit is probably why it passed overwhelmingly in the other body, with \nRepublicans and Democrats agreeing. In fact, that is why we have to \nreject these amendments and we have to cleanly pass the House-passed \nUSA FREEDOM Act.\n  Again, I cannot emphasize to Senators how much time has gone into \nthis by key Republicans and key Democrats in the House and key \nRepublicans and key Democrats in the Senate. We have worked behind the \nscenes for days, weeks, and months to get here.\n  Cleanly passing the House-passed USA FREEDOM Act is the only way to \navoid prolonging the uncertainty that the intelligence community now \nfaces because of the lapse in the three authorities this past Sunday. I \nthink both Senator Lee and I would agree the lapse in authorities was \nentirely avoidable. The Senate majority has put the intelligence \ncommunity and the American people in this position because of a \nmanufactured crisis, procedural delays.\n  Understand that any changes in this bill--as I have stated and as the \ndistinguished senior Senator from California has indicated, as well as \nothers, any changes in the bill will force it back to the House, and \nthere is absolutely no guarantee that the House will accept the \nSenate's changes and pass the new bill. In fact, the House Republican \nmajority leader said this morning that it would be a challenge to pass \nany bill that came back with changes. The Republican chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee put it more bluntly. He warned that any \namendments would likely make the sunsets permanent. Keep that in mind.\n  We can pass some amendments we may not think are major, although some \nof us think they are, but by passing them, all those who say they want \nto give the tools to the intelligence community--they are making the \nsunsets permanent if we pass these amendments.\n  So I urge Senators to oppose all of the amendments that are being \noffered by the majority leader. Senator Blumenthal, Senator Franken, \nand others have spoken about the reasons to oppose the FISA Court \namicus amendment and the substitute amendment. I agree with them \nwholeheartedly, and I thank them for their leadership. As I said \nearlier to others, Senator Blumenthal used his experience as a former \nattorney general, former U.S. attorney to work on the amicus provision.\n  I also urge Senators to oppose the amendment which would leave the \ncurrent bulk collection program in place for a full year. Extending the \ncurrent bulk collection program for a full year\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nis unnecessary. Beyond being unnecessary, it creates significant legal \nuncertainty for the government. Remember, a Federal appellate court has \nalready ruled that the program is unlawful, and they upheld a provision \nassuming that Congress is going to change it. But it is very obvious \nwhen we read the Second Circuit opinion that they mean a relatively \nshort time, not a year.\n  So the amendment to leave the bulk collection program in place for a \nfull year is only going to invite further legal challenges. It will \nalso delay implementation of tools the intelligence community has asked \nus to provide, including what is in this bill--a new emergency \nauthority to request business records under section 215.\n  I can't say enough about all of the work we have put in for 2 years \nacross the aisle and across the Capitol. This is a bill which brings \nmuch needed reform to the government's surveillance authorities, but it \nalso ensures that the intelligence community has the tools to keep us \nsafe.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act is milestone legislation. It will enact the most \nsignificant reforms of government surveillance powers since the USA \nPATRIOT Act. I am proud of the bipartisan and the bicameral effort that \nled to this bill.\n  Today, we can pass important surveillance reform legislation and then \nwork to build on these reforms in coming years.\n  So I urge Senators to oppose all amendments and then vote to pass the \nUSA FREEDOM Act, just as the House passed it. We don't need to inject \nany more uncertainty or delay into the process. None of these \namendments are worth causing further delay. Pass it. This will be \nsigned into law tonight by the President.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader on the floor, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are not \nthe sort of minority party that objects to virtually everything. We \nwant to help move things forward. But I also want to be clear that we \nare not going to require a vote to move forward on the Defense \nauthorization bill. But everyone should be aware that the President \nsaid he would veto this bill. It has all of this strange funding in \nit--funding that my Republican colleagues railed against on previous \noccasions. Now they are using it.\n  We have grave concerns about this bill. Unless it is changed, I \nrepeat, the President will veto it. I hope there are some significant \nchanges in the bill while it is on the floor so we can help to vote to \nget it off the floor. So based upon that, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1450\n\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1450.\n  The yeas and nays have been previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLeahy be recognized for 3 minutes. Then, I would say to my colleagues, \nI am going to use my leader time to make a final statement, and then we \nwill be ready for the final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor his courtesy.\n  Very briefly, we worked for 2 years across the aisle and actually \nacross the Capitol. I don't know how many meetings Senator Lee, and \nothers, and I have had. Now the Senate is finally poised to pass our \nUSA FREEDOM Act and send it to the President for his signature. This \nbill brings much-needed reform to the government's surveillance \nauthorities. It will end the bulk collection of Americans' phone \nrecords, increase transparency, improve oversight, and, most \nimportantly, help restore Americans' privacy--all while ensuring that \nthe intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep us safe.\n  I am proud to have done this. I have fought to protect the privacy \nand constitutional rights of Vermonters and all Americans since 1975, \nwhen I cast my first-ever vote as a Senator to approve the \nestablishment of the Church Committee. I will continue to fight for \nAmericans' privacy.\n  I urge Senators to vote to pass the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will now proceed on my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year I observed that \nPresident Obama's national security policy has been noteworthy for its \nconsistent objectives. He has been very consistent--drawing down our \nconventional and nuclear forces, withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan, \nending the tools developed by the previous administration to wage the \nwar on terror, and placing a greater reliance upon international \norganizations and diplomacy. That has been the hallmark of the Obama \nforeign policy.\n  None of this is a surprise. The President ran in 2008 as the \ncandidate who would end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on \nterror. And our Nation has a regrettable history of drawing down our \nforces and capabilities after each conflict, only to find ourselves ill \nprepared for the next great struggle.\n  The book ends to the President's policies were the Executive order \nsigned his very first week in office that included the declaration that \nGuantanamo would be closed within a year, without any plan for what to \ndo with its detainees, and the Executive order that ended the Central \nIntelligence Agency's detention and interrogation programs. Now, some \nof these detainees, my colleagues, are now in Qatar, preparing to \nrejoin the Taliban. Some are in Uruguay, camped out in a park across \nfrom the American embassy. And, regrettably, some are back on the \nbattlefield in Yemen, Afghanistan, and Syria. These are other hallmarks \nof the Obama foreign policy.\n  Last year the President announced that all of our combat forces would \nbe withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of his term in office, whether \nor not--whether or not--the Taliban were successful in capturing parts \nof Afghanistan, whether or not Al Qaeda senior leadership has found a \nmore permissive environment in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and \nwhether or not Al Qaeda has been completely driven from Afghanistan.\n  I will repeat. The pattern is clear. The President has been a \nreluctant Commander in Chief. And between those two book ends, my \ncolleagues, much has occurred that has undermined our national \nsecurity.\n  There was the failure to negotiate a status of forces agreement with \nIraq that would have allowed for a residual military force and \nprevented the assault by the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant. \nChina is aggressively expanding its sphere of influence. There is the \nthreat to veto funding for the troops--we just heard it from the \nminority leader--and their equipment without similar increases at the \nIRS and EPA.\n  Let me say that again. The President is threatening to veto the \nDefense bill unless we increase funding for the IRS and EPA. Now, this \nis going to diminish our military's ability to respond to the myriad of \nthreats that are facing us today. And we all know what they are. Al \nQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has doggedly pursued tactics and \ncapabilities to circumvent all that we have done since September 11, \n2001, to defend our country.\n  So while the President has inflexibly clung to campaign promises made \nin 2008, the threat from Al Qaeda has metastasized around the world. \nISIL, which has broken off from Al Qaeda, uses social media to \ncommunicate with Americans, divert them to encrypted communications, \nencourage travel to the would-be caliphate, and encourage attacks right \nhere at home. Al Qaeda and ISIL publish online magazines instructing \nindividuals in terrorist tactics. And in the long run, the al-Nusra \nFront in Syria may present the greatest long-term threat--the greatest \nlong-term threat--to our homeland.\n  The President's efforts to dismantle our counterterrorism tools have \nnot only been inflexible, but they are especially ill timed.\n  So today the Senate will vote on whether we should take one more tool \naway from those who defend this country every day: the ability of a \ntrained analyst, under exceedingly close supervision, and only with the \napproval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, to query a \ndatabase of call data records based on reasonable articulable \nsuspicion--no content, no names, no listings of phone calls of law-\nabiding citizens. None of that is going on. We are talking about call \ndata records.\n  These are the providers' records, which is not what the Fourth \nAmendment speaks to. It speaks to ``the right of the people to be \nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects.'' But these \nrecords belong to the phone companies. Let me remind the Senate that \nthe standard for reasonable articulable suspicion is that the terror \nsuspect is associated with a ``foreign terrorist organization'' as \ndetermined by a court. Nobody's civil liberties are being violated \nhere.\n  The President's campaign to destroy the tools used to prevent another \nterrorist attack has been aided by those seeking to prosecute officers \nin the intelligence community, to diminish our military capabilities, \nand, despicably, to leak and reveal classified information--putting our \nNation further at risk.\n  Those who reveal the tactics, sources, and methods of our military \nand intelligence community give a playbook--a playbook--to ISIL and to \nAl Qaeda. As the Associated Press declared today, the end of the \nsection 215 program is a ``resounding victory for Edward Snowden''--a \n``resounding victory for Edward Snowden.'' It is also a resounding \nvictory for those currently plotting attacks against our homeland.\n  Where was the defense of the National Security Agency from the \nPresident? Our chairman of the Intelligence\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\nCommittee and his committee colleagues have worked with determination \nto educate the Senate concerning the legal, technical, and oversight \nsafeguards currently in place.\n  We hear concerns about public opinion. A CNN poll was released \ntoday--just today. The CNN poll is not exactly part of the rightwing \nconspiracy. It states that 61 percent of Americans--61 percent of \nAmericans--think that the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act, \nincluding data collection, should be renewed.\n  So if there is widespread concern out of America about privacy, we \nare not picking it up. They are not reporting it to CNN. Sixty-one \npercent say: I am not concerned about my privacy. I am concerned about \nmy security.\n  So my view is that the determined effort to fulfill campaign promises \nmade by the President back in 2008 reflects an inability to adapt to \nthe current threat--what we have right now--an inflexible view of past \npolitical grievances and a policy that will leave the next President in \na weaker position to combat ISIL.\n  I cannot support passage of the so-called USA FREEDOM Act. It does \nnot enhance the privacy protections of American citizens, and it surely \nundermines Americans' security by taking one more tool from our war \nfighters, in my view, at exactly the wrong time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend the majority leader is \nconcerned, as he should be, about why the country is less secure--\nespecially in the last couple of weeks--he should look in the mirror. \nWe have a situation where he has tried to divert attention from what \nhas gone on here. It was as if there had been a big neon sign flashing \nsaying: You can't do highway reauthorization, you can't do FISA \nreauthorization, and you can't do trade in 4 or 5 days.\n  To do this right, we should have spent some time on FISA. Because of \nthe mad rush to do trade, that did not happen. So today to try to \ndivert attention from what I believe has been a miscalculation of the \nmajority leader, it is making this country less safe. Every day that \ngoes by with the FISA bill not being reauthorized is a bad day for our \ncountry. It makes us less safe. And to try to divert attention, as he \nhas tried doing in the last few minutes--blaming the Obama \nadministration for stopping torture, the detention centers, pulling \ntroops out of Iraq--I say, my friend is looking in the wrong direction.\n  The issue before us is not to be--and he is, in effect, criticizing \nthe House of Representatives for passing this FISA bill, to reauthorize \nit in a way that is more meaningful to the American people and makes us \nmore safe. It makes it so people feel more secure about the \nintelligence operations we have going on in this country.\n  Is he criticizing the Speaker for working hard to get this bill \nreauthorized and in a fashion the American people accept? Because his \ncriticism today is not directed toward people who voted here today; it \nis directed toward the bipartisan efforts in the House of \nRepresentatives that passed this bill overwhelmingly, with 338 votes. \nIt is one of a few bipartisan things they have done over there, and \nthey did it for the security of this Nation. I do not think any of us \nneeds a lecture on why we are less secure today than we were a few days \nago. I hope everyone will vote to continue the surveillance \npossibilities that we have available if this law passes. If it does not \npass, what are we going to do? It will go to the House of \nRepresentatives. The majority leader of the House of Representatives, \nthe distinguished House Member from California, Mr. McCarthy, said: \nThey do not want anything from us. They want this bill passed. They \nwant the USA FREEDOM bill passed today. That is what the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, said. Of course, that is what \nthe Democratic leader says also.\n  Let's vote. A vote today to pass this bill will make our country \nsafer immediately, not a week from now. That is how long it will take, \nat a minimum, if this bill is changed when it goes to the House--I am \nsorry--if it does not go to the President directly, and it should go \ndirectly from here to the President of the United States. He can sign \nthis in a matter of hours and put us back on a more secure footing to \nprotect ourselves from the bad guys around the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my good friend, the minority leader, \nfrequently reminded me over the last few years, the majority leader \nalways gets the last word.\n  Look, his fundamental complaint is he does not get to schedule the \nSenate anymore. He wanted to kill the President's trade bill, and so he \ndid not like the fact that we moved to the trade bill early enough \nbefore the opposition to it might become more severe.\n  I say to the Senator, the minority leader, he does not get to set the \nschedule anymore. My observations about the President's foreign policy \nare directly related to the vote we are about to cast. It remains my \nview--I know there are differences of opinion, and I respect everybody \nin here who has a different opinion--that this bill is part of a \npattern to pull back, going back to the time the President took office. \nI remember the speech in Cairo back in 2009 to the Muslim world, which \nsought to question American exceptionalism. We are all pretty much \nalike. If we just talked to each other more, everything would be OK. In \nalmost every measurable way, all the places I listed, plus Ukraine--you \nname them--we have been pulling back. My view with regard to my \nposition and my vote is that this is a step in the wrong direction. But \nI respect the views of others, and I suspect the minority leader will \nbe happy at the end of the day. It appears to me the votes are probably \nthere to pass this bill, and it will go to the President. I still think \nit is a step backward from where we are. It has been a great debate. I \nrespect all of those who engaged in it on both sides. I think it is \ntime to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the bill we just passed is a historic \nmoment. It is the first major overhaul of government surveillance laws \nin decades that adds significant privacy protections for the American \npeople. It has been a long and difficult road, but I am proud of what \nthe Congress has achieved today. This is how democracy is supposed to \nwork. Congress is ending the bulk collection of Americans' private \nphone records once and for all.\n  To my partners in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, I thank you. \nSenator Lee, whose name is on our bill here in the Senate, believes \nstrongly in our constitutional system of government. He has worked \ntirelessly to advance this bill from the day we first introduced the \nUSA FREEDOM Act. Senator Franken has devoted himself to the \ntransparency measures in the bill. Senator Blumenthal shaped the FISA \nCourt amicus provisions. This was hard fought, and they never wavered.\n  I also want to thank Senators Heller, Cruz, Murkowski, Daines, \nDurbin, and Schumer, the other original cosponsors of this bill. They \nhave each worked to help advance this legislation and build the \ncoalition we needed to finally get to our strong bipartisan vote in the \nSenate for passage. I must also mention Senator Feinstein, who provided \ninvaluable support to get this bill across the finish line. Of course, \nI also need to thank Minority Leader Reid, who has never wavered in his \nstrong support and responsible leadership.\n  On the House side, Chairman Goodlatte and Congressmen Sensenbrenner, \nConyers, and Nadler have been the kind of bipartisan partners on this \nbill that every legislator wants in their corner.\n  I also need to thank Senators Wyden and Heinrich and former Senator \nMark Udall, who used their positions on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee to ask the hard questions behind closed doors and who have \nfought to end this program for so long.\n  While we have much work to do, we have accomplished something \nmomentous today. We are a better nation for it.\n  I also want to thank the many staffers who have worked long hours on \nthis legislation for nearly two years now. On my own Judiciary \nCommittee staff, I thank Chan Park, Lara Flint, Jessica Brady, Hasan \nAli, Patrick Sheahan, Logan Gregoire, Jonathan Hoadley, Joel Park and \nKristine Lucius. My personal office staff, including J.P. Dowd, Erica \nChabot, David Carle, John Tracy and Diane Derby, also worked hard on \nthis effort, and I am grateful for that. I also want to thank \nDemocratic and Republican Senate staffers who have toiled countless \nhours on this effort, including Matt Owen, Mike Lemon, Wendy Baig, \nJames Wallner, Josh Finestone, Scarlet Doyle, Ayesha Khanna, Alvaro \nBedoya, Helen Gilbert, Samantha Chaifetz, Sam Simon, John Dickas, Chad \nTanner, and Jennifer Barrett.\n  We not only worked across the aisle on this legislation, but we also \nworked across the Capitol. The bipartisan group of House staff who \nhelped to craft this compromise bill and generated such an overwhelming \nvote on this legislation deserve enormous credit for their work: \nCaroline Lynch (who along with Lara Flint deserves a perfect attendance \naward for extensive negotiating sessions), Bart Forsyth, Aaron Hiller \n(whose wife deserves our thanks as she had a baby just weeks before the \nHouse considered the bill), Jason Herring, Shelley Husband, Branden \nRitchie, and Perry Apelbaum.\n  I thank those at the White House who devoted countless hours \nincluding Josh Pollack, Jeff Ratner, Ryan Gillis, Michael Bosworth, and \nChris Fonzone. I also appreciate the work of so many other executive \nbranch officials at the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and \nNational Security Agency who work so hard to keep our country safe and \nanswered our questions at all hours of the day and night.\n  I also need to thank the many public interest groups, on all ends of \nthe political spectrum, who stuck with us despite many challenges. \nThere are too many to name, but without their energy and expertise, \nthis reform effort would never have come to fruition.

Madam President, today I am here for the 101st time \nto urge this body to wake up to the threat of climate change. It is \nreal, it is caused by carbon pollution, and it is dangerous.\n  There is a legislative answer to this problem that my Republican \ncolleagues should consider, and that is a carbon fee.\n  The unpleasant fact here in Congress presently, anyway, is that \nCongress is ruled by the lobbyists and the political enforcers for the \nfossil fuel industry. But outside this Chamber, where the fossil fuel \nindustry's power is less fierce, there is considerable conservative \nsupport for a carbon fee.\n  Leading right-of-center economists, conservative think tanks, and \nformer Republican officials, both legislative and executive, all say \nthat putting a price on carbon pollution is the right way to deal with \nclimate change. They know that climate denial cannot stand against the \nfacts. As the Washington Post reported last month, prominent thinkers \non the right are ``increasingly pushing'' for a climate policy based on \nconservative principles and on values such as property rights, market \nefficiency, and personal liberty. They recommend pricing carbon.\n  Jerry Taylor, a former vice president at the CATO Institute now leads \nhis own Libertarian think tank, which is making the case for a carbon \nfee. He recognized that ``the scientific evidence became stronger and \nstronger over time.'' He knows climate denial is not an option. He says \nthat ``because catastrophic climate change is a non-diversifiable risk, \nwe should logically be willing to pay extra to avoid climate risks.'' \nTaylor points out that hedging against terrible outcomes is what we \nexpect in our financial markets. Why should we not do the same for \nclimate change?\n  Conservatives have also long agreed that government should prevent \none group harming another. Conservative economist Milton Friedman still \ntops the reading lists of Republicans in Congress. Republican \nPresidential hopefuls still invoke his name to show their free market \nbona fides. Asked whether the government had any role to play in \nreducing pollution, Friedman said:\n\n       There's always a case for the government to do something \n     about it. Because there is always a case for the government \n     to some extent when what two people do affects a third party.\n\n  Friedman is describing what he called ``neighborhood effects'' or \nwhat many economists call ``negative externalities.'' A negative \nexternality is when two parties engage in a transaction and the result \nof that transaction causes damage to a third party--a third party that \ndid not consent to the arrangement. That is an externality, and when \nthe consequence is harmful, it is a negative externality. In a free \nsociety, wrote Friedman, government exists, in part, to diminish those \nnegative externalities.\n  When the costs of such negative externalities don't get factored into \nthe price of a product, even conservative economic doctrine classifies \nthat\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\nas a subsidy. For the polluters who traffic and burn fossil fuels, that \nsubsidy is huge.\n  In a finding it describes as ``shocking,'' the International Monetary \nFund estimated the true costs of fossil fuel energy, taking into \naccount public health problems, climate change, and other negative \nexternalities, and they added it up to a polluter world subsidy of $5.3 \ntrillion a year. The subsidy here in the United States for the fossil \nfuel industry will hit $699 billion this year.\n  It is no wonder the fossil fuel enforcers wield their clout in \nCongress so energetically. At $700 billion a year just in the United \nStates, why would the big polluters not want to squeeze one more fiscal \nquarter, one more year of public subsidy out of the rest of us at $700 \nbillion a year? We usually talk about big numbers here in the Senate \nover a 10-year period. That is the way our budget works. Over a 10-year \nbudget period, that is $7 trillion. No wonder they are so remorseless.\n  From their point of view, lunch is good when someone else is picking \nup the tab, and Senate Republicans have been far too willing to let the \npolluters dine for free. Outside of this Chamber, however, conservative \neconomists call such an enormous public subsidy a market failure. The \nprice of fossil fuel energy does not match its true costs. That market \nimbalance artificially favors polluting fuels and their producers--\npicking winners and losers, if you will.\n  A carbon fee can make the markets more efficient and level the \nplaying field for different types of energy. Anyone who really believes \nin a free market should favor a carbon fee. That is what makes it work.\n  Harvard Professor N. Gregory Mankiw has been an economic adviser to \nPresident George W. Bush and to Presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He \nhas pointed out that a carbon fee can help repair such a market failure \nand that ``the idea of using taxes to fix problems, rather than merely \nraise government revenue, has a long history.''\n  In a 2013 New York Times op-ed, former Republican EPA Administrators \nBill Ruckelshaus, Christine Todd Whitman, Lee Thomas, and William \nReilly wrote: ``A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be \nthe best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.''\n  A carbon fee can also generate significant revenue, and this could \nhelp achieve conservative priorities, such as lowering taxes. Art \nLaffer, one of the architects of President Reagan's economic plan, \npopularizer of the famous ``Laffer curve,'' has looked at using a \ncarbon tax to fund a payroll tax cut. He said: ``I think that would be \nvery good for the economy.''\n  Did you get that? Arthur Laffer, President Reagan's economic adviser, \nsaid that a carbon tax, funding a payroll tax cut, ``would be very good \nfor the economy.'' And as an adjunct, he continues: ``It would also \nreduce carbon emissions into the environment.''\n  It is a pretty simple idea. You can lessen the tax burden on things \nthat you do want--employment, jobs, profits--and make up for the lost \nrevenue by ending the subsidy of something you don't want--pollution.\n  What is not to love unless you are a big polluter? Dr. Irwin Stelzer, \nan editor at the Weekly Standard and director of economic policy \nstudies at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that for a tax-\nswapping carbon fee, ``conservative support would depend solely on a \ndesire to get the economy growing faster by shifting the tax burden \nfrom good stuff like work to bad stuff like pollutants.''\n  The fundamental conservative faith in the free market points to a \ncarbon fee. A carbon fee priced at the true social cost of carbon would \nallow the market--not the polluters, not the government--to sort out \nwhich energy mix is best for society. On this question, Republicans \nhave a choice to make: Are they real conservatives who will support a \nfree market solution or are they the playthings of the fossil fuel \nindustry, which will not pick up this question at all?\n  Well, if you do not like picking winners and losers, then quit \nfavoring fossil fuel to the tune of $700 billion a year just in America \nand level the playing field with a good, conservative, deficit neutral \ncarbon fee. Level the playing field.\n  That is how George Shultz sees it. George Shultz was President \nNixon's Treasury Secretary and President Reagan's Secretary of State. \nHe and Nobel laureate economist Gary S. Becker made the case for a \ncarbon fee in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Americans like to compete on a level playing field. All the \n     players should have an equal opportunity to win based on \n     their competitive merits, not on some artificial imbalance \n     that gives someone or some group a special advantage.\n\n  That is why Secretary Shultz supports a price on carbon.\n  As an addition, there is also a huge economic win that will result, \naccording to knowledgeable conservatives. Last year, George W. Bush's \nTreasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, said, ``A tax on carbon emissions \nwill unleash a wave of innovation to develop technologies, lower the \ncosts of clean energy and create jobs as we and other nations develop \nnew energy products and infrastructure.''\n  Former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis has become a leading \nconservative voice in the fight against climate change. He specifically \nsupports using a carbon fee and even introduced legislation when he was \nin Congress to price carbon and cut payroll taxes, the Laffer \ncombination. Last year, he told the Dallas Morning News that this would \ncreate economic opportunity.\n  He said:\n\n       [W]e are discovering in climate science . . . that there is \n     a risk that we can avoid from the creative innovation that \n     comes from free enterprise. We have a danger and an \n     opportunity. As a conservative, I say what a great \n     opportunity to create wealth, innovate, and sell innovation \n     around the world.\n\n  By the way, Representative Inglis's dedication to this issue recently \nearned him the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. I offer him my \nsincere congratulations. It does, indeed, take courage to come out from \nbehind the veil of skepticism and denial to face the plain truth and to \npropose real, concrete solutions. That is especially true when the \nfossil fuel industry wields such relentless, remorseless power over the \nRepublican Party today.\n  President Obama's Clean Power Plan is at last putting an end to the \nfree lunch for the fossil fuel industry. This ought to motivate the \nindustry to rethink its inequitable, subsidy-ridden business model. \nWhich is more efficient, anyway--government regulation or proper market \npricing?\n  As American Enterprise Institute scholars Kevin Hassett, Steven \nHayward, and Kenneth Greene put it, ``Because a carbon tax would cause \ncarbon emissions to be reduced efficiently across the entire market, \nother measures that are less efficient--and sometimes even perverse in \ntheir impacts--could be eliminated . . . As regulations impose \nsignificant costs and distort markets, the potential to displace a \nfairly broad swath of environmental regulations with a carbon tax \noffers benefits beyond [greenhouse gas] reductions''--i.e., economic \nbenefits.\n  Republicans in Congress have a real chance to help remake the U.S. \nenergy market under conservative, free market principles. As far back \nas 1992, former Chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, Martin Feldstein, wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Although a general carbon fuel tax is moot for the moment, \n     the idea will not go away. If carbon dioxide emissions are to \n     be reduced further in the U.S., such a tax will achieve the \n     goal with less economic waste than new bureaucratic hurdles.\n\n  Why don't today's Republicans abide by this conservative principle? \nAs Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO Director under the prior Republican \nCongress and economic adviser to our friend Senator McCain's \nPresidential bid, wrote in the National Review, ``In the bad old days, \nDemocrats bad-mouthed trading systems and price mechanisms; Republicans \nopposed rifle-shot subsidies and mandates. Weirdly, conservatives have \na need to relearn these lessons.''\n  Well, the carbon fee is right in line with Douglas Holtz-Eakin's \nlessons to be learned.\n  On June 10, I will introduce my carbon fee proposal at an event \nhosted by the American Enterprise Institute. I hope that once my \ncolleagues see the details, they will take seriously the promise of a \nfree market solution to climate change. For any Senator who wants to \nengage on this issue, I am interested. I will gladly work with any\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\nRepublican colleague. What we cannot do is stay in denial. For both our \nenvironment and our economy, and indeed our honor, we cannot afford to \nkeep sleepwalking. It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3447-S3448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise today to speak on H.R. 2048, the \nUSA FREEDOM Act. I want to put it in some context and discuss why I \nvoted the way I did today, but first, a little background.\n  It has been now more than a decade since Al Qaeda launched its deadly \nattacks on U.S. soil that we all remember so well, killing 2,977 people \nin New York City, in Washington, DC, and just outside of Shanksville, \nPA, injuring about 2,700 more, and taking away far too many parents, \nchildren, wives, husbands, families, and friends.\n  As we gather here today, we face other grave threats as well. One of \nthe most grave threats is the threat of the Islamic State of ISIS. \nSecretary of Defense Hagel described it this way. He said ISIS is \n``beyond anything that we've seen'' and constitutes an ``imminent \nthreat to every interest we have.''\n  We know this is a brutal group. They behead people. They crucify \npeople. They burn people alive. They systematically sell young girls \ninto slavery. They control large regions in the Middle East now. They \nhave their sights set on attacking the United States.\n  We know there are radicalized ISIS sympathizers and adherents here in \nthe United States. Many of them are eager to carry out this group's \ndestructive ambitions right here in our own country.\n  We know ISIS has the resources to carry out attacks on our homeland. \nAl Qaeda spent about half a million dollars. That is what it cost them \nto plan and execute the entire attack on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon. ISIS has amassed a $2 billion fortune--4,000 times as much \nmoney as Al Qaeda spent on September 11. ISIS collects something on the \norder of an additional $1 million to $2 million every day through the \nvariety of means it has because of the land it controls. So this is a \nvery serious threat.\n  Like any other threat, we have an obligation to protect the American \npeople from this to the extent we can. In the process, we have an \nobligation to strike an appropriate balance between the national \nsecurity we owe our constituents, the American people, and the robust \ncivil liberties we ought to protect because they are enshrined in our \nConstitution and important to our country. In my view, section 215--the \ncontroversial part of the USA PATRIOT Act--appropriately struck that \nbalance.\n  The best policy we could have pursued this week would have been to \nreauthorize section 215 in pretty much the form it has been in. If we \nhad done so, we would have been repeating what we had done many times \nbefore by overwhelming bipartisan majorities I think seven previous \ntimes. In 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2011, Congress reauthorized the \nUSA PATRIOT Act, including section 215. Congress did that because there \nis nothing radical about section 215 or the PATRIOT Act. This--what \nbecame a very controversial section recently--simply gave our national \nsecurity officials the same kind of ability to access documents, \nreports, and other tangible items when investigating a potential \ninternational terrorist attack that a grand jury has and has long had \nwhen investigating ordinary criminal events such as a car theft.\n  It is important to note what section 215 did not authorize. It did \nnot authorize the NSA to conduct wiretaps or listen in on any phone \nconversations. That has never happened. Despite that, there has been \nrampant misinformation about the telephone metadata program, as it is \nreferred to, that was conducted under section 215, so I want to discuss \nthat a little bit.\n  I think one of the most important things to stress here is that this \nmetadata program contained only information a third party had. It was \nnot private information that an individual possessed; it was third-\nparty information held by a telephone company. What is that information \nthe phone companies have always had? It is a phone number. It is a date \nand time of a call. It is the duration of a call. It is the number \nbeing called. That is it. That is the sum total of all of the \ninformation in this so-called metadata program. Because that is all the \ninformation, it was completely anonymous. Not only did it not include \nany context of any conversation--that was not possible. Conversations \nhave never been recorded, so the contents have never been captured. But \nit also did not contain any identifying information with the phone \nnumbers. There are no names, no addresses, no financial information. \nThere is no information that would in any way identify anybody with any \nparticular number.\n  So what did the government do with the metadata it had received? \nWell, it stored it all in a big database, on a big spreadsheet with all \nof those numbers. That is all it was, was a lot of numbers.\n  When the government discovered a phone number from a known terrorist, \nwhen a group of special ops American forces took down a terrorist group \nsomewhere and grabbed a cell phone, then the government could conduct a \nsearch of the metadata, but first a Federal judge would have to give \npermission.\n  After running the search to determine whether in that metadata there \nhad been phone calls between the known terrorists and numbers in that \ndatabase, even after doing the search, the government still had no \ninformation identifying the phone number because that is not in the \ndatabase. Of course, as I said before, certainly there was no content \nbecause content had never been recorded.\n  But a link might be established--and if it were to be established, if \nFederal investigators discovered that the known terrorist was in \nregular phone communications, for instance, with someone in the United \nStates, then that fact could be turned over to the FBI, and the FBI \ncould conduct an investigation, which might be a very useful \ninvestigation to have.\n  Well, we have had a number of officials who have told us how \nimportant this program has been, the intelligence value we have \nreceived. President Obama, himself, explained that had the section 215 \nmetadata program been in place prior to 9/11, the government might have \nbeen able to prevent the attack. Remember, we learned afterward about \nour inability to connect the dots. This was a program that was designed \nto enable us to connect those dots.\n  Even the critics of this program--which, as we know, there are many--\nhave never suggested this program was in any way abused, that any \nindividual person had their rights violated, that there was any breach. \nThat case has never been made, not that I have heard. Given the value \nof the program--as we have heard from multiple sources--and the \ncomplete absence of any record of any abuse of the program, in my view, \nCongress should have reauthorized this program, including section 215.\n  But, instead, we have passed an alternative, and that is the USA \nFREEDOM Act. I voted against this measure today because I am concerned \nthe USA FREEDOM Act does not provide us with the tools we need at a \ntime when the risks have been as great as ever. Let me just mention \nsome of these.\n  First, under the USA FREEDOM Act, it is entirely possible that the \ngovernment may not be able to continue any metadata program at all. I \nsay that because the bill explicitly forbids the government from \nmaintaining the database that we have been maintaining and instead the \nbill assumes that private phone companies will retain the data, and \nthen the government will be able to access that data as needed.\n  But there is a problem with this assumption. The problem is the bill \ndoesn't require the phone companies to preserve any of this data. Under \nthe USA FREEDOM Act, the phone companies could destroy the metadata \ninstantaneously after a phone call occurs.\n  They have a regulatory obligation to keep billing information, but a \nlot of bills are unlimited calls with a single monthly charge. They \nhave no statutory or regulatory requirement to retain the records of \nthese calls. As currently practiced, I am not aware of any phone \ncompanies that retain this data for the 5 years our intelligence \nofficials believe is the necessary timeframe to provide the security \nthey would like to provide.\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\n  There is another problem, it seems to me, with the USA FREEDOM Act; \nthat is, it is entirely possible the time period contemplated for \nestablishing the software that will enable the government to query the \nmany different private phone company databases--that timeframe will not \nbe long enough. We don't know whether it is going to be long enough. We \nwill just find out, I suppose, when the time comes. But this is a \ncomplex exercise that has to be carried out in real time, and the USA \nFREEDOM Act simply creates a deadline. It doesn't ensure that we will \nhave this in place.\n  A second concern I have is that the USA FREEDOM Act weakens other \nintelligence-gathering tools that are unrelated to any of the metadata \nprograms which have received most of the attention.\n  So the USA FREEDOM Act gives intelligence officials----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I conclude by saying that we are at \nleast at as great a risk as we have ever been, and the first priority \nof the Federal Government of the United States is to protect people of \nthe United States.\n  I am deeply concerned that the USA FREEDOM Act diminishes an \nimportant tool for providing for this security, and I hope that in the \ncoming months we can address this bill and try to correct the many \nflaws it has.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3448-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3448-S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I rise, for the first time speaking in \nthis Chamber, to discuss the future of our great Nation, how truly \nfortunate we are to live in the greatest country in the world.\n  We are protected by the best military that has ever existed and that, \nin turn, allows us to live freely here at home, to focus on our God-\ngiven rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, we cherish these rights. We have \nthe opportunity to make our dreams come true because we have these \nrights and because we have a commonsense value system to guide us.\n  When I was elected, I promised to bring South Dakota common sense to \nWashington and to work to solve problems for the good of every South \nDakotan and every American. But, unfortunately, when I travel back \nhome, I continue to hear from my fellow South Dakotans about the \nFederal Government infringing on these rights and values.\n  You see, our great Nation has been bogged down in recent years with \nwhat I believe is one of the greatest hindrances to job growth and \neconomic productivity; that is, the overregulation of our citizens. \nOverregulation is not a Democratic or a Republican issue, it is an \nissue that affects every single one of us. But I believe it is a \nchallenge we can solve through cooperation and perseverance. It doesn't \nmatter if you are talking about a doctor or a small business owner or a \nfarmer or a rancher, overregulation has affected every single sector of \nour society.\n  The regulatory burden on this country is nearly $2 trillion annually, \nand this is in addition to the tax burden already placed on our \nAmerican citizens. That regulatory burden is larger than Canada's \nentire economy. In fact, the cost to comply with Federal regulations is \nlarger than the entire GDP of all but only eight other countries in the \nentire world.\n  Even more staggering, just a few years ago, we surpassed 1 million \nFederal regulations in America--1 million Federal regulations. \nRegulations are stifling economic growth and innovation and hurting the \nfuture of this country by crushing the can-do American spirit that \nfounded our Nation, settled the West, won two World Wars, and put a man \non the Moon--and every year more than 3,500 new Federal regulations are \nadded.\n  This just does not make sense, and it certainly is not South Dakota \ncommon sense. What alarms me is not only the volume of regulations \nbeing thrust upon our citizens but also the process for creating them. \nThe purpose of Congress is to be the voice of the people when making \nlaws. Unfortunately, the voice of the people in the rulemaking process \nhas been cut out and replaced by unelected government bureaucrats who \nthink they know better than the farmer or the scientist or the \nentrepreneur.\n  Our Founders recognized the need for making laws, granting the power \nto create laws to Congress and only Congress. They meant that process \nto be difficult so our government would not overburden citizens and \nrestrict their freedom, freedom that those Founding Fathers had just \nfought so hard to obtain. Through Congress, every citizen should have a \nvoice, but unfortunately that is not what is happening today.\n  Our Founding Fathers created three branches of government with checks \nand balances for each one. They could never have imagined that we would \nhave a regulatory process in place today where unelected bureaucrats \nwould both write and have the final approval of the rules and \nregulations under which our people must live.\n  This regulatory regime, which is responsible for the 3,500 new rules \neach year, has essentially become a fourth branch of government and a \nde facto legislative body. The problem is exacerbated because these \nbureaucrats in Washington have this misperception that they know how to \nrun our lives better than we do.\n  While working as a business owner, a State legislator, as a Governor, \nand now as a Senator, I have seen just how detrimental this \n``Washington knows best'' mentality is on the daily lives of South \nDakotans and Americans.\n  Many of my friends on both sides of the aisle have come to the Senate \nfloor in recent weeks and months with some great ideas and legislation \nto limit or stop or repeal or remove some of the worst regulations \ncurrently on the books. I applaud them for these efforts, many of which \nI also support.\n  I look forward to working with the senior Senator from South Dakota, \nmy friend John Thune, as well as anyone who is willing to work with me \nto remove these burdens that are stunting American greatness and, well, \nbring a little South Dakota common sense back to our regulatory \nenvironment.\n  The regulatory system in America has run amok. Too often, burdensome, \ncostly regulations are crafted by bureaucrats at the highest level of \ngovernment, behind closed doors, with little input from everyday \nAmericans who disproportionately feel the effects of these one-size-\nfits-all policies.\n  It is regulation without representation--and it is wrong. The \nAmerican people are being squeezed out, their voices falling on deaf \nears in Washington. Small businesses, which drive our economy and \ncreate the majority of jobs in America, are especially hurt by \noverregulation because they, too, have to hire lawyers and employees to \ncomply with these rules. This takes away capital that could be used to \nhire new production employees and expand their businesses.\n  People in my home State of South Dakota feel victimized by their own \nFederal Government. It is keeping crops from getting to market, and it \nis keeping businesses from growing. The idea that unelected and \nunaccountable bureaucrats should be allowed to make sweeping rules and \nregulations with no recourse should be a concern to every American, \nregardless of political affiliation, because it impacts everyone. No \nparty has a lock on the American dream, and American innovation doesn't \nhave a party affiliation.\n  From the stack of paperwork required to process a bank loan to the \nregulatory price of putting food on the table, the cost of Federal \nregulations are ultimately passed down to each and every American. \nWithout excessive regulation, imagine how much more money American \nfamilies could have in their pockets to spend on what they want, \ninstead of what the government wants. If we cut our redtape, families \ncan stop having to cut their budgets.\n  The regulatory regime is a dark cloud over our entire economy. I am \nnot saying there isn't a place for rules in our society; there is. \nRules are meant to keep us safe and to promote the greater good, and I \ndo believe there\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nare some good rules and regulations which are on the books today. The \nproblem I have is with the bad rules that keep good people from going \nabout their daily lives.\n  Unfortunately, there are too many of these bad rules that are \nhindering our freedoms and stifling our growth. These are the \nregulations which we should have a process in place to reexamine.\n  Today, I come to the floor to discuss bipartisan legislation, which \nwe have already introduced, to permanently end regulation without \nrepresentation. It takes a giant leap forward in restoring the people's \nrole in the rulemaking process. After all, if the American people don't \nlike the laws we make, they can vote us out, but they have no such \npower with unelected bureaucrats. They are stuck.\n  You see, the bipartisan legislation we have submitted, S. Con. Res. \n17, would create a Joint Select Committee on Regulatory Reform, whose \npurpose includes reviewing regulations currently on the books and \nproposing a new rules review process that includes the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. It is rooted in South Dakota \ncommon sense and the principles that have made this country great, \nmaking government work for Americans, rather than against them.\n  Madam President, this committee would make several recommendations to \nCongress to rebalance this broken regulatory scheme.\n  First, the committee would be tasked with exploring options for \nCongress to review regulations written by agencies before they are \nenacted, providing much needed oversight through the possibility of a \npermanent joint rules review committee, which would be tasked with \nreviewing rules with a cost of $50 million or more. This permanent \njoint rules review committee would have the ability to delay the \nimposition of these rules for not more than a year from the time the \nagency submits the rule for a review to enable Congress to act on the \nrule if they do not care for the rule.\n  Second, the committee would examine an option for agencies to submit \neach regulation with a $50 million or more impact to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress for review before the rule is enacted.\n  Finally, the joint select committee could recommend ways to reduce \nthe financial burden regulations place on the economy as well as \nsunsetting onerous and outdated ones.\n  This joint select committee would not be a permanent one, but it \nwould be bipartisan, bicameral, and hold meaningful hearings so that a \npermanent solution to our overregulation problem can be properly \naddressed.\n  This legislation also offers a starting point for the committee by \nrequiring certain possible solutions to our regulatory problem to be \nconsidered. I firmly believe that regulations should be reviewed by \nelected officials, those who are accountable to the American people \nthrough the democratic process.\n  This is not a new concept. It is not rocket science. It is a common \npractice at the State level. In fact, 41 of the 50 States, including my \nhome State of South Dakota, have a rules review process to make sure \nthe executive branch is faithfully executing the laws they seek to \nimplement.\n  It is worth repeating that regulations are estimated to cost $1.88 \ntrillion annually in the United States, and that is above and beyond \nthe tax burden our citizens already share. That amounts to just under \n$5 billion every single day, and it just doesn't make sense. It is \nunfair to those who still believe in and are working to achieve the \nAmerican dream. Whether Americans are seeking to buy a car, take out a \nmortgage on a house, start a business, or see the doctor, regulations \nobstruct them.\n  When I think of those who sacrificed everything so that our children \nand grandchildren could create their own version of the American dream, \nI think about the freedoms and liberties they fought so bravely to \ndefend. They fought so that we could pursue life, liberty, and \nhappiness and trust that our government would not hinder these lifelong \nendeavors. It is not Washington that will continue to make this country \ngreat; rather, it is the collective spirit of individual Americans who \nwant to work hard to be successful for their families and their \ncommunities. But they need the heavy hand of government to be lifted.\n  Here in Washington, it is not our job to dictate how Americans run \ntheir lives but to allow them to achieve their dreams, not make them \ninto nightmares.\n  The phrase ``Washington is broken'' is far too common. It seems as \nthough whenever we go home, there is someone who suggests that \nWashington is broken. We hear it regularly. People use it to describe \nthe current state of our Federal Government. ``Washington'' is now used \nin a derogatory manner.\n  This city, the Capital of our Nation, named after our very first \nCommander in Chief, the man who led us to victory in the Revolutionary \nWar and birthed this great Nation, has become, over time, the same as a \nfour-letter word. Remember, George Washington left the Presidency \nvoluntarily after two terms in office. He wanted to get away from the \nmonarch style of government in which rulers held their positions for \nlife. And now this city that bears his name is full of lifelong \nbureaucrats--and even worse, they are unaccountable to the people. It \nis a far cry from the Republic our Founders envisioned.\n  Madam President, in the year 2026 our country will celebrate its \n250th birthday. That is just over a decade away. When we get to that \npoint, I hope to join my fellow Americans in looking back with great \npride in all we have accomplished and all we have to pass on to future \ngenerations.\n  President Kennedy challenged our Nation to put a man on the Moon \nbefore the decade of the 1960s had passed--less than 10 years. I am not \nasking us to do anything as tough as putting a man back on the Moon, \nbut I think we should commit ourselves to removing the barrier of \ngovernment regulations that is weighing on the American spirit and \nagain set free the American economy before the decade preceding our \n250th birthday.\n  I have not submitted legislation to start a new committee that exists \nin name and does no deed. Americans want us and expect us to be up to \nthis challenge, and I believe we are. We can lift the heavy hand of \ngovernment. The Founding Fathers did not anticipate thousands of \nregulators and a million regulations when they created this country. It \nis time to end this regulation without representation and restore the \nlawmaking process to the people.\n  I thank my friends on both sides of the aisle who have cosponsored \nRESTORE and encourage the rest of my colleagues to sign on to this \ncommonsense approach to addressing the issue of overregulation so we \ncan work to make this country even greater and safer than we found it. \nThen, during our 250th birthday celebration, we can be proud that we \nrestored a little South Dakota and American common sense for our \nchildren and their children.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3449-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3449-S3450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING SENATOR ROUNDS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me say to our colleague from \nSouth Dakota how much all of us enjoyed his first major speech and also \ncongratulate him on focusing on what I think is the single biggest \nproblem confronting our country, creating the slow growth rate we have \nhad throughout the Obama Presidency.\n  The Senator from South Dakota has focused on the biggest drag on our \neconomy, the single biggest thing holding this country back from \nreaching its potential, and I would say to my friend from South Dakota \nthat he has picked the perfect subject and has laid out a good solution \nto it. I hope lots of colleagues on both sides of the aisle will rally \naround this excellent proposal as a good way forward in dealing with \nthe single biggest domestic problem we have regarding the future growth \nof our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I, too, wish to congratulate my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, Senator Rounds, because he has already been a great \nleader on this subject. As a successful two-term Governor, a leader in \nour State legislature, he was a practical, commonsense, down-to-earth \nGovernor who just liked to get things done.\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\n  I think coming here to Washington, DC, and finding the massive \nbureaucracy--in some cases, dysfunction--that surrounds this city, \nthere can be a lot of disillusionment at times for people across the \ncountry. I think the new Senator from South Dakota is going to be a \ngreat voice, a clear voice on solutions for how to break through that. \nHe will be a great partner and someone I look forward to continuing to \nwork with. We worked together a lot during his time as Governor and \nwhile in the State legislature, but I am delighted he is here in the \nSenate, where he can take his skills and experience and the passion he \nhas to bring about positive change for our country and put it to work \non behalf of the people of South Dakota and the people of our country.\n  I look forward to working with him on the very issue he talked about \ntoday because there is probably nothing right now that has a greater \neconomic impact and creates more economic harm for the people we \nrepresent in South Dakota than regulatory overreach. This is evidenced \non an almost daily basis as new regulations emanate from various \nagencies around this town that make it more difficult and more \nexpensive for people to create jobs, more difficult for farmers and \nranchers and small business people to do the things they do best, and \njust create a higher burden, a higher level of harm for people across \nthe State because everything that comes out of Washington, DC, that \ndrives up the cost of doing business in this country gets passed on to \nconsumers in our State and all across the country.\n  I congratulate the Senator from South Dakota on his remarks and am \ngrateful for his great service to our State in so many ways already and \nnow adding to that here as a Member of the Senate, where we have big \nproblems, big challenges, but he meets that with not only big \nenthusiasm but big experience when it comes to knocking down these \nbarriers and making it more possible for people in this country to live \nmore prosperous lives, safer lives, and hopefully more fulfilled lives \nwhen they can get government out of the way and allow their greatest \naspirations to surface.\n  So I hope we have the opportunity to deal with a lot of those issues \nand do it in a way that creates greater prosperity for people across \nSouth Dakota and across this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me observe that after hearing all \nthe Senator from South Dakota said and what his goals are, he sure \nchose the right committee, the committee I chair, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. That is what we talk about. That is what we do.\n  I had the honor of being in South Dakota before the election, and as \nI walked around in South Dakota and looked around, I thought, I could \njust as well be in Oklahoma. While I was there, I talked to the farm \nbureau people there, and they said it is the regulations. That is a \nfarm State. Oklahoma is a farm State, and we understand that.\n  Of all the regulations they have and the problems they have, they say \nthe EPA overregulates and causes the greatest problems. They singled \none out--endangered species. They singled another one out--the waters \nof the United States. Currently, we are doing legislation on the waters \nof the United States, and it is legislation that is going to get that \nburden off of the people from South Dakota and Oklahoma. Right now, we \nare considering the most expensive of all the regulations, which is the \nozone regulations. It would constitute the greatest single increase in \nexpenditures or taxes of anything in the history of this country.\n  So it is nice to know we have someone who is so committed to the \ngoals of this committee to be singling this out in a maiden speech as \nhis greatest concern. I appreciate that as the chairman of that \ncommittee, and we are going to do wonderful things together for South \nDakota, Oklahoma, and America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this afternoon I wish to call attention to \nthe severe drought and wildfires that are already burning in my home \nState of Oregon and across the West.\n  Earlier today, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I \nserve, held a hearing on drought. There is no question that communities \nin many of our Western States are experiencing very uncertain times. \nOur farmers are concerned about water for their crops. Outdoorsmen and \nbusiness owners fear low reservoir and river levels are going to ruin \nthe summer season. Conservationists worry about a lack of cold water \nfor fish habitats.\n  Drought and fire are a dangerous combination and create a trend \ncontinuing this year. Fire seasons have gotten drier. The fires have \ngotten hotter, and they have become far more expensive to fight. And \nsevere drought is now compounding the crisis. We ought to make no \nmistake about what is going on in the West. The West is now bone dry, \nand the tragic fact is that this is the new normal for Oregon farmers \nand ranchers. Water is an increasingly scarce and precious resource.\n  Right now, every last square mile of Oregon is experiencing \nabnormally dry conditions, and almost 70 percent of my State is under \nsevere drought. Fifteen of Oregon's 36 counties have declared drought \nemergencies or have been declared a drought emergency by the Governor. \nThe unusually warm winter in my home State meant record low snowpack, \nwhich devastates summertime runoff, which is so important to Oregon's \nwater supply.\n  Drought raises enormous issues for communities and State and Federal \nagencies. They have to find ways to cope while using less water. \nAuthorities feel they are in a position, or are forced into a position, \nto have to make seemingly impossible choices about where to dedicate \nincreasingly scarce resources. All of these rural communities have to \nface challenges that are heightened by drought--particularly the threat \nof wildfires.\n  Drought conditions mean that western forests and grasslands are \nespecially likely to go up in flames. It means that more acres will \nburn, more people and more structures will be at risk, and more funds \nare going to be needed to put the fires out.\n  Fire season this year has started earlier than normal. In fact, I \nreceived a fire briefing at home this March. That is the earliest I \nhave had a fire briefing in all of my time in Congress. It certainly \nbodes badly for the extra costs that we are likely to see. I recently \ngot a letter from the Forest Service with the estimate of anticipated \nwildfire suppression costs for fiscal year 2015. The middle-of-the-road \nestimate for how much it will cost to fight wildfires is nearly $1.25 \nbillion. On the high end, it could cost more than $1.6 billion. But the \nfunding, however, that has been dedicated to fighting fires does not \ncome close--not close--to covering those costs. The appropriated amount \nis $200 million less than even the most conservative median forecast. \nWishful thinking in the budget is not going to be very useful in \nputting the fires out. Fighting fires costs money, and it can't be \npunted into the future like some minor budget line item. Once again, \nthen, we are looking at the prospect of the Forest Service having to \nraid other accounts in order to put out the blazes.\n  According to the Forest Service, in 2013, $40 million was essentially \nstolen from the National Forest Fund, which would pay for the \nstewardship and management of the 193 million acres of national forests \nand grasslands. And $30 million was stolen from the account that funds \nthe disposal of brush and other debris from timber operations. This \nbrush and debris is essentially fuel for future fires.\n\n  Those figures represent the stark reality that the broken funding \nsystem in place is shortchanging the resources needed for sensibly \nfighting wildfires.\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\nThe cycle of stealing money from prevention accounts to pay for \nsuppression of forest fires just repeats itself again and again without \nend, and it will continue until this funding problem is finally fixed.\n  Senator Crapo, our colleague from Idaho, and I have been working on a \nbipartisan basis to fix this flawed policy for quite some time now. He \nand I introduced the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to end this damaging \ncycle, which I have described and which in the West we call fire \nborrowing. Our bill would raise the Federal disaster cap to allow the \nagencies to treat wildfire-fighting efforts like other natural \ndisasters because wildfires are natural disasters, destructive and \ncostly, no different than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.\n  When our governmental agencies are forced to borrow from other \naccounts to fight fires that have bankrupted these accounts for fire \nsuppression, they rob from the funds that are needed to reduce \nhazardous fuels in the forests, which leads to even more choked and \noverstocked forests ripe for future fires.\n  In effect, what happens is the prevention funds--the funds for \nthinning, cleaning out all of that debris--get shorted. So then you \nmight have a lightning strike or something in our part of the world and \nyou have an inferno on your hands. The government, in effect, borrows \nfrom the prevention fund to put the fire out, and the problem just gets \nworse and worse. It is that problem that Senator Crapo and I are trying \nto fix.\n  On a bipartisan basis, we seek to give the agencies the tools they \nneed to support the courageous firefighters on the ground, men and \nwomen who put their lives at risk to ensure that Americans, their homes \nand communities are protected from destructive wildfires.\n  I know there are other Members of the Senate who are very interested \nin solving the fire-borrowing problem. I encourage all those Members to \nwork with me, Senator Crapo, and our staff to find a solution that is \nacceptable to Congress and can be passed soon.\n  This is an urgent matter. This is not something you can sort of let \ngo and offer the amendment to the amendment to the amendment, the kind \nof thing that happens here, and it just gets shunted off for years on \nend. This is urgent business because the West has to be in a position \nto clear these hazardous fuels and get out in front of these \nincreasingly dangerous and ominous fires. We have to end--we have to \nend this cycle of catastrophic wildfires in the West. It is long past \ntime for action. I urge colleagues to join Senator Crapo and I to work \nwith us and our staff so this body moves, and moves quickly, to fix \nthis problem.\n  There is an awful lot of uncertainty when it comes to calculating the \nFederal budget. But what we know for sure--for sure--is that this \nproblem of wildfires in the West is getting increasingly serious. The \nfires are bigger, the fires are hotter, and they last longer. It is \ntime to budget for reducing this problem in a sensible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize George Schenk, founder \nof one of Vermont's most beloved restaurants, American Flatbread. \nThirty years ago, American Flatbread was built from the ground up, \ndriven by George's own enthusiasm, innovation, and drive. He baked his \nfirst pizza--flatbread as he prefers to call it--in a wood-fired stone \noven of his own design. Today, American Flatbread still bakes its \ncreations in the same stone ovens.\n  George started with a vision where his food was not just great \ntasting and nutritional, but also nurturing and healing the soul. He \naccomplished that and so much more. Anyone who has sat down at American \nFlatbread after a long day hiking, skiing or even just to visit \nunderstands the satisfaction of eating at George's restaurant. He and \nhis staff maintain a commitment to the core values of the integrity of \na meal, using organic and locally sourced ingredients, including those \ngrown in a greenhouse next door. George cultivates these ingredients to \ndeliver on his promise of ``good, flavorful, nutritious food that gives \nboth joy and health.''\n  American Flatbread also reflects the best of Vermont's community \ntraditions--caring for one another. Food is often given to help local \nhospitals and families in need, and those same citizens give back when \nthey can. Like many Vermont towns, Waitsfield was devastated by \nTropical Storm Irene, and among the damaged businesses was American \nFlatbread. Despite the damage, they were able to reopen in just a few \nshort days thanks to the work of hundreds of local volunteers in both \ntheir time and in donations.\n  Since the fire was lit in that first stone oven, George has stayed \ntrue to his vision of a sustainable and community-oriented business, \none that has flourished while calling Vermont its home. In honor of \nAmerican Flatbread turning 30, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record Sally Pollak's story from the May 28, 2015, edition of \nthe Burlington Free Press.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 28, 2015]\n\n          American Flatbread Turns 30, Throws Community Party\n\n       Waitsfield.--Thirty years ago in his side yard in Warren, \n     George Schenk made a pizza in his wood-fired field stone \n     oven.\n       The toppings were simple: olive oil, garlic, Parmesan and \n     herbs from his garden.\n       ``I didn't know if it was going to stick to the rock,'' \n     Schenk said. ``I didn't know if it was going to bake. The \n     oven had no door.''\n       Two couples who were hanging out drinking wine shared that \n     pizza, or flatbread in Schenk vernacular.\n       Their response was like a wave at a football stadium on a \n     smaller scale, Schenk said. Smiles moved from face to face.\n       ``We just thought it was great,'' said Lyndon Virkler, dean \n     of education at New England Culinary Institute, who was one \n     of the original flatbread eaters. ``Because of the nice hot \n     rock it had a nice, crisp crust. And real simple, pure \n     flavors.''\n       What was meant to be a side dish became the ``highlight of \n     the evening,'' Virkler said. He had met Schenk--a ski bum--\n     five years earlier in the kitchen at Sam Rupert's, a Warren \n     restaurant. Virkler was chef and Schenk was a salad maker \n     with creativity and drive, Virkler said.\n       ``We've often reflected on our place in history,'' Virkler \n     said. ``My wife and I being able to sample the first \n     flatbread.''\n       Schenk knew that night 30 years ago he had made something \n     he and other people enjoyed eating. Beyond that, he found \n     something that was gratifying to make: from building the oven \n     to splitting wood and making a fire to kneading the dough.\n       ``I was looking for a professional cooking opportunity that \n     felt right,'' Schenk said. ``Not necessarily being on a line \n     behind closed doors.''\n       Schenk's pizza--American Flatbread--has been around ever \n     since: never behind closed doors and often outside. It \n     started once a week at Tucker Hill Inn before Schenck opened \n     American Flatbread at Lareau Farm in Waitsfield in 1992. That \n     restaurant spawned a dozen American Flatbreads in New \n     England, one in Hawaii and one in British Columbia.\n       American Flatbread will be available to all next Saturday, \n     when Schenk celebrates 30 years of flatbread with free pizza \n     and salad at his Waitsfield restaurant. Bigger than the \n     birthday party, the event is to recognize community members \n     who give to their communities in a variety of ways, he said.\n       ``It's the whole range of human experience,'' Schenk said, \n     listing the spheres of people and organizations he intends to \n     honor: religious, local government, volunteer fire and \n     ambulance personnel, people who serve seniors and the ill and \n     injured, those who are involved in the arts and work to \n     protect the environment.\n       ``Here in this small valley there are 54 registered \n     nonprofits,'' Schenk said.\n       Schenk spoke of the help his business received after two \n     floods--in 1998 and 2011--damaged the restaurant and grounds \n     at Lareau Farm, site of American Flatbread.\n       ``Over 400 peopled helped us dig out,'' Schenk said. \n     ``People donated tractors, cleaned firewood, mucked out the \n     basement and moved debris. In the absence of that help, this \n     little business would have failed.''\n       Money also was donated, including a $25,000 interest-free \n     loan.\n       ``People get really squirrely about money,'' Schenk said. \n     But this loan was without that kind of attitude. The check \n     came with a post-it note that read: ``Thinking of you.'' When \n     Schenk repaid his last loan installment of $1,000, the check \n     was returned uncashed, he said.\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\n       ``In various iterations that story repeated itself over and \n     over,'' Schenk said. ``With acts of profound kindness, at a \n     time of need and loss.''\n       The celebration next Saturday is to do something ``nice,'' \n     Schenk said--choosing with care a word an English teacher \n     advised him long ago to stay away from.\n\n\n                       Words with a side of pizza\n\n       Words matter to Schenk. Over the years they have achieved a \n     place of importance in his business.\n       The restaurant in Waitsfield has gardens that grow food for \n     flatbreads and salad, a campfire on the stone patio, and \n     banners printed with Schenk's writings on food, family, \n     community, philosophy, and social issues.\n       His compositions, which he calls ``dedications,'' appear in \n     the menus at American Flatbread. Schenck has written more \n     than 1,400 over the past 28 years.\n       ``I have often felt as though if I didn't write, the \n     flatbread wasn't complete, it wasn't as good,'' Schenk said. \n     ``Maybe in truth, I was not as good or complete. It provided \n     an internal discipline that I needed.''\n       In his semi-retirement, Schenk, 62, is reading through the \n     archive of his dedications with plans to publish them in a \n     book.\n       Reading through his dedications, the ones that emerge as \n     most meaningful to him are about his family and the time he \n     spent raising his two children, now grown, Schenk said.\n       ``I'm acutely aware that those days and events are past and \n     will never come again,'' Schenk said. ``The dedications \n     captured something about their childhoods and my experiences \n     that I wouldn't otherwise have.''\n       A dedication called ``The Family Bed'' is on the porch at \n     American Flatbread.\n       It reads in part:\n       ``We are together. Laughing and talking, getting ready for \n     bed. 'Read to me first,' cries Willis who is three. I look at \n     Hanna, half grown at eight years, she looks back at me with \n     patience. `Pick out your books and jump into bed, I'll be \n     with you in just a minute.' (I go downstairs and fill the old \n     stove with big chunks of wood. It is cold for April.) I hop \n     back up, two stairs at a time, and join them in the big \n     bed.''\n       Nearby is a dedication titled ``Children and the Kitchen.'' \n     Schenk wrote:\n       ``Children have a natural curiosity about the goings on in \n     a kitchen. It is important to nurture this curiosity so that \n     they have as their own the skills and care of good cooking. \n     Almost all food work, from the garden to washing dishes, \n     including knife-work, is child-friendly.''\n\n\n                          Dreaming in the dirt\n\n       The garden is where Schenk prefers to spend time these \n     days. He has a plot in the staff garden at Flatbread, and he \n     works in a greenhouse at Lareau Farm.\n       Schenk loves the physical activity of gardening, and being \n     outside in sunlight and fresh air. He has a particular \n     interest in the nutrient content of the soil, and values the \n     way garden work helps produce food that is ``nutrient dense'' \n     and rich in flavor, Schenk said.\n       ``There's a kind of psychological peace and health that \n     comes with the work,'' he said. ``Our palates really can \n     guide us to health affirming food.''\n       He has built in his garden a structure he calls a ``soil \n     invertebrate condominium.''\n       Soil invertebrates, insects and worms, stimulate soil \n     bacteria, which improve the biology and chemistry of the \n     soil. The creatures also aerate the soil, and help with pest \n     control, Schenk said. They allow Schenk to play in the dirt, \n     and peek into that ``magic place'' where they live.\n       ``I've come to take an enormous amount of happiness from \n     this work, and peace,'' Schenk said last week in his garden. \n     ``As I become older, that peace and well being has become \n     something that I value greatly. My goal wasn't to go out and \n     create a pizza empire. It was to have a healthy and happy \n     life.''\n       He sold his restaurant development group a few years ago, \n     and now works as a Flatbread consultant. Thursday, he trucked \n     buckets of clay gathered at Lareau Farm and sapling alders \n     from a swamp in Roxbury to Rockport, Maine, to build an oven \n     for a new American Flatbread restaurant.\n       ``It was about letting go of my ego,'' Schenk said of his \n     selling the development group. ``When we idealize the \n     American corporate dream and growth, that's what we see and \n     hold up as a model of success.\n       ``I got caught up in someone else's dream. As I grew, I \n     came to realize that it wasn't my dream.''\n       Schenk dreams in the dirt these days, a place he hopes is \n     teeming with activity.\n       ``Systems that are more complex tend to be more stable,'' \n     he said. ``It's stability that we're looking for in our \n     lives.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3452-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LAURA PECHAITIS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career of Laura \nPechaitis, a dedicated public servant who has made a profound \ndifference in the lives of thousands of Ohioans. For 13 years, I have \nbeen honored to have Laura on my staff, where she has helped veterans \ndealing with problems large and small. Laura retires on May 8, 2015, \nafter more than 30 years of service to her community.\n  From the moment Laura contacted my then-congressional office about a \njob, I should have recognized that I was encountering a woman of \nuncharacteristic zeal and dedication. Laura wrote to me after she--\nalong with her husband, Theodore, and two sons, Marc and Scott--had \nmoved back home to Ohio from New York. She had worked for 18 years in \nthe New York Assembly for State Representative Michael Bragman as his \ndirector of constituent services. During her time in the New York \nAssembly she helped develop a program used by all assembly offices to \ntrack and manage casework. Hiring her should have been an obvious \ndecision, but it was only after she had written to me three times that \nI finally recognized the dedication and passion of the person I was \ndealing with. Hiring Laura has made a difference in the lives of \nthousands of Ohioans.\n  On my staff, Laura primarily focused her efforts on assisting Ohio's \nveterans. Our veterans and servicemembers dedicate their lives to our \nNation, and Laura worked to make sure that they received the respect, \ngratitude, and assistance befitting their service. Inspired by her \nfather--a World War II naval veteran--Laura has been committed all of \nher adult life to serving those who served us. As a student at Miami \nUniversity, she helped form an auxiliary for the Navy ROTC program, \nserving as its commander.\n  She helped all generations of veterans. She helped men who stormed \nthe beach on D-day secure long-overdue medals they had earned, and she \nhelped recent Iraq war veterans access VA benefits to attend college \nand transition to civilian life. Her ability to resolve seemingly \nintractable cases was legendary. For veterans who had been waiting \nmonths, she was able to expedite their cases and get them the attention \nthey deserved, many within 24 hours. One constituent had been told by \nthe VA that his claim would take 20 days to process. Frustrated and \ndistraught, he called Laura while driving to the VA clinic. By the time \nhe pulled into the VA clinic, Laura had resolved the issue. Another \nveteran in Columbus had lived in her house for 27 months, but she was \ntoo afraid to unpack out of fear of being evicted. Laura helped ensure \nthat this veteran had the VA benefits that would enable her to stay in \nher home.\n  Going above and beyond the call of duty was the norm for Laura. One \nveteran even had a term for her dedication, dubbing such exemplary \nservice the ``typical Pechaitis fashion.'' Another constituent from \nWarren was having his TRICARE bills denied by the VA. Not only did \nLaura have the issue resolved within 24 hours, but she worked to help \nhim reenroll in college and went so far as to put him in touch with a \nmentor at a local university to make sure he went back to school.\n  Her drive for public service, however, went beyond veterans. In fact, \nlong before he became the star of the Cleveland Cavaliers, a young \nLeBron James used to come into my Akron office to spend time with a \nfriend whose mother worked for me. During one those visits, Laura \nhelped LeBron James register for the draft--the Selective Service draft \nthat is, not the NBA draft.\n  Since 2006, Laura helped coordinate more than 10,000 cases for \nveterans and Active-Duty members of the armed services. She brought the \nsame energy and empathy to each one. Laura has been a champion of \nveterans in Ohio, and the breadth of her impact is remarkable. She has \nbeen a model public servant, and I am proud to have worked with her.\n  Our actions in Congress are closely watched, but what too often goes \nunnoticed is the work of dedicated staff members whose only goal is to \nserve those we are elected to represent. I ask that my colleagues join \nme in thanking Laura Pechaitis for her service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3452-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3452-S3453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Ammaline Helen \n``Amy'' Howard, a beloved member of the Charleston, WV community.\n  The Howard family is a great, well-respected family in my beautiful \nState and I am honored to call the members of this family my dear \nfriends. I had the privilege of meeting Amy, who was affectionately \nknown by so many as Aunt Amy, many times. She was always humble, \nwelcoming, and supportive. She was a pillar in the Howard family, \nstanding strong on values with a captivating yet calming spirit. Her \nnieces and nephews knew if their parents told them ``no'' to something, \nthat they could go to Aunt Amy and she would find a way to help them \nout.\n  Put simply, individuals like Amy stand out. She was the epitome of \nwhat West Virginians are all about, with her welcoming nature and \nunwavering commitment to help those in need. Amy led by example and \ntreated her neighbors as friends and her friends as family. She \ninstilled this same loyal community service mindset throughout her \nfamily. She leaves behind her loving brother Victor, sister-in-law \nElaine, and many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews.\n  She was a second mother to many, and truly brought the whole family \ntogether. She made sure a hot meal was ready every evening, and if she \nsaw you, she made sure you were invited to dinner that night.\n  A native of Charleston, Amy graduated from Charleston High School in \n1933 and gave back to her hometown in many ways. She began working at \nthe Naval Ordinance and Armor Plant in South Charleston before joining \nher brother in his successful grocery business, Sabe Howard's Market. \nShe then worked for many years as a loyal employee of the Kanawha \nCounty Clerk's Office before her retirement in 1974.\n  Among her many roles, she was a member of the Charleston Hightop Club \nand the West Virginia Woman's American Syrian League. Amy also \nsupported the West Virginia Symphony League and the St. Jude Hospital \nbecause she was passionate about investing her time and efforts to \nhelping others in any way that she could.\n  She was a lifelong member of St. George Orthodox Cathedral, and was \nalso a member of the Order of St. Ignatius of Antioch and the St. \nGeorge Ladies Guild, serving as an officer. Amy was fiercely committed \nto her church family, always willing to lend a helping hand or prepare \nfood for church functions. Every year at the annual dinner she would \nhelp prepare food and make sure there were plenty of her legendary \ncabbage rolls.\n  Aunt Amy was a model for the ages. She understood what really \nmattered in life and I enjoyed chatting with her about the jewels in \nthe treasure box of life--family, faith, community, and service. She \nbelieved that staying active was the key to living a long, happy life. \nAmy loved to walk and visit the mall to get her favorite coffee and \nbiscuits, and remained active until her late 90s.\n  I recall one time being invited to Aunt Amy's basement kitchen where \nthe heavy cooking really took place. It was filled with freezers, \nrefrigerators, microwaves, and every cooking utensil you can think of. \nNot many people were invited down to her kitchen, so I knew I was \nreally taken in as part of the family. She truly had that effect on \npeople--it was a second home, and you were considered family. And \nfamily comes first.\n  Amy was a beloved aunt, friend, and inspiration to the Charleston \ncommunity. Her glowing smile and positive attitude were contagious and \nwill live on in the memories and hearts of all those who had the \nprivilege of knowing her. Amy's service was greatly appreciated and \nwill certainly never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3453-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3453-S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING STANFORD OVSHINSKY\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Mr. Stanford \nOvshinsky, on the occasion of his induction into the National Inventors \nHall of Fame. Mr. Ovshinsky, the eldest son of working-class Jewish \nparents in Akron, OH, displayed an early conviction to improving the \nlives of all Americans. This conviction inspired a lifelong dedication \nto advancing labor rights, civil rights, and civil liberties. Despite \nno formal education after receiving his high school diploma, Mr. \nOvshinsky became one of the 20th century's most prolific inventors. His \nvision and concern for the greater good led to over 400 patents, \nincluding major contributions to flexible solar panels, computer \nmemory, flat-screen TV displays, and the development of the nickel-\nmetal hydride battery.\n  Mr. Ovshinsky's belief in the ability of science and technology to \nadvance environmental stewardship and quality of life was rooted in his \nexperience as a member of the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish fraternal \norganization committed to community, an enlightened Jewish culture, and \nsocial justice since it was established in 1900. The Workmen's Circle \ninspired Mr. Ovshinsky to pursue science and develop advanced \ntechnology dedicated to heightening economic opportunity and improving \npeople's relationship with the environment around the world. After \nstarting his career as a toolmaker in Akron, Mr. Ovshinsky moved to \nDetroit in 1952, where he was director of research at the Hupp \nCorporation and established General Automation with his younger \nbrother, Herb Ovshinsky.\n  At General Automation, Mr. Ovshinsky continued his research on \nintelligent machines, as well as early work on various information and \nenergy technologies. He was invited by Wayne State University to \nconduct research at the university's neuroscience lab, where he \ndiscovered the connection between the amorphous structure of brain \ncells and amorphous glassy materials. This discovery encouraged Mr. \nOvshinsky and his brother to construct the Ovitron, a mechanical model \nof a nerve cell constructed of thin layers of amorphous material, \ncreating the first nanostructure, and establishing the foundation of \nhis research for decades.\n  Following his experience at General Automation, Mr. Ovshinsky founded \nEnergy Conversion Devices in 1960 with Iris Dibner, who would become \nhis wife and partner for over 50 years. It was at Energy Conversion \nDevices that he established Ovonics--the process of turning glassy, \nthin films into semiconductors with the application of low voltage--and \ndeveloped new electronic and optical switches, including Ovonic Phase \nChange Memory and the Threshold Switch. These became the basis for the \ninvention of rewritable CDs and DVDs, as well as the cognitive \ncomputer. Mr. Ovshinsky's work also revolutionized the construction of \nsolar panels and resulted in the nickel-metal hydride battery, which \nbecame an important power source for electric vehicles, consumer \nelectronics, industrial equipment, and telecommunications.\n  Time Magazine celebrated Mr. Ovshinsky as a ``Hero for the Planet''\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nin 1991. In 2006, The Economist recognized him as the ``Edison of our \nage.'' At the time of his death in 2012, he was credited on more than \n300 publications and had received over 20 major awards and honorary \ndegrees. Throughout his life, however, Mr. Ovshinsky displayed as much \nvigor for fighting for justice outside his laboratory as within. His \nefforts contributed to the introduction of affordable housing in his \naffluent neighborhood in Birmingham, MI, and he was a proud member of \nthe Mechanist's Union, as well as an early supporter of Walter P. \nReuther and the United Auto Workers. It is an honor to recognize \nsomeone whose work not only helped usher the world into the modern age, \nbut was also based in a belief that each of us has a responsibility to \nserve our community and leave the world a better place for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE 125TH STEVENS FAMILY REUNION\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and honor \nan exemplary Oregonian family who will soon gather for their 125th \nfamily reunion. Family reunions are difficult to organize and even \nharder to make longlasting traditions. Nonetheless, since 1891 the \nchildren of Hanson and Lavina Stevens have managed to hold yearly \nfamily reunions, with the exception of one missed reunion during the \nFirst World War--truly an amazing feat.\n  In many ways, the history of the Stevens family is the history of the \nState of Oregon. In 1852, the Stevens family decided to take advantage \nof the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, which encouraged settlement of \nthe Oregon Territory. Hanson and Lavina Stevens, their eight children \nand a wagon loaded with vital supplies traveled the treacherous Oregon \nTrail.\n  Twenty-two other wagons traveled alongside the Stevens family and \nundertook the Oregon Trail's most dangerous migration year ever \nrecorded. While all of the other families decided to stop near Fort \nBridger, WY, in search of gold, Hanson Stevens concluded that mining \ncamps were not suitable for raising his family. Instead, the Stevens, \nlike thousands of other pioneers, chose to settle in Oregon. They chose \nthe ``Promised Land.'' Ever since, the Stevens and their descendants \nhave contributed to the territory and then the State of Oregon.\n  In June of 1891, the entire family gathered for the birthday of the \nfamily patriarch at the time, Isaac Stevens. That tradition continued \non each year, and eventually turned from a birthday party into a more \nformal family reunion.\n  Today the Stevens decedents are six clans strong, and they rotate the \nresponsibility for hosting their memorable reunions. This year the \nRingo Clan will be hosting the 125th reunion on July 19, 2015 at \nChampoeg Park in St. Paul, OR.\n  The family tells me that each year the various clans all give a \nreport to the family, and the details are recorded in a leather-bound \njournal. As you can imagine, this journal traces not just the history \nof the Stevens family but also provides a view into the history of \nOregon and the United States.\n  And that is part of what makes family reunions so wonderful. They \ndon't just connect us to the aunts, uncles and cousins we don't see \nvery often; they also connect us to our past, our heritage. Family \nreunions are a place to share family lore, shared values, and \ntraditions.\n  I am thrilled to recognize the Stevens family 125th annual reunion. I \nhope to see the Stevens family tradition continue for many, many years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3454-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3454-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/02/senate-section/article/S3454-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 802.

A bill to require States to report to the Attorney General \ncertain information regarding shooting incidents involving law \nenforcement officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Boxer to \nintroduce the Police Reporting of Information, Data, and Evidence Act \nof 2015, PRIDE Act, a critical data collection bill designed to advance \npublic safety, strengthen police-community relations, and foster mutual \ntrust and respect. I thank Senator Boxer for her leadership on this \nissue.\n  A critical issue in our Nation today is the issue of trust between \nlaw enforcement and the communities they serve. Tragic events across \nthe country--in New York, Ferguson, North Charleston, Baltimore, and \nsubsequent protests--remind us how critical trust is to the fabric of a \ndemocracy. These incidents raised the public's awareness and sparked a \nnational debate about how police and citizens interact and how they \nshould interact. But the issue is not unique now. The Kerner \nCommission's 1968 report on urban violence declared that minorities \nbelieved a ``double standard'' of justice and protection existed for \nwhites and blacks. Sadly, that distrust continues today. It is contrary \nto who we are and what we stand for.\n  Our nation was founded on shared and timeless values. Liberty and \njustice for all. Equal justice under law. The former was enshrined in \nour founding charter. The latter was written on the marble of Supreme \nCourt. But when any American feels that they have not been treated \nfairly, we undermine those values. That makes the issue of police and \ncommunity relations a problem for all of us--not just a specific city \nor a specific race. It is a problem for the Nation as a whole. We must \ndo all we can to restore justice to our criminal justice system. That \nincludes tracking when officers use deadly or serious force against \npeople in the community.\n  We must ensure that police officers feel respected and honored. Each \nday, law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to keep our \ncommunities safe. They deserve our respect. They should not feel \nattacked or undervalued. They routinely make split-second decisions \nevery day that do not escalate into uses of force. As the senseless \nkillings of NYPD Officers Rafael Ramos and Wanjian Liu remind us, \nofficers often serve the public at considerable personal risk. We \nshould provide them with the tools they need to do their jobs \neffectively and safely. That includes tracking the uses of force by \ncivilians against our men and women in uniform.\n  To bridge the wide trust gap between law enforcement and citizens, we \nmust shine a light on the problem. The first step to solve any problem \nis to be honest about the facts. We need objective data. We need to \nstudy trends. We need to examine the evidence. That is why I am \nencouraged by the words of FBI Director, James Comey, who said ``We \nsimply must find ways to see each other more clearly. Part of that has \nto involve collecting and sharing better\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\ninformation about encounters between police and citizens, especially \nviolent encounters.''\n  For too long, the way we have collected information and data from \nStates and local governments on violent encounters between law \nenforcement and civilians has been inconsistent. Under current law, \ndemographic data regarding officer-involved shootings is inconsistently \nreported to the FBI under the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. \nAccording to a study by the Washington Post this month, since 2011, \nless than three percent of the Nation's 18,000 State and local police \nagencies reported fatal shootings by their officers to the FBI. That is \nunacceptable. Incomplete and unreliable reporting makes it tougher to \nget a true scope of the problem and more difficult to obtain a policy \nsolution.\n  The PRIDE Act would fix that problem and increase accountability for \nlaw enforcement by creating a comprehensive national data collection \nprogram. It would require law enforcement at the State, local, and \ntribal levels to report to the Attorney General information regarding \npolice-involved shootings and any incident in which use of force by or \nagainst a law enforcement officer or civilian results in serious injury \nor death. By making the voluntary reporting of uses of force by, and \nagainst, police officers mandatory, we ensure that more accountability \nand transparency will exist between the police and the citizens they \nprotect.\n  I have worked closely with Senator Boxer on crafting this \nlegislation, and appreciate my friend and colleague welcoming several \nrecommendations to strengthen the bill, including clarifications that \nuse-of-force policies for law enforcement officers be made publicly \navailable. I believe this change would promote transparency. It shines \na spotlight on the scope of shootings and uses of force involving \npolice and civilians, which in turn enhances public confidence in our \njustice system.\n  I also appreciate that the bill includes grant funds for public \nawareness campaigns designed to gain information from the public on \nuses of force against police officers. This was a recommendation drawn \nfrom being a former mayor. I have seen first-hand how helpful tip \nlines, hotlines, and public service announcements can be in helping law \nenforcement capture dangerous people. When someone uses violence \nagainst our men and women in uniform, we must respond quickly. That \nmeans we should do all that we can to ensure that information on the \nsuspect gets out to the public in a timely manner. That way, the \noffender can promptly be caught and brought to justice.\n  Lastly, I recommended the bill include grant funds for use of force \ntraining for law enforcement agencies and personnel, including de-\nescalation training. Officers deserve to receive the best and most up \nto date training we can offer. They must feel confident that they are \ntrained to use force in a way that allows them to safely come home to \ntheir families. Equally, the public deserves to have confidence that \nwhen an officer uses force he or she does so appropriately. That means \ntraining officers to ensure that force is a last resort and officers \nknow how to de-escalate a situation to avoid using force at all.\n  Many of the bill's provisions were recommendations from the \nPresident's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. It put forth a series \nof recommendations aimed at rebuilding trust between the law \nenforcement officers and the communities they protect. Its \nrecommendations included use of force data collection, de-escalation \ntraining, transparency, and officer safety measures. I am glad that \nmany of the task force recommendations were included in this bill.\n  It is time we address the plague of shootings by and against police \nofficers in our country. We must come together to ensure that we do see \neach other clearly and restore public confidence in our system of \njustice. The first step is to shine a light on the problem and collect \naccurate data. I thank Senator Boxer again for her leadership, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the PRIDE Act and work towards its speedy \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1481.

A bill to improve and reauthorize provisions relating to the \napplication of the antitrust laws to the award of need-based \neducational aid; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Need-Based \nEducational Aid Act of 2015, a bill that extends the Section 568 \nantitrust exemption for higher education institutions. I am pleased \nthat Senator Leahy and Senator Lee are cosponsoring this bill.\n  The Section 568 exemption enables colleges and universities to \ncollaborate on need-blind financial aid policies. It allows these \ninstitutions to collaborate on a common formula for calculating a \nfamily's ability to pay for college, by permitting certain specific \nactivities. The exemption was enacted in 1994, and since then has been \nreauthorized by Congress on three occasions. In addition, a 2006 GAO \nreport found that the activities permitted by Section 568 did not \nresult in harm to competition.\n  Our bill would provide a 7-year extension for this exemption, and \nalso remove one of the four previously permitted activities under the \nexemption that no school has ever used. By allowing financial aid \nprofessionals to work together in these ways, Section 568 provides \nincreased access to higher education to low-income students, while \npreventing needless litigation over the development of principles for \ndetermining financial need.\n  I am proud to introduce this important, bipartisan bill, which will \nensure these benefits remain available for students and will encourage \naccess to higher education for years to come.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Leahy and Lee, for their support of \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1482\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Need-Based Educational Aid \n     Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION RELATING TO THE APPLICATION OF THE \n                   ANTRITRUST LAWS TO THE AWARD OF NEED-BASED \n                   EDUCATIONAL AID.\n\n       Section 568 of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 \n     (15 U.S.C. 1 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; or'' and inserting a \n     period at the end; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``2015'' and inserting \n     ``2022''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senators Grassley \nand Lee in introducing legislation to extend for an additional 7 years \nthe antitrust exemption permitting colleges and universities to \ncollaborate on issues of need-based financial aid. This exemption, \nwhich was first enacted by Congress in 1994, allows colleges and \nuniversities that admit students on a need-blind basis to collaborate \non the formula used to determine how much families can pay for college. \nThe Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015 is the fourth \nreauthorization of this exemption, which is set to expire this year.\n  Congress must always carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of \ncreating exemptions to the antitrust laws. These laws serve as an \nimportant bulwark to protect consumers from anticompetitive conduct. \nThe Government Accountability Office has studied the effect of this \nparticular exemption in the past and concluded that allowing \nuniversities to talk among themselves about financial aid policies and \nprocedures has not caused any harm.\n  Antitrust exemptions should not be a blank check, however, which is \nwhy this exemption is not permanent. Our legislation will sunset the \nexemption once again in 2022 and we have removed one of the permitted \nactivities that no school has ever used. A time-limited exemption \nensures that Congress will continue to conduct oversight in order to \nassess the impact on consumers. I have long been skeptical of permanent \nantitrust exemptions and the effect they have on the marketplace. For \nexample, I have worked for years with a number of Senators from both \nparties to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a permanent exemption for \nthe insurance industry in place since 1945.\n  Allowing covered universities to focus their resources on ensuring \nthe most qualified students can attend some of the best schools in the \nnation, regardless of family income, is a bipartisan and bicameral \ngoal.

A Member may make the motion only on the day \n     after the calendar day on which the Member announces to the \n     House concerned the Member's intention to make the motion, \n     except that, in the case of the House of Representatives, the \n     motion may be made without such prior announcement if the \n     motion is made by direction of the committee to which the \n     resolution was referred.

As acknowledged in the March 2015 Navy, Marine \n     Corps, and Coast Guard maritime strategy entitled ``A \n     Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower: Forward, \n     Engaged, Ready'', ``[o]ceans are the lifeblood of the \n     interconnected global community. . .90 percent of trade by \n     volume across the oceans. Approximately 70 percent of the \n     world's population lives within 100 miles of the coastline''.\n       (5) In this global security environment, it is critical \n     that the United States possess a maritime forces whose \n     mission and ethos is readiness, a fight tonight force, \n     forward deployed, that can respond immediately to emergent \n     crises across the full range of military operations around \n     the globe either from the sea or home station.\n       (6) The need for such forces was recognized by the 82nd \n     Congress during the Korean War, when it mandated a core \n     mission for the Nation's leanest force, the Marine Corps, to \n     be most ready when the nation is least ready.\n       (7) In recognition of this continued need and the wisdom of \n     the 82nd Congress, the Senate reaffirms section 5063 of title \n     10, United States Code, uniquely charging the United States \n     Marine Corps with this responsibility.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Marine Corps, within the Department of the Navy, \n     should remain the Nation's expeditionary, crisis response \n     force; and\n       (2) as provided in section 5063 of title 10, United States \n     Code, the Marine Corps should--\n       (A) be organized to include no less than three combat \n     divisions and three air wings, and such other land combat, \n     aviation, and other services as may be organic to it;\n       (B) be organized, trained, and equipped to provide fleet \n     marine forces of combined arms, together with supporting air \n     components, for service with the fleet in the seizure or \n     defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such \n     land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a \n     naval campaign; and\n       (C) provide detachments and organizations for service on \n     armed vessels of the Navy, provide security detachments for \n     the protection of naval property at naval stations and bases, \n     and perform such other duties as the President may direct;\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n       (D) develop, in coordination with the Army and the Air \n     Force, those phases of amphibious operations that pertain to \n     the tactics, techniques, and equipment used by landing \n     forces; and\n       (E) be responsible, in accordance with the integrated joint \n     mobilization plans, for the expansion of peacetime components \n     of the Marine Corps to meet the needs of war.\n\n                    Subtitle F--Studies and Reports\n\n     SEC. 1061.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EUROPEAN DEFENSE AND NORTH \n                   ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, at \n     the 2014 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in Wales, \n     pledged to ``reverse the trend of declining defense budgets, \n     to make the most effective use of our funds and to further a \n     more balanced sharing of costs and responsibilities''.\n       (2) Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated on May \n     2, 2014, that ``[t]oday, America's GDP is smaller than the \n     combined GDPs of our 27 NATO allies. But America's defense \n     spending is three times our Allies' combined defense \n     spending. Over time, this lopsided burden threatens NATO's \n     integrity, cohesion, and capability, and ultimately both \n     European and transatlantic security''.\n       (3) Former North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary \n     General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated on July 3, 2014, that \n     ``[d]uring the last five years, Russia has increased defense \n     spending by 50 percent, while NATO allies on average have \n     decrease their defense spending by 20 percent. That is not \n     sustainable, we need more investment in defense and \n     security''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security and fiscal interests of \n     the United States that prompt efforts should be undertaken by \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to meet defense \n     budget commitments made in Declaration 14 of the Wales Summit \n     Declaration of September 2014;\n       (2) the United States Government should continue efforts \n     through the Department of Defense and other agencies to \n     encourage North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies towards \n     meeting the defense spending goals set out at the Wales \n     Summit;\n       (3) some North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have \n     already taken positive steps to reverse declines in defense \n     spending and should continue to be supported in those \n     efforts; and\n       (4) thoughtful and coordinated defense investments by \n     European allies in military capabilities would add deterrence \n     value to the posture of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization against Russian aggression and terrorist \n     organizations and more appropriately balance the share of \n     Atlantic defense spending.\n\n     SEC. 1255.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REAFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF \n                   IMPLEMENTING THE REBALANCE TO THE ASIA-PACIFIC \n                   REGION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has a longstanding national interest \n     in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region.\n       (2) The Asia-Pacific region is home to the world's three \n     largest economies, four most populous countries, and five \n     largest militaries. The Asia-Pacific's rapid economic growth \n     and mounting security tensions require a renewed focus from \n     the United States on the region to maintain security, expand \n     prosperity, and support common values.\n       (3) In 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the \n     United States would rebalance to the Asia-Pacific. Since \n     then, there have been a number of actions taken to strengthen \n     the United States posture and relationships in the region, \n     including the negotiation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation \n     Agreement with the Philippines, the distributed laydown of \n     the United States Marines Corps in the Pacific, the \n     rotational stationing of the Littoral Combat Ship in \n     Singapore, and a new comprehensive partnership with Vietnam \n     on defense and security.\n       (4) Leaders in regional states remain concerned about a \n     variety of regional military challenges. These include \n     China's military modernization and its increasingly assertive \n     actions in the East and South China Sea and North Korea's \n     continued belligerence and its pursuit of nuclear and \n     ballistic missile technology. United States allies and \n     partners are looking to the United States to demonstrate its \n     willingness and ability to maintain regional peace and \n     security by fully implementing the rebalance to the Asia-\n     Pacific.\n       (5) In April 2015, the Commander of the United States \n     Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Locklear warned, ``Our \n     relative superiority I think has declined and continues to \n     decline. . .we rely very heavily on power projection, which \n     means we have to be able to get the forces forward. . .''. \n     Admiral Locklear also noted, ``Any significant force \n     structure moves out of my AOR in the middle of a rebalance \n     would have to be understood and have to be explained because \n     it would counterintuitive to a rebalance to move significant \n     forces in another direction.''\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) in order to maintain the credibility of the United \n     States rebalance, it is vital that the United States continue \n     to shift forces to the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen the \n     ability of the United States Armed Forces to project power to \n     shape the choices of regional states and to deter, and if \n     necessary defend, against hostile military actions;\n       (2) United States allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific \n     region, as well as potential adversaries, would take note of \n     any withdrawal of forces from the Asia-Pacific theater;\n       (3) any withdrawal of United States forces from Outside the \n     Continental United States (``OCONUS'') Asia-Pacific region or \n     from United States Pacific Command would therefore seriously \n     undermine the rebalance; and\n       (4) in order to properly implement United States rebalance \n     policy, United States forces under the operational control of \n     the United States Pacific Command should be increased \n     consistent with commitments already made by the Department of \n     Defense and aligned with the requirement to maintain a \n     balance of military power that favors the United States and \n     United States allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n     SEC. 1263. SENSE OF SENATE ON TAIWAN ASYMMETRIC MILITARY \n                   CAPABILITIES AND BILATERAL TRAINING ACTIVITIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States, in accordance with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act (Public Law 96-8), should continue to make \n     available to Taiwan such defense articles and services as may \n     be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense;\n       (2) the United States should continue to support the \n     efforts of Taiwan to integrate innovative and asymmetric \n     measures to balance the growing military capabilities of the \n     People's Republic of China, including fast-attack craft, \n     coastal-defense cruise missiles, rapid-runway repair systems, \n     offensive mines, and submarines optimized for defense of the \n     Taiwan straits;\n       (3) the military forces of Taiwan should be permitted to \n     participate in bilateral training activities hosted by the \n     United States that increase credible deterrent capabilities \n     of Taiwan, particularly those that emphasize the defense of \n     Taiwan Island from missile attack, maritime blockade, and \n     amphibious invasion by the People's Republic of China;\n       (4) toward that goal, Taiwan should be encouraged to \n     participate in exercises that include realistic air-to-air \n     combat training, including the exercise conducted at Eielson \n     Air Force Base, Alaska, and Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, \n     commonly referred to as ``Red Flag''; and\n       (5) Taiwan should also be encouraged to participate in \n     advanced bilateral training for its ground forces, Apache \n     attack helicopters, and P-3C surveillance aircraft in island-\n     defense scenarios.\n\n                Subtitle F--Reports and Related Matters\n\n     SEC. 1271.

MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO VIOLATIONS OF THE \n                   INTERMEDIATE-RANGE NUCLEAR FORCES TREATY BY THE \n                   RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 31, 2014, the Department of State released its \n     annual report entitled ``Adherence to and Compliance With \n     Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements \n     and Commitments'', which included the finding that ``[t]he \n     United States has determined that the Russian Federation is \n     in violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to \n     possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise \n     missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, \n     or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles''.\n       (2) The United States has undertaken diplomatic efforts to \n     address with the Russian Federation its violations of the INF \n     Treaty since 2013, and the Russian Federation has failed to \n     respond to those efforts in any way.\n       (3) The Commander of the United States European Command, \n     and Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, General Philip \n     Breedlove stated that ``[a] weapon capability that violates \n     the I.N.F., that is introduced into the greater European land \n     mass, is absolutely a tool that will have to be dealt with'' \n     and ``[i]t can't go unanswered''.\n       (4) The Secretary of Defense has informed Congress that the \n     range of options in response to the violation by the Russian \n     Federation of the INF Treaty could include ``active defenses \n     to counter intermediate-range ground-launched cruise \n     missiles; counterforce capabilities to prevent intermediate-\n     range ground-launched cruise missile attacks; and \n     countervailing strike capabilities to enhance U.S. or allied \n     forces''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the development and deployment of a nuclear ground-\n     launched cruise missile by the Russian Federation in \n     violation of the INF Treaty would pose a dangerous threat to \n     the United States and its allies;\n       (2) the Russian Federation has established an increasing \n     role for nuclear weapons in its military strategy;\n       (3) efforts taken by the President to compel the Russian \n     Federation to return to compliance with the INF Treaty must \n     be persistent and are in the best interests of the United \n     States, but cannot be open-ended; and\n       (4) efforts by the United States to develop military and \n     nonmilitary options for responding to violations of the INF \n     Treaty could encourage the Russian Federation to return to \n     compliance with the INF Treaty.\n       (c) Notification.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, \n     the President shall notify the appropriate congressional \n     committees with respect to whether the Russian Federation--\n       (1) has flight-tested, has deployed, or possesses a \n     military system that has achieved an initial operating \n     capability that is either a ground-launched ballistic missile \n     or ground-launched cruise missile with a flight-tested range \n     of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers; or\n       (2) has begun taking measures to return to full compliance \n     with the INF Treaty, including verification measures \n     necessary to achieve high confidence that any missile \n     described in paragraph (1) will be eliminated.\n       (d) Updates to Allies.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff shall, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     that describes--\n       (1) the status of updates provided to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and other allies of the United States on \n     the Russian Federation's flight testing, operating \n     capability, and deployment of ground-launched ballistic \n     missiles or ground-launched cruise missiles with a flight-\n     tested range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers; and\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n       (2) efforts to develop, with the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and such allies, collective responses, including \n     economic and military responses, to arms control violations \n     by the Russian Federation, including violations of the INF \n     Treaty.\n       (e) Plan on Response Options.--\n       (1) Military response options.--\n       (A) In general.--If, as of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Russian Federation has not begun taking \n     measures to return to full compliance with the INF Treaty, \n     including by agreeing to verification measures necessary to \n     achieve high confidence that any ground-launched ballistic \n     missile or ground-launched cruise missile with a flight-\n     tested range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers will be \n     eliminated, the Secretary of Defense shall, not later than \n     120 days after such date of enactment, submit to Congress a \n     plan with respect to developing the following military \n     capabilities:\n       (i) Counterforce capabilities to prevent intermediate-range \n     ground-launched ballistic missile and cruise missile attacks, \n     whether or not such capabilities are in compliance with the \n     INF Treaty and including capabilities that may be acquired \n     from allies of the United States.\n       (ii) Countervailing strike capabilities to enhance the \n     forces of the United States or allies of the United States, \n     whether or not such capabilities are in compliance with the \n     INF Treaty and including capabilities that may be acquired \n     from allies of the United States.\n       (iii) Active defenses to defend against intermediate-range \n     ground-launched cruise missile attacks.\n       (B) Cost and schedule estimates.--The Secretary shall \n     include, in the plan required by subparagraph (A), with \n     respect to each military capability described in clauses (i), \n     (ii), and (iii) of that subparagraph, an estimate of cost and \n     the approximate time for achieving a Milestone A decision, if \n     such a decision is required.\n       (C) Availability of funds for recommended capabilities.--\n     The Secretary may use funds authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2016 for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation, Defense-wide, as \n     specified in the funding table in section 4201, to carry out \n     the development of capabilities pursuant to subparagraph (A) \n     that are recommended by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff to meet military requirements and current capability \n     gaps. In making such a recommendation, the Chairman shall \n     give priority to such capabilities that the Chairman \n     determines could be tested and fielded most expediently, with \n     the most priority given to capabilities that the Chairman \n     determines could be fielded in two years.\n       (2) Other response options.--The President shall include in \n     the plan required by paragraph (1)(A) such other options as \n     the President considers useful to encourage the Russian \n     Federation to return to full compliance with the INF Treaty \n     or necessary to respond to the failure of the Russian \n     Federation to return to full compliance with the INF Treaty.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the congressional defense committees;\n       (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) INF treaty.--The term ``INF Treaty'' means the Treaty \n     between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-\n     Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed at Washington \n     December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988 \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Intermediate-Range Nuclear \n     Forces Treaty'' or ``INF Treaty'').\n\n     SEC. 1662.
