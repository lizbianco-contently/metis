Madam President, last week the Senate took decisive \naction to address America's devastating prescription opioid and heroin \nepidemic by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. It is \nan important accomplishment for the American people. It is the latest \nexample of a Republican Senate leading on important issues. It also \nreminds us what can be accomplished when Senators focus on issues where \nthey can agree rather than only fighting about issues where they don't \nagree.\n  It is clear that Democrats and Republicans do not agree on whether \nthe American people should have a voice in the current Supreme Court \nvacancy. Republicans know the American people elected a Republican \nSenate to be a check-and-balance to President Obama. We know the next \nJustice could dramatically change the direction of the Court for \ndecades. We think the American people deserve a voice in that \nconversation. Democrats would rather the President make this incredibly \nconsequential decision on his way out the door. This is one issue where \nwe simply don't agree, so let's keep our focus on the areas where we \ncan find agreement instead.\n  I ask colleagues to join us in continuing to do our work here in the \nSenate. As we do that, the American people can continue making their \nvoices heard in this important national conversation. Passing CARA was \na great example of what we can get done when we work constructively \ntoward solutions.\n  This week we will have the opportunity to make progress on other \nissues, including one I would like to mention now.\n  Vermont recently passed food-labeling legislation that according to \none study could increase annual food costs by more than $1,000 per \nfamily. These aren't just Vermont families I am talking about; these \nare families all across our country.\n  The Senate will soon consider commonsense, bipartisan legislation \nthat aims to ensure that decisions in one State or a patchwork of \ndifferent State laws do not hurt American families throughout our \ncountry--especially at a time when so many are already struggling to \nmake ends meet. The goal is to set clear, science-based standards in \norder to prevent families from being unfairly hurt by a patchwork of \nconflicting local and State labeling laws passed in States and cities \nwhere they don't even live.\n  I would like to recognize the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Roberts, for his continuing work on this issue. The Agriculture \nCommittee moved to pass the chairman's mark last week with bipartisan \nsupport. I know Chairman Robert continues to work with Senator \nStabenow, the ranking member, and others across the aisle on a pathway \nforward on legislation we can pass in the Senate to resolve this issue. \nI urge Members to continue working with him in that endeavor.\n  Let's not forget that this may well be our last chance to prevent the \nactions of one State--just one State--from hurting Americans in all the \nother States. Legislation to address this issue passed the House last \nsummer with bipartisan support. With cooperation from across the aisle, \nwe can take action on a bipartisan basis here on the Senate floor as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1445-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1445-S1446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COAL FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on one final matter, when President \nObama was a candidate, he boasted that his energy tax policies would \nmake electricity prices skyrocket for American families. When President \nObama took office, his administration declared a war on coal families \nand on their jobs. For a time, his administration tried to deny it was \ndeclaring war on anyone, but now we hear boasting from the highest \nranks of the Democratic Party that these policies are going to put coal \nminers out of business.\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\n  Miners in Kentucky and across the country know that coal keeps the \nlights on and puts food on the table. What they want is to provide for \ntheir families. But here is how more Democrats seem to view these hard-\nworking Americans and their families: just statistics, just the cost of \ndoing business, just obstacles to their ideology. This is callous, it \nis wrong, and it underlines the need to stand up for hard-working, \nmiddle-class coal families. That is what I have done here in the \nSenate. That is what I will continue to do. I hope our colleagues will \njoin me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1446-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I understand the Republican leader's \nconcern about coal not being the way it was. It is simply that the \nAmerican people have made a decision that we are going to have to look \nfor another way to produce energy. There is still a place for coal in \nour society, but everyone has to acknowledge that it is not as it was a \nfew years ago.\n  I wish the Republican leader cared more about moving to help the \npensions of these coal miners. They are desperately looking for \nsupport. We support them on this side. All the coal miners support it. \nWe can get no support from the Republicans. We tried during the work we \ndid at the end of the year. We came close, but Republicans said no.\n  I want all those coal miners from Kentucky and around the country to \nunderstand that we are trying to help them with their pensions, but \nunless we get some help from the Republicans, there will be no support. \nThat is too bad.

Madam President, Senate Republicans have finally admitted \nthat their obstruction of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee has \nnothing to do with precedent, it has nothing to do with history, it has \nnothing to do with the Constitution, but it has everything to do with \npartisan politics.\n  Last Thursday, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee forced \nChairman Grassley and the committee Republicans to debate the Supreme \nCourt vacancy during a markup. Remember, this is the same markup the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, canceled a week \nearlier because he and Republicans didn't want to make the meeting open \nto the public. He tried to have a secret meeting; Democrats wouldn't \nagree.\n  On last Thursday when they finally had a meeting, the senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina, a Republican, said:\n\n       We are setting a precedent here today, Republicans are, \n     that in the last year at least of a lame duck eight-year \n     term--I would say it's going to be a four-year term--that \n     you're not going to fill a vacancy of the Supreme Court based \n     on what we're doing here today. We're headed to changing the \n     rules, probably in a permanent fashion.\n\n  I applaud Senator Graham's forthrightness in admitting what his \nRepublican colleagues refuse to admit: Their obstruction of a Supreme \nCourt nominee is unprecedented. The senior Senator from South Carolina \nsaid that, and that is what I have been saying.\n  So the question then remains, if denying President Obama's nominee a \nmeeting, a hearing, and a vote has nothing to do with Senate precedent, \nthen what is this all about? Fortunately, last Thursday also yielded an \nanswer to that question. During an interview with a Wisconsin radio \nstation, the Republican Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Ron Johnson, \nwas asked if he would treat a Supreme Court nominee from a Republican \nPresident differently. He answered:\n\n       Generally, and this is the way it works out politically . . \n     . if a conservative president's replacing a conservative \n     justice, there's a little more accommodation to it.\n\n  The Senator from Wisconsin admitted that he and his colleagues would \naccommodate the Supreme Court nomination from a Republican President. \nSo Senate Republicans are talking out of both sides of their mouths. \nRepublicans claim they are simply adhering to precedent, even as they \nadmit they are permanently changing the way the Senate treats Supreme \nCourt nominees.\n  Republicans claim they want to give the American people a voice. That \nis what elections are all about. President Obama's reelection was the \nAmerican people's voice.\n  Republicans claim--I repeat--they want to give the American people a \nvoice and wait until after a new President is sworn in, even while \nadmitting they would consider a Republican President's nominee right \nnow. It doesn't make sense. It is illogical. It is unfair.\n  The American people do not accept this duplicitous posturing. They \ndon't accept it as a rationalization for why Republicans won't do their \njobs.\n  Over the weekend, the editorial board of Iowa City Press-Citizen--the \nPresiding Officer's home State--made clear what they want Senator \nGrassley and Senate Republicans to do: They want Republicans to follow \nthe Constitution.\n\n       Partisan posturing to score points at the expense of \n     Constitutional process doesn't change character based on the \n     letter next to a lawmaker's name. . . . Currently, a Democrat \n     is in the White House as this pitched battle is fought, but \n     were the roles reversed, we would not alter our position. If, \n     down the line, a Supreme Court Justice retired or died in a \n     presidential election year with a Republican in power, we \n     would similarly urge a fair hearing for that president's \n     nominee.\n\n  The Senate's constitutional duty transcends partisan bickering. The \npeople of Iowa and America don't want a Senate that treats its \nconstitutional duties differently based on who is in the White House. \nThey want a Senate that does its job. They want Republicans to do their \njobs.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues, enough with the hollow excuses \nand groundless rationalizations. Do your jobs and give President \nObama's Supreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote.\n  Madam President, there is another aspect of this Supreme Court fight \nwe must address. Already, as we know, Republicans are resorting to what \nthey call pinata politics. That is what Senator Cornyn promised. \nRadical conservative groups are starting to run smear campaigns \ntargeting President Obama's potential Supreme Court nominees. One of \nthose potential nominees is from Iowa.\n  One such ad from the Judicial Crisis Network, a dark money, rightwing \npolitical organization that operates in total secrecy--not knowing \nwhere its money comes from; probably the Koch brothers because they \nfund most everything else--is especially appalling. The ad takes aim at \nan Iowan serving on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Jane \nKelly. The accusations leveled against Judge Kelly are despicable, and \nthey deserve to be answered by her home State Senator--I should say \nSenators.\n  Senator Grassley is on record as having strongly supported Judge \nKelly's confirmation to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. It was he \nwho came to the floor in 2013 and read from a letter stating that Judge \nKelly is ``a forthright woman of high integrity and honest character . \n. . and exceptionally keen intellect.'' It was Senator Grassley who \ntold his colleagues at about the same time: ``I am pleased to support \nher confirmation and urge my colleagues to join me.'' And Senator \nGrassley's Judicial Committee, of which he was a senior member, even \nhelped vet Judge Kelly's record before endorsing her confirmation to \nthe bench.\n  If there was something wrong with her judicial nomination, he \ncertainly didn't find it. Yet Senator Grassley has been silent in the \nwake of these recent smears against Judge Kelly. I\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\nknow the senior Senator from Iowa has been busy listening to what the \nRepublican leader's line is on the Supreme Court vacancy, but this \ndisgusting rightwing attack from Republicans to a fellow Iowan--a judge \nhe enthusiastically supported--demands a response.\n  Senator Grassley needs to tell the people of Iowa whether he supports \nthe smear campaign that his own Republicans are hurling at Judge Jane \nKelly. Does he support the smear campaign? That is a question that \nneeds to be answered, especially since the Judicial Crisis Network--\nthis rightwing, secretly funded by dark money--has been in lockstep \nwith Senator Grassley's obstruction and even praising him while at the \nsame time smearing Judge Kelly.\n  If he doesn't go on record, he needs to do something. I can't imagine \nwhy he wouldn't go on record denouncing this type of disgusting \nrhetoric. I look forward to the senior Senator from Iowa setting the \nrecord straight on his fellow Iowan and a judge whom he personally \nendorsed.\n  Madam President, there is no one on the floor.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about something \nthat guides the work of each and every one of us--the U.S. \nConstitution. Each and every one of us has taken an oath of office to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. We all \nsolemnly swear that we will bear true faith and allegiance to the \nConstitution and that we will faithfully discharge the duties of our \noffice. Have some of the Senate Republicans forgotten this?\n  Last week a colleague was asked in a radio interview on a Wisconsin \nradio station if Republicans would be more likely to advance a Supreme \nCourt nomination had a Republican been elected President in 2012. He \nsaid: ``Generally, and this is the way it works out politically, if \nyou're replacing--if a conservative president's replacing a \nconservative justice, there's a little more accommodation to it.'' Do \nSenate Republicans really believe that they need a Republican President \nsimply to do their jobs?\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that President Obama was elected \nto a 4-year term in 2012 with over 65 million votes. The American \npeople decided who our President is, and according to the Constitution, \nthe term the President earned has more than 300 days remaining. The \nvoices of those 65 million Americans need to be heard and respected \ndespite how much some people want to silence them, disrespect them, and \nignore them.\n  On Supreme Court vacancies, the Constitution is also clear. Under \narticle II of the Constitution, the President shall appoint judges to \nthe Supreme Court and the Senate's role is to provide advice and \nconsent. It is the constitutional duty of the President to select a \nSupreme Court nominee, and the Senate has the responsibility to give \nthat nominee fair consideration with a timely hearing and a timely \nvote.\n  It is deeply troubling to me and the people for whom I work in \nWisconsin that the Republican majority would choose not to fulfill \ntheir constitutional duty. Before the President has even made a \nnomination to fill the current vacancy, a number of Senators have \nannounced that they will not perform their constitutional duty. This \nnot only runs contrary to the process that the Framers envisioned in \narticle II, but it runs counter to our Nation's history.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have claimed that the Senate history \nsupports their historic obstruction. This is simply false. In fact, six \nJustices have been confirmed in Presidential election years since 1900, \nincluding Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, and Republican appointee \nAnthony Kennedy, who was confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate \nduring President Ronald Reagan's last year in office.\n  Recently, one of my colleagues on the other side suggested that the \nnomination and confirmation process for a Supreme Court Justice--\nperhaps just this impending Supreme Court nomination--would be nothing \nmore than playing pinata. I would like to point out that when playing \npinata, children are typically blindfolded, spun around in circles, and \nthen they take a whack at the pinata with either a bat or stick. It is \nas if my Republican colleagues have become dizzied by what they are \nhearing around them--perhaps Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric.\n  Do they see a Supreme Court nominee as nothing more than something to \nwhack over and over, like a pinata? The violence of the metaphor is \nproblematic. Have they lost faith and allegiance in their \nconstitutional duties?\n  Today, the American people deserve a full and functioning Supreme \nCourt, not an empty seat on the highest Court in the land. The American \npeople cannot afford partisan obstruction that threatens the integrity \nof our democracy and the functioning of our constitutional government.\n\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, people get it. A recent poll there \ndone by Marquette University showed a majority of the people believe \nthat the Senate should hold hearings and a vote on a nominee this year. \nA majority of Wisconsinites also said they believe that leaving this \nseat on our highest Court vacant for more than a year will hurt the \nU.S. Supreme Court's ability to do its job. They are right, and their \nmessage to Washington and the Republican majority is simple: Do your \njob so the Supreme Court can do its job on behalf of all of the \nAmerican people. The American people deserve better than a long-term \nvacancy that could jeopardize the administration of justice across our \nwhole country.\n  So I call on my colleagues to join together on behalf of the American \npeople to fulfill our constitutional obligation of restoring the U.S. \nSupreme Court to its full strength.\n  In the spirit of cooperation, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I call \non Senate Republicans to end their partisan obstruction and do their \njobs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1447-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1447-S1448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRAGEDY IN KANSAS AND IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I wish to address the Senate in regard to \na terrible tragedy that has occurred in our State. I start with the \npremise that our immigration system is terribly broken and the \nconsequences of flawed immigration policies exhibit themselves across \nour society. It is hard to understand why nothing has been done to \naddress certain obviously dangerous vulnerabilities and specific \nproblems that put American lives at risk.\n  Sanctuary city policies and indifference about prosecution of illegal \nimmigrants arrested for dangerous crimes and the tolerance of \nbureaucratic redtape by the administration all contribute to a \ndangerous degrading of the criminal justice system. The failure to \naddress illegal immigration at all levels of government has been \naccounted for in lost lives.\n  Sometimes a government failure is just annoying. Sometimes it is \ndeadly. Decades of broken immigration policy contributed to the \nsituation that led to the murder of four people in Kansas and another \nin Missouri. The victims are Michael Capps, 41 years old, Jake Waters, \n36 years old, Clint Harter, 27 years old, and Austin Harter, 29 years \nold, all of Kansas City, KS, and Randy Nordman, 49 years old, of New \nFlorence, MO. The man suspected of taking these lives is an illegal \nimmigrant--a\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nman who has unlawfully entered the United States three times. He has \nbeen arrested over and over. He has repeatedly demonstrated that he is \na serious threat. Yet, despite these red flags, the system failed, and \nthis man was free and able to commit these barbaric acts.\n  The extent of the systemic breakdown in this case is sickening. How \ncriminal suspects unlawfully in the country are processed is a failure. \nThe policies are terribly ineffective. In the current system, justice \nis delayed by bureaucracy or obstructed, in some cases, amazingly, by \ndesign. A broken system--some people prefer it that way and work to \nmake it so. Others simply permit it to persist. Regardless, this has \nresulted in horrific crimes.\n  Sanctuary city policies and the laws that enable them must be fixed \nbefore the unnecessary loss of innocent life happens again. Failure to \ndo so only allows more crimes like these murders and the spree of \ncriminal behavior that preceded them.\n  Congress needs to act now. The President needs to act now. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security needs to act now. Local governments and \nlaw enforcement agencies need to act now.\n  The Senate's attempt to do just that has been stymied, but we must \nnot give up on an effort to secure our Nation and protect Americans \nfrom harm. Failure to address these problems will only make the \nproblems worse and will make them more difficult to solve later. \nContinuing the status quo means empowering career offenders, \nincentivizing law-evading behavior, impeding the prosecution of crime, \nand releasing dangerous and habitually unlawful individuals who have no \nplace in our communities.\n  The victims of crime like last week's horrors in Kansas City have \nbeen failed by their communities and by their political leaders. \nAmericans and our communities will continue to pay the price for the \nfailure of our immigration system and the refusal of policymakers to \nwork together to fix it.\n  Americans and their families will continue to pay--hopefully not \nagain in the loss of life, but how can we guarantee that? We must act \nquickly. We must act now to correct these immediate problems, improve \nour Nation's broken immigration policies and laws, and stop the \nterrible consequences.\n  The loss of life is a terrible thing, and probably in this \ncircumstance had no reason to happen, would not have happened if jobs \nhad been done.\n  Kansans, Kansas families, Americans, American families deserve much, \nmuch better. These victims and their families--we honor them today, we \noffer our condolences and provide our sympathies--but these individuals \nand their families deserved better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1448-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1448-S1449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOMINATION OF JOHN KING\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nJohn King to be Secretary of Education.\n  Dr. King has impressive credentials and an inspiring personal story. \nI have had the opportunity to meet with him and discuss his leadership \nand his view of the law.\n  I shared with Dr. King that in the view of many legal experts and \nschool officials across the country, the Department of Education has \nbeen bullying schools to comply with policies that simply do not have \nthe force of law. This coercive use of power, however well intentioned, \nis wrong and it is unlawful.\n  Leadership requires making sure that those serving within the \nDepartment conduct themselves in full compliance with the law.\n  I have an obligation to the people of Oklahoma to ensure that the \nPresident's nominees adhere to the law. Regrettably, Dr. King has \nrefused to commit to stopping these regulatory abuses if he were \nconfirmed. For that reason, I will oppose his nomination today.\n  For far too long we have witnessed executive overreach in this \nadministration. From the Clean Power Plan to waters of the United \nStates, Federal departments and agencies have usurped the power to \ninvent law with increasing boldness. The Department of Education \noverreach is similar in this kind.\n  Instead of promulgating rules that conflict with congressional \nintent, the Department of Education is skirting the rulemaking process \naltogether by issuing guidance documents they call Dear Colleague \nletters. Guidance documents cannot and do not have the force of law. \nGuidance documents may only interpret existing obligations found in \nstatute or regulation.\n  Some agencies complain that the rulemaking process is too long and it \nrequires too much public input, so it is easier just to say that the \nnew rule simply interprets an existing rule, and then skip the \ncompliance with the Administrative Procedures Act that is required for \na new rule. It is complete irony that agencies see regulatory \ncompliance as too burdensome, so they impose new regulatory guidance on \nStates, local governments, tribes, and private institutions at a faster \npace, and those institutions have no way to fight the rules--only \ncomply.\n  Let me give an example from the Department of Education's Office of \nCivil Rights. They have a great responsibility to promote our shared \nAmerican values of equal opportunity, ensuring gender equality, and to \nwork with federally funded schools to prohibit sexual harassment and \nsexual violence. As the father of two daughters, I fully support the \nobjectives of Title IX and condemn all forms of sexual discrimination.\n  But the Office of Civil Rights enforcement authority comes from Title \nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bill, and those Office of Civil \nRights Dear Colleague letters that are now being put out there \nsupposedly notify schools of their obligations under Title IX.\n  Two of the Office of Civil Rights Dear Colleagues letters \nsignificantly expand school liability by prescribing policies required \nneither by Title IX nor by OCR's regulations. I am particularly \nconcerned with OCR's 2010 Dear Colleague letter on harassment and \nbullying and a 2011 letter on sexual violence.\n  These letters respectively prohibit conduct and require procedures \nnot required by law. For example, the 2010 letter says that making \nsexual jokes or distributing sexually explicit pictures or creating \nemails or Web sites of a sexual nature can be actionable under Title \nIX. Well, regardless of what one personally thinks about abhorrent \nthings like what I have just described, the First Amendment protects \nall forms of speech, and no part of our Federal Government can dictate \nwhat is said and not allowed to be said on a university campus. The \n2010 letter leaves schools to wonder whether they should police certain \nspeech on their campus or fear a Title IX investigation.\n  The 2011 letter requires schools to change their Title IX \ndisciplinary procedures to require what is called a preponderance-of-\nthe-evidence standard of proof. This means that the decisionmaker is 51 \npercent sure a student committed an act of sexual assault or sexual \nviolence. But the Office of Civil Rights doesn't require many due \nprocess protections for the accused that he or she would enjoy being \nprovided in a court of law.\n  The Office of Civil Rights said it was merely interpreting the \n``equitable resolution'' standard that is in the law. So it changed, \ncreating a new standard and saying it is just interpreting some \nequitable standard that is in the law--a standard that no other \nadministration has ever applied.\n  If these policies had been subjected to notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, I wouldn't be standing here today. When agencies follow the \nlaw, notice and comment allows for public input and leads to better \nregulatory outcomes.\n  But universities never got that chance. So on January 7, 2016, I \nasked the Department of Education a simple question: From where in the \ntext do you derive this new authority? Where is it in the law that you \ncreated this new policy? Because the Department of Education can't \ncreate a new law; they can simply promulgate rules from existing law. \nThat is a pretty basic question: Where did it come from in the law?\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Education did not answer my \nquestion. They sent me a letter back, but in their response they \ninsisted that they have the authority to issue guidance under Title IX \nand cited general abilities in the statute. They also cited prior \nguidance documents, which are also not legal documents. You can't\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nmake a new guidance off of old guidance documents.\n  So on March 24, 2016, I replied back to them, pointing out that the \n2010 and 2011 letters did, in fact, create new policy. In my reply, I \nalso expressed concern over the reliance by the Office of Civil Rights \non letters of findings to support their policy requiring the \npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard. But these letters are not \nbinding on other schools, either. In fact, they show that the Office \nfor Civil Rights looks to and has enforced these policies enumerated \nonly in ``Dear Colleague'' letters across the country.\n\n  Legal scholars at Harvard Law and Penn Law have argued that the \nOffice for Civil Rights' sexual harassment policy was ``inconsistent \nwith the most basic principles we teach.'' Title IX was not written and \nhas never been said to imperil these ``basic principles,'' as the \nprofessors pointed out, which include free speech, due process, and \nadherence to good administrative procedures. To me, this is evidence \nthat the ``Dear Colleague'' letters changed the application of title IX \nand its regulatory landscape in fundamental ways. These policy changes \nshould be subject to rulemaking process, not just inventing new \nguidelines.\n  Other prominent voices have also stated their concerns with the \nsubstance of and the manner in which the guidance documents were \nissued. Take, for example, the director of the civil liberties-minded \nFoundation for Individual Rights and Education, known as FIRE, who \nstated that ``OCR has consistently avoided giving real answers to \nquestions about its power to issue regulations outside the bounds of \nthe law. It cannot avoid accountability forever.''\n  An analysis from Inside Higher Ed, a respected news outlet for the \npostsecondary education community, stated:\n\n       Last week, the Department clarified in a letter . . . that \n     the Dear Colleague letter acts only as a guidance for college \n     and does not ``carry the force of law.'' But many college \n     presidents and lawyers argue that the Department's Office for \n     Civil Rights treats the guidance far more than as a series of \n     recommendations. Instead, they say, OCR uses the letter to \n     determine which colleges are in violation of Title IX and to \n     threaten the federal funding of those that don't follow every \n     suggestion. Some Department officials have recently said \n     there are clear ``musts'' and clear ``shoulds'' in the \n     guidance, though colleges say the Office for Civil Rights \n     does not seem to clearly differentiate between the two. \n     Attempts to clarify which parts of the letter should be read \n     as hard regulations and which should be considered \n     recommendations have only led to more confusion and \n     frustration.\n\n  That from this well-respected entity.\n  The publication also quotes Terry Hartle of the American Council on \nEducation saying that ``the department's political leadership can say \nor write whatever they want, but where the rubber meets the road is \nwhere the Office for Civil Rights shows up to investigate cases on \ncampus, and in those cases they consistently treat every single word of \nthe guidance as an absolute mandate.''\n  Kent Talbert, a lawyer who served as general counsel at the \nDepartment of Education from 2006 until 2009, went on the record to say \nthat the response to my letter that I got back from Dr. King and from \nthe Department of Education ``glosses over'' concerns regarding whether \nthe Department circumvented notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  Hans Bader, another former attorney in the Office for Civil Rights, \ncharacterized OCR's response as a ``question-begging rationalization'' \nthat did not ``address the criticisms . . . made by many lawyers and \nlaw professors.'' Mr. Bader went on to say that ``the 2011 Dear \nColleague letter that was the subject of Senator Lankford's questions \nis just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Education \nDepartment imposing new legal rules out of thin air, without codifying \nthem in the Code of Federal Regulations, or complying with the notice-\nand-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.''\n  Commentator George Will penned an op-ed on the same issue as my \nletter, and he said that when the Department argues ``its `guidance' \nletters do not have the force of law--it's a distinction without a \ndifference.''\n  Last week in my conversations with Dr. King about the Department of \nEducation's practice of issuing guidance in lieu of rulemaking as \nrequired by law, he stated that if a school has a problem, they can \nchallenge the Department in court, basically saying: If the schools \nhave a problem with our guidance, they can sue us.\n  Were the Office for Civil Rights to take adverse action against a \nschool for failure to comply with the guidance documents and if that \nschool fought back in court, I believe that school would prevail. In \nfact, the legislative and policy director for FIRE said that \ninstitutions ``would be on very solid ground in challenging OCR because \nOCR's statements and policies clearly skirted the notice-and-comment \nrequirements.'' But you tell me what school would have an incentive to \naccept the existential threat that litigation poses to their university \nwhen they file suit against the Office for Civil Rights? They risk \nreputational harm, legal penalties, and recision of Federal funding, \nall because the OCR thinks no one would actually sue them. Many schools \ndecide the risk is not worth the reward, and the Department of \nEducation knows it.\n  While individual companies or entire industries can and often do \nfight back against regulatory overreach from the Department of Labor or \nEPA, the Department of Education is in a position to hold Federal \nfunding ransom if universities don't comply with its policies even when \nthose policies are unlawful abuses of regulatory power. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Just because we share an objective of equality and school safety \ndoesn't mean we can turn a blind eye to a Federal department running \nroughshod over the very regulatory process we require. Here the ends \ncertainly do not justify the means, and schools and the very students \nwe want to protect suffer as a result.\n  I do want to stress that I admire Dr. King's dedication to bettering \nour Nation's schools. All Americans are undoubtedly enriched by \ncontributions made by such conscientious and exceptional educators. I \nthank him for his previous time of service, which is an impressive \nrecord.\n  Likewise, I appreciate that these guidance documents predate Dr. \nKing's service at the Department and that he had no role in overseeing \ntheir development or issuance, but when asked to reexamine them and the \nprocess of how they were created, he protected them instead of \nacknowledging the problem with the process. That tells me there are \nmore ``Dear Colleague'' letters coming to our schools, and this agency \nwill continue to make up the rules in a vacuum and threaten Federal \nfunding for those who dare not comply.\n  As part of my continuing discussions with the Office for Civil \nRights, the Department has assured me they will take steps to clarify \nthe interpretive role of guidance, increase transparency, and enhance \nopportunity for public input. I am encouraged that the Office for Civil \nRights has committed to these improvements, and I look forward to a \ncontinued discussion on how better guidance practices, both in the \nOffice for Civil Rights and across the entire government, can actually \noccur. Unfortunately, these proposals don't answer the questions I have \nasked Dr. King, nor do they in any way address the fundamental problems \nwith the 2010 or 2011 ``Dear Colleague'' letters or the Office for \nCivil Rights' broader practice of issuing guidance in lieu of \nrulemaking. Because I have not received a full answer to the questions \nI asked the Department and because Dr. King does not acknowledge that \nthis overreach is even occurring within the agency he is nominated to \nlead, I have no choice but to oppose his nomination today.\n  Time will tell whether this Department of Education is about to take \na new direction with new leadership or whether they will continue the \nsame path of coercive overreach they have already been on. This needs \nto stop. The American people require a voice in the rulemaking process, \nand I hope this can press on today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1449-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1449-S1450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Illegal Immigration\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, last Thursday the Democratic candidates \nfor President had a debate. They made several extremely irresponsible \nstatements about immigration policy. I oppose their calls to reward \nmass illegal immigration with blanket amnesty, which would undermine \nthe rule of law, cost Americans jobs, drive down wages for working \nAmericans, and invite more illegal immigration.\n  But what must President Obama think? After all, he has attempted to \ngrant amnesty by fiat to over 5 million illegal immigrants, although \nthe courts have blocked most of those amnesties for now. Yet the \nSenator from Vermont and Hillary Clinton both insisted that the \nPresident hadn't gone far enough. They would expand on his actions and \ngo even further. In fact, a debate moderator called President Obama \n``the deporter in chief,'' and Hillary Clinton tacitly accepted the \ncharacterization, saying she wouldn't deport nearly as many illegal \nimmigrants as President Obama has--which of course isn't a terribly \nhigh bar to clear since deportations are down 42 percent since the \nstart of President Obama's second term and last year deportations hit a \n10-year low. Still, I can't imagine President Obama is too pleased with \nhis would-be successor.\n  I also can't imagine a more opportunist and irresponsible position \nthan the one taken by Hillary Clinton. As she panders for votes, she \nlimited deportation priorities to violent criminals and terrorists. \nApparently, Secretary Clinton will welcome con artists, identity \nthieves, and other nonviolent criminal illegal immigrants with \noutstretched arms into our country.\n  Even more astonishing, she stated unequivocally, ``I will not deport \nchildren. I would not deport children.'' As I stated, this is pure \nopportunism. For instance, I imagine this child shown in this poster \nwould have liked Secretary Clinton's policy to have been in effect \nduring her husband's administration. This is the famous picture of \nElian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy who reached our shores despite \nhis mother tragically dying at sea. Elian's U.S.-based family pleaded \nwith the Clinton administration to grant him asylum, as was our common \ncustom for refugees from communism, but President Clinton rejected \nthose pleas, siding with the Castros. Federal agents stormed the \nprivate residence and apprehended Elian at gunpoint. Where was \nSecretary Clinton? I guess she didn't have a no-kids policy back then. \nBut we don't have to guess. The then-First Lady was campaigning for \nSenate in New York. She opposed congressional action to protect Elian \nand advocated returning the boy to Cuba--contrary to a decades-long \nbipartisan consensus that we should grant safe harbor to refugees from \ntotalitarian Communist states.\n  Yet, the sad story of Elian Gonzalez isn't the most recent or harmful \nexample of her opportunism. Just two summers ago, our country faced a \nmigrant crisis on our southern border. Nearly 140,000 people--about \nhalf of them unaccompanied kids--poured across our border. Notably, \nmost did not flee from the Border Patrol or try to avoid capture; on \nthe contrary, they ran to U.S. border agents.\n  Why would brandnew illegal immigrants, having successfully crossed \nour border, turn themselves in? The answer is simple: They have been \nled to believe they would be allowed to stay.\n  From the multiple administration memos instructing agents not to \nfully enforce immigration law to President Obama's unlawful Executive \namnesties, to the Senate's own amnesty legislation, every signal from \nWashington said our political class lacked the willpower to secure our \nborders and enforce our immigration laws in the country's interior.\n  Some might say these policies and proposals wouldn't have covered the \nnewly arrived immigrants; that they would have faced deportation. \nPerhaps, but what they signaled was a complete unwillingness to enforce \nour immigration laws, just as amnesty granted in 1986 invited another \ngeneration of illegal immigrants to migrate to our country and wait for \nthe next amnesty.\n  These policies certainly gave the human traffickers who transported \nand abused these kids plenty of grounds to tell desperate parents: Send \nyour kid north with me, and he will get a permiso. In the end, they \nweren't wrong. Nearly 2 years later, only a very tiny minority of \nunaccompanied children have been deported. In fact, more than 111,000 \nunaccompanied minors entered the United States illegally from 2011 to \n2015, but only 6 percent have been returned to their home countries. \nYes, some may have received a deportation order from a court--usually \nafter failing to appear for a hearing. Yet the Obama administration has \nmade little to no effort to locate them.\n  Therefore, it is fair to say the human traffickers, the so-called \ncoyotes, weren't wrong, and many Central American parents took an \nunderstandable risk. After all, a life in America in the shadows--as \nadvocates for amnesty and open borders call it--may be preferable to \npoverty and violence back home. While these factors may have been the \npush factors in the migrant crisis, there can be no doubt that the pull \nfactors of amnesty, deferred action, nonenforcement, economic \nopportunity, and safety were just as strong, if not stronger.\n  That is why even the Obama administration tried to address them. \nPresident Obama met with leaders of Honduras, Guatemala, and El \nSalvador to seek their assistance. Vice President Biden flew to \nGuatemala and publicly urged parents not to believe the coyotes' \npromises of amnesty. The Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson \nwrote an open letter to Central American parents, and, yes, Hillary \nClinton got involved too. Secretary Clinton stated in 2014 that these \nchildren ``should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who \nresponsible adults in their families are.'' She insisted that ``we have \nto send a clear message: Just because your child gets across the \nborder, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay.''\n  That was the right position then, and it is the right position now, \neven if real action didn't back up the Obama administration's words, \nbut that was then, and this is now, in the middle of another flailing \nPresidential campaign. Secretary Clinton now says she would not deport \nchildren under any circumstances, not even those who just arrived or \npresumably those who arrive in the future.\n  We have come to expect such opportunism from the ``House of \nClinton,'' but even worse is the irresponsibility. Put yourself in the \nposition of a desperate parent in Central America. You live in Third \nWorld conditions. Work is scarce. Food and water are a struggle. Power \ndoesn't always come on with the flip of a switch. Gangs control many of \nthe streets. Murder rates are some of the highest in the world. You \nhave every reason to try to escape these conditions or at least get \nyour kid out, but where to go?\n  You just got your answer. Hillary Clinton, one of the most famous \npeople in the world--one of only six people likely to be the next \nPresident of the United States--just broadcast new hope to the world: \nYou can come to the United States.\n  Of course, it is a peculiar kind of hope. She didn't say go to our \nEmbassy and seek asylum. She certainly didn't say get on an airplane \nand fly safely to\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\nthe United States, nor will she ever take such massively unpopular \npositions. Indeed, she essentially invited you to take a life-or-death \ngamble: If you survive the trip, you can stay.\n  How is this moral? How is it compassionate to create incentives for \nsuch reckless behavior? Hillary Clinton just created a full employment \nopportunity for human traffickers. She helped oversell illicit tickets \non this train, The Beast, a network of freight trains aboard which \nmigrants from Central America cross Mexico to the United States.\n  The Beast has another name--The Death Train. It is called that \nbecause many who ride it don't survive or, if they do, they only escape \nwith grievous injuries or after enduring physical and sexual abuse at \nthe hands of criminal gangs. With her irresponsible pandering, \nSecretary Clinton's words will help contribute to untold suffering, \npain, and death among American families.\n  Her words are equally irresponsible when looked at from the American \nperspective. Secretary Clinton's promise to deport only violent \ncriminals and no children under any circumstances will badly harm \nstruggling Americans. Decades of mass immigration has contributed to \njoblessness, stagnant wages, and communities stressed to the breaking \npoint to provide education, housing, emergency services, public safety, \nand other basic government services.\n  The coming Clinton wave of illegal immigration will only make it \nharder to secure our borders, enforce our laws, and get immigration \nunder control and working for Americans who are, after all, the people \nwe are supposed to serve.\n  The world is full of violence, oppression, corruption, and injustice. \nWe cannot turn a blind eye to this. It often has a way of arriving at \nour borders and on our shores. Similar to most Americans, my heart \nbreaks when I imagine the plight of those desperate parents in Central \nAmerica as they look upon their little ones. That is why I strongly \nsupport efforts to assist countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El \nSalvador to develop stronger institutions and improve living conditions \nthere. Many dedicated professionals in the State Department, FBI, DEA, \nSouthern Command, and other Federal agencies are there serving us--to \ndo just that.\n  At the same time, we cannot solve all the world's ills and our \nforemost responsibility is to Americans, not foreigners. We can help \nreduce the push factors in foreign countries driving migrants to our \nborders, but we are not obligated to accept their citizens into our \ncountry. On the contrary, our obligation is to protect and serve \nAmericans. To do so, we must eliminate the pull factors for these \nmigrants here at home.\n  Like any country, we have a right, indeed, we have a duty to control \nwho comes to our country and allow them here only if it is in our \nnational interests. America is a nation of immigrants, but we are also \na nation of laws. Secretary Clinton has not only displayed contempt for \nour immigration laws but also encouraged foreigners to break those \nlaws, to their own grave danger. We must say to these foreigners, \nloudly and clearly: Do not make this dangerous journey. Do not violate \nour laws. Do not come here illegally. It is the humane thing to do, and \nit is the right thing to do. Secretary Clinton should be ashamed of \nherself for doing otherwise.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to discuss the vacancy created by \nthe death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Those of us who knew \nthe late Justice well are still mourning the loss of a dear friend, and \nthe Nation is feeling the loss of one of the greatest jurists in its \nhistory. We will never find a true replacement for Justice Scalia, only \na successor to his legacy. We owe it to the late Justice's \nextraordinary legacy of service to ensure that we treat confirmation of \nhis successor properly.\n  My friends in the Democratic minority have settled upon one mantra \nabove all others in addressing this vacancy; that the Senate must ``do \nits job.'' While I have no doubt this talking point has been poll \ntested and refined to serve as the most effective political attack \npossible, the truth is that this point is completely uncontroversial. I \nhave not heard a single one of my Republican colleagues argue that the \nSenate should not do its job with respect to the Supreme Court vacancy. \nWhere we have a legitimate difference of opinion is how the Senate can \nbest do its job.\n\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution divides the appointment \nprocess into two--two--distinct roles: the power of the President to \nnominate and the power of the Senate to provide its advice and consent. \nDespite the wild claims of some of my Democratic friends to the \ncontrary, the Constitution does not define how the Senate is to go \nabout its duty to provide advice and consent. It does not dictate that \nthe Senate must hold confirmation hearings or floor votes on the \nPresident's preferred timeline. After all, how could the Constitution \nprovide such instruction if the Judiciary Committee did not come into \nexistence until 27 years after the Senate first convened in 1789? \nIndeed, the Judiciary Committee only began holding confirmation \nhearings in the past century, and nominees only began appearing before \nthe committee regularly in the past 60 years.\n  In fact, the Constitution prescribes no specific structure or \ntimeline for the confirmation process, and the Constitution's text and \nstructure, as well as longstanding historical practice, confirm that \nthe Senate has the authority to shape the confirmation process how it \nsees fit. In other words, the Senate's job is to determine the best way \nto exercise its advice and consent power in each unique situation.\n  Over the years, the Senate has considered nominations in different \nways at different times, depending on the circumstances. Consider these \nprecedents with great bearing on the current circumstances. The Senate \nhas never confirmed a nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy that opened up \nthis late in a term-limited President's time in office. This is only \nthe third vacancy in nearly a century to occur after the American \npeople had already started voting in a Presidential election. In the \nprevious two instances, in 1956 and 1968, the Senate did not confirm \nthe nominee until the following year. The only time the Senate has ever \nconfirmed a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy created after \nvoting began in a Presidential election year was in 1916, and that \nvacancy only arose when Justice Charles Evans Hughes resigned his seat \non the Court to run against incumbent President Woodrow Wilson.\n  Key Democrats have long expressed strong agreement with the decision \nto defer the confirmation process in these circumstances. For example, \nSenator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader, argued in July \n2007--with a year and a half left in President George W. Bush's term \nand with no Supreme Court seat even vacant--that the Senate ``should \nnot confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court except in \nextraordinary circumstances.'' Vice President Joe Biden argued in 1992, \nwhen he was Judiciary Committee chairman, that if a Supreme Court \nvacancy occurred in that Presidential election year, ``the Senate \nJudiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \nconfirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political \ncampaign season is over.''\n  Past practice and the well documented past positions of key Democrats \ncertainly support the notion that deferring the confirmation process is \nan option reasonably available to the Senate in certain circumstances. \nAs for its appropriateness in the present situation, one need only \nconsider how the confirmation process would be further poisoned by \nelection-year politics.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee for nearly four decades, I \nhave witnessed the judicial confirmation process become increasingly \ndivisive and sometimes--oftentimes, as a matter of fact--downright \nnasty. First came the campaigns of character assassination waged \nagainst Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Then came the\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nSenate Democrats' unprecedented filibusters of President George W. \nBush's lower court nominees. Then came the attempt to deny an up-or-\ndown vote on the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court--a \nmove supported by then-Senators Obama, Biden, Clinton, Reid, Durbin, \nSchumer, and Leahy. Finally came the unilateral use of the nuclear \noption to blow up the filibuster and pack the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals--widely considered the second most powerful court in the \nNation--with liberal judges committed to rubberstamping the President's \nagenda.\n  Those who were responsible for every single one of these major \nescalations in the so-called judicial confirmation wars have no \ncredibility to lecture anyone on what a proper confirmation process \nshould look like in this situation. For those of us who have fought \nagainst the breakdown of the confirmation process, the prospect of \nconsidering a nomination in the middle of what may be the nastiest \nelection of my lifetime could only further damage the long-term \nprospects of a healthy confirmation process. Deferring the process is \nin the best interests of the Senate, the judiciary, and the country.\n  The tenor of the debate since Justice Scalia's passing has only \nconfirmed how right we were to take a stand to defer the process until \nafter the election. For example, a speech I delivered to the Federalist \nSociety on Friday was briefly disrupted by protestors chanting ``Do \nyour job,'' ironically just as I began to explain why our approach to \nthis vacancy is the best way the Senate can indeed do its job. Now, I \ndo not mind protestors speaking their minds, but I don't appreciate it \nwhen they try to prevent others from expressing differing views. That a \nrespectful discussion among attorneys was disrupted by professional \nactivists wielding materials from Organizing for Action, a political \narm of the White House and the Democratic National Committee, \ndemonstrates what I have been saying all along: Considering a nominee \nin the midst of a Presidential election campaign would further inject \ntoxic political theater into an already politicized confirmation \nprocess.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of an article from Politico detailing the extensive \npolitical coordination between the White House and the parent \norganization of these protestors that risks turning what should be \nserious consideration of a weighty lifetime appointment into an \nelection-year political circus.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From POLITICO, Mar. 13, 2016]\n\n              White House Preps Supreme Court Battle Plan\n\n               (By Edward-Isaac Dovere and Josh Gerstein)\n\n       As soon as President Barack Obama announces a Supreme Court \n     nominee from his short list--which is now set--the White \n     House and its allies will unleash a coordinated media and \n     political blitz aimed at weakening GOP resistance to \n     confirming the president's pick.\n       Administration allies have already started putting a ground \n     game in place. Obama campaign veterans have been contracted \n     in six states--New Hampshire, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania \n     and Wisconsin, where GOP incumbents are most vulnerable, plus \n     Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley's Iowa.\n       With Republicans flatly refusing even courtesy meetings \n     with a nominee, let alone confirmation hearings, they're also \n     looking into photo ops with Senate Democrats, and could \n     pursue mock hearings or other events meant to highlight GOP \n     intransigence, according to sources familiar with the \n     planning.\n       Still, the West Wing is trying to strike a balance between \n     pushing the nominee forward to create pressure and the danger \n     of seeming to politicize the fight or accidentally straying \n     into hypothetical discussions of future court decisions.\n       Obama is expected to announce a nominee as early as this \n     week. Many believe that the choice will be one of three \n     federal appeals court judges: Sri Srinivasan, Merrick Garland \n     or Paul Watford.\n       The first calls for outside help went out from the White \n     House as soon as Antonin Scalia's death was confirmed and \n     Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ruled out \n     confirming a successor. That Thursday, senior Obama adviser \n     Valerie Jarrett and White House counsel Neil Eggleston \n     gathered in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building for a \n     larger version of their regular judicial nominations action \n     meeting, with participants including Judy Licthman of the \n     National Partnership for Women & Families, frequent White \n     House collaborator Robert Raben, People for the American Way \n     and the Leadership Conference On Civil and Human Rights. Tina \n     Tchen, chief of staff to the First Lady, also attended.\n       In follow-up conference calls and smaller meetings, a plan \n     and strategy took shape, which they agreed would be led by \n     Obama 2012 deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter, with \n     White House communications director Anita Dunn leading the \n     media plan, and recently departed legislative affairs \n     director Katie Beirne Fallon taking the lead on the Hill. The \n     following week, leaders of more of the operational groups \n     gathered in Jarrett's office for a brainstorming and \n     coordination meeting, with Eggleston and political director \n     David Simas attending. Among the outside groups that \n     attended: Center for American Progress president Neera \n     Tanden, Americans United for Change president Brad Woodhouse, \n     political consultant Bob Creamer and Patty First from the \n     Raben Group.\n       The White House is still unsure how to deploy Obama. Some \n     advisers feel like the presidential bully pulpit is the only \n     way to bring enough pressure to have a chance at making \n     Senate Republicans crack. Others have been advising that the \n     more this is about Obama, the worse their chances are, and \n     the more they can focus attention on the nominee, and his or \n     her qualifications, the better they'll do.\n       Obama's aides haven't made a final decision on the long-\n     term strategy. They're more focused for the moment on \n     finalizing plans for the roll-out, hoping to at least \n     generate some initial buzz around the nominee.\n       Outside allies are lining up progressive organizations, \n     labor leaders, women's groups and black ministers, to focus \n     attention on the battle, which is likely to drag on for \n     months. Monday morning, for example, the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights is releasing a letter \n     from law school deans pushing the Senate to act.\n       ``We are building this campaign for the long haul. Our \n     number one goal is that Senate Republicans do their job, \n     follow their Constitutional responsibility and take up the \n     president's nominee and put that person on the court,'' said \n     one of the people involved in the outside efforts. ``But if \n     they want a political fight, we're more than willing to \n     accommodate them. And if they maintain this unprecedented \n     obstruction, they can kiss their majority goodbye.''\n       Senate Democrats have been pitching in too. First up: \n     photos and video of the nominee going to meet with Democratic \n     senators on Capitol Hill, hoping will keep the nominee in the \n     news. The administration and Senate Democrats are also \n     weighing whether to stage mock hearings or other photo ops \n     highlighting the nominees inability to even talk to \n     Republicans--all in the hope of generating embarrassing \n     footage for the GOP.\n       ``Unprecedented Republican obstruction calls for an \n     unconventional response,'' is how one Senate Democratic \n     leadership aide put it.\n       Traditionally, Supreme Court nominees go completely silent \n     except for their private meetings with senators and committee \n     hearings. Though White House aides appear ready to break with \n     that tradition, they'll only go so far: the nominee won't be \n     making the rounds of Sunday talk shows, but some outside \n     advisers have pushed for more contained and scripted \n     appearances, like speeches at bar associations or law \n     schools.\n       But the White House is proceeding carefully, feeling that \n     the politics work best for them if they're able to keep the \n     focus on Republican obstructionism.\n       ``It's going to be largely about the person, so it's up to \n     us to be as serious and dogged about how we present that \n     person to the country,'' a White House aide said.\n       Top aides remain optimistic that McConnell will ease his \n     blockade, but right now there's zero indication Republicans \n     plan to back down. With that in mind, the administration is \n     prepared for the fight to become more about ramping up \n     embarrassment for Republicans up and down the ballot going \n     into November, hoping they can help elect a Democratic \n     president and more Democrats to the Senate, who would then \n     fill the seat in January.\n       Asked aboard Air Force One on Friday whether the White \n     House is prepared to have the nominee do interviews or \n     whether the president will take a more public role, White \n     House press secretary Josh Earnest said, ``it's too early to \n     say exactly how this will play out.''\n       Within the White House, the planning is being overseen by \n     Jarrett, Brian Deese, the senior adviser whom Obama tapped to \n     lead the process, and Shailagh Murray, the senior adviser and \n     former newspaper reporter who's specialized in developing \n     unconventional media strategies for this White House. White \n     House principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz has \n     become the point person for the media approach.\n       Jarrett's chief of staff, Yohannes Abraham, has been \n     organizing about 125 outside experts, including legal \n     experts, law school deans, former Supreme Court clerks, \n     officials from previous administrations, former elected \n     officials (including dozens of Republicans), civil rights \n     leaders, mayors, union officials, CEOs and environmental \n     leaders.\n       They've also convened conference calls with leaders broken \n     down by groups. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, \n     Latino, African-American, civil rights, small business, state \n     and local elected officials, academics and law school deans, \n     disability advocacy, faith, youth, labor and progressives, \n     women and lawyers.\n       ``The coordinated grassroots effort that has already proven \n     a powerful tool to put\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\n     pressure on Republicans will only ramp up,'' said Amy \n     Brundage, a former deputy communications director at the \n     White House currently helping coordinate communications for \n     the outside effort at Dunn's firm. ``That includes events in \n     targeted states with real working Americans pushing Senate \n     Republicans to do their jobs, press events with key \n     Democratic members and groups, and coordinated validator \n     pushes like those with the legal scholars, historians and \n     attorneys general.''\n       So far, the administration doesn't have a set calendar for \n     each day following the submission of the nomination, but \n     they're developing the plan to accommodate variables such as \n     who the nominee is, what that person's biography includes, \n     and what that person's current job allows for. With the short \n     list reportedly limited to sitting federal judges, there may \n     be less room to maneuver. Judges face more restrictions on \n     their activities than a practicing attorney, academic or \n     politician.\n       ``The formal ethics rules applicable to appellate court \n     judges wouldn't apply to a senator,'' said Indiana University \n     professor Charles Geyh. The standard rules for judicial \n     candidates technically don't apply to Supreme Court nominees, \n     Geyh pointed out. Strategic considerations have led recent \n     nominees to be fairly evasive about their views, but that \n     doesn't preclude trying to keep the spotlight on the \n     nomination.\n       ``I wouldn't hesitate to have cameras at the ready to the \n     extent this person is having doors slammed in his face, using \n     that as a way to embarrass the Republicans, but that's \n     different from having the nominee out there chatting about \n     what he'd do as a judge,'' Geyh said, adding that most of the \n     reticence nominees have shown in recent years ``is all \n     strategic and has nothing to do with ethics.''\n       Democrats have already been talking about holding \n     unofficial hearings on a potential nomination. Whether the \n     nominee him- or herself would attend is an open question, but \n     experts say it would also be within ethical bounds.\n       ``We're entering uncharted waters here. We've never had a \n     situation in which the party in power, in this case the \n     Republicans, were denying even a hearing to the nominee,'' \n     said Nan Aron of the liberal Alliance for Justice.\n       If the fight stretches into late summer and the Democratic \n     focus turns to an election-focused campaign, the situation \n     gets dicier. A nominee who's a sitting judge would need to \n     steer clear of events where those arguments are being made, \n     and even a non-judge would be wise to do the same.\n       Conservatives say they're bracing for an aggressive \n     campaign by the White House and Democrats who'll be looking \n     to keep the Supreme Court fight on the front burner. Already, \n     some groups have been circulating opposition research about \n     several of the potential nominees whose names have been most \n     discussed, hitting Sri Srinivasan, Jane Kelly and Ketanji \n     Jackson.\n       ``This is just going to push the boundaries,'' said veteran \n     GOP judicial nominations advocate Curt Levey, now with \n     Freedomworks. ``They can certainly make the meetings with \n     Democratic senators into a show--more of a show than it \n     normally is.''\n       The White House theory is that if there's enough pressure \n     to get Republicans to cave on a hearing, that will start the \n     ball rolling in a way that'll make winning confirmation a \n     real possibility.\n       Democrats pounced on Sen. John Cornyn's (R-Texas) promise \n     last week that the Republicans will turn Obama's nominee into \n     a pinata. That raises additional questions about who Obama \n     chooses, since the person will have to endure not just a \n     stranger than normal process, but likely a very negative one. \n     As Cornyn warned, that could be enough to make some potential \n     picks say no. If this fight goes on long enough and the \n     nominee is a judge who'll likely recuse from pending and \n     future cases, the person could be open to attacks of getting \n     paid for not working--or going back to their day job and \n     appearing to throw in the towel.\n       Levey said he expects the fight will eventually morph into \n     full-blown election politics. ``At some point this is going \n     to turn,'' Levey said. ``It may turn very quickly in terms of \n     the White House giving up whatever little hope they have.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Furthermore, Madam President, the minority leader has \nturned his daily remarks on the floor into constant diatribes against \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee. These diatribes rank among the \nmost vicious and most personal attacks I have heard on the Senate floor \nin my nearly four decades in this Senate body. Having myself served as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for more than 8 years, I know that \nthe position is no stranger to controversy and political hardball. But \nthe vile and unfair attacks on Senator Grassley's independence and work \nethic have gone too far.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Grassley for more \nthan 35 years. I know no one more committed to doing his job. Senator \nGrassley has not missed a vote in a record-setting 27 years--when he \nwas home in Iowa, touring the awful damage of the Great Flood of 1993--\nand yet still manages to hold townhall meetings in all 99 of his \nState's counties every year. He sets the gold standard of service in \nthe Senate.\n  If anyone knows his mind, it is Senator Grassley. Each of us is \nentitled to our opinions on issues that come before this body, even \ncontroversial ones, but I want to condemn in the strongest possible \nterms the notion that a difference of opinion with Senate Democrats \nmeans that Senator Grassley is compromising his own integrity or the \nindependence of the Judiciary Committee he leads. These attacks come \nvery close to impugning his character, and that sort of behavior is \nbeneath the dignity of this body.\n  The minority leader came to the floor to seize on the comments of the \nsenior Senator from Texas to manufacture what I consider to be another \ncheap political attack on the Republican majority. In those comments, \nSenator Cornyn had speculated that the election-year political \nenvironment could, unfortunately, turn any Supreme Court nominee into a \npolitical pinata. The minority leader's comments are a total \nmischaracterization of Senator Cornyn's record of fairness toward \nnominees of both parties and of Senate Republicans' intentions in this \nsituation. After all, the whole point of deferring the nomination and \nconfirmation process is to limit the mistreatment of any nominee, as \nSenator Cornyn suggested in his remarks. This unfounded accusation is \nalso deeply ironic, coming from the party that stooped to the character \nassassination of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.\n  If there is anyone who has been treated like a pinata in this debate, \nit has been Senator Grassley. Now, Chuck Grassley is as tough as they \ncome, and I have every confidence that he will weather these attacks. \nBut if these scorched-earth political tactics reflect the length some \nof the Democratic minority are prepared to go in an election-year \nconfirmation battle, there can be no better illustration of why we \nshould defer this process.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of Dr. John King to be the next Secretary of Education. \nWhile there is only 1 year left in the Obama Presidency, this is still \none of the most important jobs in Washington because the Department of \nEducation has a powerful set of tools available that it can use to \nstand up for people who are struggling with student loan debt and tools \nto help make a quality, affordable college education a reality for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Secretary of Education must be one of the most difficult jobs in \nWashington because for years there has been some kind of problem at the \nDepartment of Education that has made it practically impossible to get \nthe Department to put the interests of students ahead of the interests \nof private contractors and for-profit colleges that are making the big \nmoney off our students.\n  The Department has powerful tools to make sure that fraudulent \ncolleges aren't sucking down billions of taxpayer dollars of student \nloans. But for the most part, these tools gather dust on the shelf \nwhile shady institutions like Corinthian Colleges spend years gobbling \nup taxpayer money while they defraud their own students.\n  The Department has powerful tools to help students when they get \nripped off by fraudulent colleges. But for years, it has been like \npulling out your own teeth simply to get relief for the victims who got \ncheated by for-profit colleges like Corinthian.\n  There are literally dozens of examples of how the Department of \nEducation's trillion-dollar student loan bank has been putting profits \nfor these companies and for-profit colleges ahead of the needs of \nstudents. One of the worst has been the bank's approach to overseeing \nthe student loan servicing companies that are paid by the government to \ncollect student loan payments.\n  Consider the case of Navient, a student loan servicer that got caught \nredhanded ripping off tens of thousands of\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nactive duty members of the military. Two years ago, the Department of \nJustice and the FDIC fined the company $100 million for breaking the \nlaw and overcharging our active duty military on their student loans. \nBut the Department of Education didn't take any action against Navient. \nInstead of following the lead of the Justice Department and using the \nJustice Department's evidence--no, the Department of Education \nannounced its own separate review of whether soldiers were harmed.\n  A year later, they released their results, and notwithstanding the \nfact that Navient was already sending checks to thousands of \nservicemembers under the DOJ and FDIC agreement, the Department of \nEducation student loan bank concluded that everything was just fine, \nand the Department's bank had no need to impose any additional fines or \nrestrictions on Navient. In fact, things were so fine that the \nDepartment's bank rewarded Navient by renewing a $100 million contract.\n  If that sounds stinky to you, it should. The Department's inspector \ngeneral took a close look at what was going on over at the Department's \nbank, and 2 weeks ago they released a scathing report on the bank's \nwhitewash. The IG slammed the Department for a report that was a \ncomplete and utter mess, loaded with errors, calling for ``inconsistent \nand inadequate actions.'' The IG concluded that the Department of \nEducation's happy-face press release announcing that everything was \nfine with the servicer was ``unsupported and inaccurate.''\n  When a private company breaks the law and steals from American \nsoldiers who are literally in the field fighting overseas, those \ncompanies should be held accountable. The Justice Department held \nNavient accountable. The FDIC held Navient accountable. But the \nDepartment of Education's bank decided it was more important to protect \nNavient than to watch out for our military students.\n  Let's not mince words. The Navient fiasco is outrageous, but it is \nnot surprising. At a Senate hearing 2 years ago, I asked James Runcie, \nwho runs the Department of Education's student loan bank, how he could \nturn around and renew the contract of a company like Navient that had \njust copped to ripping off American soldiers. His answer, essentially, \nwas that moving borrowers away from Navient would simply be too \ndisruptive. Senator Harkin said at the time that sounded an awful lot \nlike too big to fail. And Senator Harkin was right. So long as that \ntheory remains the operating principle of the Department of Education, \nthe American people can forget about the law because there will be no \nreal limits on how much money big private companies and large \nfraudulent schools can steal from students and taxpayers.\n  Dr. King didn't create any of these problems. These problems have \ngrown and festered over a long time, and they won't be easy to solve. \nFor several weeks now Dr. King and I have talked about these issues, \nand I believe he understands the magnitude of the task he faces. He has \ncommitted in no uncertain terms to a top-down review of the way the \nstudent loan program is administered and the way the Department \noversees financial institutions. He has announced that he will force \nall of the major student loan servicers to review their records and \nmake refunds to all members of the military who were illegally ripped \noff. And he has embraced strong, new proposals to protect borrowers who \nare taken in by fraudulent colleges so they can get their money back.\n  These are serious steps in the right direction. For those reasons, I \nwill vote for him today, but let's be clear that this is not the end of \nthe story. Dr. King has an enormous amount of work to do to get the \nDepartment's higher education house in order, and the American people \nwill be watching closely for results.\n  One of the first things that must be done is a total reform of \nstudent loan servicing to make sure nothing like the Navient disaster \never, ever happens again. Here are five simple principles that should \nguide that reform:\n  First, put students and families first--every time, every decision. \nThe Department exists to serve students, not student loan companies. It \nis time they acted like it.\n  Second, punish bad actors. Navient broke the law and cheated \nsoldiers, but the Department bent over backward to protect them. Right \nnow Navient owes the Federal Government $22 million it stole in another \nscam, and the Department hasn't even bothered to collect it. The \nDepartment needs to show it is willing and able to punish companies \nthat break the rules, and that includes kicking them out of the student \nloan program if necessary.\n  Third, change the financial incentives for servicers. Two years ago, \nthe Department renegotiated the servicer contracts and basically ended \nup paying the companies more money for the same bad outcomes. No more. \nOur country pours millions of tax dollars into these companies, and it \nis time to leverage those dollars to make sure the companies are \nworking for students.\n  Fourth, release more data. The Department of Education adamantly \nrefuses to share basic data about the student loan program with anyone, \neven other folks within the Department of Education. That means \nnobody--nobody--can even see how this bank is being run. It is time for \nsome sunshine.\n  Fifth, take responsibility for aggressive oversight of student loan \nservicers. The Department needs to act before this problem \nmetastasizes, and when the Department doesn't have the tools to act, it \nneeds to get out of the way and let the CFPB or other Federal agencies \ndo their jobs.\n  Five simple principles. Everyone in government who is serious about \nstanding up for the tens of millions of student loan borrowers in this \ncountry should embrace them because we shouldn't be running the student \nloan program to create profits for private companies. We should run it \nfor students.\n  We are facing a crisis in higher education. Student debt is \nexploding, crushing our young people and threatening the economy. \nOpportunity is slipping away from millions of Americans. The time for \nreform is now--not in the next Presidency, not 5 years from now but \nnow. Reform starts with the Department of Education, and if he is \nconfirmed today, it is my strong hope that Dr. King will make fixing \nthese problems a top priority from his first day on the job to his last \nday on the job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, last week the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee voted to advance President Obama's \nnominee for Secretary of Education, Dr. John King. Tonight the \nnomination is set to come before the Senate not for a robust debate but \nfor a hasty vote, and by all accounts confirmation is expected.\n  I rise to oppose the nomination of Dr. King and to urge my colleagues \nto join me in voting against his confirmation as Secretary of \nEducation. I have studied Dr. King's professional record--most notably, \nhis time in New York's Department of Education. I have reviewed the \ntranscripts of his confirmation hearing. Based on the policies he has \nsupported, the bipartisan opposition he has invited throughout his \ncareer, and his uncompromising commitment to the designs of bureaucrats \nand central planners over the lived experiences of parents and \nteachers, I believe it would be a grave error for the Senate to confirm \nDr. King's nomination at this time.\n  Indeed, I believe it would be difficult for anyone to support Dr. \nKing's nomination on the basis of his record. The problem is not that \nDr. King lacks experience. On paper, you might even think that \nSecretary of Education is the natural next step in his career. After 3 \nyears as a teacher and a brief stint at managing charter schools, Dr. \nKing has risen through the ranks of the education bureaucracy, climbing \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\none political appointment to the next, but do we think that someone who \nhas spent more time in a government agency than in a classroom is best \nsuited to oversee Federal education policy? More to the point, what \nmatters aren't the jobs someone has held but the policies that person \nhas advanced. This is the problem with Dr. King's nomination.\n  Look closely at his record, especially look closely at the 3\\1/2\\ \nyears he spent as New York's education commissioner, where he forced on \nan unwilling school system unpopular Common Core curriculum and \nstandards, an inflexible testing regime, and a flawed teacher \nevaluation system.\n  All of this proves that Dr. King is the standard bearer of No Child \nLeft Behind--the discredited K-12 regime that has become synonymous \nwith dysfunctional education policy in classrooms and households all \nacross America. This is not just my opinion. It was the opinion of New \nYork's parents, teachers, legislators, school board members, and \nsuperintendents. The vast majority of them opposed and protested \nagainst Dr. King and the policies he championed while at the helm of \nthe State's education department.\n  This Congress and President Obama have promised to move Federal \neducation policy in the opposite direction established by No Child Left \nBehind. Under these circumstances, Dr. King--the embodiment of the \nfailed K-12 status quo--is not the person who should be put in charge \nof the Department of Education. If confirmed, Dr. King would serve as \nthe head of the Department of Education for 10 months, until January \n2017, when the next President is sworn into office. This may sound like \nan insignificant amount of time for a Cabinet Secretary to serve, but \nin reality the next 10 months are crucially important to the future of \nFederal education policy in America.\n  Just a few months ago, Congress passed and President Obama signed the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA--a bill that reauthorized the law \ngoverning Federal K-12 education policy. Now the Department of \nEducation will begin implementing the ESSA, which will set the course \nof the Department for years to come. So what happens over the next 10 \nmonths within the Department of Education will have sweeping, far-\nreaching consequences for America's schools, teachers, and students--\nconsequences that will affect not just the quality of education \nstudents receive as children but the quality of life available to them \nas adults.\n  One of the most serious flaws of the ESSA, and one of the primary \nreasons I voted against the bill, is that it reinforces the same K-12 \nmodel that has trapped so many kids in failing schools and confined \nAmerica's education system to a state of mediocrity for half a century. \nThis is a model that concentrates authority over education decisions in \nthe hands of Federal politicians and bureaucrats instead of parents, \nteachers, principals, and local school boards.\n  There is no government official who is granted more discretion or \nmore authority under the ESSA than the Secretary of Education. The ESSA \npurports to reduce the Federal Government's control over America's \nclassrooms by returning decisionmaking authority to parents, educators, \nand local officials. For instance, there are several provisions that \nprohibit the Secretary of Education from controlling State education \nplans or coercing States into adopting Federal standards and testing \nregimes, but when you look at the fine print, you see that in most \ncases these prohibitions against Federal overreach contain no \nenforcement mechanisms--only vague, aspirational statements encouraging \nthe Secretary to limit his own powers.\n  So the question is, If confirmed as Secretary of Education, would Dr. \nKing adhere to the spirit of the ESSA and voluntarily return \ndecisionmaking authority to parents, teachers, and local officials? \nThere is little reason to believe he would.\n  Dr. King's former boss and would-be predecessor, Arne Duncan, \ncertainly had no qualms about violating similar prohibitions against \nFederal overreach found in No Child Left Behind, nor has he shied away \nfrom advertising the fact that ESSA would function in much the same way \nas No Child Left Behind.\n  In an interview with POLITICO, Duncan discussed whether the ESSA \nwould, in fact, reduce the Federal Government's control over America's \nclassrooms. He was asked: ``How do you respond to the notion that \nyou've had your wings clipped on your way out the door?'' This was \nDuncan's response: ``Candidly, our lawyers are much smarter than many \nof the folks who were working on this bill.''\n  In other words, Congress can write whatever bill it wants, and the \nadministration's lawyers will be able to figure out a way to implement \nit according to the preferences of the Cabinet Secretaries and their \narmies of bureaucrats. This is certainly a brazen admission of \nbureaucratic arrogance by former Secretary Duncan, but it is exactly in \nline with the way Dr. King approached his job as education commissioner \nof New York just a few years ago.\n  Under Dr. King's leadership, New York became one of the first States \nto implement Common Core standards and testing requirements starting in \n2011. Dr. King was one of the only education commissioners in the \ncountry to insist on rolling out the tests before teachers had been \ngiven adequate time to adapt to the new curriculum imposed by Common \nCore. To the surprise of no one--except perhaps for Dr. King--the \nresults were a disaster.\n  The 2013 Common Core tests only widened the achievement gap and \nsparked the Opt Out movement in New York, which mobilized 65,000 \nstudents to opt out of the Common Core tests in 2014 and more than \n200,000 students to opt out in 2015. To make matters worse, around the \nsame time teachers were being forced to test their students on material \nthey hadn't been given time to incorporate into their curriculum, Dr. \nKing implemented a teacher evaluation system that relied heavily on \nthese distorted student test scores. This evaluation system was so \nunpopular that in 2014 one of New York's teachers unions called for Dr. \nKing's resignation.\n  What is most troubling about Dr. King's tenure as education \ncommissioner isn't that he centralized decisionmaking authority within \nthe State's education department, imposing one-size-fits-all policies \nacross a diverse school system. Plenty of education commissioners are \nguilty of the same, if not worse. No, the real problem with Dr. King's \nrecord is that he routinely and apparently as a matter of policy \nignored the advice and feedback of teachers, parents, principals, and \nschool board members. Even as his centrally planned house of cards was \ntumbling down around him, Dr. King stayed the course, believing against \nall evidence that when it comes to running a classroom, bureaucrats and \npoliticians know better than teachers, parents, and local school \nboards.\n  When the Senate confirms a Presidential nominee, we are doing more \nthan just approving a personnel matter; we are accepting, to a degree, \nwhat that nominee stands for. As we consider this nomination, we must \nask ourselves, what kind of policy do the American people want? What \nkind of policy do America's elementary and secondary students deserve? \nWe know that local control over K-12 and even pre-K education is more \neffective than Washington, DC's, prescriptive, heavyhanded approach \nbecause we have seen it work in communities all across the country. The \npoint isn't that there is a better way to improve America's schools but \nthat there are 50 better ways, thousands of better ways, but Washington \nis standing in the way, distrustful of any alternative to the top-down \neducation status quo. And under the leadership of Dr. King, \nWashington's outdated, conformist policies will continue to stand in \nthe way. America's students deserve better than this. The least we can \ndo is to not accept the failed status quo.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting against this \nnomination.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes before the vote, to be followed by Senator Murray for as \nmuch time as she may require, and then we will have a vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes following Senator Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has given an \nexcellent speech about why it would be a good idea to have a Republican \nPresident of the United States, but we don't have one.\n  The reason we are voting today is because we need a U.S. Education \nSecretary confirmed by and accountable to the U.S. Senate so that the \nlaw to fix No Child Left Behind will be implemented the way Congress \nwrote it.\n  In December, at the ceremony where President Obama signed the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act, the new law to fix No Child Left Behind, I urged \nthe President to send a nominee to the Senate to be the Education \nSecretary to replace Arne Duncan. Without that, we would have gone a \nwhole year without a leader of that Department confirmed by and \naccountable to the U.S. Senate. I made that recommendation to the \nPresident because this is such an important year for our 100,000 public \nschools and the 50 million students who are in those schools. We need \nan Education Secretary who is confirmed and accountable to Congress \nwhile we are implementing a law that may govern elementary and \nsecondary education for some time. I want to be sure we are working \ntogether to implement the law the way Congress wrote it. That law was \npassed with broad bipartisan support. It passed the U.S. Senate by a \nvote of 85 to 12. It passed the House of Representatives by a vote of \n359 to 64.\n  We achieved that result because, as Newsweek said, No Child Left \nBehind was a law everybody wanted fixed and fixing it was long overdue. \nGovernors, teachers, superintendents, parents, Republicans, Democrats, \nand students all wanted No Child Left Behind fixed. Not only was there \na consensus about the need to fix the law, there was a consensus about \nhow to fix it, and the consensus was this: Continue the important \nmeasures of academic progress of students, disaggregate the results of \nthose tests, report them so everyone can know how schools, teachers, \nand children are doing, but then restore to States, school districts, \nclassroom teachers, and parents the responsibility for deciding what to \ndo about those tests and about improving student achievement.\n  This new law is a dramatic change in direction for Federal education \npolicy. In short, it reverses the trend toward what had become a \nnational school board and restores to those closest to children the \nresponsibility for their well-being and academic success.\n  The Wall Street Journal called the new Every Student Succeeds Act \n``the largest devolution of federal control of schools from Washington \nback to the states in a quarter of a century.''\n  I suppose you could say it didn't go far enough, but that would be \nlike standing in Nashville and waiting 7 years to hitchhike to New York \nCity, and when somebody offers you a ride to Philadelphia, you say: I \nthink I will wait another 7 years. I think I would take the ride and \nthen see if I could get another ride to New York City, and that is what \n85 U.S. Senators thought when they voted for this.\n  There is no group more interested in restoring responsibility to \nStates than the Nation's Governors. The Governors gave our new law the \nfirst full endorsement of any piece of legislation since their \nendorsement of welfare reform 20 years ago in the U.S. Congress.\n  I believe the law can inaugurate a new era of innovation and student \nachievement by putting the responsibility for children back in the \nhands of those closest to them: the parents, classroom teachers, \nprincipals, school superintendents, school boards, and States.\n  The Senate Education Committee, which I chair and on which the \nSenator from Washington is the senior Democrat, will hold at least six \nhearings to oversee implementation of the new law. All of those \nhearings will be bipartisan, as our hearings almost always are. We \nalready held the first hearing on February 23 with representatives of \nmany of the groups who worked together to pass the law, and now they \nare working together to implement the law. They already formed a \ncoalition made up of the National Governors Association, the School \nSuperintendents Association, the National Education Association, the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National Association of State Boards of Education, \nthe National School Boards Association, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals, the National Parent Teacher Association, with the \nsupport of the Chief State School Officers.\n  They sent Dr. King a letter saying:\n\n       Although our organizations do not always agree, we are \n     unified in our belief that ESSA is an historic opportunity to \n     make a world-class 21st century education system. And we're \n     dedicated to working together at the national level to \n     facilitate partnership among our members and states and \n     districts to guarantee the success of this new law.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       That new law replaces a top-down accountability and testing \n     regime with an inclusive system based on collaborative state \n     and local innovation. For this vision to become a reality, we \n     must work together to closely honor congressional intent: \n     ESSA is clear. Education decisionmaking now rests with the \n     states and districts, and the federal role is to support and \n     inform those decisions.\n\n  You may say something different, but you are disagreeing with the \nGovernors, the school superintendents, the NEA, the AFT, the State \nlegislatures, the State boards of education, the National School Boards \nAssociation, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, \nthe National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the \nNational Parent Teacher Association.\n  Our first oversight hearing with Dr. King will be April 12.\n  Some have objected to this nomination on the grounds that Dr. King \nwas supportive of common core when he was education commissioner in New \nYork State. I want those who are worried about that to know that this \nnew law has ended what had become, in effect, a Federal common core \nmandate. More than that, it explicitly prohibits Washington, DC, from \nmandating or even incentivizing common core or any other specific \nacademic standards. That is in the law. What standards to adopt \nentirely up to States, local school boards, and classroom teachers.\n  Here is what Senator Roberts of Kansas, who wrote this part of the \nlaw, asked Dr. King at our hearing on February 25:\n\n       I know that we have differences on Common Core. I don't \n     want to get into that. But it is part of the existing \n     legislation in law. And I want to be absolutely clear, the \n     language says, no officer or an employee of the federal \n     government, including the secretary, shall attempt to \n     influence, condition, incentivize or coerce state adoption of \n     the Common Core state standards or any other academic \n     standards common to a significant number of States or \n     assessments tied to such standards.\n\n  Senator Roberts continued:\n\n       I know that we, again, have differences. But nevertheless, \n     will you give us your commitment that you will respect the \n     intent as well as the explicit binding letter of that \n     prohibition?\n\n  Dr. King said: ``Absolutely.''\n  That is why we needed a confirmation hearing. That is why we need to \nhave a confirmed Secretary of Education.\n  In my questions to Dr. King, I said this about my exchanges at an \nearlier hearing with Dr. Tony Evers, the Wisconsin State superintendent \nof public instruction, who is also the president of all the chief state \nschool officers. I said to Dr. Evers:\n\n       Do you read the new law to say that if Wisconsin wants to \n     have Common Core, which it does, I believe, that it may? If \n     it does not want to have Common Core, that it may not? That \n     if it wants part of Common Core or more than Common Core, it \n     can do that? It simply has to have challenging academic \n     standards that are aligned to the entrance requirements for \n     the public institutions of higher education in the state.\n\n  The superintendent said he agreed with that.\n  In other words, to be blunt, it doesn't really make much difference \nwhat Dr. King thinks of common core. Under the law, he doesn't have \nanything to do with it. He doesn't have anything to do with whether a \nState adopts it or whether a State chooses not to adopt it.\n  The new law also ended the practice of granting conditional waivers, \nthrough which the U.S. Department of Education has become, in effect, a \nnational school board for more than 80,000 schools in 42 States. \nGovernors have been forced to come to Washington to play ``Mother, may \nI?'' in order to put in a plan to evaluate teachers or help a low-\nperforming school, for example. That era is over. It ends the ``highly \nqualified teacher'' definition. It ends the teacher evaluation mandate. \nIt\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nends the Federal school turnaround models, Federal test-based \naccountability, and adequate yearly progress. Those decisions--after \nall the reports are made about how schools, teachers, and children are \ndoing--will be made by those closest to the children. The new law moves \ndecisions about whether schools, teachers, and students are succeeding \nor failing from Washington, DC, and back to States and communities, \nwhere those decisions belong.\n  In conclusion, please permit me to add a personal note. This day is \nactually 25 years to the day since I was confirmed as the U.S. \nEducation Secretary. I believe the Senator from Indiana was on the \nEducation Committee at that time. But here is the difference: Under a \nDemocratically controlled Senate, my nomination took 87 days from the \nday it was announced and 51 days from when the nomination was formally \nsubmitted to the Senate. Under a Republican-controlled Senate, Dr. \nKing's nomination has taken 32 days. His nomination was announced and \nformally submitted on February 11.\n  Let me conclude the way I started. The reason we are voting today is \nthat we need an Education Secretary confirmed by and accountable to the \nU.S. Senate so that the law that 85 of us voted for to fix No Child \nLeft Behind is implemented the way we wrote it. This vote is not about \nwhether one of us would have chosen Dr. King to be the Education \nSecretary. Republicans won't have the privilege of picking an Education \nSecretary until we elect a Republican President of the United States. \nWhat we need is an Education Secretary confirmed by and accountable to \nthe U.S. Senate so that the law to fix No Child Left Behind will be \nimplemented the way we wrote it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes. I conclude my remarks, but I want \nto do so with thanks to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, who \nplayed such a crucial role in passing the law fixing No Child Left \nBehind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor as well today to \nspeak in support of Dr. John King's nomination to serve as Secretary of \nEducation.\n  This is really an important time for students when it comes to early \nlearning. We have seen improvements, but we have much more to do to \nexpand access to high-quality preschool so more of our kids can start \nschool on strong footing.\n  This is a critical moment as well, as we just heard, for K-12 \neducation as schools and districts and States transition from the \nbroken No Child Left Behind to the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds \nAct that the President signed into law late last year.\n  I hear all the time from students and families who are struggling \nwith the high cost of college and the crushing burden of student debt. \nWith all of these challenges and opportunities, the Department of \nEducation will need strong leadership, and I am glad President Obama \nhas nominated Dr. John King who is currently serving as Acting \nSecretary of the Department.\n  I want to commend Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of our HELP \nCommittee, for moving forward with Dr. King's nomination in a timely \nand bipartisan manner in our committee. I also appreciate Majority \nLeader Mitch McConnell for bringing this nomination to the floor.\n  Dr. John King has a longstanding commitment to fighting for kids. \nThrough his personal background, he knows firsthand the power that \neducation can have in a student's life. He has enriched students' lives \nas a classroom teacher and as a principal. He has worked with schools \nto help close the achievement gap. And he served as the commissioner of \neducation for New York State for 4 years. No one can question his \npassion for our Nation's young people.\n  This administration has a little less than a year left in office, but \nthat is still plenty of time to make progress in several key areas, and \nthat progress is more likely with a confirmed Secretary in place at the \nDepartment.\n  In higher education, I, along with my Democratic colleagues, will \ncontinue to focus on ways to make college more affordable, reduce the \ncrushing burden of student debt that is weighing on so many families \ntoday, and continue working to fight back against the epidemic of \ncampus sexual assaults and violence.\n  I would also like to see the Department take new steps to help \nprotect students who are pursuing their degrees. As one example, \nstudents like those who went to Corinthian Colleges, have the right to \nseek loan forgiveness if they attended a school that engaged in \ndeceptive practices. I am really pleased the Department has a new \nproposal to set up a simple way for students to get relief. And all \nborrowers should receive the highest levels of customer service and \nprotections under the law, particularly our servicemembers and our \nmilitary families. This is an issue I and others have raised directly \nwith Dr. King during his confirmation and one where we are finally \nseeing the administration make progress.\n  The role of Education Secretary has become especially important as \nthe Department begins implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act. I \nexpect the Department to use its full authority under the Every Student \nSucceeds Act to hold our schools and States accountable, to help reduce \nthe reliance on redundant and unnecessary testing, and to expand access \nto high-quality preschool.\n  A good education can be a powerful driving force for success in our \ncountry and help more families live out the American dream. That is \nwhat makes education such a vital piece of our work to help our economy \ngrow from the middle out, not from the top down. I hope to partner with \nDr. King as Secretary of Education to work toward that shared goal.\n  I urge all of our colleagues today to support his nomination.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the King nomination?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I would like to say a word to Senators \nabout our colleague currently in the chair. He has just passed an \nimportant milestone. He has now presided over the Senate for 100 hours. \nWe all know what that means. He will be receiving the Golden Gavel, and \nI look forward to presenting it to him tomorrow.\n  Presiding over the Senate may not seem the most glamorous job around \nhere to some people, but it is an important one. You learn a lot about \nprocedure, you learn a lot about your colleagues, and because the use \nof electronic devices is prohibited, you rediscover the lost art of \ncommunicating with a pen and a piece of paper. I think we could all \nstand to benefit from that kind of practice.\n  Today's Golden Gavel recipient often dashes off notes for pages to \nbring to his staff while in the chair, and because today's Golden Gavel \nrecipient is a doctor, it also takes his staff about 3 hours to \ndecipher each of the notes he writes.\n  Here is the bottom line for our friend from Louisiana. Being in the \nchair reminds him of all the history in this Chamber. It brings to mind \nthe many important decisions that have been made here over the years, \nand it gives him perspective.\n  ``Every now and then,'' Senator Cassidy says, he likes to just ``soak \nup the moment.'' I hope he will take the opportunity to do so now. He \nis the first Member of the class of 2014 to earn the Golden Gavel \ndistinction, and all of our colleagues are pleased to acknowledge this \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1458-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL SEA GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to Sarah Root, a \nyoung woman from Iowa who had a very bright future but was taken from \nthis Earth too soon.\n  Sarah was 21 years old and just graduated from Bellevue University \nwith perfect grades. In the words of her family, ``She was full of life \nand ready to take on the world.''\n  According to a close friend of hers, Sarah was smart, outgoing, and \ndedicated to her friends and family. She embodied the words that were \ntattooed on her body: ``Live, laugh and love.''\n  The day Sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver. That \ndriver was in the country illegally. The alleged drunk driver was Edwin \nMejia, and he had a blood alcohol content of .241, three times the \nlegal limit. The driver was charged with felony motor vehicle homicide \nand operating a vehicle while intoxicated on February 3. Bail was set \nat $50,000, but he was only required to put up 10 percent. So for a \nmere $5,000, the drunk driver walked out of jail and into the shadows. \nAs Sarah's father said, after laying his daughter to rest, ``The cost \nof a bond cost less than the funeral.''\n  Those are painful words to hear, but what is more frustrating is that \nthe driver should have never been released. When local law enforcement \napparently asked the Federal Government--specifically U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement--to take custody of the person, the Federal \nGovernment declined. ICE refused to place a detainer on the driver. An \nICE spokesman stated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the \nman because\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\nhis arrest for felony motor vehicle homicide ``did not meet ICE's \nenforcement priorities.''\n  Now the Root family must face the consequences of the Federal \nGovernment's inaction while grappling with their daughter's death. It \nis difficult for the family to have closure since the man is nowhere to \nbe found. It is unknown if he is still in the United States or if he \nhas fled to his home country of Honduras, but this is not an isolated \nincident. It is business as usual in the Obama administration. Because \nof the administration's policies and carelessness, Sarah Root became \nanother victim. Once again, this case shows that there is a colossal \nand systematic breakdown of immigration enforcement thanks to the Obama \nadministration's flawed policies and lack of commitment to the rule of \nlaw.\n  Unfortunately, a talented young lady whose life was cut short, who \ndidn't have an opportunity to take on the world, is a story all too \ncommon. Under President Obama's Priority Enforcement Program, a person \nin the country illegally will only be detained or removed in a few \nlimited circumstances. Some say that nearly 90,000 undocumented \nimmigrants were released in 2015 thanks to this policy.\n  Secretary Jeh Johnson has claimed that only those who have laid down \nroots and do not have serious crimes would not be subject to removal. \nYet their words don't match up with their actions. Local law \nenforcement, such as those in Omaha, NE, have asked the Federal \nGovernment to take custody of certain individuals, but the agency in \ncharge refuses. It hides behind their so-called priorities.\n  The President has a constitutional duty to ``take care that the laws \nbe faithfully executed.'' The Constitution does not say the President \nshall make a list of which criminals would be punished or removed and \nwhich criminals may go about their lives. The Obama administration may \nnot agree with the laws that Congress passes, but that has no bearing \non its responsibility to make sure the laws are faithfully carried out.\n  The administration claims it is well within its constitutional duties \nunder the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion. However, this \nadministration's approach of announcing its priorities and only \nenforcing the laws on individuals who fall under its priorities is both \nunusual and obviously an abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\n  This is unusual to prosecutorial discretion because prosecutors do \nnot usually announce their priorities or when they will exercise \nprosecutorial discretion. A liberal law professor and immigration \nattorney, Peter Margulies, explained that prosecutors strive ``to keep \nprospective lawbreakers in the dark.'' He explains that if prosecutors' \ndiscretion priorities are not kept secret, they ``would effectively \nlicense the wrongdoing.''\n  He then went on to give an example in the case of a burglary. He \nsaid:\n\n       When an admitted burglar is youthful and the burglar's \n     ``take'' is relatively modest, judges may not wish to \n     sentence an offender to prison, and may look with favor on a \n     plea bargain that reflects this sentiment. However, it would \n     be difficult to imagine prosecutors soliciting applications \n     from known burglars for a ``burglar's holiday'' that would \n     guarantee a specific period of immunity.\n\n  In other words, it is as ridiculous to let people contemplating \nillegally migrating to the United States know they will get a pass \nunder certain conditions as it would be to let people contemplating \nburglary know they would be let off the hook if they met certain \nqualifiers.\n  Consider the drunk driver who killed Sarah Root. What message does \nthis send to people who make a conscious decision to get behind the \nwheel after drinking? What this case says is that drunk driving--unless \nconvicted--is not a serious enough offense to force removal \nproceedings. This is moral hazard. Hence, this administration's \nPriority Enforcement Program is creating a moral hazard and given \nlicense to illegal activities.\n  Sarah Root is one of many victims in the past few weeks who died at \nthe hands of undocumented immigrants. In Louisville, KY, Chelsea Hogue \nwas put into a coma when Jose Aguilar, an undocumented person, hit her \nwhile driving under the influence of alcohol. ICE issued a detainer and \ndid not take custody of Aguilar but released him a day later, again \nbecause he had ``no prior significant misdemeanor or felony \nconviction.''\n  Then there is Esmid Pedraza, who had been transferred to ICE in \nAugust of 2013 after serving time for driving under the influence. \nHowever, he was let go on bond because of limited detention space. This \nis what ICE said at that particular time:\n\n       Due to limited availability of detention space, ICE \n     prioritizes the use of its immigration detention beds for \n     convicted felons, known gang members, and other individuals \n     whose conviction records indicate they pose a likely threat \n     to public safety.\n\n  This is ironic, given that the administration has failed to live up \nto the mandated detention bed limit that Congress sets every year.\n  Just a little over 2 years after his drunk driving offense, Pedraza \nwas charged with the murder of his girlfriend Stacey Aguilar. Then on \nMarch 8, an individual illegally present in the United States allegedly \nmurdered five people in Kansas and Missouri. The suspect entered the \ncountry in 1993, committed a series of crimes, and was removed from the \nUnited States in 2004. He attempted to illegally enter again the same \nmonth but was given ``voluntary return.'' However, he returned at some \npoint and continued his criminal ways. The suspect had been arrested \nand charged with numerous crimes, including communicating a threat with \nintent to terrorize; battery of a spouse; several driving without a \nlicense offenses; a subsequent felony conviction for communicating a \nthreat with intent to terrorize, reportedly based on his threat to kill \nhis wife with a rifle, for which he was sentenced to incarceration for \n2 years; two arrests for driving under the influence, which produced \none conviction; and a conviction for domestic battery.\n  On at least two occasions, ICE was notified of the suspect but, for \nvarious reasons, did not take custody of that person. That was a major \nfailure between the Feds and local law enforcement.\n  People are illegally entering the country, being removed, entering \nagain, and committing more crimes. Illegal reentries are happening \nbecause there are no consequences. That is what happened in Kate \nSteinle's death, and that is why we need to move to what is called \nKate's Law. That bill would deter people from illegally reentering by \nenhancing penalties and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences \nfor certain individuals with previous felony convictions.\n  The Obama administration cannot continue to turn a blind eye to \nsanctuary communities and ignore those who have broken our laws by \nillegally crossing the border time and again.\n  How many more people have to die? How many more women--like Kate \nSteinle, Sarah Root, Chelsea Hogue, and Stacey Aguilar--are going to be \ntaken from their families and friends? The parents of these young women \nare grieving today, yet their stories fall on deaf ears at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Things have to change. The President must rethink his policies and \nmust find a way to ensure that criminal immigrants are taken off the \nstreets. The Obama administration should try enforcing the law, instead \nof its priorities, for the sake of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford).

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the extraordinary \nwork of United States Capitol Police Chief Kim C. Dine, who served with \ndistinction for more than 3 years with the department.\n  Chief Dine, who has over 40 years of distinguished service in the \nfield of law enforcement, was sworn in as the eighth chief of police of \nthe United States Capitol Police in December 2012. As chief, he \ncommanded a force of nearly 2,000 sworn and civilian personnel who \nprovide comprehensive law enforcement, security, and protective \noperations services for the U.S. Congress, its staff, and more than 11 \nmillion annual visitors. Chief Dine also served as an ex-officio member \nof the Capitol Police Board.\n  Chief Dine's outstanding dedication to duty shined during a tenure \nthat included a Presidential inauguration, the historic visit of Pope \nFrancis, hundreds of protests, and four State of the Union addresses, \nas well as overseeing the department's strategic plan update. Chief \nDine also oversaw other important events such as the 2013 Ricin \nincident, Memorial Day and July Fourth concerts, the annual National \nPeace Officers Memorial Service, the implementation of a new radio \nsystem, and the tragic line-of-duty death of Sergeant Clinton Holtz.\n  Chief Dine's outstanding policing career began in 1975 at the \nMetropolitan Police Department, MPD, in Washington, DC, where he spent \n27 years, rising through the ranks to an appointment as an assistant \nchief of police. During his MPD career, Chief Dine worked in many \ndiverse neighborhoods across Washington, DC, as well as serving in a \nbroad range of organizational assignments throughout the agency, \ngaining expertise in critical aspects of policing and crime reduction \nstrategies. His accomplishments included building community coalitions, \nhoning community policing strategies, developing juvenile crime \nprevention programs, and initiating use of force training and internal \ninvestigations.\n  During his tenure as MPD's First District commander--an area \nencompassing Capitol Hill and downtown Washington, DC--homicides \ndeclined by 60 percent and community policing flourished. His last \nassignment as assistant chief included command over internal affairs, \nforce investigation teams, the disciplinary review division, the Office \nof Equal Employment Opportunity, and management of the memorandum of \nagreement between MPD and the U.S. Department of Justice to institute \nagencywide reforms.\n  In July 2002, Dine became the chief of police of the Frederick Police \nDepartment, FPD, in Maryland, where he served as chief of police for \nover 10 years. During his tenure, he and the women and men of the FPD \nfocused on strengthening the relationship between the police and the \ncommunity, building a new strategy of community policing and \nintelligence-led policing, improving training, producing the agency's \nfirst ever strategic plan, acquiring national law enforcement \naccreditation, achieving flagship status, and aggressively using \ntechnology.\n  By outreach; marshaling and maximization of resources; acquisition \nand intelligent use of technology; extensive crime analysis; and \naggressive acquisition of grants, FPD was able to combat crime more \neffectively, build bridges with Frederick's minority communities and \ndeaf community, and make major strides in working with the mental \nhealth community through effective partnerships to improve services and \nminimize use of force issues. Through implementation of cohesive and \nmultifaceted approaches, these efforts resulted in a 10-year record of \ncrime reduction, value-added problem solving, enhanced trust, and \ncommunication with all constituents that made meaningful strides in \nmaintaining the high quality of life and pride in Frederick--Maryland's \nsecond largest city.\n  Chief Dine holds a bachelor of arts from Washington College in \nChestertown, MD, and a master of science from American University in \nWashington, DC. Chief Dine's graduate study at American University \nincluded study abroad at the University of London Imperial College of \nScience and Technology Institute on Drugs, Crimes, and Justice in \nEngland. Chief Dine is a graduate of the FBI National Academy and a \nmember of a number of organizations, including the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and \nthe Maryland Chiefs of Police Association. He is married to a former \nNASA scientist and is the proud father of two daughters.\n  Congratulations on your retirement from public service, and we wish \nyou the very best in your future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1460-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1460-S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        EFFORTS TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OPIOID ADDICTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was disturbed to hear Senator McConnell's \nremarks on the floor last week questioning my commitment to supporting \nsurvivors of human trafficking. I think anyone who follows our efforts \nto stop this terrible crime knows the ridiculousness of that claim. I \nwas particularly surprised to hear it coming from Senator McConnell \nwho, along with Senator Grassley and other Republicans, voted against \nreauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--two watershed laws that changed the way this country \napproaches human trafficking and other violence against women.\n  I am deeply committed to supporting victims of crime and have been \nfor my entire career. I started out as a prosecutor, and I have never \nforgotten the terrible crime scenes I saw. Those images serve as a \nconstant reminder of how important it is to do all we can to support \nsurvivors and their families. And those efforts must include a \ncommitment to providing real money--not just lip service--to support \nsurvivors as they rebuild their lives.\n  That is why last Congress, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nled the effort to reauthorize the landmark Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act. That historic, bipartisan legislation--and the funds it \nauthorized--signaled our country's commitment to ending all forms of \nhuman trafficking, both here at home and around the world. I also led \nthe effort to pass the historic Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act, \nwhich included vital updates to help women on college campuses, tribal \nlands, immigrants, and new protections for those in the LGBT community \nto ensure that every victim in need gets the lifesaving services they \ndeserve. These impactful laws were enacted 3 years ago, and they are \nmaking a real difference in peoples' lives. Senator McConnell may have \nforgotten about what we did in 2013 to greatly expand protections for \nvictims of violence, but I have not. I will continue fighting for our \nmost vulnerable populations and work across the aisle to make real \nprogress.\n  I was glad to see the Senate return its attention to the issue of \nhuman trafficking this Congress with the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, which I supported. However, the Senate should have \nalso passed my bipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking \nPrevention Act, critical legislation to prevent trafficking in the \nfirst place. That bill would authorize funding to provide shelter and \nservices for some of our most vulnerable kids, kids who are literally \nwalking prey for traffickers. Unfortunately, Senators McConnell and \nGrassley opposed that effort. Republicans cannot pretend to stand up \nfor the rights of trafficking victims while leaving these children \nbehind. They had a chance to help and they said no. That is not \nleadership.\n  Senator McConnell also suggested that I had somehow ignored the \nopioid epidemic gripping our Nation and my State of Vermont and let the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act ``languish'' in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Again, anyone who knows my record is aware of how focused I \nam on helping ensure that communities are getting the resources they \nneed to respond to this devastating problem. I have been holding Senate \nJudiciary Committee field hearings on heroin and opioid addiction since \n2008. Long before the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, \nwas introduced, I worked to deliver funding--real dollars--for \nantiheroin task forces\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\nacross the country. And when we did first introduce the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act in September 2014, I was an original \ncosponsor of that legislation and have worked tirelessly to see it \nenacted.\n  At the same time, I have worked to change the focus from imposing \nharsh and arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences on those who abuse \ndrugs to actually providing treatment. I know that bumper sticker \nslogans and the ``war on drugs'' are failed approaches.\n  It is unfortunate that Republicans in the Senate are unwilling to put \nreal money behind CARA to ensure its programs will succeed. Just last \nweek, Senator McConnell led the Republican opposition to Senator \nShaheen's amendment that would have provided emergency supplemental \nappropriations. Ending this crisis is going to cost money, and it is \ndisappointing that Senator McConnell and other Republicans are not \nwilling to dedicate the resources that are so desperately needed by law \nenforcement and health care providers throughout this county.\n  Passing one bill in one Congress is not the answer to addressing the \nvery serious problems facing our communities. It takes a sustained \ncommitment. I am proud of my record to support victims of human \ntrafficking and communities struggling to respond to the opioid \nepidemic. Unfortunately, too often, Republicans have blocked efforts to \nprovide real funding for these priorities. I will not stop working \nuntil we are able to end these scourges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1461-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     ANNIVERSARY OF ASSOCIATED LOGGING CONTRACTORS, INC., OF IDAHO\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho.\n  The Associated Logging Contractors, Inc., of Idaho, ALC, have an \nimportant voice in advocating for policies that support an essential \nsector of Idaho--the logging and wood hauling industry. Throughout the \npast 50 years since its organization, the association has worked to \nserve its purpose of ``developing programs that are instrumental in \nhelping members to reduce costs of operation and to craft creative \nsolutions to problems confronting the industry.'' ALC represents nearly \n400 independent logging contractor businesses from across Idaho.\n  From Endangered Species Act reform, to boosting rural economies, to \naddressing forest health and much more, the ALC has been involved in a \nwide range of discussions central to Idaho. I value the organization's \nand its members' input and involvement in shaping solutions to our \nnatural resources challenges. We have much work ahead, but progress is \nbeing made on public lands issues to the benefit of Idahoans and our \neconomy. Positive developments in job opportunities and more timber \nidentified for harvest for the betterment of forest health are the \nresult of the State and Federal Government working more closely with \nprivate landowners and the logging community to make progress toward \nthe removal of salvage timber from last year's fires.\n  While challenging, collaboration is working, and ALC members have \nbeen instrumental in advancing this effort. The organization has much \nto be proud of for its efforts in bringing folks together to achieve \nsolutions and working toward their implementation. Collaboration is \ndifficult but indispensable work, as it brings lasting advancements for \nhabitats, recreation, rural economies, and job production. I have \ngreatly valued ALC member's support of local collaborative efforts.\n  Congratulations to the members of the Associated General Contractors \nof Idaho on 50 years of accomplishments. Thank you for your hard work \nbuilding up our great State and Nation. I wish you all the best for \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1461-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING CASEY FAMILY PROGRAMS\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to serve as a co-chair \nof the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth. Through this caucus and from my \ntime in the Senate, I have learned about the experiences that many \nyoung people have faced when entering the foster care system. I have \nworked to help improve the system by ensuring that children are cared \nfor and that we do all we can to find them safe, loving, and permanent \nhomes. Children should grow up in families, not foster care.\n  Today, I want to pay tribute to Casey Family Programs. It is the \nNation's largest operating foundation focused exclusively on child \nwelfare. Casey is operating in Iowa and all the States to provide \nstrategic consultation, technical assistance, data analysis, and \nindependent research and evaluation. It enjoys a unique partnership \nwith the States by asking what jurisdictions hope to achieve that \nmatches the foundation's mission and working with the State in \npartnership. Casey Family Programs also provides direct service to \nchildren and families in some States, and it is committed to the goal \nthat no child will age out of their care without a caring adult by \n2017.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I value the \nresearch, data, and policy information that Casey Family program \nshares. They have done so much for States, children, and families since \ntheir inception.\n  This month, Casey Family Programs is celebrating its 50th \nAnniversary. I want to say congratulations to its board of trustees and \nleadership for working so hard to reduce the number of youth in foster \ncare.

It gives me great \npleasure to recognize his years of hard work and dedication to creating \na safe environment for the communities of Incline Village and Crystal \nBay.\n  Mr. Brown began his career in fire services 37 years ago. In 1986, he \njoined the NLTFPD as a firefighter and paramedic. Throughout his \ntenure, he worked diligently, moving up the chain of command, until he \nleft the NLTFPD to serve the Nevada Division of Forestry. He returned \nto the district in 2003, assuming the role of assistant fire chief. In \n2007, Mr. Brown was named fire chief, taking full responsibility for \nthe department and leading his colleagues in fighting fires and \nproviding emergency services. Mr. Brown commanded the department with \nover 20 years of experience as a paramedic, serving the local \ncommunities with unparalleled knowledge. His years of service in \nresponding to all types of emergency and public service situations are \ninvaluable to residents across the Lake Tahoe community. Mr. Brown \ntruly went above and beyond in his role with the NLTFPD.\n  It is the brave men and women who serve in our local fire departments \nthat help keep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put their \nlives on the line every day. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Brown \nfor his courageous contributions to the people of Lake Tahoe. His \nsacrifice and courage earn him a place among the outstanding men and \nwomen who have valiantly put their lives on the line to benefit others.\n  For the last 50 years, the NLTFPD has provided risk services to \nresidents of Incline Village and Crystal Bay. The department has three \nstations and provides two staffed ambulances and two reserve ambulances \nto address needs within the local community. All firefighters serving \nthe NLTFPD are Nevada emergency medical technicians. In addition, the \ndepartment has over 20 paramedics ready to assist at any time. This \ndepartment serves as a special resource to the community with the \nability to rescue residents in all types of scenarios, including \nemergencies in snow, water, or in backcountry, in addition to \nprotecting local residents in incidents of fire. In 1982, it also began \nproviding transportation of the sick and injured to various hospitals. \nThis department has shown unwavering dedication to keeping Nevadans of \nthis community safe. We are lucky to have had someone like Mr. Brown \nleading the way in the department's efforts.\n  Mr. Brown has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, \nand dedication to the highest standards of the NLTFPD. I am both \nhumbled and honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow \nNevadan. Today I ask all of my colleagues to join\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\nme in congratulating Mr. Brown on his retirement, and I give my deepest \nappreciation for all he has done to make Nevada a safer place. I offer \nhim my best wishes for many successful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1462-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROSSI RALENKOTTER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Rossi \nRalenkotter for his hard work and dedication to the State of Nevada. I \nwould also like to congratulate him on his induction into the Nevada \nBusiness Hall of Fame. Mr. Ralenkotter has gone above and beyond in his \nrole with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, LVCVA, \ncontributing greatly to the touristic success of our great State.\n  Mr. Ralenkotter earned his bachelor of science in marketing from \nArizona State University in 1969 and obtained his master's degree in \nbusiness administration from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in \n1971. Prior to working with LVCVA, Mr. Ralenkotter served as a first \nlieutenant in the U.S. Air Force with the 468th Medical Service Flight. \nNo words can adequately thank him for his service and sacrifices in \nprotecting our freedoms.\n  He began his career with LVCVA more than 40 years ago, starting his \nlengthy tenure as a research analyst. From there, Mr. Ralenkotter \nworked diligently, ascending the chain to the very top. He was named \nthe authority's executive vice president and senior vice president of \nmarketing before taking the role of president and CEO in 2004. As \npresident and CEO, Mr. Ralenkotter launched the LVCVA's ``What happens \nhere, stays here'' branding campaign, one of the most successful in \nNevada tourism history.\n  He also spearheaded the Las Vegas Convention Center District project, \nfurther expanding the convention center and increasing Las Vegas's \nreputation as the leading business destination in the world. He is \ntruly a role model to the local business community, going above and \nbeyond to grow Nevada tourism. As our State continues to flourish as \none of the Nation's top destinations, I remain committed to introducing \nnew policies and strengthening existing ones that positively affect \nNevada tourism. I am grateful to have allies like Mr. Ralenkotter \nworking toward a similar goal.\n  Over the past decade, Mr. Ralenkotter has been recognized for his \nefforts. He was named Co-Brand Marketer of the Year in 2004 by \nBrandweek Magazine, as one of the 25 Most Influential People in the \nMeetings Industry by Meeting News in 2005, and as Employer of the Year \nby the Employee Service Management Association in 2006. He was also \nrecognized by the International Association of Exhibitions and Events \nwith the Pinnacle Award, as well as being inducted into both the U.S. \nTravel's Hall of Leaders and the Destination Marketing Association \nInternational Hall of Fame in 2014. These awards are given to those \nindividuals who have gone to great lengths to grow business and tourism \nin their communities, and without a doubt, Mr. Ralenkotter's efforts \nmerit each one of these prestigious awards.\n  For the last 40 years, Mr. Ralenkotter has demonstrated an unwavering \ncommitment to growing Nevada's tourism industry and further \nestablishing its prestige. The State of Nevada is fortunate to have \nsomeone of such commitment working towards these goals. Today I ask all \nof my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Ralenkotter on his \ninduction into the Nevada Business Hall of Fame, and I wish him well as \nhe continues in his efforts for the Silver State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1462-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1462-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1462-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 6:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1172.

A bill to authorize the President to provide major disaster \nassistance for lead contamination of drinking water from public water \nsystems; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to address the crisis of lead \ncontamination in drinking water that we are seeing all across this \nNation. It is time for us to come together and solve these problems. We \nhave all been outraged by the crisis in Flint, where we know children \nand families are being poisoned by lead in their drinking water.\n  My colleagues from Michigan, Senators Stabenow and Peters, have an \nexcellent bipartisan bill--which Senator Inhofe and I helped to \nnegotiate--that would provide emergency relief to address this crisis. \nThe people of Flint need this relief now. So I call on any of those \nholding up this bill to get out of the way and let this legislation \npass immediately. The crisis in Flint has also brought attention to the \nbroader issue of lead in drinking water in communities throughout our \nNation.\n  I want to read to you some headlines from just the last few weeks. \nHere is one from the Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, MS: ``Pregnant women, \nkids cautioned over Jackson water, lead.'' That is February 25, 2016.\n  From Newsweek: ``With lead in the water, could Sebring, Ohio, become \nthe next Flint?'' That is January, 27, 2016.\n  From the Associated Press: ``Elevated Lead Levels Found in Newark \nSchools' Drinking Water.''\n  In Charlotte, the Charlotte Observer: ``Lead in water not confined to \nFlint.'' That is January 30, 2016.\n  Whether it is Flint, MI; Newark, NJ; Jackson, MS; or Durham, NC--or \nshall I name some places that are going to hit us--the American people \nhave a right to expect clean, safe drinking water when they turn on \ntheir faucets.\n  It is clear that this is a national crisis that demands a national \nsolution going forward. So that is why today I have introduced new \nlegislation, the Lead in Drinking Water Disaster Act. We are doing this \nbecause, should there be more Flints, we want to have a better way to \nmove forward.\n  Currently, the President can declare a major disaster for \ncatastrophes such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, \nstorms, droughts, fires, floods, and explosions. Now, sometimes those \nfires, floods, and explosions are manmade and, yet, we are able to act \nthrough FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But lead in \ndrinking water is not on the list of major disasters covered under \nFEMA's rules.\n  It is critical that future Presidents do not have their hands tied \nbecause the definition of a major disaster does not include lead in \ndrinking water. My bill ensures that a lead-contamination crisis would \nbe considered a disaster, which it clearly is.\n  Take a look at the color of the water coming out of the fountains \nhere--the faucets. Nobody could face this in their homes. You would get \nyour kids out of there so fast. Current law doesn't think this is a \ndisaster. So I think this simple way I have of moving forward should be \nattractive to colleagues. I hope they will sign on to this very simple \nbill.\n  The way it would work is that the Governor in any State that is hit \nby this would ask the President for a major disaster declaration. So \nfor all of my colleagues who feel we should process these things \nthrough the State, that is exactly what happens in my bill. If the \nPresident agrees, FEMA would provide immediate assistance to protect \nfamilies from lead in the water.\n  What we do in this legislation is we name several agencies who would \nhelp create the plan to address the emergency. It would be, in addition \nto FEMA, Health and Human Services, the EPA, and the Army Corps of \nEngineers. They would work together to create a plan to resolve the \ncrisis.\n  We can see what is happening to the kids in Flint. Instead of doing \ntheir afterschool activities--look how sweet they are--they are \ncarrying bottles of water throughout their community.\n  Look, there is no safe level of lead for children. The effects of \nexposure are generally irreversible. Lead harms the developing brains \nand nervous systems of children and babies. It can cause miscarriage, \nstillbirths, and infertility in both men and women. People with \nprolonged exposure to lead may be at risk for high blood pressure, \nheart disease, and kidney disease.\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\n  What is the extent of this problem? Millions of homes across America \nreceive water from pipes that date back to an era before scientists \nknew of the harm caused by lead exposure. While we take steps toward \ninvesting in modernizing our water infrastructure, which I hope we will \ndo as we write a new Water Resources Development Act--Senator Inhofe \nand I are very hard at work in doing just that--we also have to step in \nand help communities that are in crisis right now.\n  I want to conclude with this. Again, take a look at the drinking \nwater coming out of the tap. Would anyone in the Senate stand still for \na minute if their children or grandchildren were in a situation where \nthis was the drinking water, this was the bathing water? We know there \nis no way we would ever allow that to happen.\n  No American should ever have to drink water that puts their health \nand the health of their children at risk. I hope we take action by \npassing the emergency legislation by the Michigan Senators this week. \nThe children and families of Flint should not have to wait one more \nday.\n  After we pass that measure, which addresses itself just to Flint, MI, \nI hope we will take up my legislation to help future Presidents address \nthis public health threat, which is going to pop up all over this great \nNation of ours. We must be prepared. We cannot tie the hands of this \nPresident or any future President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Booker):\n  S. 2675. A bill to provide for the adjustment of the debts of the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to be a voice for the 3.5 million \nAmerican citizens living in Puerto Rico, the 200,000 Puerto Ricans who \nhave served in our Armed Forces in every conflict since World War I, \nand the 20,000 who currently wear the uniform and put their lives on \nthe line for our country.\n  I rise to introduce a comprehensive stability and recovery package \nthat restores fairness, ensures accountability, and gives Puerto Rico \nthe tools it needs to dig itself out of this hole. And I rise to \nimplore this Congress to act before it is too late.\n  Let me thank Senators Schumer, Brown, Warren, Cantwell, Blumenthal, \nand Booker for supporting these efforts and working so hard on behalf \nof the people of Puerto Rico. I also want to thank Congressman \nPierluisi, who coauthored the tax sections of this bill along with \nparts of the healthcare titles.\n  Finally, I want to thank Governor Padilla for his incredible \nleadership on the island and for strongly endorsing our legislation. \nThe people of Puerto Rico are fortunate to have a Governor who cares \ndeeply about their lives and is so dedicated to putting them first and \nabove politics.\n  Let me put it this bluntly: Puerto Rico is on the brink of default \nand staring into the abyss. For the better part of the past year, the \ngovernment has been compelled to take drastic and unprecedented actions \njust to avoid a total default of the central government. They have \nclosed schools and hospitals, they have laid off police officers and \nfirefighters, and they have raised taxes on businesses and individuals. \nBut all the spending cuts and tax hikes in the world will not make a \ndent in this crisis unless Puerto Rico has the ability to restructure \nits debts. That is because servicing the government's $72 billion debt \nis swallowing a massive 36 percent of the island's revenue. That is 36 \ncents of every dollar the government takes in going not to roads or \nbridges and schools but to bondholders instead. This percentage is six \ntimes the U.S. State average and simply unsustainable by any measure.\n  In fact, despite all we hear about Puerto Rico's significant annual \nbudget deficits, the island would actually be running a surplus--a \nsurplus--if it didn't have to make debt payments. Let me repeat that: \nIt would have a surplus.\n  These debt service payments act like an albatross and handcuff the \npeople of Puerto Rico, preventing them from investing in their economy. \nFewer resources for education, infrastructure, and essential services \ncause a death spiral as talented workers opt to leave the island, \nbusinesses are shuttered, and revenue drops even further. That is why \nthe first and most important step we must take is to give Puerto Rico \nthe ability to restructure its debt in an orderly fashion--a right that \nthey had at one time and that was surreptitiously stripped out. There \nis no legislative history as to why it was stripped out, but they had \nthis right. This is not novel. Our legislation would in essence do just \nthat, providing a fair and reasonable way for Puerto Rico to \nrestructure all of its debts while avoiding a costly race to the \ncourthouse that would result in years--years--of costly litigation. But \nbefore Puerto Rico can even access this authority, it needs to \naffirmatively opt in and accept the establishment of an independent \nfiscal stability and reform board and create a chief financial officer.\n  This both ensures that any restructuring plan is based on objective \nand independent analysis of the island's situation and provides \nassurances to creditors that future governments will adhere to a \nprudent long-term fiscal plan, while affirming and respecting Puerto \nRico's sovereignty.\n  Once Puerto Rico opts in, it receives an automatic 12-month stay to \ngive government officials the necessary breathing room to organize \ntheir finances and develop a sustainable 5-year fiscal plan upon which \nannual budgets and their restructuring proposal will be based.\n  Once the Governor submits a restructuring proposal, a judge selected \nby the First Circuit Court of Appeals would have to confirm that it \ncomplies with the fiscal plan, protects the rights of pensioners, and, \nif feasible, does not unduly impair general obligation bonds.\n  Our process follows precedent by giving creditors a voice and the \nability to object in court, and it ultimately gives an independent \njudge the authority to ensure that any plan is fair and reasonable. In \norder to ensure the long-term fiscal plan is followed--not just now, \nbut in the future--our legislation gives the independent board the \npower to review annual budgets and future debt issuances and to \nexercise strong oversight and transparency powers.\n  If future budgets do not comply with the fiscal plan, the board has \nthe authority to issue a vote of no confidence, which will send a \nstrong and unequivocal message to the legislature, to capital markets, \nand to the Puerto Rican people that the proposed path is unsustainable, \nwhich, in turn, will provide much needed transparency and \naccountability to the budgeting process.\n  At the same time, we are careful to affirm the fundamental pillars of \ndemocracy by making the board of, by, and for the people of Puerto \nRico. The board will consist of nine members chosen by the Governor of \nPuerto Rico, its legislature, both parties, the Supreme Court, and the \nPresident of the United States. At least six of the board members must \nbe full-time residents of Puerto Rico, at least six must have knowledge \nof its history, culture, and socioeconomics, and all members--all \nmembers--must have financial and management expertise.\n  This structure strikes the proper balance by providing strong and \nindependent oversight and accountability while still respecting the \nsovereignty and democratic rights of the people of Puerto Rico.\n  It is not a bailout--far from it, in fact. This proposal wouldn't \ncost the U.S. Treasury a penny--not a dime--and, because it is limited \nto the territories, wouldn't have a contagion effect on the broader \nmunicipal market.\n  As I have said before, giving Puerto Rico the flexibility to \nrestructure its debt is the top priority and a prerequisite for any \nlegitimate recovery plan. But it is also clear that the lack of health \ncare funding parity is adding pressure to the overall financial \nsituation as the island's health care system accounts for 20 percent of \nthe island's economy, and it is responsible for a third of its overall \ndebt burden.\n  Currently, Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program, rather than being \nreimbursed for necessary costs, is capped. Not only is it capped, it is \nset to hit a funding cliff as soon as mid-2017. When this happens, the \nisland will instead receive\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\nfunding to cover only a very small portion of its Medicaid costs, a \nburden no State could handle.\n  The second piece of our legislation fixes this by moving Puerto Rico \ntoward a Medicaid system that provides stable funding for the long \nterm. Additionally, there are several policies in Medicare that treat \nthe island differently from the rest of the Nation, leaving providers \nand seniors to face unfair penalties and low reimbursements.\n  This bill eliminates many of these discrepancies to more accurately \nalign Medicare policies in Puerto Rico with the rest of the country. As \ncitizens of the United States--and I emphasize that because sometimes \nMembers of Congress have asked me whether they need an American \npassport to go to Puerto Rico. I thought they were joking, but they \nwere serious. As citizens of the United States, it is only fair that \nPuerto Ricans be afforded the same access to care, coverage, and health \nbenefits as everyone else.\n  Finally, our legislation would incentivize Puerto Rican workers to \nenter the formal economy and give families the help they need to raise \ntheir children by providing parity to the island for the earned-income \ntax credit and child tax credit. Praised by both Republicans and \nDemocrats as one of the most effective tools to combat poverty and \nencourage workers to enter the labor market, the earned-income tax \ncredit is currently unavailable to the people of Puerto Rico. However, \nas American citizens, all it takes for a resident of Puerto Rico to \nbecome eligible for a credit is a short plane ride to Miami.\n  This is just another reason why so many Puerto Ricans have fled the \nisland and taken up residence on the mainland. It makes no sense to \nprohibit American citizens living in Puerto Rico from taking advantage \nof this important credit, especially with such a stubbornly lower labor \nparticipation rate.\n  Our legislation corrects this inequity, providing equal treatment for \nall American citizens, regardless of whether they reside in Puerto Rico \nor in the States.\n  I shouldn't need to remind this body that from the infancy of our \nNation, the people of Puerto Rico have been there for us and with us, \nand now we need to be there for them. Puerto Rico was ceded to the \nUnited States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. Less than two \ndecades later, in 1917, Congress passed the Jones-Shafroth Act, \ngranting American citizenship to the residents of the island. But even \nlong before they were granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto Ricans have had \na long and profound history of fighting on the side of America.\n  As far back as 1777, Puerto Rican ports were used by U.S. ships, \nenabling them to run British blockades and keep commerce flowing, which \nwas so crucial to the war effort. It was Puerto Rican soldiers who took \nup arms in the U.S. Civil War, defending this Nation's Capital, \nWashington, DC, from attack, and they fought in the Battle of \nFredericksburg.\n  In World War I, almost 20,000 Puerto Ricans were drafted into the \nU.S. Armed Forces. Let's not forget about the 65th Infantry Regiment, \nknown as the Borinqueneers, the segregated military unit composed \nalmost entirely of soldiers from Puerto Rico, who played a crucial and \nprominent role in World War I, World War II, and the Korean war.\n  I am proud to say that I worked with Senator Blumenthal and others to \nmake sure that the heroic Borinqueneers--the only Active-Duty \nsegregated Latino military unit in the history of the United States and \nthe last segregated unit to be deactivated--received well deserved and \nlong overdue national recognition when we passed a bill awarding these \ncourageous patriots with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest \nexpression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and \ncontributions to the United States.\n  While some might be tempted to point their finger at our brothers and \nsisters on the island and fault Puerto Rico for carrying more than $70 \nbillion in debt, I challenge my Senate colleagues to work with us on \nfinding solutions because this problem isn't going away.\n  Mark my words. If we don't act now, this crisis will explode into a \nfull-blown humanitarian catastrophe, not in a matter of decades or even \nyears but in months. In just a couple of months, they have a major \npayment they do not have the wherewithal to make.\n  We may think we will kick the ball down the road. But, no, that human \ncatastrophe is going take place in months, and we will be right back \nhere next year with the same set of problems, only far, far worse.\n  Delaying action is akin to letting an infection reach the bloodstream \nbefore seeking treatment. The longer you wait, the more painful and \nchallenging the treatment is. Puerto Rico isn't asking us to pull them \nout of this, just to give them the wherewithal to help them help \nthemselves be able to achieve the goal.\n  Let's not stand aside and do nothing while the island burns. Let's \nnot turn our backs on our friends and fellow citizens when they need us \nthe most.

(b) \n     Conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) Direct and public \n     incitement to commit genocide; (d) Attempt to commit \n     genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide.'';\n       Whereas, on July 10, 2015, Pope Francis, Supreme Pontiff of \n     the Roman Catholic Church, declared that Middle Eastern \n     Christians are facing genocide, a reality that must be \n     ``denounced'' and that ``[i]n this third world war, waged \n     piecemeal, which we are now experiencing, a form of \n     genocide--and I stress the word genocide--is taking place, \n     and it must end'';\n       Whereas a March 13, 2015, report of the United Nations \n     Committee on Human Rights prepared at the request of the \n     Government of Iraq stated that ``[e]thnic and religious \n     groups targeted by ISIL include Yezidis, Christians, Turkmen, \n     Sabea-Mandeans, Kaka`e, Kurds and Shi'a'' and that ``[i]t is \n     reasonable to conclude that some of the incidents [in Iraq in \n     2014-2015] . . . may constitute genocide'';

and\n       (C) should collaborate on the establishment and operation \n     of domestic, regional and international tribunals to punish \n     those responsible for the ongoing crimes;\n       (6) the governments of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the \n     Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Lebanese Republic, and other \n     countries are commended for having undertaken to shelter and \n     protect those fleeing the violence of the Islamic State in \n     Iraq and Syria (``ISIS'' or ``Da'esh'') and other extremists \n     until they can safely return to their homes in Iraq and \n     Syria; and\n       (7) all those who force the migration of religious \n     communities from their ancestral homelands, where they have \n     lived and practiced their faith in safety and stability for \n     hundreds of years--including specifically in the Nineveh \n     Plain, a historic heartland of Christianity in Iraq and Mount \n     Sinjar, the historic home of the Yezidis--should be tracked, \n     sanctioned, arrested, prosecuted, and punished in accordance \n     with the laws of the place where their crimes were committed \n     and under applicable international criminal statutes and \n     conventions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1467-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3450.

Mr. President, I rise to address the motion that is on \nthe floor right now, which is a motion to adopt an amendment that is \nessentially a new version of the Monsanto DARK Act. Now, DARK is an \nacronym that stands for ``Denying Americans the Right to Know.'' This \nis, by the way, an amendment that has not been seen in any committee in \nthe Senate ever.\n  We heard a lot of discussion about how we were going to have a \nprocess in this Chamber where things would be in the ordinary fashion--\ngo through the committee so it could be digested and analyzed--but \ninstead this amendment is to an underlying bill that has been ping-\nponging back and forth between the House and Senate. This legislation \nhas never been heard in committee. It was crafted over the last few \nhours. Here we are with a fundamental issue of citizens' right to know, \nand the majority leader of this Chamber has decided to bypass any \nordinary consideration to jam this through on behalf of Monsanto.\n  What is at stake here? What is citizens' right to know about? It is \nabout genetically modified or genetically engineered ingredients that \nare in their food. Across the country 90 percent of Americans want to \nhave some indication of what is in their food and whether there are GE \ningredients. They feel this is relevant to what they would like to buy. \nEven if they don't personally look it up when they buy a product, they \nfeel citizens should have a right to know. I rounded it off and said 90 \npercent, but it is actually 89 percent. The survey took place last \nfall. I believe it took place in November of 2015. This fundamental \nnotion about the right to know what is in your food transcends every \nideology in our country.\n  The Presidential primary season is going on right now, and we are \nseeing a huge range of ideologies from the left to the right on \ndisplay, but when we talk to citizens about this right to know, it \ndoesn't matter if they are Democrats, Independents, Republicans, \nrightwing Republicans or leftwing Democrats, they all come out \nessentially the same. Let's break it down by each party. Democrats are \nat 9 to 1, or 92 percent; Republicans are at 84 percent, which rounds \nout to about 8\\1/2\\ Republicans to 1 Republican. It is a huge ratio. \nIndependents are 9 to 1, or 89 percent. When asked if they feel \nstrongly about this, they say, yes, they do feel strongly about this. \nThat just goes to the fundamental notion that here in America citizens \nbelieve they have the right to make up their own minds and not have the \noverreach of the Federal Government telling them what to believe or the \ngovernment saying: You can't have the information you want in order to \nmake your decision as a consumer. Citizens resent that. Citizens get \nangry about that. Yet right now the majority party in this Chamber is \ntrying to push through just such a repression of a citizen's right to \nknow.\n  This has been triggered by a law in Vermont. Citizens in Vermont \nvoted and decided they want to know if their food has GE, genetically \nengineered, ingredients, and that law goes into effect on July 1 of \nthis year. Our big food industry--Monsanto and friends--said: No, we \ncan't let the citizens of Vermont have the information they want. We \nmust pass a Federal law to stop them. By the way, we need to stop every \nother State in the United States of America and every other subdivision \nof any State in the United States of America from providing this \ninformation, which 9 out of 10 Americans want to have listed on their \nfood.\n  We are all acquainted with labels on food. That is not something new. \nSome citizens look at it to determine how many calories are in the \nfood. Others look at what vitamins may be in the food or if it meets \nthe daily recommended dose of vitamins. Some go to see if it has a form \nof cornstarch, corn sugar, or high fructose corn syrup that maybe they \nlike or don't like.\n  We also have labeling laws about other things consumers care about on \ntheir food. If you sell fish in a grocery store in America, you have to \ntell the consumer whether that fish has been caught in the wild or \nwhether it has been raised on a farm. Why? Because citizens wanted that \ninformation. They considered that relevant to their decision about \ntheir purchase of foods for themselves and their families.\n  Let's consider the fact that here in America if you put juice in a \nstore, you have to say whether it is made from concentrate or whether \nit is fresh. Why? Because consumers thought that was relevant to how \nthey would like to exercise their judgment. Well, 9 out of 10 Americans \nsay they want the information on whether there are GE ingredients, but \nnow we have this bill on the floor--this Monsanto DARK Act addition \n2.0--that says, no, we are going to\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\ntake away that power from every State in the country, not just Vermont, \nnot just my home State of Oregon but every State. We are going to take \nit away from any subdivision of those States. We are going to black out \nthat information so consumers can't have it.\n  Here is the question we face: Are we going to hold a vote this week \nin this Chamber, as scheduled by the majority leader for Wednesday, to \nshut down debate on this topic? The majority leader didn't allow debate \ntoday because he just introduced the bill tonight and he just set the \nschedule for tomorrow. We are not going to have the debate until 2:15 \np.m. tomorrow, and he said we are going to vote on Wednesday morning on \nthis critical issue affecting citizens' right to know. So on behalf of \nMonsanto and friends, he wants to make sure there are only a few hours \nof debate and that the citizens of our country don't even know this \ndirty deed is being done in this Chamber. That is why I am speaking \nright now, because it is important for the citizens to know this is \nbeing rammed through right now at a time when it is most likely not \ngoing to gain public attention.\n  Why is that? Why did the majority leader do this on a Monday night \nright before the five big primaries that occur tomorrow? Because the \nnews media is very busy covering those five big primaries. Who is going \nto win the Republican primary in Florida that will affect, one way or \nanother, whether a Member in this Chamber stays in the race? Who will \nwin the Republican primary in Ohio? That is possibly going to affect \nwhether the frontrunner gets a majority by the time the convention \ncomes up. Who is going to win the Democratic primary in Illinois? Who \nis going to win the Democratic primary in Ohio? That will have a big \nimpact on the rhythm of that. So the media is very consumed and very \nbusy, and that is why here, on the eve of this major Tuesday primary, \nthis bill has been put on the floor. Americans have no idea it is \nhappening. They can ram this thing through with no notice to the \nAmerican people because, again, this bill was never considered in \ncommittee. This is a whole new creature--this Monsanto DARK Act 2.0.\n  What specifically does it do and how has it morphed? Well, this is \nvery interesting. This act says States are banned from providing \ninformation that 9 out of 10 of their citizens want. It says \nsubdivisions are banned from providing information that 9 out of 10 of \ntheir citizens want, and then it says there will be a voluntary \nprogram, and if, after a series of years, citizens can get information \nbased on consumer inquiries, then this ban will continue forever. If \nthey can't get the information on 70 percent of the major foods that \nare being sold, then all that is required is a response to consumer \ninquiries. In other words, no labeling requirement, no simple fashion \nfor a consumer to find out what is in their food. If we put a ban on \nStates from providing easy-to-use consumer information about GM or GE \ningredients, then there must be a national consumer easy-to-use \nindication on the label.\n  The argument is put forward--and I share it--that 50 different State \nstandards would be confusing and expensive and almost impossible to \nimplement. One warehouse serves multiple States and so on and so forth. \nHaving a different label in every State makes no sense. OK. I take that \npoint. But if we are going to ban the States from providing the \ninformation consumers want on the argument that there should be one \nnational standard for simplicity, then there must be a consumer-\nfriendly national standard, and there is no such standard in this \nMonsanto DARK Act 2.0 placed on the floor tonight.\n  There is an interesting twist here because they have proposed some \nideas that are different from putting consumer-friendly information on \nthe label. The first of those ideas is a 1-800 number. It works like \nthis. Let's say, like my daughter, you are interested in high fructose \ncorn syrup.\n  I am going to use this book here as a visual aid, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Imagine these are products that are in the grocery store. So I, the \nconsumer, am going down the aisle, and I say: I want to know whether \nthese contain high fructose corn syrup. Well, I turn it over and look \nat the ingredients, and I see that one does. Looking at this one: No, \nthis one doesn't. Let me check the third. It is right here. I have the \nanswer. I have checked three products in 5 seconds. That is consumer \nfriendly. But let's say we have to call the 1-800 number to find out.\n  I ask unanimous consent to use my cell phone as a visual aid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So now I have to pull my cell phone out of my pocket, \nand I have to find this number that is probably too small for me to \nread. I have to turn on my phone and hope there is a cell connection in \nthe store, which there may or may not be. I dial it up. Oh, I am \ntalking to somebody in the Philippines, and they have no idea what I am \nasking about. Oh, I am talking to some call center somewhere else, and \nthey have all kinds of information, but they are not sure exactly what \nmy question is about GE ingredients. And maybe I have to wait 15 \nminutes while I am on hold. We have all had that experience. Every one \nof us has had the experience of not just waiting 15 minutes; we call a \nconsumer help line or maybe a 1-800 number and maybe it is half an \nhour. They give you a little message: We are sorry, we have a high call \nvolume and we just can't get to you yet, but we will get back to you in \nmaybe 30 or 40 minutes. I am standing here in the aisle. I want to \ncompare these three products. I have to call three different 800 \nnumbers. I ask, can anyone on this floor stand up and say this is a \nconsumer-friendly way to answer the fundamental question as to whether \nthere is a GE or GM--genetically engineered or genetically modified--\ningredient? No. This is absurd. This is a sham. That is why it is sham \nNo. 1.\n  But there is not just one sham in this bill; there are more. The \nsecond sham is a computer code. So picture this: Instead of being able \nto pick up a product and say ``I want to see if this has peanuts in it; \nI am allergic to peanuts,'' I can check my second product. Oh, here it \nis. I check the third product. No, no peanuts. I am allergic to \npeanuts. In 5 seconds, I have checked three products. That is consumer \nfriendly.\n  But now this second sham is that I have to have a smartphone with me. \nI have to take a picture of this code called a quick response code, and \nthat will take me to a Web site, and maybe I will find out the \ninformation in the format presented by the company itself, which will \nprobably be completely incomprehensible and indigestible. All I wanted \nto know was whether there is a GM ingredient. But now I have to take a \npicture. I have to go to a Web site. I have to negotiate the \ninformation on the Web site. All I needed was a little symbol right \nhere. It doesn't matter what the symbol is. It could be ``GM.'' It \ncould be ``GE.'' It could be a ``t'' for transgenic. That is what \nBrazil uses. It could be a happy face. Just anything so that consumers \nknew what that symbol stood for. That would allow them to check it very \nquickly and very easily.\n  A QR code is even more diabolical because when you use your phone to \ntake a picture of this and go to that Web site, they track some of your \ninformation. You have to give up your privacy. I have to give up my \nprivacy to find out if there is a GE ingredient in the food I am \neating? No. No way. No how. Just wrong. An invasion, an overreach of \nthe Federal Government asking me to give up my privacy by having to \ntake a picture of this.\n  Envision now whether this is really practical in any way. Not only \nmight it take half an hour to go through those three different QR codes \nand find out what they really mean, but I am shopping for groceries. \nThis is just one item I want to buy. I want to buy a can of soup. That \nis what I want to do. But I have 20 more things on my list. I go to the \nsecond thing. Maybe I want to buy hot dogs, and now there are 10 \ndifferent versions of hot dogs. What am I going to do--take a picture \nof all 10 hot dogs for my second item on the list?\n  Now I am 2 hours into my shopping trip. I have a child in the grocery \ncart who is hungry and who is tired and who wants to go home. I want to \ngo home. I want to get home and cook dinner for myself and my family. I \nhave to spend 2 hours to check out two products on my grocery shopping \nlist. This is a complete sham.\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\n  There is even more to come. This is sham No. 3 that is in the \nMonsanto Protection Act, Monsanto DARK Act--Denying Americans the Right \nto Know--2.0. Here is a wonderful idea. This says a company can provide \ninformation via social media, as in Facebook or Twitter or who knows \nwhat--Instagram. So here I am now. Picture this. This really takes the \ncake. I am in the store. I care about GE ingredients, and I check \nproduct No. 1 for their 800 number, but they don't have an 800 number, \nor they have it but it is not for this purpose because this company has \ndone their voluntary disclosure not through the 800 number. So I think, \nwell, am I supposed to take a picture of the smart code? I look for it. \nMaybe I find one. I take a picture, I go to the Web site, but no \ninformation is there because this company has decided to do voluntary \ndisclosure through social media. Well, which social media? I am \nsupposed to know if they are putting it up on Facebook or if they are \nsupposed to be putting it on Instagram or on Twitter? No, because they \ncan put it anywhere they want.\n\n  So here we have a completely unworkable system in every possible way. \nIn other words, all three of these ideas were put into this bill solely \nfor the pretense that there is some form of disclosure to consumers.\n  Now, why would the author of this bill that was put on the floor \ntonight go to this tremendous effort to have this pretense about \ndisclosure? Well, let's go back to where I started. The reason for the \npretense is that 9 out of 10 Americans want to know. So this is a scam \non the American people.\n  Right now, citizens in our country are very angry. They are very \nupset. We have gone through four decades in which the middle class has \nbeen squeezed, and they know they are getting the short end of the \nstick. They know that our national wealth has grown enormously but \nnothing is shared with the middle class. They know the system is \nrigged. And here comes our majority leader to put a bill on the floor \nthat further rigs the system with this Monsanto DARK Act edition 2.0.\n  So citizens across the country, this is being done to take away your \nrights when you are not paying attention because we are in the middle \nof a major primary tomorrow. So if you are aware of this Monsanto DARK \nAct 2.0 being on the floor right now and that there is going to be a \nvote on it on Wednesday morning, then weigh in and say it is not all \nright. Share with other Americans on your social media and say that \nthis sham disclosure bill is not OK, that taking away the desire and \nright of 9 out of 10 Americans to want to know if there is GE \ningredients in their food--taking away that right is a complete \ntravesty.\n  This is the type of overreach that makes citizens mad. This is the \ntype of jam-through legislation on behalf of a powerful special \ninterest to take away what citizens care about that makes people mad. \nMy colleagues across the aisle know that, so they want to jam this \nthrough in the dark of night when the country is not paying attention. \nThat is simply not OK. It is not OK.\n  Some may say: What is the big deal here? Aren't genetically \nengineered products all wonderful, and why would any citizen actually \nbe concerned about them? Why do these 9 out of 10 citizens have this \ndesire? They are just misled. There is no concern about GE ingredients. \nWe are just taking away their right because they don't know what they \nare talking about. Their concerns are not legitimate.\n  Well, I will tell my colleagues tonight that their concerns are \nlegitimate. Genetic engineering can produce a benefit and it can \nproduce problems, and therefore it is the citizens' right to be able to \nmake the evaluation of how they want to spend their dollar, just as it \nis their right if they want to buy reconstituted juice versus fresh \njuice, just as it is their right if they want to buy wild fish rather \nthan farmed fish, just as it is their right if they don't want to buy \nfood with high fructose corn syrup, or maybe they do want to buy it, \nbut they get to choose. They get to look at the ingredients and the \nlabeling and they get to choose.\n  Let me expand a little bit on this because science has provided us \nwith both an accounting of some of the benefits and an accounting of \nsome of the problems. Science indicates that there is some truth in \nboth. For example, let's take one of the benefits. This is a picture of \ngolden rice. Well, what is golden rice? In parts of the world, citizens \nsuffer from a big deficiency of vitamin A. Therefore, this rice has \nbeen genetically engineered to have vitamin A in it, and it can, in \nparts of the world where rice is routinely eaten, help address that. \nFolks have said that is a good thing. Now, I don't know all the \nreverberations of cultivating this type of rice versus another type of \nrice. There might be a problem hidden away in those different \ncultivation techniques. But by and large, I have heard positive things \nabout golden rice helping address a vitamin deficiency.\n  Let's take transgenic carrots. Their cells have been cultivated in \norder to provide a substance that provides a cure to Gaucher's disease. \nSo that seems like a benefit because people who suffer from Gaucher's \ndisease are awfully happy about having a remedy.\n  Let's take yams grown in South Africa. Well, they have several \ndifferent viruses that affect these yams, and so by genetically \nengineering to resist these viruses, as far as I am aware, we don't \nknow yet of any side effects that are a problem. As of now, this can be \nsomething that is generally registered as a benefit, to have that \nresistance to these viruses. There is even discussion of genetic \nmodifications that can be done that serve in lieu of immunizations. \nThat is a very interesting scientific idea. That could be a way to \nprovide resistance to humans with certain diseases.\n\n  That is only part of the story. Just as science has documented that \nthere are benefits, there are also some concerns. Here in the United \nStates, the major genetic modification is something called Roundup \nReady. It makes a particular plant immune to the effects of an \nherbicide. Herbicides kill the plants, so this makes the plant immune \nto the substance that kills plants. Therefore, you can use this \nherbicide to control weeds without killing the corn or without killing \nsugar beets or without killing the cotton, and so forth.\n  (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.)\n  So what have we seen? Since this genetically engineered quality was \ndeveloped, we have seen a massive increase in the use of herbicides on \ncrops. It has gone from 7.4 million pounds back in 1994 to now over 160 \nmillion pounds. We see this massive increase and its continued path to \n2012. One of the effects is that if you have this massive 160 million \npounds of herbicide on fields that weren't there 20 years earlier, what \nyou have is a lot of runoff of herbicide into our streams and into our \nrivers. When you put plant-killing stuff in our streams and rivers, it \nhas an impact on the ecosystem. That is a scientifically documented \nlegitimate concern.\n  There is another concern. When we tilled fields to take down the \nweeds, it was mechanical, and in that disturbed soil grew a variety of \nthings and the edges of fields grew a variety of things. One example is \nmilkweed. It has been scientifically documented that there is a big \nreduction in these miscellaneous weeds and some of the related insects \nand species that otherwise would have inhabited that area near these \nfields. One example is the monarch butterfly. The monarch butterfly has \ncrashed in the Midwest because of the dramatic reduction in milkweed \nwith a change from mechanical tilling to herbicide control of weeds. \nThat is just the canary in the coal mine--or the monarch in the coal \nmine. We don't know what else is being affected by this massive \napplication of herbicides.\n  Here is another challenge. This is an interesting genetic \nmodification. This is called Bt corn. Bt corn has been genetically \nmodified so it produces a pesticide inside each corn cell, and \nparticularly the goal is that when the larvae of these beetles start \neating, the pesticide would kill the larvae of these beetles. These \nlarvae are referred to as the ``western corn worm.''\n  The western corn worm does a lot of damage, and you put the pesticide \ninside the cells. Both the larvae and the beetles themselves like to \neat the corn. They like to eat the strands of pollen that pollinate the \ncorn. What can end up is corn that has only a few kernels on them. \nThere is a greatly reduced amount of kernels as a result of the pollen \nbeing compromised. What is happening as a result of the prevalence of \nthis Bt corn which is grown all over the United States? What is \nhappening\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\nis that these larvae of the corn worms and beetles are developing a \nresistance to it because Mother Nature has a few surprises. At any one \nmoment in a large population, there are thousands or millions of \naccidental mutations occurring. Out of those mutations, when millions \nand millions of these beetles and their larvae are exposed, eventually \na few of them have a mutation that makes them immune to the pesticide. \nThen they proceed to have offspring, and then the offspring have more \nmutations and become more resistant. Suddenly, you now have to go back \nand put pesticides in these fields, even though there is a pesticide \nproduced in each cell of the corn itself. That type of biofeedback is \nscientifically documented. That is a concern.\n  There is an impact on creating what is sometimes called superweeds \nthrough herbicides and superbugs that are pesticide-resistant through \nthe massive application of Bt GE engineering.\n  This chart is just a reference to the problem in the waterways that I \nhave already spoken to, so I don't think I need to repeat that.\n  If there are advantages or benefits and there are scientifically \ndocumented problems, shouldn't it be up to the consumer to decide if \nthey want to buy a product with genetically engineered ingredients? \nThey are not stupid. They are not crazy. They have not invented some \nconcerns. There are legitimate, scientifically documented benefits and \nlegitimate scientifically documented concerns. So it should be up to \nthe consumer.\n  We tell consumers: Hey, you have thoughts about whether you would \nrather have wild fish or farm-raised fish, for example. Why do we \nrequire that? I will give you an example from the Pacific Northwest. In \nthe Pacific Northwest a lot of salmon are raised in ocean pens. Those \nare farmed fish. They are very close together, and because they are \nvery close together, they develop more diseases. There is a type of sea \nlice that becomes prevalent. Also, because they are not eating the same \nstuff wild fish eat, their meat is white, so they have to be fed a dye \nto make their meat the same color as wild salmon. There are folks who \nhear that and say: I have a preference. I would rather have farmed fish \nbecause they are cheaper, or I would rather have wild fish because I \ndon't like the way farmed fish is raised. Maybe one likes the idea of \nsupporting the wild fishing industry rather than the farm fishing \nindustry. That is why we require the disclosure. So it should be a \ncitizen's right to know.\n  Right now here is where we are with this issue being jammed through \nin the middle of the night on behalf of a very powerful special \ninterest, even though 9 out of 10 Americans don't agree.\n  Well, let's ask the Presidential candidates where they stand--each \nand every candidate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders from the \nDemocratic side, Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Kasich on the \nRepublican side: Where do you stand on this issue that is going to be \nvoted on Wednesday morning in this Chamber? Do you stand with the 9 out \nof 10 Americans who want the right to know whether there are GE \ningredients in their food? Do you stand with the people, or do you \nstand with the powerful special interests that want American citizens \nto be kept in the dark? This is very relevant. Folks voting tomorrow in \nfive primaries, in Florida, Illinois--whatever the other three are \ntomorrow--they want to know where the Presidential candidates stand. \nAre they going to be the type of leader who stands with the people, or \nare they going to be the type that wants to approve and say it is OK to \nslam this Deny Americans the Right to Know Act 2.0--this Monsanto act. \nIt is all right to slam it through with no committee consideration in \nthe dark of night when the country is not paying attention because of \nthe big set of primaries tomorrow. I want to know where they stand.\n  So I say to these candidates on the Republican side and the \nDemocratic side: Call us up. Tell us where you stand. Call my office: \n202-224-3753. I will let the rest of the Senate know where you stand. \nWe will make sure everyone knows whether you, the Presidential \ncandidates, stand with the citizens of America and the right to know or \nwhether you stand with the powerful special interests that want to \nstrip States' rights to inform their citizens about information that \nthey want.\n  I want to know from the Presidential candidates: Do you believe that \nthe Federal Government should strip States of the ability to label, \neven if their labels are all consistent with each other? Do you think \nthat is OK? Do you care about States' rights? Do you see States as a \nlaboratory where we can experiment with ideas and see if they work or \nnot?\n  Right now Vermont is a laboratory. On July 1 they are going to have \ntheir first labeling law in the country, and that is an experiment that \ntheir citizens wanted, consistent with 9 out of 10 Americans who want \nto know. They responded; Vermont responded. They are the first State in \nthe Union to do so. Are we going to cut that short? We are going to \ntrash that ability of Vermont to conduct this experiment? We are going \nto stomp on the citizens' rights to know, not just in Vermont but in \nOregon, Montana, Florida, and all 50 States, and throw in a few U.S. \nterritories as well?\n  Now the argument is made that this is very dangerous because there \ncould be multiple States that produce different standards. But that \ndoesn't exist. There will not be multiple States in July. There is only \none State that has a bill. So it is a phony argument to say that this \nis somehow causing big, expensive problems because there are \nconflicting State standards, because there are no conflicting State \nstandards. It is just one great State that responded to its citizens' \ndesires. Who are we to stop that experiment now? We should endorse that \nexperiment. We should endorse that State laboratory. We should watch to \nsee how well it works. We know citizens want this and that they care a \nlot. So why take it away just because Monsanto and friends don't want \nAmericans to know?\n  How many Members here want to go home to their citizens and say: You \nknow what, I represent all of us here in our State of Iowa or our State \nof Florida or our State of Montana or our State of Oregon--my home \nState--and it is OK with me if the Federal Government takes away your \nrights on something you really care about. That is what this Chamber is \npoised to do. That is why they are doing it in the dark of night, \nbecause the Senators who are here who are prepared to vote for the \nMonsanto DARK Act 2.0 don't want their citizens to know about it. That \nis why they have encouraged the strategy of putting it on the Senate \nfloor on Monday night right before the big Tuesday primary, because \ncitizens care a lot about knowing what they put in their mouth, and \nthey care a lot about what they feed to their children. It is not \nsimply whether it will make them sick. They care about the implications \nabout the way different food is raised.\n  When we talk about the difference between farmed fish and wild fish, \nit doesn't have anything to do with what is going to poison you. It \nisn't even necessarily the taste. The taste may be similar. It is about \nthe citizens' concerns about the way the harvesting is done, about the \nway the crop is grown, the produce is grown. When we talk about the \ndifference between constituted juice and we require disclosure, the \ndifference between fresh juice and concentrated juice, it isn't because \nit is going to poison us when we put in our bodies, it is because \ncitizens care about the process that got them to the product they are \nabout to buy. They care about this, too.\n  They care about it--Democrats, 92 percent; Republicans, 84 percent; \nIndependents, 89 percent. In this deeply divided country, when 9 out of \n10 folks--Independents, Democrats, or Republicans--all say it is \nimportant, shouldn't we honor that? Shouldn't we not trounce on their \nrights? Shouldn't we not suppress the first State pilot project on \nsomething that 9 out of 10 citizens across the spectrum agree on? Yet \nthat is the dirty deed this Chamber is planning for Wednesday morning. \nIt is just wrong.\n\n  I am deeply disturbed about what has become of our ``we the people'' \nNation. What are those beautiful first three words of our Constitution? \nIf you ask that in any townhall in America, the crowd at the townhall \nwill respond: ``We the People.'' Those words are carved in our hearts \nbecause the core principle on which this Nation was\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\nfounded is that we would establish a republic where the decisions would \nbe of, by, and for the people. But this vote on Wednesday morning is \nnot of, by, and for the people; it is of, by, and for Monsanto and \nfriends because they want to take away what we the people care about--\nthe right to know whether there are GE ingredients in their food.\n  Each of us came to Congress and we pledged to uphold our \nresponsibilities under the Constitution. I would have to assume that \neach and every one of the 100 Senators on this floor had actually read \nthe Constitution. I certainly hope every Senator on this floor knows it \nstarts out ``We the People,'' and I hope they understand why.\n  After President Jefferson was out of office, he talked about the \nmother principle of our Republic, and that is that the decisions will \nserve the people. He talked about how for that to happen for each \ncitizen, there has to be an equal voice.\n  You can imagine the vision of the town square and that there is no \ncharge for standing in the town square and expressing your opinion. It \nis free. But every citizen gets to stand and have their say with an \nequal voice before a vote is taken. That is the equal voice President \nJefferson talked about. That is the equal voice concept President \nLincoln talked about, that understanding that each citizen would have a \nproportionate equal voice. That was embedded in our Founders' minds. \nThey hadn't yet envisioned a world in which the town square is now for \nsale. The town square is now for sale. The town square is television, \nradio. You have to buy ads on it, and it is expensive. So you have to \npay to stand and make your point. And those with the most money get to \nstand up for a longer period of time than those with little money. \nThose with the most money get to purchase the equivalent of a stadium \nsound system to drown out the voice of ordinary people.\n  Here is what I want to know: On Wednesday morning, is this Chamber \ngoing to respond to those with those stadium sound systems and proceed \nto drown out the voice of the people?\n  Let's put up that 89 percent chart.\n  This is the choice of the people--Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents who care about this. Wednesday morning, are we going to \ndrown out their desires on behalf of the powerful special interests? \nAre we going to stamp out States' rights on behalf of a powerful \nspecial interest?\n  Let's not do that. Let's not go in that shameful direction, that \ndirection which is completely contrary to the principles that founded \nthis Nation of an equal voice, a nation, as Lincoln said, that operates \nof, by, and for the people.\n  If we want to have this debate over conflicting State labels, then \nfine. Let's create a common standard. Let's create one common standard \nfor the entire country, a little symbol on the ingredients. That is all \nit would take. It could be any symbol, and the FDA could choose it so \nthere is nothing pejorative about it. It is not taking up space on the \npackage. It is not taking up space on the cover. It is not pejorative. \nIt is not demeaning. It doesn't imply there is anything wrong. It just \nsays this is something citizens want to know, just as they want to know \nfarm versus wild for fish; just as they want to know concentrate versus \nnonconcentrate for juice; just as they want to know what minerals, \nvitamins, and ingredients are in the food they are buying. This they \nwant to know. So honor that. Let's not tear down that vision laid out \nin the first three words of our Constitution and replace ``We the \nPeople'' with ``We the Titans.''\n  If you want to be a Senator in a republic that starts out with a \nConstitution that says ``We the Titans,'' then please go be a Senator \nin a different nation. Go to work somewhere else but not here in the \nUnited States of America where we have a responsibility to the citizens \nand the citizens are clear on where they stand.\n  So if we must vote on Wednesday--and there is no need to. We are only \nvoting on Wednesday because within seconds of this bill being \nintroduced tonight, the majority leader also put forward a petition \nthat forces a vote on closing debate on Wednesday morning. No. So \nbefore anyone has had a word to say, a petition has already been filed \nto close debate. What kind of a democratic process is that? So the only \ntime to speak to this is tomorrow when the whole world is paying \nattention to the primaries in five different States--and tonight. That \nis why I am speaking tonight.\n  So I am hoping a few people are tuned in enough to activate their \nnetworks and to say: This is wrong, Mr. Majority Leader. Pull that bill \nfrom this floor. That is a terrible assault on deliberative democracy. \nSend it to a committee and actually have a debate on it so people can \nanalyze it. Give people in that committee the opportunity to do \namendments. Give citizens across the Nation the chance to find out this \nis going on. Honor the people of this Nation and their right to know.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/14/senate-section/article/S1473-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
